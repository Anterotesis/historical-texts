         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LIFE
OF
CHARLES I.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HARLES I. King of Great <hi>Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
was the Son of <hi>James</hi> VI. King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife
a Daughter of <hi>Denmark.</hi> By His Father deſcended to Him
all the Rights (together with their blood) of all our Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
both <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings to this Empire. For
the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter and ſole Heir of <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> the
laſt ſurviving Prince of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> being married to
<hi>Malcolme Conmor</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> conveyed to his Line the
<hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. married to
<hi>James</hi> IV. did bring the <hi>Norman</hi> titles and blood. From
this Imperial Extract He received not more Honour than He gave to it. For the blood
that was derived to Him elaborated through ſo many Royal Veins, He delivered to
Poſterity more maturated for Glory and by a conſtant practice of Goodneſs more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated
for Vertue.</p>
                  <p>He was born at <hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> one of the principal Towns of <hi>Fife</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> on
<hi>Nov.</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1600.<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1600</label> in ſo much weakneſs, that his Baptiſm was haſtened without
the uſual Ceremonies wherewith ſuch Royal Infants are admitted into the Church.
Providence ſeeming to conſecrate Him to Sufferings from the Womb, and to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
Him to the exchange of the ſtrictures of Greatneſs for clouds of Tears.</p>
                  <p>There was no Obſervation nor Augury made at His Birth concerning the Sequel of
His Life or courſe of Fortune (which are uſually related of ſuch whoſe lives have
different occurrences from thoſe in others of the ſame ſtate.) Either the fear of His
Death made thoſe about Him leſs obſervant of any Circumſtances which curious minds
would have formed into a Prediction, He appearing like a Star that riſes ſo near the
Point of his Setting, that it was thought there would be no time for Calculation. Or
He being at diſtance by his Birth from the Succeſſion to the Crown (Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
then having the firſt hopes) made men leſs ſollicitous to enquire of His future ſtate,
on whom, being born to a private Condition, the Fate of the Kingdom did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
                  <p>But in the third Year of His age, when King <hi>James</hi> was preparing himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, a certain Laird of the <hi>Highlands,</hi> though of very great
age, came to the Court to take his leave of him, whom he found accompanied with
all his Children. After his addreſs full of affectionate and ſage Advice (to which
his gray hairs gave authority) to the King; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1602</label> his next application was to Duke CHARLES
(for in the Second year of his Age he was created Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Ardmanock</hi>) whoſe hands he kiſs'd with ſo great
an ardency of affection that he ſeem'd forgetful of a ſeparation. The King, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his ſuppoſed miſtake, adviſed him to a more preſent obſervance of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi>
as the Heir of his Crown, of whom he had taken little notice. The old Laird an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
that he knew well enough what he did, and that <hi>It was this Child</hi> (who was
then in His Nurſes arms) <hi>who ſhould convey his name and memory to the ſucceeding ages.</hi>
This then was conceived dotage; but the event gave it the credit of a Prophecy, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60710:7"/>
confirmed that Opinion, <hi>That ſome long-experienced ſouls in the World, before their diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
arrive to the height of prophetick Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was three years old He was committed to the Care and Governance of
Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi>'s Lady,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1603</label> as a reward for being the firſt Meſſenger of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
death, whoſe long life had worn the expectation of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nobility into a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
<hi>that the Lords of</hi> England <hi>would never acknowledge her to be dead as long as there was
any old Woman of that Nation that could wear good cloaths, and perſonate the Majeſty of a
Queen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth Year,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1604</label> after he had wreſtled with a Feaver, He was brought in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where on the <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. following, having the day
before been made <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Bath,</hi> He was inveſted with the Title of <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>York;</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1606</label> and in the ſixth Year was committed to the <hi>Pedagogie</hi> of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas Murray,</hi> a
Perſon well qualified to that Office, though a favourer of Presbytery.</p>
                  <p>Under this Tutor, and confined to a retiredneſs by the preſent weakneſs of
his Body, He was ſo diligent and ſtudious, that He far advanced in all that kind
of Learning which is neceſſary for a Prince, <hi>without which even their natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
ſeem rough and unpleaſant in deſpight of the ſplendour of their Fortune.</hi> His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in Letters was ſo eminent, that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> taking notice of it, to put a
Jeſt upon Him, one day put the Cap of the Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> (who was then, with
the Prince and the Duke and other of the Nobility, waiting in the Privy Chamber
for the King's coming out) on his Brother's head; adding, That <hi>if He continued a
good Boy, and followed His Book, he would make him one Day Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury
Which the Child took in ſuch diſdain, that He threw the Cap on the Ground, and
trampled it under His Feet with ſo much eagerneſs, that he could hardly be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Which Paſſion was afterward taken by ſome over-curious as a preſage of the
ruine of Epiſcopacy by His Power. But the event ſhewed it was not ominous to the
Order, but to the Perſon of the Archbiſhop, whom in his Reign he ſuſpended from
the Adminiſtration of his Office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1611</label> In his eleventh Year he was made Knight of the Garter:<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1612</label> and in the twelfth Prince
<hi>Henry</hi> dying <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6. He ſucceeded him in the Dukedome of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities
thereof; and attended his Funeral as Chief Mourner, on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>On the 14<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h of <hi>Feb.</hi> following He performed the Office of Brideman to the Princeſs
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Siſter, who on that Day was Married to <hi>Frederick</hi> V. Prince <hi>Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi>
the Gayeties of which Day were afterwards attended with many fatal Cares and
Expences.</p>
                  <p>His Childhood was blemiſhed with a ſuppoſed Obſtinacy: for the weakneſs of his
Body inclining him to retirements, and the imperfection of His Speech rendring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
tedious and unpleaſant, He was ſuſpected to be ſomewhat perverſe. But more
age and ſtrength fitting Him for Manlike Exerciſes, and the Publick Hopes inviting
Him from his Privacies, He delivered the World of ſuch Fears: for applying Himſelf
to Action, he grew ſo perfect in Vaulting, riding the great Horſe, running at the
Ring, ſhooting in Croſs-bows, Muskets, and ſometimes in great Pieces of Ordnance, that
if Principality had been to be the Reward of Excellency in thoſe Arts, He would have
had a Title to the Crown this way alſo; being thought the beſt Marks-man and moſt
graceful Manager of the great Horſe in the three Kingdoms. His tenacious humour
He left with his Retirements, none being more deſirous of good Counſel, nor any
more Obſequious when he found it; yea, too diſtruſtful of his own Judgment, which
the iſſue of things proved always beſt when it was followed.</p>
                  <p>When he was ſixteen Years old,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1616</label> on <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. He was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl
of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> the Revenues thereof being aſſigned to maintain his Court which
was then formed for Him. And being thus advanced in Years and State, it was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that He ſhould no longer retain the Modeſty which the Shades of his Privacy had
accuſtomed Him unto, but now appear as the immediate Inſtrument of Empire, and
that by Him the Favours and Honours of the Court ſhould be derived to others. But
though Providence had changed all about, yet it had changed nothing within Him;
and He thought it Glory enough to be great without the diminution of others; for
He ſtill permitted the Miniſtry of State to His Father's Favourites: which gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Diſcourſe to the <hi>Speculativi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">Some thought He did it to avoid the Jealouſies of the Old King (which were
conceived to have been ſomewhat raiſed by the popularity of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> whoſe
breaſt was full of forward Hopes.) For <hi>Young Princes are deemed of an impatient Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and Old ones to be too nice and tender of their Power; in which though they are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60710:7"/>
contented with a Succeſſor (as they muſt have) yet are afraid of a Partner.</hi> And it was
ſuppoſed, that therefore King <hi>James</hi> had raiſed <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> like Comets
to dim the luſtre of theſe riſing Stars.<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> &amp; the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </note>
 But theſe were miſtaken in the nature of that
King, who was enclined to contract a private friendſhip, and was prodigal to the
Objects of it before ever he had Sons to divert his Love, or raiſe his Fears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">Some that at a diſtance looked upon the Prince's actions, aſcribed them to a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs

the Methods of Commanding by the practice of Obedience; and that being of a
peaceful Soul, He affected not to embroil the Court (and from thence the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Factions, the effects of impotent minds) which He knew were dangerous
to a State, and deſtructive to that Prince who gives Birth unto them; that therefore
He choſe to wait for a certain, though delayed, Grandeur, rather then by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious

fall upon Servants, that His Son might aſcend the Throne free and unburthened with

the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was to Combate all the Artiſts of State in that

Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> though much converſant in the Intriegues of that Council, had been long
cajoled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60710:8"/>
To that Place he was to paſs <hi>Incognito,</hi> accompanied only with the Marqueſs of

to ſatisfy His Curioſity, and ſhew Himſelf to Love, He attempted and enjoyed a
view of the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> and there received the firſt Impreſſion of that Excellent
<hi>Princeſs</hi> who was by Heaven deſtined to His Chaſt Embraces. Satisfied with that
ſight, no leſſer enjoyments of any Pleaſure in that great Kingdom, nor Vanity of
Youth, which is hardly curbed when it is allyed to Power, could tempt His ſtay,
or a diſcovery of His Greatneſs; but with a ſpeed anſwerable to an active Body and
Mind, He out-ſtripped the <hi>French</hi> Poſts which were ſent to ſtop Him, although that
King had intelligence of His being within his Dominions immediately after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The certain news of His ſafe arrival at <hi>Madrid</hi> drew after Him from hence a Princely
Train, and raiſed the Cenſures of the World upon the <hi rend="margQuotes">King; As being too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of the Inhoſpitality of Princes to each other, who, when either Deſign,
Tempeſts or Neceſſity have driven their Rivals in Majeſty upon their Coaſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Caution, they let them not part without ſome Tribute to their Intereſt: and
a freſh Example of this was in the King's own Mother, who ſeeking Refuge in
<hi>England</hi> with her Siſter Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from a Storm at Home, did loſe both her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This none daring to mind the King of, his Jeſter</hi> Archee <hi>made him ſenſible, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

(<hi>ſaid the King</hi>) what wilt thou ſay when thou ſeeſt Him come back again? Mary, <hi>ſays the
Jeſter,</hi> I will take off the Fools Cap which I now put upon thy Head for ſending Him thither,
and put it on the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s for letting him return.</p>
                  <p>This ſo awakened the King's apprehenſion of the Prince's danger, that it drove
him into an exceeding Melancholy, from which he was never free till he was aſſured
of the Prince's return to his own Dominions, which was his Fleet in the Sea: and
that was not long after. For notwithſtanding the contraſts of his two prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
there, <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (which were ſufficient to amaze an ordinary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and diſturb the Counſels of ſo young a Beginner in the Myſteries of Empire,
and the Arts of Experienced Conclaves;) the impetuous attempts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
either for a change of His Religion, or a Toleration of theirs; the Spleen of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares,</hi>
whom <hi>Buckingham</hi> had exaſperated; He ſo dexterouſly managed the Treaty of
Marriage, that all the Articles and Circumſtances were ſolemnly ſworn to by both
Kings. By a civil Letter to the Pope (which His Enemies Malice afterwards took as
an occaſion of Slander) He procured a civil return, with the grant of a Diſpenſation;
baffled the hopes of their Clergy by his Conſtancy in his own Profeſſion, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
it from the odious aſperſions of their Prieſts, by cauſing our Liturgy to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue; and by His generous mien enthralled the <hi>Infanta,</hi> for
whom He had expoſed His Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Yet having an inſight into the practices of that Court, that they would not put
the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> into the conſideration of the Portion, but reſerve it
as a Super-foetation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Love, and as an opportunity for the <hi>Infanta</hi> to
reconcile the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits, who were heated by the late Wars into an hatred of the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that this was but to lengthen out the Treaty till they had wholly
brought the <hi>Palatinate</hi> under their Power; He conformed His mind to the reſolves
of His Father, who ſaid, <q>
                        <hi>He would never marry his Son with a Portion of His only
Siſter's Tears;</hi>
                     </q> and therefore inclined to a Rupture. But concealing His Purpoſe,
and diſſembling His Knowledge of their Deſigns, He conſulted His own Safety and
Return, which His Father's Letters commanded: which He ſo prudently acquired,
that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> parted from Him with all thoſe endearments with which
departing Friends ceremoniate their Farewells; having ſatisfied him by a Proxie left
with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to be delivered when the Diſpenſation was come. Which
as ſoon as He was ſafe on Shipboard, by a private Expreſs, He commanded him
to keep in his hands till further Order.</p>
                  <p>His return to <hi>England,</hi>

and his entrance into <hi>London</hi> was as a triumph for His Wiſdom, their Bonfires
lengthned out the day, and their Bells by unceſſant ringing forbad ſleep to thoſe
Eyes which were refreſhed with His ſight. Nor could the People by age or ſickneſs
be confined at home, but deſpiſing the preſcriptions of their Phyſicians, went to meet
Him as reſtored Health.</p>

When He had given the King an account of His Voyage, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels
not to reſtore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> was ſummoned, which was ſo zealous of
the Honour of the Prince, that both Houſes voted an Addreſs to his Majeſty, that he
would no longer treat, but begin a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and deſiring the Prince's media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(who was always ready to gratifie the Nation) therein to his Father, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
Him they would ſtand by Him with their Lives and Fortunes: but yet when
the War, with the Crown, deſcended unto Him, they ſhamefully deſerted Him in the
beginning of His Reign,</p>
                  <p>When neither a Wife nor Peace was any longer to be expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> both
were ſought for from <hi>France,</hi> by a Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> the youngeſt
Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. The Love of whom the Prince had received by the Eye,

Sunday <hi>March 27. An.</hi> 1625. and Prince CHARLES was immediately proclaimed at
the Court-Gate <hi>King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,</hi> and ſo throughout all the
three Kingdoms, with infinite Rejoycings. The people expecting all the benefits of
the happieſt Government under Him, whoſe private and youthful part of Life had
been ſo ſpent, that it had nothing in it to be excuſed, and where the eager Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for matter of Reproach met with no ſatisfaction. An argument of a ſolid Vertue,
that could hold out againſt all the <hi>Vices of Youth, that are rendred more impetuous by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and Plenty, which are continually reſident in great Courts.</hi> For had any Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
polluted His earlier Days, it had been publiſhed by thoſe who in ſcarcity of juſt
Accuſations did invent unimaginable Calumnies. Nor could it have been hid, for <hi>in
a great Fortune nothing is concealed, but Curioſity opens the Cloſets and Bed-chambers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Princes, and diſcovers their cloſeſt Retirements, expoſing all their Actions to Fame
and Cenſure.</hi> Nor did the King deceive their hopes, they being the happieſt People
under the Sun while he was undiſturbed in the adminiſtration of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>His firſt publick Act was the Celebrating His Father's Funeral, whereat He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was Chief Mourner, (contrary to the Practice of His Royal Predeceſſors, and not
conformable to the Ceremonies of State;) Either preferring Piety to an unnatural
Grandeur; or urged by ſome ſecret Decree of Providence, that in all the Ruines of
His Family He ſhould drink the greateſt Draught of Tears; or His Spirit preſaging
the Troubles of the Throne, He would hallow the Aſcent to it by a Pious Act of
Grief.</p>
                  <p>When He had pay'd that Debt to His Deceaſed Father, He next provided for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and therefore haſtened the coming over of His Deareſt Conſort, whom the
Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> had in His Name Eſpouſed at the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi>
and He receiving Her at <hi>Dover</hi> the next Day after Trinity-Sunday; at <hi>Canterbury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his Conjugal Embraces. A Lady of moſt excellent Endowments, who aſſumed
to Her ſelf nothing in His Good Fortune but the Joy; and in His Evil bore an equal
ſhare, for She reverenced Him, not His Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus having diſpatched the Affairs of His Family, He applies Himſelf to thoſe of
His Kingdoms, which too much Felicity had made unmanageable by a moderate
Government. And He ſeemed not ſo much to aſcend a Throne, as enter upon a
Theatre, to wreſtle with all the difficulties of a corrupted State; whoſe long Peace
had ſoftned almoſt all the Nobleſs into Court-pleaſures, and made the Commons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
by a great Plenty. The Rites and Diſcipline of Religion had been blotted out
by a long and uninterrupted Proſperity, and Factions crept from the Church into the
Senate, which were made uſe of by thoſe that endeavoured the alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the Reſolves of that Council were the Dictates of ſome heady Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
who fed the Vulgar with hopes of Novelty under the name of Liberty, ſo
that the King could not endure their Vices, nor they His Vertues, whence came all
the Obſtructions to His Deſigns for Glory and the Publick Good. The Treaſury had
been exhauſted to ſatiate the unquiet and greedy <hi>Scots:</hi> and the People were taught
not to ſupply it, unleſs they were bribed with the blood of ſome Miniſter of State,
or ſome more advantages for Licentiouſneſs. Each of theſe ſingle would have enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Care of an Ordinary Prudence to have weathered out; but when all theſe
conſpired with the Traiterous Projects of Men of unbounded and unlawful hopes,
they took from Him His Peace, and that which the World calls Happineſs, but yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60710:9"/>
they made Him Great, and affording Exerciſes for His moſt excellent Abilities ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Him Glorious.</p>
                  <p>The different ſtates of theſe Difficulties, when like Clouds they were gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and when they deſcended in ſhowres of Blood, divide the King's Reign into
two parts. The firſt could not be eſteemed days of Peace, but an Immunity from
Civil War. The other was when He was concluded by that Fatal Neceſſity, either
to part with His Dignity, and expoſe His Subjects to the Injuries of numerous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
or elſe to exceed the calmer temper of His peaceful Soul, and make uſe of
thoſe neceſſary Arms, whereby he might hope to divert, if poſſible, the Ruine of
Church and State which He ſaw in projection.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part He had no Wars at home but what was in the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which though their firſt Inſtitution deſigned for the production of juſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and aſſiſtances of Government, yet, through the juſt Indignation of Heaven, and
the practices of ſome unquiet and ſeditious Perſons, became the Wombs wherein were
firſt conceived and formed thoſe monſtrous Confuſions which deſtroyed their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
cauſed our Miſeries, and the <hi>King</hi>'s Afflictions.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Parliament began <hi>June</hi> 18. At the opening of which the <hi>King</hi> acquainted
them with the neceſſity of Supplies for the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which they importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had through His Mediation engaged His Father in, and made it as Hereditary to
Him as the Crown. His Eloquence gave powerful Reaſons for ſpeedy and large
ſumms of Money; did alſo audit to them the ſeveral disburſements relating both to
the Army and Navy, that He might remove all Jealouſies of miſimployment, and
give them notice how well He underſtood the Office He had newly entred upon,
and how to be a faithful Steward of the Publick Treaſure. But the Projectors of the
alteration of Government brought into Debate two Petitions, one for Religion, the
other for Grievances, formed in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, which delayed the Succours, and
increaſed the Neceſſities, which at laſt they anſwered but with two Subſidies, too
poor a ſtock to furniſh an Army with; yet was kindly accepted, in expectation of
more at the next Seſſion. For the Infection ſeiſing upon <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament was
adjourned till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when they were to meet at <hi>Oxford:</hi> and at that time He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſuch Acts as were preſented to Him.</p>
                  <p>At the next Seſſion he gave a complying and ſatisfactory anſwer to all their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and expected a Retribution in larger Subſidies towards the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War. But in
ſtead of theſe, there were high and furious Debates of Grievances, conſultations to
form and publiſh Remonſtrances, Accuſations of the <hi>Duke of Buckingham:</hi> Which the
King eſteeming as reproaches of His Government, and aſſaults upon Monarchy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
that Aſſembly, hoping to find one of a leſs cholerick complexion after His
Coronation.</p>
                  <p>This inauſpicious Meeting drew after it another Miſchief, the miſcarriage of the
Deſigns upon <hi>Spain.</hi> For the Supplies of Money being ſcanty and ſlow, the Fleet
could not go forth till <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. an unſeaſonable time in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; and their firſt
conteſt was with Winds and Tempeſts, which deſtroying ſome, ſcattered all the
Ships. When they met, a more dangerous Storm fell among the Souldiers and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
where ſmall Pay cauſed leſs Diſcipline, and a Contempt of their General, the
Lord <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> rendred the attempt upon <hi>Cades</hi> vain and fruitleſs. This was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a Contagion (to which ſome conceive diſcontented minds make the Bodies
of Men more obnoxious) in the Navy, which forced it home, more empty of Men,
and leſs of Reputation.</p>
                  <p>The Infection decreaſing at <hi>London,</hi> the King performed the Solemnities of His
Coronation <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. with ſome alterations from thoſe of His Predeceſſors: for in the
Civil He omitted the uſual Parade of riding from the <hi>Tower</hi> through the City to
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> to ſave the Expences that Pomp required, for more noble undertakings.
In the Spiritual there was reſtored a Clauſe in the Prayers which had been pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſince <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and was this; <hi>Let Him obtain favour for this People, like</hi>
Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the Waters,</hi> Zacharias <hi>in the Temple; give Him</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'<hi>s
Key of Diſcipline,</hi> Paul'<hi>s Doctrine.</hi> Which though more agreeing to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> which acknowledgeth the Power of Princes in their Churches,
and was therefore omitted in the times of Popery; yet was quarrelled at by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Party, (who take advantages of Calumny and Sedition from good as well as
bad circumſtances) and condemned as a new invention of Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and made uſe
of to defame both the <hi>King</hi> and him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60710:9"/>
After this He began a ſecond Parliament <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. wherein the Commons voted Him
four Subſidies, but the Demagogues intended them as the price of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s
Blood; whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Cook</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Turner</hi> with ſo much bitterneſs inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
as paſſing the modeſty of their former diſſimulation they taxed the <hi>King</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Sir <hi>Dudley Digges,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> and others carried up Articles againſt
him to the Lords Houſe, in which, to make the Faction more ſport, the Duke and
the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> did mutually impeach each other. By theſe contraſts the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were ſo highly heated, that the Faction thought it fit time to put a <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi>
in the Forge, which according to their manner was to be a publick Invective
againſt the Government. But the <hi>King</hi> having notice of it, diſſolves the Parliament
<hi>June 18. An.</hi> 1626. and the Bill for the Subſidies never paſſed.<label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>This miſunderſtanding at home produced another War abroad. For the King of
<hi>France</hi> taking advantage of theſe our Domeſtick embroilments begins a War upon us,
and ſeiſeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Ships in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> His pretence
was, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> had ſent back all the <hi>French</hi> Servants of the Queen, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies
had been intolerable. But the World ſaw the vanity of this pretext in the
Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf, who had in the like manner dimitted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Attendants
of his own Queen: and that truly the unhappy Counſels in Parliament had expoſed this
juſt Prince to Foreign Injuries. Which He Magnanimouſly endeavoured to revenge, and
to recover the Goods of His abuſed Subjects; and therefore ſent the Fleet deſigned
for Juſtice upon <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeek it firſt in <hi>France.</hi> But the want of Money made the
Preparations ſlow; and therefore the Navy putting out late in the Year was by
Storms forced to deſiſt the Enterprize. So that what was the effect only of the malice
of His Enemies, was imputed by ſome to a ſecret Decree of Heaven, which obſtructed
His juſt Undertakings for Glory.</p>
                  <p>The next Year the <hi>King,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1627</label> quickened by the Petitions of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who now
ſued for His Protection, as well as by the Juſtice of His own Cauſe, more early pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
His Counſels, and ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to attach the Iſle of <hi>Rhe;</hi>
which though alarmed to a greater ſtrength by the laſt Year's vain attempt, yet had
now ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, had not the Duke managed that War more
with the Gayeties of a Courtier than the Arts of a Soldier. And when it was wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to forſake thoſe Attempts which former neglects had made impoſſible, being too
greedy of Honour, and to avoid the imputation of fear in a ſafe retreat, he loaded
his overthrow with a new Ignominy, and an heavier loſs of Men, (the common fate
of thoſe <hi>Who ſeek for Glory in the parcels, loſe it in the groſs.</hi>) Which was contrary
to the temper of his Maſter, who was ſo tender of humane Blood, that therefore He
raiſed no Wars, but found them, and thought it <hi>an opprobrious Bargain to purchaſe the
fruitleſs Laurels, or the empty name of Honour, with the Lives of Men, but where the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

their Dangers, but was reſtrained by that neceſſitous condition the Faction had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Him under. To free Himſelf from which, that He might deliver the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
he doth pawn His own Lands for 120000 Pounds to the <hi>City,</hi> and borrows
30000 <hi>l.</hi> more of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company: but this was yet too narrow a Foundation
to ſupport the Charges of the Fleet, and no way ſo natural to get adequate ſupplies
as by a Parliament; which He therefore ſummons to meet <hi>March</hi> 17. intending to uſe
all Methods of Complacency to unite the Subjects Affections to Himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Which in the beginning proved ſucceſsful, for the modeſty of the Subjects ſtrove

their Petition of Right, the greateſt Condeſcenſion that ever any <hi>King</hi> made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
He ſeemed to ſubmit the Royal Scepter to the Popular <hi>Faſces,</hi> and to have given
Satisfaction even to Supererogation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe auſpicious beginnings, though full of Joy both to Prince and People, were
matter of Envy to the Faction: and therefore to form new Diſcontents and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
the Demagogues perſwaded the Houſes that the <hi>King</hi>'s Grant of their Petition
extended, (beyond their own hopes and the limits themſelves had ſet, and what He

by His perſonal Induſtry doing more to the neceſſary furniſhing of the Fleet in ten or
twelve Days then the Duke had done in ſo many Months before. But in the mean

                  <p>As Providence had removed the great Object of the Popular hate, and (as was

<hi>Buckingham;</hi> ſo the <hi>King</hi> Himſelf labours to remove all other occaſions of quarrel
before the next Seſſion. He reſtores Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who for his remiſsneſs

                     <hi>Mountague</hi>'s

Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> an active Leader of the Commons, was toward the beginning
of this Seſſion, as Sir <hi>John Savil</hi> had been at the end of the laſt, called up into the
Lord's Houſe, being made Viſcount <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> of the North.</p>
                  <p>But the Honours of theſe Perſons (whoſe Parts the <hi>King,</hi> who well underſtood
Men, thought worthy of His Favour and Employment) ſeeming the rewards of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and the ſpoils of deſtructive Counſels, the Demagogues were more eager in
the purſuit of that which theſe had attained unto, by the like arts. And therefore
deſpiſing all the <hi>King</hi>'s obliging Practices, in the next Seſſion they aſſumed a Power
of reforming Church and State, called the Cuſtomers into queſtion for Levying <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>
and <hi>Poundage,</hi> made now their Invectives, as they formerly did againſt the Duke,
againſt the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton;</hi> ſo that it appeared that not the Perſons of Men,
but the <hi>King</hi>'s truſt of them, was the object of their Envy, and His Favour, though
never ſo Vertuous, marked them out for Ruine. And upon theſe Points they raiſed
the Heat to ſuch a degree, that fearing they ſhould be diſſolved e're they had time to
vent their Paſſions, they began a Violence upon their own Body (an Example which
laſted longer then their Cauſe, and at laſt produced the overthrow of all their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.)
They lock'd the Doors of the Houſe, kept the Key thereof in one of
their own Pockets, held the Speaker by ſtrong Hand in the Chair, till they had thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
out their Votes like dreadful <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> againſt thoſe that ſhould levy, and,
which was more ranting, againſt ſuch as ſhould willingly pay the <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>
This Force the <hi>King</hi> went with His Guard of Penſioners to remove; which

                  <p>While the Winds of Sedition raged thus furiouſly at home, more gentle gales came
from abroad. The <hi>French</hi> King's Deſigns upon other Places required Peace from us, and
therefore the Signiory of <hi>Venice</hi> by her Ambaſſadors was moved to procure an Accord

being thus freed from His Domeſtick Embroilments and Foreign Enmities, ſoon made
the World ſee His Skill in the Arts of Empire, and rendred Himſelf abroad more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
then any of His Predeceſſors. And He was more glorious in the Eyes of the
good, and more ſatisfied in His own Breaſt, by confirming Peace with Prudence,
then if He had finiſhed Wars with deſtroying Arms. So that His Scepter was the
<hi>Caduceus</hi> to arbitrate the differences of the Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi> His Subjects likewiſe
taſted the ſweetneſs of a Reign which Heaven did indulge with all its favours, but
only that of valuing their Happineſs. While other Nations weltred in Blood, His
People enjoyed a Profound Peace, and that Plenty which the freedom of Commerce
brings along with it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> uſed <hi>London</hi> as the ſureſt Bank to
preſerve and increaſe their Trading. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bullion was here Coined, which
advantaged the <hi>King</hi>'s Mint, and encreaſed the Wealth of the Merchants, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

                  <p>While He diſpenſed theſe Bleſſings to the People,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1630</label> Heaven was liberal to Him in
giving Him a Son to inherit His Dominions, <hi>May 29. An.</hi> 1630. which was ſo great

in the Exultation, kindling another Fire more than Ordinary, making a <hi>Star</hi> to
be ſeen the ſame day at noon. (From which moſt men preſaged that that Prince
ſhould be of high Undertakings, and of no common glory among Kings: which hath
ſince been confirmed by the miraculous preſervation of Him, and Heaven ſeemed to
conduct Him to the Throne.) For this great Bleſſing the <hi>King</hi> gave publick Thanks
to the Author of it, Almighty God, at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church; and God was pleaſed in a

<hi>For neither Armies nor Navies are ſuch ſure props of Empire as Children are. Time, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
private Luſts, or Errors may take off, or change Friends: but thoſe that Nature hath

                  </p>
                  <p>Proſpering thus in Peace at home, a ſmall time aſſiſted His frugality to get ſuch a
Treaſure, and gave Him leaſure to form ſuch Counſels as might curb the Inſolence of
His Enemies abroad. He confederated with other Princes to give a check to the
<hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs, aſſiſting by his Treaſure, Arms and Counſel, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
to deliver the oppreſſed <hi>German</hi> States from the Imperial Oppreſſions. And when
<hi>Guſtavus</hi>'s Fortune made him Inſolent, and he would impoſe unequal Conditions upon
the <hi>Paltſgrave,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Brother-in-law, He neceſſitated him notwithſtanding his
Victories to more eaſie Articles.</p>
                  <p>The next year was notorious for two Tryals; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1631</label> one of the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> Earl of
<hi>Caſtlehaven,</hi> who being accuſed by all the abuſed parts of his Family of a prodigious
wickedneſs and unnatural uncleanneſs, was by the <hi>King</hi> ſubmitted to a Tryal by his
Peers, and by them being found guilty, was condemned, and his Nobility could be no
patronage for his Crimes; (but in the King's eyes they appeared more horrid, becauſe
they polluted that Order) and was afterwards executed.</p>
                  <p>The other was of a Tryal of Combate at a Marſhal's Court, betwixt <hi>Donnold</hi> Lord
<hi>Rey,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh High-lander,</hi> and <hi>David Ramſey,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Courtier. <hi rend="margQuotes">The firſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  </p>
                  <p>There were no Witneſſes, and the Defendant denying what the Appellant affirmed,
the Tryal was thought muſt be by Duel. In order to which the <hi>King</hi> grants a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

more heightned, yet the <hi>King</hi> hinders any further proceſs by Combat, which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether it be lawful; either thinking none ſo fooliſh as to ſtrive for Empire
which He found ſo full of Trouble; or knowing that <hi>Magiſtracy being the ſole Gift of
Heaven, it was vain to commit a Crime in hope of enjoying it, or in fear of loſing it:</hi> (which
was the Principle upon which Excellent Princes have neglected the diligent Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

ſecurity as it had never been ſince its firſt annexion to this Crown, and made it pay
for the Charges of its own Government, which before was deducted out of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Treaſury: their Peace and Laws now opening acceſſes for Plenty.</p>
                  <p>This enjoyment of Peace and Plenty through all the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions made Him
mindful of employing ſome fruits of it to the Honour of that God that cauſed it; and
not to let ſo great a Proſperity wholly corrupt the minds of men to a neglect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

equal with the Structure, which is ſuppoſed the goodlieſt in the Chriſtian World,
had not the Malice of His Enemies forced him to Arms, mingled His Mortar with the

Yet as He had been nobly treated all along His Journey by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, ſo
was He there magnificently received and crowned at <hi>Edinburgh June</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But the
King ſoon found all thoſe Careſſes falſe. For the Nobility and Laick Patrons could not
concoct His <hi>Revocation</hi> (though legal and innocent) of ſuch things as had been ſtoln
from the Crown during His Father's Minority, with a Commiſſion for <hi>Surrendry</hi>
of <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Tithes</hi> to be retaken from the <hi>King</hi> by the preſent Occupants
(who could as then pretend no other Title than the unjuſt uſurpation of their
Anceſtors) on ſuch conditions as might bring ſome Profit to the Crown, (to
which they juſtly belonged) ſome Augmentation of the Clergy, and far more eaſe
and benefit to the common People, whom by advantage of thoſe illegal Tenures they
oppreſſed with a moſt bitter Vaſſalage. This Act of His Majeſty being ſo full of
equity and publick good, thoſe whoſe greatneſs was builded upon Injuſtice did not
bare-facedly oppoſe it, but endeavoured to hinder that and all the other deſigns
of Peace and Order, by oppoſing in the Parliament next after the Coronation the
Act of <hi>Ratification</hi> of all thoſe Laws which King <hi>James</hi> had made in that Nation
for the better regulating the affairs of that Church, both as to the Government
and Worſhip of it.</p>
                  <p>This was highly oppoſed by ſuch as were ſenſible of their diminution by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
reſtitution of their unrighteous Poſſeſſions. And although the King carried it
by the major part of Voices; yet to prevent their own fires with the publick Ruine,
they did moſt aſſiduouſly ſlander it among the People as the abetting of <hi>Popery,</hi> and
the betraying their Spiritual Liberty to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke. Theſe Calumnies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
more credit by the King's Order for a more decent and reverend Worſhip of
God at His Royal Chappel at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> conformably to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Uſage.</p>
                  <p>Their noiſe grew lowder by the Concent of their party of <hi>Malecontents</hi> in
<hi>England;</hi> who alſo took advantage to diffuſe their poiſon from the King's Book
of Sports, which King JAMES had in his time publiſhed in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and was
now ratified by <hi>King</hi> CHARLES for a more univerſal Obſervance. The Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of which was the Apoſtaſie of many to <hi>Popery,</hi> (whoſe Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are more indulgent to the licentious) through the rigid Opinion of ſome Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who equall'd all Recreations on the Sabbath (as they call'd it) to the
moſt prodigious tranſgreſſions. On the contrary, ſome of the ignorant Teachers
had perverted many to down-right <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> by the conſequence of ſo ſtrict an
Obſervance of the Sabbath. And ſome over-buſie Juſtices of Peace had ſuppreſſed
all the ancient Feaſts of the <hi>Dedications</hi> of Churches. The <hi>King</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intended by this Edict to obſtruct the ſucceſs of the Enemies on both ſides,

of another; and whereas the Generality of men ſeldom do good but as neceſſitated by
Law, when Liberty is indulged all things are ſoon filled with Diſorder and Confuſion.</hi>
And ſo) it happened in this, that the Vulgar abuſing the <hi>King</hi>'s Liberty, (which
was no more than is granted in other Proteſtant Churches) and committing many
undecencies, made many well-temper'd Spirits too capable and credulous of thoſe

for Him to expect the Peoples Contribution to their own Safety, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>Privie Seals</hi> and <hi>Loans,</hi> the uſe of which He debarred Himſelf of in granting the

with <hi>Ancient Precedents of raiſing a Tax upon the Nation for ſetting forth a Navie
in caſe of danger,</hi> and aſſures Him of the Legality of the way in proceeding by
Writs to that effect. Which Counſel being embraced, there were Writs directed
to the ſeveral Counties for ſuch a Contribution that in the whole might build,
furniſh and maintain Forty Seven Ships for the ſafety of the Kingdom. And
by theſe the <hi>King</hi> ſoon ſecured and calmed the Seas; but the Faction endeavoured

                  <p>They complained of Invaſions on their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Liberties,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1635</label> becauſe the Biſhops

had done that to the Spiritual Body which it doth to the Natural, dayly amaſſed
thoſe Corruptions which at length will ſtand in need of cure. Therefore when they
took this proper Method of reforming a corrupted State in bringing things back to

                  </p>
                  <p>This Tax of Ship-money was pretended a breach to their Civil Liberties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

<hi>Prince</hi> declined not the Tryal, and permitted Monarchy and Liberty to plead at the

legal for the King to levy ſuch a Tax;</hi> and their Subſcriptions were enrolled in all
the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall. And when it came to be argued in the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Chamber,
ten of them abſolutely declared for it; only two, <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi>
openly diſſented from that Opinion to which they had formerly ſubſcribed,
not without the ignominy of Levity unbeſeeming their places. And as the <hi>King</hi>
was thus victorious in the Law, ſo was He at Sea; and having curbed the Pirates,
He alſo reduced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to a precarious uſe of His Seas.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt all theſe Difficulties and Calumnies the <hi>King</hi> hitherto had ſo governed,

and (which was the effect of that) none prouder. Security increaſed the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-mans
ſtock, and Juſtice preſerved his Life; none being condemned as to Life,
but by the lawful Verdict of thoſe of an equal Condition, the Jury of his Peers.
The poor might Reverence, but needed not Fear the Great: and the Great though
he might deſpiſe, yet could not injure his more obſcure Neighbour. And all things
were ſo adminiſtred, that they ſeemed to conſpire to the Publick good; except
that they made our <hi>Happineſs too much the cauſe of all Civil Commotions,</hi> and brought
our Felicity to that height, that by the neceſſity of Humane Nature, which hath
placed all things in motion, it muſt neceſſarily decline. And God provoked by
our ſins did no longer reſtrain and obſtruct the arts and fury of ſome wicked men,
who contemning their preſent certain enjoyments, hoped for more wicked acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in publick Troubles; to overwhelm every part of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions
with a Deluge of Blood and Miſery, and to commence that War, which as it
was horrid with much ſlaughter, ſo it was memorable with the Experiences of His
Majeſties Vertues; Confuſions, like Winds, from every Coaſt at once aſſaulting
and trying His Righteous Soul.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Storm aroſe from the North, and the flame firſt broke out in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where thoſe Lords who feared they ſhould loſe their ſpoils of Religion and Majeſty,
took all occaſions to haſten the publick Miſery (which at laſt moſt heavily lay
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60710:12"/>
upon their Country, the hands they had ſtrengthned and inſtructed to fight againſt
their Prince, laying a more unſupportable ſlavery upon them then their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Slanders could form in the imaginations of the credulous that they might
fear from the <hi>King</hi>) by calumniating the <hi>King</hi>'s Government, raiſing fears of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Idolatry, forming and ſpreading ſeditious Libels. The Author, or at
leaſt the Abettor, of one of which was found to be the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> a Traitor by
Nature, being the Son of one who had before merited Death for his Treaſons to
King <hi>James,</hi> yet found that mercy from him as the Son now did from King <hi>Charles,</hi>
to have his Life and Eſtate continued after condemnation. Yet this perfidious man
interpreted the <hi>King</hi>'s Clemencie for his own Vertue; and he that had dared ſuch a
Crime, could not be changed by the Pardon of it; and as if he had rather received
an Injury than Life, he was the moſt active in the approaching Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>For the Rabble,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1637</label> that delights in Tumults, were fitted by this and other Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeus
for any occaſion of contemning the <hi>King</hi>'s Authority (though His deſigns,
that were thus diſpleaſing to the Noblefs, were evidently for the benefit of the
Populacy) and at laſt took fire from the Liturgie, ſomething differing from ours,
(leſt a full conſent might argue a dependency upon the Church of <hi>England</hi>) which
ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhops had compoſed and preſented to the <hi>King</hi> for the uſe of their
Church; which the <hi>King</hi> who was deſirous that thoſe who were united under His
Command might not be divided in Worſhip, confirmed, and appointed to be firſt
read <hi>July</hi> 13. at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a City always pregnant with ſuſpicions and falſe rumours.
But it was entertained with all the inſtruments of Fury that were preſent to a debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
multitude: for they flung Cudgels and Sticks at the Dean of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> while
he was performing his Office; and after that was done, re-inforced their aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Biſhops, whom the Earls of <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and <hi>Traquaire</hi> pretended to protect,
who indured ſome affronts, that their Patience might provoke a greater rage in
the Multitude, which a vigorous puniſhment had eaſily extinguiſh'd. For <hi>they that
are fierce in a croud, being ſingled, through their particular fears become obedient. And
that Rabble that talks high againſt the determinations of their Prince, when danger from
the Laws is within their ken, diſtruſt their Companions, and return to ſubjection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it ſoon appeared that this was not the bare effort of a mutinous Multitude,
but a long-formed Conſpiracy; and to this Multitude, whoſe preſent terrour was
great, yet would have been contemptible in a ſhort ſpace, there appeared Parties to
head them of ſeveral Orders. Who preſently digeſted their Partiſans into ſeveral
Tables, and concocted this Mutiny into a formal Rebellion. To proſecute which
they mutually obliged themſelves and the whole Nation in a <hi>Covenant</hi> to extirpate
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and whatſoever they pleaſed to brand with the odious names of <hi>Hereſie</hi>
and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and to defend each other againſt all Perſons, not excepting the
<hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To reduce this people to more peaceful Practices, the <hi>King</hi> ſends Marqueſs
<hi>Hamilton</hi> (one who being careſſed by His Majeſtie's Favour had riſen to ſuch a
degree of Wealth and Greatneſs, that now he dreamed of nothing leſs than Empire,
to bring his Power to perfection, at leaſt to be Monarch of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to which he
had ſome pretenſions by his birth) as His Commiſſioner. Who with a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of
Loyalty diſſembled that pleaſure which he took in the oppoſition of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whoſe firſt motions were ſecretly directed by his Counſels, and thoſe of his
Dependents, <hi>Traquair</hi> and <hi>Roxbrough,</hi> for all his Allies were of that Party, contrary
to the cuſtom of that Country, where all the Members of a Family eſpouſe the
part of their Head though in the utmoſt danger:) and his Mother rid armed with
Piſtols at her Saddle-bow for defence of the Covenant. By his actings there new
ſeeds of Diſcontents and War were dayly ſown, and his Oppoſitions ſo faint, that
he rather encreaſed than allayed their fury: By ſeveral returns to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> for
new Inſtructions he gave time to the Rebels to conſolidate their Conſpiracy, to call
home their Exiles of Poverty that were in Foreign Armies, and provide Arms for
open Force: By his falſe repreſentations of the ſtate of things, he induced the
<hi>King</hi> to temporize with the too-potent Corruption of that Nation (an Artifice <hi>King</hi>
JAMES had ſometimes practiſed) and by granting their deſires, to make them
ſenſible of the Evils which would flow from their own Counſels. Therefore the
<hi>King</hi> gave Order for revoking the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the <hi>High-Commiſſion,</hi> the Book of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
and the Five <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth.</hi>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60710:12"/>
But the Covenanters were more inſolent by theſe Conceſſions, becauſe they
had gotten that by unlawful courſes and unjuſt force which Modeſty and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
had never obtained; and imputing theſe Grants to the <hi>King</hi>'s Weakneſs, not
His Goodneſs, they proceeded to bolder Attempts: Indicted an Aſſembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Him, in which they aboliſhed <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> excommunicated the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all
that adhered to them. Afterwards they ſeiſed upon the <hi>King</hi>'s Revenue, ſurpriſed
His Forts and Caſtles, and at laſt put themſelves into Arms.</p>
                  <p>Provoked with theſe Injuries the <hi>King</hi> amaſſes a gallant Army, in which was a
very great appearance of Lords and Gentlemen, and with theſe marches, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps
within two miles of <hi>Berwick,</hi> within ſight of the Enemy. But their preſent
Condition being ſuch as could endure neither War nor Peace, they endeavoured to
diſſipate that Army, which they could not overthrow, by a pretence to a Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For which they petitioned the <hi>King,</hi> who yielded unto it out of His innate
tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood. So an Accord was made <hi>June</hi> 17.<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1639</label> and the <hi>King</hi>
disbands His Army, expecting the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould do the like, according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Agreement.</p>
                  <p>But they being delivered from Fear, would not be reſtrained by Shame from
breaking their Faith. For no ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> disbanded, but they proteſted
againſt the <hi>Pacification,</hi> printed many falſe Copies of it, that might repreſent it
diſhonourable to the <hi>King,</hi> retained their Officers in pay, changed the old Form of
holding Parliaments, invaded the Prerogatives of the Crown, and ſollicited the
<hi>French</hi> King for an aid of Men and Money.</p>
                  <p>This perfidious abuſe of His Majeſtie's Clemency made thoſe that judge of
Counſels by the iſſue to cenſure the King's Facility. <hi rend="margQuotes">Some wondred how He
could imagine there would be any Moderation in ſo corrupt a Generation of Men,
and that they who had broken the Peace out of a deſire of War, ſhould now lay
aſide their Arms out of a love to Quiet. That there would be alwaies the ſame
cauſes to the <hi>Scots</hi> of diſturbing <hi>England,</hi> and oppoſing Government, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
Nature and Covetouſneſs: therefore unleſs ſome ſtrong impreſſion made
them either unable or unwilling to diſtract our quiet, the <hi>King</hi> was to look for
a ſpeedy return of their Injuries. Others attributed the Accord to the <hi>King</hi>'s
ſenſe that ſome eminent Officers in his own Camp were polluted with Counſels
not different from the Covenanters: and that <hi>Hamilton</hi> His Admiral had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the ſeaſons of fighting by riding quietly in the <hi>Forth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and
had ſecret Conference with his Mother, the great Nurſe of the Covenant, on
Shipboard. But moſt referred it to the <hi>King</hi>'s innate tenderneſs of His Subjects
Blood, and to His Prudence not to defile His Glory with the overthrow (which
ſeemed probable) of a contemptible Enemy, where the gains of the Victory could
not balance the hazards of attempting it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While Men thus diſcourſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> Perfidiouſneſs,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1640</label> the <hi>King</hi> prepares for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Army, and in order thereto calls a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and another in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for aſſiſtances againſt the Rebels in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> granted Money to
raiſe and pay Eight Thouſand Men in Arms, and furniſh them with Ammunition.
Yet this Example, with the <hi>King</hi>'s account of the Injuries done to Him and this
Nation by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and his promiſe of for ever acquitting them of Ship-money if
now they would freely aſſiſt Him, prevailed nothing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament,
whom the Faction drew aſide to other Counſels. And when the King ſent S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Henry
Vane</hi> to remind them of His deſires, and to demand Twelve Subſidies, yet to accept
of Six; but he induſtriouſly (as was collected from his own and his Sons following
practices) inſiſted upon the Twelve, without inſinuation of the leſſer quantity His
Majeſty would be contented with; which gave ſuch an opportunity and matter for
ſeditious Harangues, that the Houſe was ſo exaſperated, as that they were about to
Remonſtrate againſt the War with <hi>Scotland.</hi> To prevent this ominous effect of the
falſeneſs of His Servant, the <hi>King</hi> was forced to diſſolve the Parliament <hi>May</hi> 5. yet
continued the Convocation which granted Him Four Shillings in the Pound for all
their Eccleſiaſtical Promotions. But the Laity that in the Houſe had not time to
declame againſt His Majeſtie's Proceedings, did it without doors; for being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to their homes, they filled all places with ſuſpicious rumours and high diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
and in <hi>Southwark</hi> there was an open Mutiny began, which was not pacified
without much danger, and the Execution of the principal Leaders.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> thus betrayed, defamed and deſerted by thoſe who ſhould have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that in His Honour their Safety was embarqued, though He had no leſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60710:13"/>
cauſe to fear ſecret Conſpiracies at Home, which were more dangerous becauſe
obſcure, than the <hi>Scots</hi> publick Hostility; yet vigorouſly proſecuted his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and raiſed a ſufficient Army: but could not do it with equal ſpeed to His
Enemies, who had ſoon re-united their diſperſed Forces; and incouraged by the
Faction, with whom they held Intelligence in <hi>England,</hi> contented not themſelves
to ſtand upon the defence, but invaded us, and advanced ſo far before all the <hi>King</hi>'s
Army could be gathered together, that they gave a defeat to a Party of it ere
the Reer could be brought up by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was appointed General,
or the <hi>King</hi> could come to incourage them with His Preſence.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner arrived at his Army, but there followed Him from ſome <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Lords a Petition, conformable to the <hi>Scotch Remonſtrance,</hi> which they called the
<hi>Intentions of the Army.</hi> So that His Majeſty might juſtly fear ſome attempts in the
South, while He was thus defending Himſelf from the Northern injuries. The <hi>King</hi>
anſwered the Petitioners, <hi>That before their Petition came He had reſolved to ſummon all
the Peers to conſult what would be moſt for the Safety of the Nation and His own Honour.</hi>
Who accordingly met <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. Where it was determined that a Parliament ſhould be
called to meet <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. and in the mean time a Ceſſation ſhould be made with the
<hi>Scots,</hi> with whom ſome Commiſſioners from the Parliament ſhould treat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. began that Fatal Parliament which was ſo tranſported by the Arts of ſome
unquiet perſons, that they diſhonoured the name and hopes of a Parliament, ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
the Nation in a Sea of Blood, ruined the <hi>King,</hi> and betrayed all their own
Priviledges and the People's Liberty into the power of a phanatick and perfidious
Army. And although His Majeſty could not hope to find them moderate, yet He
endeavoured to make them ſo; telling them at their meeting, that He was reſolved
to put himſelf freely upon the Affections of His <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects; that He would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
all their juſt Grievances, and not leave to malice it ſelf a ſhadow to doubt of
His deſire to make this a glorious and flouriſhing Kingdom. He commended to their
care the chaſing out of the Rebels, the Proviſions of His own Army, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the oppreſſed Northern Counties.</p>
                  <p>But the Malignity of ſome few; and the ignorance of more, employed that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
in other matters: firſt, in purging their Houſe of all ſuch as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
would not comply with their deſtructive Enterpriſes; and for ſuch men they
either found ſome fault with their Elections, or made them Criminals in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Grievance; though others of a deeper guilt they kept among them, that their
Offences might make them obnoxious to their power, and obſequious to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Then with compoſed Harangues they declamed upon the publick Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and reckoned up cauſal Misfortunes amongſt deſigned Abuſes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
every way raiſing up Contumelies againſt the preſent Power: and that which
was fulleſt of Detraction and Envy was applauded as moſt pregnant with Liberty.
Thus pretending ſeveral Injuries had been done to the People, they raiſed the
Multitude to hopes of an unimaginable Liberty, and a diſcontent with the preſent
Government. After this they ſet free all the Martyrs of Sedition, that for their
malignant Libels had been impriſoned, and three of them were conducted through
<hi>London</hi> with ſuch a company of people adorned with Roſemary and Bayes, as it
ſeemed a Triumph over Juſtice and thoſe Tribunals that ſentenced them. Then
they fell upon all the chief Miniſters of State: they impeached the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> after him the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Finch,</hi> Keeper of the Great Seal, the Judges that according to their Oath had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Ship-money legal, and others; ſome of which fled, thoſe that were found
were clapt in Priſon: ſo that the <hi>King</hi> was ſoon deſpoiled of thoſe that were able
or faithful to give Him Counſel, and others terrified in their Miniſtry to Him.</p>
                  <p>While the Factious thus led the Houſe, their Partiſans without by their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
formed Petitions againſt the Government in Church and State; to which
they ſeduced the ignorant Rabble in the City and ſeveral Counties to ſubſcribe,
and in a tumultuous manner to preſent them to their Patriots. Who being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the ſucceſs of their Arts, fell to draw up a Bill for <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliaments,
wherein the Power of calling that great Council of the Nation was, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
of the <hi>King,</hi> and the neglect of others, devolved upon Conſtables, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of Majeſty though the <hi>King</hi> diſſwaded them from, yet they perſiſted in;
and He paſſed it.</p>
                  <p>After five Months time (for ſo long a ſpace they took to rake up Matter
and Witneſſes to juſtifie their accuſation,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1641</label> and to give leiſure to the Court for Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60710:13"/>
of gainfull Offices to the great Sticklers againſt him; which not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> is brought to his Triall in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall before
the Lords as His Judges: (the <hi>King, Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> ſitting behind a Curtain
in an adjoyning Gallery) and round about the Court ſtood the Commons. His
Accuſers and Witneſſes were <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (and indeed ſo brave a
Perſon could not be ruined but by the pretended hatred of the whole Empire.)
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſuch as envied his Vertues, and greatneſs in the <hi>King</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
The <hi>Scotch,</hi> becauſe they knew his Prudence able to counterwork their
Frauds, diſcover their impudent Cheats, and his wiſe management to overthrow
their Force. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> hatred aroſe from his juſt and neceſſary Severity in his
Government, whereby he had reduced them from ſo great a Barbarouſneſs that
was impatient of Peace, to a Civility that was fertile of Plenty; and by Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Husbandry and Commerce had rendred that tumultuary Nation ſo rich, that
they were now able to repay to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſury thoſe great Debts which
their former Troubles and Commotions had contracted. Although thoſe of this
Nation were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſworn Enemies both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and State, and
were even then practiſing and meditating their Rebellion, (which they hoped
more eaſie when ſo wiſe a Governour was removed) and ſo prone enough of
themſelves to the Crime; yet were they much careſſed by the Faction, that theſe
in the name of the whole Kingdom ſhould preſs the <hi>Earl</hi> with envy to the
Grave.</p>
                  <p>His Charge conſiſted of twenty eight Articles (that their number might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their want of Evidence.) To all which the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (whoſe Patience was
not overcome, nor his nature changed by the Reproaches of his Accuſers) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
with ſo brave a Preſence of Spirit, ſuch firm Reaſons, and ſo clear an
Eloquence, that he whom the mercenary Tongues of their Lawyers had rendred
as a Monſter of men, could not be found guilty of Treaſon, either in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
or the whole. So that his Enemies were filled with madneſs that their
Charge of Crimes appeared no other then a Libel of Slanders; and the diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
Hearers were (beſides the pleaſure they received to find ſo great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
polluted with no hainous Crimes) ſenſible of the unhappineſs of thoſe
who are <hi>Miniſters of State among a Factious people, where their proſperous Counſels
are not rewarded, and unſucceſsfull, though prudent, are ſeverely accuſed: when they erre,
every one condemns them, and their wiſe Advices few praiſe; for thoſe that are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted
envy, and ſuch as are diſappointed hate thoſe that gave them.</hi> And ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Fate of this Excellent Counſellour, whom nothing elſe but his great Parts,
his Maſter's Love and Truſt had expoſed to this Danger.</p>
                  <p>The Faction being obſtructed this way, by the Earl's Innocency and Abilities,
from taking away his Life, move the Houſe to proceed by a Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi>
to the making a Law after the Fact, whereby they Vote him guilty of High
Treaſon: yet adde a Caution, that it ſhould not be drawn into a Precedent,
ſeeking to ſecure themſelves from a return of that Injuſtice upon themſelves
which they acted on him, intending to proſecute what they falſly charged him
with, the Alteration of Government. Which yet paſſed not without a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and contention: for many that had none but honeſt hopes, diſdained to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
to the Intereſt of the Faction in the blood of ſo much Innocent Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry;
and thoſe that were prudent ſaw how ſuch an Example opened the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to ruine of the beſt Perſons, when once expoſed to publick hatred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they earneſtly diſſwaded ſuch a proceed. And fifty nine of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
openly diſſented when it came to the Vote; whoſe Names were afterwards
poſted, and marked for the fury of the Rabble, that for the future they might
not oppoſe the deſigns of the Factious, unleſs they deſired to be torn in
pieces.</p>
                  <p>In two dayes the Lower Houſe paſt the Bill, ſo ſwift were the Demagogues
to ſhed blood: but the Lords Houſe was a little more deliberative (the <hi>King</hi>
having amongſt them declared His ſenſe of the Earl's Innocency:) of whoſe
ſlow Reſolves the Faction being impatient, there came a ſeditious rabble of about
5 or 6000 of the dreggs of the people, armed with Staves and Cudgels, and
other Inſtruments of Outrage, (inſtigated by the more unquiet Members both
of the Houſe of Commons and the City) to the Parliament doors, clamouring
<hi>Juſtice, Juſtice:</hi> and the next day, to raiſe their Fury, there was a report ſpred
among them of ſome endeavours to prepare an Eſcape for the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60710:14"/>
therefore with more fierceneſs they raiſed their clamours, ſome objecting
Treaſon to him, others their Decay of Trade, and each one either as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
(for ſome of the Houſe of Commons would be among them, to direct
their Fury, and to give ſome order to their Tumult, that it might appear more
terrible,) or the ſenſe of his own neceſſities and luſts led him, urged his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
motives for Juſtice: and at laſt, heated by their own motion and noiſe,
they guard the doors of the Houſe of Peers, offer inſolencies to the Lords, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Biſhops, as they went in, and threaten them if their Votes diſagree
from their clamours. And when they had thus made an aſſault on the Liberty
of the Parliament (which yet was pretended to be ſo Sacred) they afterward
ſet upon the neighbouring <hi>Abbey-Church;</hi> where forcing open the doors they
brake down the Organs, ſpoiled all the Veſtments and Ornaments of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
from thence they fly to Court, and diſturb the Peace of it with their
undecent and barbarous clamours: and at laſt were raiſed to that impudency, as
to upbraid the <hi>King,</hi> (who from a Scaffold perſwaded them as they paſſed by
to a modeſt care of their own private affairs) with an unfitneſs to reign.</p>
                  <p>When ſome Juſtices of the Peace, according to the Law, endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
thoſe Tumults by impriſoning the moſt forward and bold Leaders, they
themſelves were impriſoned by the Command of the Commons, upon pretext of
an injury offered to the Liberties of the Subject; of which one was (as they
then dictated) <hi>That every one might ſafely petition the Parliament:</hi> yet when the
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> men came to petition for ſomething contrary to the Guſt of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they cauſed the <hi>City</hi> Gates to be ſhut upon them; and when other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were meditating Addreſſes for Peace, by threatnings they deterred them
from ſuch honeſt undertakings. And when ſome prudent Perſons minded the
Demagogues how diſhonourable it was for the Parliament not to ſuppreſs ſuch
Mutinies, they replied, that <hi>their friends ought rather to be thanked and careſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe and other Arts having wholly overthrown the freedom of that Council,
and many withdrawing themſelves from ſuch Outrages, when ſcarce the third part
of the Peers were preſent, the Faction of that Houſe likewiſe paſſed the Bill, the
Diſſenters being out-voted only by ſeven Voices. Yet all this could not prevail upon
the <hi>King,</hi> though the Tumults were ſtill high without, and within He was daily
ſollicited by the Lords of his Palace (who now looked upon the Earl as the Herd doth
on an hurt Deer, and they hoped his Blood would be the Luſtration of the Court) to
leave the Earl as a Sacrifice to the Vulgar rage. Nor did the <hi>King</hi> any ways yield,
till the Judges (who were now obſequious to the pleaſures of the Parliament) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he might do it by Law, and the Earl by his own Letters devoted himſelf as a
Victime for the publick Peace and His Majeſty's ſafety: and then overcome with
Importunities on all hands, and being abuſed by bad dealing of the Judges (as Himſelf
complained to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who anſwered, <hi>That if the</hi> King <hi>in Conſcience
found him not guilty, He ought not to paſs the Bill; but for matter of Law, what was
Treaſon, he referred Him to the Judges, who according to their Oath ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
indifferently betwixt Him and His Subjects:</hi> but the other four Biſhops that were
then conſulted, <hi>Durham, Lincoln, Carliſle,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> were not
ſo free as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was, and therefore the King obſerved a ſpecial
bleſſing of God upon him.) He at laſt with much reluctancy ſigned a Commiſſion
to ſome Lords to paſs that Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> and another for <hi>Continuation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
during the pleaſure of the Two Houſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">The paſſing of theſe two Bills, as ſome thought, wounded the <hi>King</hi>'s Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
more than any thing He ever did. The firſt, becauſe it cut off a moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Inſtrument of Empire, and a moſt faithful Servant: and none did more make
uſe of this to pollute His Honour, than thoſe who had even forced Him to it;
like thoſe malignant and damned Spirits who upbraid unhappy Souls with thoſe
Crimes and ruines to which they themſelves have tempted and betrayed them. But
the heavieſt Cenſor was Himſelf, for he never left bewailing His Compliance, or
rather Connivence, with this Murder, till the iſſue of his Blood dried up thoſe of
His Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">By the other Bill He had, as ſome cenſured, renounced His Crown, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to thoſe men who at preſent exerciſed ſo Arbitrary a Power, that they wanted
nothing but length of time to be reputed Kings, and this they now had gotten.
But the more Speculative concluded it an act of eſpecial Prudence, for the <hi>King</hi>
made that an evidence of His ſincere intention to oblige His people, and overcome
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60710:14"/>
the Malice of His Enemies with Benefits: which the Faction would have uſurped,
and by the boldneſs of the attempt ingaged the People to them as the only Patrons
of their Liberty. And they were furniſhed with an Example for it by their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who indicted an Aſſembly without the <hi>King</hi>'s leave, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
it againſt His pleaſure; and (as <hi>all imitations of Crimes exceed their firſt pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>)
it was conceived theſe men whoſe furies were more unjuſt, and ſo would be
more fierce, intended to improve that Precedent to the extreameſt guilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bill was no ſooner ſigned, but they haſtened the Execution; and ſo much the
more eagerly, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> deſired, in a moſt paſſionate Letter delivered by the
<hi>Prince</hi> to the Lords, that the Excellent Soul which found ſo much Injuſtice on Earth,
might have the more time to fit it ſelf for the Mercy of Heaven. But this favour
which became Chriſtians to grant, agreed not with the Religion of his Adverſaries,
and therefore the ſecond day after he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> (in
his Paſſage thither he had a ſight of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whoſe Prayers and
Bleſſing he with a low Obeiſance begged, and the moſt pious Prelate beſtowed them
with Tears,) where with a greater preſence of mind than he had looked his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the face, did he encounter Death, and ſubmitted his neck to the ſtroke of
the Executioner. <hi rend="margQuotes">He was a perſon of a generous Spirit, fitted for the nobleſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes,
and the moſt difficult parts of Empire. His Counſels were bold, yet
juſt, and he had a Vigour proper for the Execution of them. Of an Eloquence,
next to that of his Maſter's, maſculine, and moſt excellent. He was no leſs affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to the Church than to the State, and not contented while living to defend
the Government and Patrimony of it, he commended it alſo to his Son when he
was about to die, and charged his abhorrency of Sacriledge. His Enemies called
the Majeſty of his Miene in his Lieutenancy, Pride, and the undaunted execution
of his Office on the contumacious, the inſolency of his Fortune. He was cenſured
for committing that fatal Errour of following the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>London</hi> and to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
after the Pacification with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>York;</hi> and it was thought that if
he had gone over to his charge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have ſecured both himſelf and
that Kingdom for his Majeſty's Service. But ſome attributed this Counſel to a
neceſſity of <hi>Fate, whoſe firſt ſtroke is at the brain of thoſe whom it deſigns to ruine,</hi> and
brought him to feel the effects of Popular Rage, which himſelf in former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had uſed againſt Government, and to find the Experience of his own advices
againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham. Providence teaching us to abhor over-fine Counſels by
the miſchiefs they bring upon their Authors.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fall of this Great Man ſo terrified the other Officers of State, that the Lord
<hi>High Treaſurer</hi> reſigned his Staff to the Hands from whence he received it; the Lord
<hi>Cottington</hi> forſook the Maſterſhip of the Court of <hi>Wards;</hi> and the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the
Prince returned Him to the <hi>King:</hi> Theſe Lords parting with their Offices, like thoſe
that ſcatter their Treaſure and Jewels in the way, that they might delude the violence
of their greedy purſuers. But the <hi>King</hi> was left naked of their faithful Miniſtery,
and expoſed to the Infuſions and Informations of thoſe who were either Complices or
Mercenaries to the Faction, to whom they diſcovered his moſt private Counſels.</p>
                  <p>When the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was dead, then did the Parliament begin to think of
ſending away the <hi>Scots,</hi> who hitherto had much impoveriſhed the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and increaſed the charges of the Nation: but now they were voted to receive
300000 l. under the notion of a Brotherly aſſiſtance, but in truth, deſigned by the
Faction, as a reward for their Clamours for the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Blood; yet were they kept ſo
long till the <hi>King</hi> had paſſed away more of His Prerogative, in ſigning the Bills to
take away the <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> After which ſpoils of Majeſty
they disband the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Armies, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. and on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that
Month the <hi>King</hi> follows them into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle, if it were poſſible, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But the <hi>King</hi> ſtill found them as before: when he ſatisfied their greedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
then would they offer Him their Lives and Fortunes; but when gain or
advantage appeared from His Enemies, they appeared in their proper nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
changeable and perfidious, whom no favours could oblige, nor any thing but
Ruine was to be expected by building upon their Love.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>King</hi> was in <hi>Scotland</hi> labouring to ſettle that Nation by granting all that
the Covetouſneſs and Ambition of their Leaders pretended was for the Publick good,
and ſo aimed at no leſs than a Miracle, by His Benefits to reduce <hi>Faith</hi> (which, <hi>like
Life, when it is once departed doth never naturally return</hi>) into thoſe perfidious breaſts;
the Parliament adjourns, and leaves a ſtanding <hi>Committee</hi> of ſuch as were the Leaders
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60710:15"/>
or the Servants of the Faction. Theſe prepared new Toils for His Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and by them was the <hi>Grand Remonſtrance</hi> formed: in it were reckoned for
Grievances all the Complaints of Men that were impatient of Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Offences of Courtiers, the unpleaſing Reſolves of Judges, the Neglects
or Rigours of the Miniſters of Juſtice, the undigeſted Sermons of ſome Preachers,
yea the Poſitions of ſome Divines in the Schools, were all exaggerated to defame
the preſent Government both in Church and State, and to magnifie the skill of
theſe State-Phyſicians that offered Preſcripts for all theſe Diſtempers. Beſide, more
eaſily to abuſe the <hi>Vulgar, who reckon Misfortunes as Crimes,</hi> unpleaſing accidents
were repreſented as deſigns of Tyranny; and thoſe things which had been refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
were yet mentioned as continued burthens. From which the People were
aſſured there could be no deliverance but by the Wiſdom and Magnanimity of the
Remonſtrants.</p>
                  <p>To prepare the way for this, the moſt opprobrious parts of it were firſt whiſpered
among the Populacy, that by this ſeeming ſuppreſſion men impatient of Secrets might
more eagerly divulge them, and the danger appear greater by an affected ſilence.
Then prodigious Calumnies (which none but ſouls prone to any wickedneſs could
believe of ſo Great a Man) were formed of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch ſuſpicions raiſed
of Him and His Friends, as might force them to ſome Injuries which hitherto
they forbore, and by ſecuring themſelves increaſe the Publick fears. For <hi>Slanders do
rather provoke moſt men, than amend them; and the provoked think more of their ſafety,
than to adjuſt their actions againſt their malicious Slanderers.</hi> And when the minds of
Men were made thus ſollicitous concerning Dangers from the <hi>King,</hi> to make them
more pliable and ductile, there was repreſented to them an inevitable anger of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt the preſent ſtate of things both in Church and State, teſtified by many
Prodigies that were related, and portentuous Preſages of Ruine. Certain Prophecies
(for a credulity to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vulgar are infamous) from unknown Oracles
are divulged, which aenigmatically deſcribe the <hi>King</hi> as a Monſter, and from ſuch a
Prince muſt proceed a change of Government. Some vain perſons alſo, that gave
themſelves up to the Impoſture of Aſtrologie, were hired to terrifie the People with
the unſignificant Conjunctions of Stars, and from them to foretel Ruines to the better
part of the World, and an imminent deſtruction of Men of the long Robe, and
Alterations of States.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were done to temper the minds of Men by a ſuperſtition for a guidance of
their Miniſters, who being conceived to be the Ambaſſadours of Heaven, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have it in their Commiſſion, to declare the Conditions of War and Peace:
and theſe, either through the ſame weakneſs capable of the like terrours, with the
Vulgar, or (which is more to be abhorred) corrupted, as ſome were, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
and gainful hopes that the Faction baited them with, did juſtifie their Fears,
and increaſe them by applying ſome obſcure Prophecies in Scripture to the preſent
times and People; compared the pretended Corruptions of our Church with the
Idolatries of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whatſoever was condemned in the Holy Records, was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
with the things they diſliked here, and all the Curſes that God poured upon
His irreconcileable and obdurate Enemies, were denounced againſt ſuch as differ'd
from them, or would not joyn with the Faction.</p>
                  <p>To make theſe Harangues more efficacious, the Authors of them received the
Reverence of the Demagogues, who (deſpiſing, queſtioning and expoſing to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
ſuch ſober Divines as would have cured the madneſs of the People,) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to ſuch Teachers the Titles of Saints, Faithful Miniſters, Pretious Men;
and they on the other ſide made a return of Epithets to their Maſters, of the
Servants of the Moſt High, ſuch as were to do the Work of the Lord; That by
their Counſels men were to expect new Heavens and a new Earth; that they
were Men that ſhould prepare the Kingdom for Jeſus Chriſt, and lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Empire of the Saints which was to laſt a Thouſand years. To
make the Cry yet louder, they permitted all Sects and Hereſies a Licence of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
profeſſion, (which hitherto Diſcipline, the Care of the Common Peace and
Religion had confined to ſecret Corners) and permitted the Office of Teaching to
every bold and ignorant Undertaker; ſo that at laſt the dreggs of the People Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that Dignity, and Women, who had parted with the Natural Modeſty of their
Sex, would not only ſpeak, but alſo rule in the Church. All theſe, in gratitude for
their Licentiouſneſs, ſtill perſwaded to their Hearers the admiration of the Authors
of it, and bitterly inveighed againſt thoſe whom the Care both of the Souls and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60710:15"/>
of Men would excite to repreſs them, in many of their Raptures denouncing
Wo and Judgment to the lawful Governours in Church and State.</p>
                  <p>While all theſe Methods of Ruine were preparing here, the ſame anger of God,
the ſame madneſs of men raiſed up another Tempeſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Lords and Prieſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who were the prime Compoſers of the Tragedies
there,) were incouraged by the Succeſs of the <hi>Scots, who by a proſperous Rebellion</hi>
(as the Hiſtorian of thoſe Troubles writes) <hi>had procured for themſelves ſuch large Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi>
to an imitation, which the preſent Jealouſies in <hi>England</hi> (where mutual
Contraſts would employ all their force upon one another,) promiſed to be ſecure. And
they had an happy opportunity by the Vacancy in Government through the ſlaughter
of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords (while they proſecuted him in
<hi>England</hi>) had removed all thoſe other inferiour Magiſtrates that were moſt skilful
in the Affairs of that Kingdom, by accuſing to the Faction ſome of them of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and others of an inclination to the <hi>Earl,</hi> and had got preferred to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ſuch as were either altogether unacquainted with the <hi>Genius</hi> of that People, or
favourers of the Conſpiracy. A ſtrength they had alſo ready; for thoſe Eight
Thouſand which had been liſted for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Expedition were unſeaſonably disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the <hi>King</hi> in foreſight they might cauſe ſome miſchief in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
had therefore promiſed Four Thouſand of them to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> yet
would not the Parliament conſent to their departure, becauſe (as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords
ſuggeſted) it would diſpleaſe the King of <hi>France;</hi> and when the <hi>King</hi> promiſed to
ſend as many to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, that likewiſe was not reliſhed. The Common
Souldiers of that Army being thus made uſeleſs, and therefore like Men of their
employment, moſt fierce when they were to be diſmiſſed from the dangers of War,
were eaſily drawn into the Rebellion, although very few of their Officers were
polluted with the Crime.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords and Prieſts being allured by theſe our Vices and theſe ſeveral
opportunities, began their Rebellion <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> throughout that whole
Kingdom on a ſudden invading the unprovided <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſcattered among
them, deſpoiling them of their Eſtates, Goods, and many thouſands of their Lives,
without any reſpect of Sex, Age, Kindred, or Friendſhip, and made them as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sacrifices to their bloody Superſtition. They miſſed but a little to have ſurpriſed
<hi>Dublin.</hi> But their Conſpiracy being detected there and in ſome few other places,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and intereſt was preſerved in that Kingdom, till they could receive
Succours from hence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> had the firſt Intelligence of it, in its very beginnings, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
thereupon ſent S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>James Stuart</hi> to the Lords of the Privie Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with His Knowledge and Inſtructions, and to carry all that Money
that His preſent Stores could ſupply. Beſides, He moves the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
as being neareſt, to a ſpeedy help; who decline their Aids, becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> At the ſame time alſo He ſends poſt to the
Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> who leſs regard it, the Faction applauding their Fortune,
that new Troubles were ariſen to moleſt the <hi>King,</hi> and that the Royal Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus aſſaulted in all three Nations, there muſt ſhortly ariſe ſo many new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.
Beſides that it yielded freſh matter of reproach to His Majeſty, to
whoſe Councils at firſt ſecretly they whiſpered, and at laſt publickly imputed that
horrid Maſſacre. Which Slanders were coloured by the Arts of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels,
who, to diſhearten the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from any reſiſtance, bragged <hi>that the Queen was with
their Army; That the King would come amongſt them with Auxiliary Forces; That
they did but maintain His Cauſe against the Puritans; That they had the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for what they did,</hi> ſhewing indeed a Patent that themſelves had drawn, but
thereto was affixed an Old broad Seal that had been taken from an obſolete Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
out of <hi>Farnham</hi> Abbey, by one <hi>Plunckett,</hi> in the preſence of many of their
Lords and Prieſts, as was afterwards atteſted by the Confeſſion of many. <hi>That the
Scots were in Confederacy with them,</hi> to beget a Faith of which, they abſtained from
the Lives and Fortunes of thoſe of that Nation among them.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, to incourage the Natives of their own Party, they produce
fictitious Letters, wherein they were informed from <hi>England</hi> that <hi>the Parliament
had paſſed an Act, that all the Iriſh ſhould be compelled to the Proteſtant Worſhip; that for
the firſt offence they ſhould forfeit all their Goods, for the ſecond their Eſtates, and for the
third their Lives.</hi> Beſides they preſent them with the hopes of Liberty: <hi>That the
Engliſh Yoke ſhould be ſhaken off; that they would have a King of their own Nation;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60710:16"/>
and that the Goods and Eſtates of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould be divided among the Natives.</hi>
And with theſe hopes of Spoil and Liberty and <hi>Iriſh</hi> were driven to ſuch a Fury,
that they committed ſo many horrid and barbarous Acts as ſcarce ever any Age or
People were guilty of.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while nothing was done for the relief of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, but
only ſome Votes paſſed againſt the Rebels, till the <hi>King</hi> returned to <hi>London,</hi> which
was about the end of <hi>November;</hi> where He with the Queen and the Prince were
magnificently feaſted by the Citizens, and the chief of them afterwards by Him at
<hi>Hampton</hi>-Court. For he never neglected any honeſt Arts to gain His Peoples
love; to which they were naturally prone enough, had not His Enemies methods
and impulſes depraved their <hi>Genius.</hi> But this much troubled the Faction, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
that Reverence to Majeſty in others which was not in themſelves, and they
endeavoured to make theſe loves ſhort and unhappy; for they diſcountenanced the
prime advancers of this Honour of the <hi>King,</hi> and were more eager to render Him
odious. For having gotten a Guard about them, they likewiſe inſinuated into the
people dangerous apprehenſions as the cauſe of that Guard, and every day grew
more nice, and jealous of their Priviledges, and Power. The <hi>King</hi>'s advices to
more tenderneſs of His Prerogative, or His Advertiſements of the ſcandalous Speeches
that were uttered in their Houſe, they interpret as encroachments upon their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and upbraided the <hi>King</hi> for them in their Petitions to Him.</p>
                  <p>But their greateſt effort upon Majeſty was the Remonſtrance: after which they
took all occaſions to magnifie the apprehenſions of thoſe Fears which they had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
pretended to in it. This the Faction had before formed, and now brought into
the Houſe of Commons; where it found a ſtrong oppoſition by thoſe wiſe men that
were tender of the publick Peace and Common Good: though thoſe who preferred
their Private to the General Intereſt, and every one that was ſhort-ſighted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
for the future, were ſo fierce for it, that the Debates were continued all
Night till ten a Clock the next Morning, ſo that many of the more aged, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of beſt Fortunes (not accuſtomed to ſuch watchings) were wearied out, and
many others, not daring to provoke the Faction in this their grand Deſign, left the
Houſe, ſo that at laſt they carried it, yet but by eleven Votes. Which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with a Petition to take away the Votes of Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and
the Ceremonies in the Church, and to remove thoſe Perſons from His Truſt which
they could not confide in; yet named none, but only accuſed all under the name of
a <hi>Malignant Popiſh</hi> Party. Which they had no ſooner delivered than they cauſed it to
be publiſhed in print.</p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>King</hi> anſwers in another publick Declaration, but ſo much to the
Diſcontent of the Demagogues, to find their Methods of Ruine ſo fully diſcovered
as they were in His Majeſties Anſwer, that they had recourſe to their former Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Remedy, which ſober men accounted a Crime, and an indignity to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Tumults of the Rabble. Who in great numbers and much confuſion came
up to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſome crying out againſt Biſhops, others belching their fury
againſt the Liturgy, and a third Party roaring that the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould
be taken out of the <hi>King</hi>'s hands. To their Clamours they added rude Affronts to
thoſe Lords whom their Leaders had taught them to hate, and eſpecially to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
at their going in, or coming out of the Houſe: and afterwards drawing up
to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> they appeared ſo inſolent, as it was evident they wanted only ſome
to begin, for there were enough to proſecute an aſſault upon the <hi>King</hi> in His own
Palace.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhops thus rudely excluded from their Right and Liberty of coming
to the Parliament, Twelve of them afterwards proteſt againſt the Proceedings of it,
during their ſo violent Excluſion. Which Proteſtation the Commons preſently accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of High Treaſon, and cauſed their Commitment to the <hi>Tower;</hi> where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
them till the Bill againſt their Votes in the Lord's Houſe was paſt, that they
might not produce their Reaſons for their Rights, and againſt the Injuſtice offered
unto them, and then afterwards releaſed them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> alſo ſaw it neceſſary to take a Guard of ſuch Gentlemen as offered
their Service for His Safety, and to prevent the prophaning of Majeſty by the
rude fury of the People, who uſed to make their Addreſſes acceptable at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
by offering in their paſſage ſome baſe Affronts at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> But when the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of this Guard had reduced them to ſome leſs degree of Impudencie, they then,
inſtructed by their Heads, laboured to make it more unſafe to the <hi>King,</hi> by ſeeking
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60710:16"/>
to raiſe the Rage and Jealouſie of the whole City againſt Him. For at Midnight
there were cries out in the Street, that all People ſhould ariſe to their defence; for
the <hi>King</hi> with His <hi>Papiſts</hi> were coming to fire the City, and cut their Throats in
their Beds. Than which though nothing was more falſe, yet it found the effects of
truth; and the People by ſuch Alarms being terrified from ſleep, the impreſſions of
thoſe nightly fears lay long upon their Spirits in the day, and filled them almoſt with
Madneſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> therefore, not alwaies to incourage theſe Violences with Patience, but
at laſt by a courſe of Juſtice to take off thoſe whom He had found to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of theſe deſtructive Counſels, the grand Movers of theſe Seditious practices,
and, which was more, the Inviters of a Foreign Force, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, into this
Nation; commands His Atturney-General to accuſe Five Members of the Houſe of
Commons, and one of the Lords, upon Articles of High Treaſon, to be tried accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of the Land: And He alſo ſends ſome other Officers to ſeal up their
Trunks and Cabinets in their ſeveral Lodgings, and to ſecure their Perſons. This
being related to the Houſe of Commons (wherein the Faction was now grown more
powerful, and with whom did joyn many men of Integrity in this Occurrence, being
too careful of the Priviledges of their Houſe, which yet ſecure none of the Members
againſt Juſtice for Murder, Felony, or Treaſon) they were ſo far from admitting
the <hi>King</hi>'s Charge againſt them, that they accuſed the <hi>King</hi> of breach of Priviledge,
and Vote all thoſe guilty of Enmity to the Commonwealth that ſhall obey the <hi>King</hi>
in any of His Commands concerning them.</p>
                  <p>This obſtruction of Juſtice ſo far moved the <hi>King,</hi> together with the Advice of
ſome of His Council that were alſo of the Houſe of Commons, as alſo an hope of
rooting up the Faction this way, that none through the hope of Concealment ſhould
be incouraged to conſpire the publick Ruine, that He Himſelf, with about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Lords and Gentlemen and their followers, went to the Houſe of Commons:
Where commanding His Attendants to move no further than the Stairs, to offer
no violence, nor return any uncivil Language to any, although provoked, Himſelf
with the <hi>Paltzgrave</hi> only enters the Houſe, and demands that the Incendiaries might
be delivered into His hands, with whom he promiſes to deal no otherwiſe than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law. But they whom He ſought, being before informed (as it is
reported) of the <hi>King</hi>'s coming by the ſecret Intelligence of Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and
a Court Lady (who having loſt the Confluence of Servants with her Beauty, ſought
now to prevent a ſolitude by politick Miniſteries) had forſook the place, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
themſelves into the Sanctuary of the <hi>City.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>King</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
His Charge, without injury to any, immediately departs.</p>
                  <p>But the Faction would not let Him ſo reſt, but proſecuted this attempt of His with
all the Clamours that they poſſibly could raiſe, ſpread the ſparks of Diſſenſion far
and wide, make the common People mad with Fears and Diſtractions, ſtir up ſome
in ſeveral Counties to bring Petitions for the Impeached Members and their Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Priviledges; and at laſt prepare an armed Rabble diſpoſed into Order to bring
the accuſed Demagogues to the Houſe from their Coverts in <hi>London.</hi> This coming
to the knowledge of the <hi>King,</hi> although many Gallant and Faithful Perſons proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Service by mingling with the Rout, or by being as Spectators, to curb any
Inſolencies that ſhould be attempted on Him; yet was He reſolved to withdraw
Himſelf with the Queen and their Children to <hi>Windſor,</hi> that He might permit
their Fury to languiſh when it had no oppoſition, and to give time for their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
and rumours to wax old and periſh. For <hi>the firſt Indignation of a mutinous
Multitude is moſt fierce, and a ſmall delay breaks their conſent;</hi> and <hi>Majeſty would have a
greater Reverence, if any, at a diſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Wiſdom was perceived by His Enemies, and therefore to counterwork
it, and not to let the People ſleep without fear, leſt they ſhould come to be ſober,
and return to the love of Obedience, ſtrange reports were every day brought of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from the <hi>King:</hi> That Troops of Papiſts were gathered about <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon the
<hi>Thames,</hi> where the County Magazine was lodged, under the command of the Lord
<hi>George Digby,</hi> who was then famed to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> (though at that time he was an
elegant Aſſetor of the Proteſtant Faith,) and Col. <hi>Lunsford,</hi> who was characteriſed to
be of ſo monſtrous an Appetite that <hi>he would eat Children.</hi> And Parties were ſent to take
them both, which found no ſuch dreadful Preparations. At other times, when the People
on the Lord's days were at Divine Worſhip, they were diſtracted from it by Alarms,
that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who and from whence none could tell) were up in Arms, and were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60710:17"/>
juſt then about to fire their Houſes, and mix their Blood with their Prayers; That
there were Forces kept in Grotts and Caves under Ground, that ſhould in the Night
break out into the midſt of the City, and cut all their Throats: And what was more
prodigious, and though ridiculous, yet had not a few Believers in <hi>London,</hi> That there
were Deſigns by Gunpowder to blow up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and choak them with the Water
in their Beds. Thus were the people taught to hate their Prince, and by bloody News
from every Quarter they were inſtructed to that Cruelty which they vainly feared, and
to adore thoſe by whoſe Counſels they were delivered from ſo unexpected Dangers.</p>
                  <p>By all this the Faction gained the repute of Modeſty inferiour to their ſuppoſed
Truſt, when they demanded nothing elſe but the Command of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the
<hi>Militia</hi> of all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> together with the Forts and Caſtles of the ſame.
For all which they moved the Houſe of Commons to petition: who deſiring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of the Lords in the ſame, were wholly refuſed by them. Therefore ſtemm'd
by the Faction they petition alone. Which unlimited Power the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to grant unto them, who He foreſaw would uſe that, as they had all His other
Conceſſions, to the ruine of the Author of their Power. Yet was pleaſed to conſent,
after He had demonſtrated the Prejudice they required to the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> that they
might ſend over an Army of 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and deliver unto them the ſtrong
Town and Port of <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> one of the chief Keys of that Kingdom: which was
done to oblige the <hi>Scots</hi> to them in their future Deſigns. And alſo He was pleaſed to
wave the Proſecution of the Impeached Members, and was willing to grant a Free
and General Pardon for all His Subjects, as the Parliament ſhould think convenient.</p>
                  <p>But all this could not content them who had immoderate Deſires, and they were
more diſcontented that they could not uſurp the <hi>King</hi>'s Right, than if they had loſt their
own Privileges: therefore to bring the Lords to a Concurrence with them, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
proſperous art of Tumultuous Petitions was again practiſed, and great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from ſeveral Counties were moved to come as Earthquakes, to ſhake the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Conſtitutions of their Houſe, and to require that neither the Biſhops nor the
Popiſh Lords ſhould continue in their ancient Right to Vote among the Peers. By this
means they ſhould weaken the <hi>King</hi> in the Voices of that Houſe, and whoſoever they
could not confide in, they could fright Him from Voting againſt them, by expoſing
him as Popiſh to the Popular Fury. For this was the method of uſing the Petitions.
The moſt common Anſwer was with Thanks, and that the <hi>Houſe of</hi> Commons <hi>were
juſt now in conſideration thereof.</hi> The Petitioners were taught to reply, that <hi>They doubted
not of the Care of the</hi> Commons <hi>Houſe, but all their Diſtruſt was in the Houſe of</hi> Lords,
<hi>where the Popiſh Lords and Biſhops had the greateſt Power, and there it ſtuck, whoſe Names they
deſired to know:</hi> And in this they were ſo earneſt, that they would not willingly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
whileſt it was debated, and then they had leave to depart with this Anſwer, <hi>That
the Houſe of</hi> Commons <hi>had already endeavoured Relief from the</hi> Lords <hi>in their Requeſts,
and ſhall ſo continue till Redreſs be obtained.</hi> Such Petitions as theſe were likewiſe from
the ſeveral <hi>Claſſes</hi> of the inferiour Tradeſmen about <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Porters, Water-men,</hi>
and the like: and that nothing of teſtifying an univerſal Importunity might be left
unattempted, <hi>Women</hi> were perſwaded to preſent Petitions to the ſame effect. While
the Faction thus boaſted in the ſucceſs of their Arts, Good men grieved to ſee theſe
daily Infamies of the Supreme Council of the Nation, all whoſe Secrets were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
to the loweſt and weakeſt part of the People: and they who clamoured it as a
breach of their Privilege, that the <hi>King</hi> took notice of their Debates, now made them
the ſubjects of diſcourſe in every Shop, and all the corners of the Street; where the
good and bad were equally cenſured, and the Honour and Life of every Senator expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Verdict of the Rabble. No Magiſtrate did dare to do his Office, and all
things tended to a manifeſt Confuſion: So that many ſober Perſons did leave <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
as <hi>unſafe, where Factions were more powerful than the Laws. And Just Perſons choſe
rather to hear than to ſee the Miſeries and Reproaches of their Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, to make the <hi>King</hi> more plyable, they tempt him by danger in His
moſt beloved Part the <hi>Queen,</hi> concerning whom they cauſed a Rumour, that <hi>they did
intend to impeach Her of High Treaſon.</hi> This Rumour made the deeper Impreſſion,
becauſe they had raiſed moſt prodigious Slanders (which are the firſt Marks for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of Princes) on Her; and when they had removed all other Counſellors from
the <hi>King,</hi> She was famed to be the Rock upon which all hopes of Peace and Safety
were ſplit: That She commanded no leſs His Counſels than Affections, and that His
Weakneſs was ſo great, as not to conſent to or enterpriſe any thing which She did not
firſt approve. That She had perverted Him to Her Religion, and formed Deſigns of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60710:17"/>
overthrowing the Proteſtant Profeſſion. Theſe and many other of a portentuous falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
were ſcattered among the <hi>Vulgar, who are always most prone to believe the Worſt of
Great Perſons: and the uncontrolled Licence of reporting ſuch Calumnies is conceived the first
Dawning of Liberty.</hi> But the Parliament taking notice of the Report, ſent ſome of their
Houſe to purge themſelves from it, <hi>as an unjust Scandal cast upon them.</hi> To which the
<hi>Queen</hi> mildly anſwers, <hi>That there was a general Report thereof, but She never ſaw any Articles
in writing, and having no certain Author for either, She gave little Credit thereto; nor will
She believe they would lay any Aſperſion upon Her, who hath been very unapt to miſconstrue
the Actions of any One Perſon, and much more the Proceedings of Parliament, and ſhall at
all times wiſh an Happy Vnderstanding between the King and His People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>King</hi> knowing how uſual it was for the Faction by Tumults and other
Practices to tranſport the Parliament from their juſt Intentions in other things, and
that they might do ſo in this, reſolved to ſend Her into <hi>Holland,</hi> under colour of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
their eldeſt <hi>Daughter,</hi> newly married to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but in truth
to ſecure Her; ſo that by the fears of Her danger (who was ſo dear unto Him) He
might not be forced to any thing contrary to His Honour and Conſcience, and that
Her Affections and Relations to Him might not betray Her Life to the Malice of His
Enemies. With Her He alſo ſent all the Jewels of the Crown, that they might not
be the Spoils of the Faction, but the means of the ſupport of Her Dignity in Forein
Parts, if His Neceſſities afterwards ſhould not permit Him to provide for Her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Which yet She did not ſo employ, but reſerved them for a ſupply of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Arms, when His Adverſaries had forced Him to a neceſſary Defence. It
was ſaid, that the Faction knew of this Conveyance, and might have prevented it,
but that they thought it for their greater advantage that this Treaſure ſhould be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
that the <hi>King</hi> in confidence of that Aſſiſtance might take up Arms, to which
they were reſolved at laſt to drive Him. For they thought their Cauſe would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in War than Peace, becauſe their preſent Deliberations were in the ſenſe of the
Law actual Rebellions; and a longer time would diſcover thoſe Impoſtures by which
they had deluded the People, who would ſoon leave them (as many now did begin to
repent of their Madneſs) to the Vengeance which was due to their Practices, unleſs
they were more firmly united by a communion of Guilt in an open aſſaulting their
Lawful Prince.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> haſtens the Security of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and accompanies Her as far as <hi>Dover,</hi>
there to take His Farewel of Her; a Buſineſs almoſt as irkſom as Death, to be ſeparated
from a Wife of ſo great Affections and eminent Endowments: and that which made it
the more bitter, was, that the ſame Cauſe which forced Her Separation from Him, ſet Her
at a greater diſtance from His Religion, (the onely thing wherein their Souls were
not united) even the Barbarity of His Enemies who profeſſed it, yet were ſo irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
to Vertue, that they hated Her for Her Example of Love and Loyalty to Him.
While He was committing Her to the mercy of the Winds and Waves, that. She
might eſcape the Cruelty of more unquiet and faithleſs men, they proſecute Him with
their diſtaſteful Addreſſes, and the <hi>Canterbury</hi> preſent Him with a Bill for taking away
Biſhops Votes in Parliament. Which having been caſt out of the Houſe of Peers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times before, ought not by the Courſe and Order of Parliament to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
again the ſame Seſſion. But the Faction had now uſed their accuſtomed <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi>
the <hi>Tumult,</hi> and it was then paſſed by the Lords, and brought hither together
with ſome obſcure Threats, that if it were not ſigned, the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to depart. (By ſuch impious Violences did they make way for that which they
call'd <hi>Reformation.</hi>) This His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſigns, (though after it made a part of His pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential
Confeſſions to God) in hopes that the Bill being once conſented to, the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Faction, which with ſo great Violence purſued an abſolute Deſtruction of
the Eccleſiaſtical Government, would be abated, as having advanced ſo far in their
Deſign to weaken the <hi>King</hi>'s Power in that Houſe by the loſs of ſo many Voices,
which would have been always on that ſide where Equity and Conſcience did moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
But He ſoon found the <hi>Demagogues</hi> had not ſo much Ingenuity as to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with, and they made this but a ſtep to the Overthrow of that which He
deſigned to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>When His <hi>Majesty</hi> was come back as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> He met with many Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
how averſe the Faction was to Peace, and that their Proceedings were raiſed to
a Level with their Principles, which ſome of them publiſhed, <hi>That the Alteration they
did intend, and which was neceſſary both in Church and State, must be made by Blood.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they endeavoured by their Calumnies to create an Hatred of Him, and to deſpoil
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60710:18"/>
Him of all the hopeful Effects of His Condeſcenſions. For <hi>when a Prince is once hated,
his Benefits do him no leſs hurt than Injuries.</hi> In order to this, Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> had publickly
charged Him with a Connivence at leaſt, if not with the Contrivance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
becauſe many Papiſts had His <hi>Majeſties</hi> immediate Warrant for their tranſport
thither. This the <hi>King</hi> requires ſatisfaction for, ſhewing the Falſhood and Malice of
the Defamer, by giving an Account of the date of the ſeveral Warrants. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo far prevailed as to make it a Publick Sin, and the Houſe was perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and acknowledge it to be their common ſenſe. Many others had uttered ſeditious
Speeches in the Houſe, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Marten,</hi> a man of all Uncleanneſſes, a publick
contemner of Religion and Honeſty, that had waſted a large Patrimony (which he
had likewiſe unjuſtly mortgaged to ſeveral and different Creditors) in the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Luſts, and ſought a greater licence and freſh ſupplies for them by the ruine of the
State; at which he was powerful, being of as impure and laſcivious a Wit as he was
of Life, wherewith he uſed to prophane God and His Vicegerents: yet ſerving the
ends of Confuſion, had his name among the Catalogue of thoſe that were to do the
<hi>Work of the Lord.</hi> Beſides the attempts upon His Honour, they endeavour another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
His Family, and to ſeize upon the <hi>Prince.</hi> Which the <hi>King,</hi> hearing, ſends for
Him and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and immediately removes to <hi>Theobalds</hi> in order to His
journey towards the North, where He intended to ſettle His abode, till he ſaw what
Iſſue this Storm would have.</p>
                  <p>This removal of the <hi>King</hi> was variouſly cenſured. <hi rend="margQuotes">Some thought it unadviſedly
done, to withdraw ſo far from <hi>London,</hi> to leave His chief City wholly to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and expoſe His Friends there to the Impoſtures and Injuries of his Enemies.
Others, eſpecially the friends of the Faction, defamed it as a preparing Himſelf for
that War which followed. But others concluded it as an act of Neceſſity, and
where there was no choice for Prudence. For when He had paſſed more obliging
Acts, and parted with ſo much of His Prerogative and ſo many undoubted Rights
of His Crown, as could not be equalled by the Grants of all His Predeceſſors, yet
He found that He had effected nothing more by giving, than to make the Faction
more eagerly deſire what they knew He muſt in Honour and Conſcience deny; and
that the People were ſo bewitched as not to ſee, <hi>it is ſafer to truſt Him who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a leſs degree of Power, than thoſe whoſe ambition and avarice knew no bounds:</hi>
Who being thus deluded as ſo far to adminiſter to the Luſts of their Diſturbers,
would not fail their aſſiſtance to ſeize upon His Perſon, unleſs in time He did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for His Liberty. Nor could it be imagined that He meditated a War, who to
make His people happy (if they had not deſpiſed their own Mercies) had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Himſelf of a power to manage it. For beſides thoſe Acts formerly mentioned,
He had ſigned many other as prejudicial to ſuch an undertaking. For He had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Acts againſt His own power of Impreſſing Souldiers, His right to Tonnage and
Poundage, the Stannary Courts, Clerk of the Market, the Preſidial Courts in the
North, and Marches of <hi>Wales;</hi> whereby He had not only diminiſhed His Greatneſs,
and that Reverence which was due to the Crown, but alſo ſo ſtreightned His Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
as it was not able to maintain <hi>Diſcipline, without which no hopes of Victory, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in a Civil War.</hi> Beſides, His Enemies in every County had injured His <hi>Fame,</hi>
which <hi>is of great moment in the deciding Controverſies by the Sword;</hi> and the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which is the grand Treaſury of the Wealth and Strength of the whole Nation,
was now enſlaved by the Rabble to their commands. All which conſiderations as
they could not eſcape ſo Wiſe a Prince, ſo would they not permit the Deſigns of War,
eſpecially in that Breaſt, to which it was equally miſerable to ſuffer the ſpilling of
His Subjects blood, as to expoſe Himſelf to Ruine. So that His departure from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was not of Deſign, but Neceſſity, nor was there in it more of Fear than Shame;
for He could not longer endure thoſe deteſtable <hi>Spectacula,</hi> in which Tumults like
Beaſts were let looſe to aſſault the Majeſty of Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus provides for His Liberty, the Faction proceed to uſurp the
<hi>Militia,</hi> which His Majeſty had denied, and the Lords were aſhamed to ask: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they privately incourage their Partiſans in all the Cities and Boroughs where they
were moſt powerfull, to appoint Muſters, to arm and train their youth, and module
them into Companies; which afterwards (though contrary to the Law) they move
the Lower Houſe to vote Legal, and to make an Order in the name of the Parliament
for the conſtituting of Deputies to the ſame purpoſe in every County: and at laſt, by
the Tumults which they raiſed, the Threats they uſed to divulge the names of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Lords, and ſecret promiſes to ſome others (for Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> told the Earl of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60710:18"/>
he muſt look for no Preferment unleſs he joyned with them</hi>) they prevailed upon the
Houſe of Peers, when many of the moſt eminent were abſent, to joyn in a Petition
for the <hi>Militia,</hi> upon pretence of great Dangers at home, and more prodigious terrors
from abroad, pretending that by Intelligence from <hi>Paris, Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> they were
aſſured of great deſigns to overthrow the Parliament, together with the Proteſtant
Religion; (whoſe fate and Intereſt they would have it imagined, was ſo twiſted with
theirs, that like thoſe Twins they could not laugh nor grieve but in Conjunction.)
This Paper being preſented to His Majeſty, whoſe Soul was wholly devoted to Peace,
when it did not betray Religion and the Truſt Heaven had committed unto Him, He
propoſes to them Expedients whereby they might be aſſociated with Him in the Power
of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which Honour and Conſcience forbad Him to deveſt Himſelf wholly
of, and paſſionately adjures them to lay aſide their vain and empty Terrors, whereby
they diſtracted and divided the People, not ſuffering them to enjoy the Peace and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Conceſſions wherein He had exceeded the Goodneſs of all His Predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>But they, who had projected to themſelves the whole Power, would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a Partner in it, and therefore deſpiſing His Indulgence, and neglecting His
Admonitions, the next day in furious Votes declared themſelves ſole Maſters of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia:</hi>
and to make the People believe there was truth in their falſe Fears, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſtrict Watches to be kept in all ſuſpected places, Beacons to be new ſet up, the
Sea-marks to be watched, and the Navy to be new rigged and fitted for the Sea. New
Plots were alſo diſcovered, and ſtrange and unheard-of Counſels to murder the moſt
Eminent Patriots are brought to light. <hi>A Taylor in a ditch hears ſome deſperate Cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
contriving the Death of Mr.</hi> Pym. <hi>A Plaiſter alſo taken from a Plague-ſore was ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe to the ſame perſon, that the Infection firſt ſeiſing on a Member of the quickeſt
ſenſes, might thence more impetuouſly diffuſe it ſelf upon all the moſt Grave Senators.</hi> Such
like plots as theſe, and whatſoever could be deviſed, were publiſhed to make the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
think thoſe demands of the Faction ſeem modeſt, (their dangers being ſo great)
which were very unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould at His coming into the North make uſe of that Magazine
at <hi>Hull</hi> (which at His own Charges He had provided for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition) for
His own defence, the Faction, to ſecure that and the Town for their future purpoſes,
ſend down Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> without any Order or Commiſſion from either Houſe of
Parliament, to ſeiſe on them. This man of a fury and impudence equal to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
when the <hi>King,</hi> petitioned by the Gentlemen of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> to employ thoſe Arms
and that Ammunition for the Safety and Peace of that County, (where ſome of the
Factious Members of Parliament had begun to form the like Seditions with thoſe of
<hi>London,</hi>)<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1642</label> would have entred <hi>Hull, April</hi> 23. inſolently ſhut the Gates upon Him,
and would not permit Him, though with but twenty Attendants, for He offered to
leave the Guard of Noblemen and Gentlemen which followed Him without. The <hi>King</hi>
thereupon proclaims him Traitor, and by Letters complains of the Indignity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Satisfaction. But the Faction rendred the Act ſo glorious, that the Houſe of
Commons by their Votes approved what he had done without their Command, and
clamoured that the <hi>King</hi> had done them an injury, in proclaiming ſo innocent a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Traitor: Ordered the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to whom they had committed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Navy, to land ſome men out of the Ships at <hi>Hull,</hi> and to tranſport the
Magazine there from thence to <hi>London.</hi> An Order of Aſſiſtance was alſo given to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Confidents, as a Committee of both Houſes to reſide at <hi>Hull,</hi> and the
Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> were commanded to execute their commands. Beſides,
they ſent a Commiſſion to <hi>Hotham,</hi> to proſecute the Inſolencies he had begun, and
kindle that War which took fire on the whole Nation, and in a ſhort ſpace conſumed
him and his Son, who were executed by the Inſtructors of his Villany: For he fell
under the ſame Fate which attends all the Inſtruments of Great Crimes, to be Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſuſpected by thoſe that made uſe of them. Therefore they gave ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> as did conclude the diminution, and ſubmiſſion of
<hi>Hotham</hi> to his Commands. This cauſed him to reflect with grief and madneſs upon
his firſt miniſtery to the Faction, which appeared every day more monſtrous to his
Conſcience, being now ſpoiled of that Grandeur that he hoped would have been its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and awakened by thoſe Deſolations in the whole Kingdom which followed it,
and were but as the Copies of his Original Treaſon. Therefore he thought to expiate
his former guilt by ſurrendring the Town to Him from whom he had detained it.
But his practices were diſcovered to the Faction by One whom they had ſent thither
in pretence to preach the Goſpel, but in truth ſecretly to ſearch into the intrigues of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60710:19"/>
his Counſels: ſo that he periſhed in his deſign, being neither ſtout nor wiſe enough
in juſt enterpriſes, nor of a pertinancy ſufficient for a proſperous Perfidiouſneſs. And
although in his Ruine the <hi>King</hi> obſerved how great a draught was offered to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thirſt of Revenge, yet He did truly bewail him: and indeed he was ſo much the
more to be pitied, becauſe his cruel Maſters deluded him to a ſilence of their black Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
with a falſe hope of Life till the Ax was upon his Neck. So betraying his Soul
to a ſurpriſe by his Spiritual enemies, as his pretended Spiritual Guides had done his
Body to them.</p>
                  <p>The Inſolency of <hi>Hotham,</hi> who acted according to his Inſtructions and late Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
beginning acts not uſual in Peace, nor juſtifiable by Law, (for he iſſued out
Warrants for the Trained Bands to march into <hi>Hull</hi> with their Arms, where he forced
them to leave them, and nakedly return to their homes, that ſo they might be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his Violence) and the practices of the Committee which were ſent down into
the North, to debauch the People in their Loyalty, made the <hi>King</hi> intend His own
Security by a Guard; which the Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> that were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the Injury offered to their Prince, did willingly and readily make up. No
ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> expreſſed His intention of ſuch a Guard, but the Faction, who
were watchful of all opportunities of beginning a War, and ingaging thoſe that either
through Fear or Weakneſs had hitherto ſubmitted to their Impoſtures, in a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
guilt, (for now the greateſt part of the Peers, who were of the moſt ancient
Families and nobleſt Fortunes, and a very great number of the Houſe of Commons,
Perſons of juſt hopes and fair Eſtates, who perceiving the deſigns of the Diſturbers,
ſcorned any longer to be their Slaves, yet not thinking it ſafe to provoke the fury of
the Vulgar Tumults by a preſent oppoſition, had withdrawn from the Parliament to
follow the <hi>King</hi> and His Fortune, and every day ſome more were ſtill falling off) took
this occaſion to commence our Miſeries, and open thoſe Sluces of Blood which pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the whole Kingdom. For upon the firſt Intelligence of it they filled the Houſe of
Commons and the City with Clamours, that <hi>His Majeſty had now taken Arms to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of them and the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and that <hi>they were not any longer to think the
Happineſs of the Kingdom did depend upon the</hi> King, <hi>or any of the Regal Branches of that
Stock; that it would argue no want either of Duty or Modeſty, if they ſhould depoſe Him.</hi>
By theſe Harangues they ſo heated the Parliament, that was now more penurious than
before in perſons of Honour and Conſcience, to ſuch a degree of Fury, that unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
how they themſelves for eight months before upon impoſſible Fears and improbable
Jealouſies had taken a Guard, they Reſolved upon the Queſtion, that the <hi>King by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to himſelf ſuch a Guard did intend to levy War againſt the Parliament.</hi> With an
equal fury they iſſue out Commiſſions into all parts of the Kingdom, and appoint cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
days for all the Trained Bands to be put into a poſture of War, ſending down
ſome of their Members to ſee to the execution of theſe Commands, and to ſeiſe on
the Magazines in the ſeveral Counties.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe their violent and unjuſt attempts the <hi>King</hi> firſt oppoſes the Law, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Declarations manifeſts the Power of Arms to be the ancient and undoubted
Right of the Crown, by many Proclamations charges all men under the Crime and
Penalties of Treaſon to forbear the Execution of thoſe Ordinances which were publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to licenſe their Rebellion, and anſwers with a wonderful Diligence and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
all the fictious Pretenſions of the Parliament to that Power, in their ſeveral
Remonſtrances. But though the <hi>King</hi> had in the judgment of all underſtanding and
unintereſſed perſons the Juſter Cauſe, and the more powerful Pen, yet the Faction's
<hi>Haſt, which is moſt eſſicacious in civil Diſcords,</hi> the Slanders they had raiſed of Him, and
impreſſed in the minds of the People, the terrors of that Arbitrary Power which the
Houſe of Commons had a long while exerciſed in the vexatious proſecution of all ſuch
as did oppoſe their imperious Reſolves, (for they would by their Meſſengers ſend for
the Great Earls and Prime Barons of the Kingdom as Rogues and Felons, and weary
them and others with a tedious and chargeable Attendance, oppreſs them with heavy
and unproportionable Cenſures, and reſtrain them by Illegal Impriſonments) and
the hopes of licence and ſpoil in the ruine of Church and State, had ſo preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the Minds of the inferiour Multitude, that neither Law nor Religion could
have the leaſt conſideration in their practices; and thoſe Perſons whom His Majeſty
appointed as Commiſſioners of <hi>Array,</hi> in few places found that Obedience which was
due to the juſt Commands of a Gracious Prince, who vainly expected that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Juſtice in others which Himſelf gave.</p>
                  <p>After the experience of their Power in theſe their Succeſſes at Land, and having
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60710:19"/>
gotten the whole Navy at Sea, being made Maſters of the moſt and greateſt Strengths
of the Kingdom, they then thought it might be ſafe for them to publiſh the aims and
ends of their moſt deſtructive deſigns; which if ſooner manifeſted, when the <hi>King</hi>
by his Meſſage of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> from <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, adviſed them <hi>to preſcribe the
limits of their Privileges, give full Boundaries to His own Power, and propoſe what was in
their judgments proper to make the People happy; and moſt religiouſly promiſed an equal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of theirs and the Peoples Rights as of His own, and what was for the Publick good
ſhould not be obſtructed for His Particular Emolument;</hi> they had juſtly drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
all that popular hatred which they endeavoured to fling upon the <hi>King,</hi> and
had been buried under thoſe ruines which they projected for the Grave of Majeſty.
But then the Faction confided not ſo much in their own force, nor were the Vulgar
then ſo blinded with fury as to chuſe their own deſtruction: and therefore to that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of Peace nothing was returned but Complaints, that <hi>by ſuch Adviſoes their Counſels
were diſturbed, that it was contrary to their unbounded Privileges to be minded of what was
neceſſary.</hi> But now they were furniſhed with a Power equal to their Ambition, they
thought it expedient to confirm their newly-gotten Empire with ſome pretenſions to
Peace; but with a great deal of Caution, that the affectation of it might not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
them of their hopes, which were all built upon War and Confuſion. Therefore
they formed the Conditions ſuch as the <hi>King</hi> could not in Honour or Conſcience grant
them, nor expect Peace by them. Or if He did, they ſhould be inſtated in ſuch a
Grandeur, that they might reap for themſelves all the reproachful Honours and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
gains of an Arbitrary Power, the thing they aimed at, and leave the <hi>King</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with ſhame and contempt for their miſcarriages in Government. Theſe
Conditions were digeſted into Nineteen Propoſitions; which when preſented to the
<hi>King,</hi> He ſaw by an aſſent to them He ſhould be concluded to have depoſed Himſelf,
and be but as an helpleſs and idle Spectator of the Miſeries ſuch Tyrants would bring
upon the People whom God had committed to His Truſt. Therefore He gave them
that denial which they really deſired and expected, and adjuſts His refuſal in a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
wherein He ſets forth the Injuſtice of each Propoſition. His Anſwer He ſent
by the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> and Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Perſons of great Integrity and
Prudence, with Inſtructions to treat in the Houſe of Peers upon more equal Conditions.</p>
                  <p>But it behoved the Faction not to let the Kingdom ſee any way to Peace, therefore
denying any admittance to thoſe Lords, before ever the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer could publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover who were the obſtructours of the Peoples quiet, they Ordered a Collection
to be made of Money and Plate, to maintain Horſe, Horſe-men and Arms for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
War. The ſpecious Pretences for which were <hi>the Safety of the King's Perſon,
and the taking Him out of the hands of Evil Counſellors, the Defence of the Privileges of
Parliament, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the maintenance of the ancient
Laws of the Land.</hi> Such inviting cauſes as theſe inflamed the Minds of the Multitude,
and filled them with more aiery hopes of Victory than the noiſe of Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.
But that which was moſt powerful were the Sermons of ſuch who, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with the preſent Eccleſiaſtical Government, were promiſed the richeſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and a partage of the Revenues which belonged to Biſhops, Deans and Chapiters.
Theſe from their Pulpits proclaimed War in the Name of Chriſt the Prince of Peace,
and whatſoever was contributed to the ſpilling of the Blood of the Wicked, was to build
up the Throne of the meekeſt Lamb; and beſides the ſatisfaction they were to expect
from the Publick Faith, which the Parliament promiſed, there was a larger Intereſt
to be doubled upon them in the Kingdom of Saints that was now approaching. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by theſe Artifices and Impoſtures, People of all Conditions and all Sexes, ſome
carried by a ſecret Inſtinct, others hurried by ſome furious Zeal, and a laſt ſort led by
Covetouſneſs, caſt into this Holy Treaſury the Banck for Blood, all the Ornaments of
their Family, all their Silver Veſſels, even to their Spoons, with the Pledges of their
firſt Love, their Marriage-rings; and the younger Females ſpared not their Thimbles
and Bodkins, the obliging Gifts of their <hi>Inamorato's,</hi> from being a part of the Price of
Blood. But while theſe Preparations were made at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>York</hi> declares
againſt the Scandal, that <hi>He intended to Levy War againſt the Parliament,</hi> calling God
to witneſs how far His deſires and thoughts were from it; and alſo thoſe many Lords
who were Witneſſes of His Counſels and Actions, do publiſh to the World by a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſubſcribed with all their Names, to the number of Forty and odd, that <hi>they ſaw
not any colour of Preparations or Counſels that might reaſonably beget the belief of any ſuch
Deſign, and were fully perſwaded that He had no ſuch intention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all was in vain, for the Faction choſe that the People ſhould be rather guilty of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60710:20"/>
committing Rebellion, that only of favouring the Contrivers of it, and decreed to
try whether by a proſperous Succeſs they could change their Crimes to Vertue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haſtened all they could to raiſe Horſe and Foot to form an Army equal to
their Uſurpation: which was not difficult for them to do, for they being Maſters of
<hi>London,</hi> whoſe multitudes deſirous of Novelty, were eaſily amaſſed for any enterpriſe,
eſpecially when the entring into this Warfare, might make the Servant freer than
his Maſter, (for ſuch was the Licence was indulged to thoſe Youths that would ſerve
the Cauſe) 20000 were ſooner gathered that the <hi>King</hi> could get 500. The City
alſo could afford them more Ordnance than the <hi>King</hi> could promiſe to Himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Muskets: and to pay their Souldiers, beſides the vaſt ſumms that were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for <hi>Ireland</hi> (which though they by their own Act had decreed ſhould not be uſed
for any other enterpriſe, yet now diſpenſe with their Faith, and imploy it to make
<hi>England</hi> as miſerable as that Iſland) and the Contributions of the deluded Souls for
this War; they ſeized alſo upon the Revenues of the <hi>King, Queen, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
and plunder the Houſes of thoſe Lords and Gentlemen whom they ſuſpected to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe. And in contemplation of theſe advantages, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
their credulous Party an undoubted Victory, and to lead Majeſty Captive in
Triumph through <hi>London</hi> within a Month, by the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom
they appointed General.</p>
                  <p>Thus did they drive that Juſt and Gracious <hi>Prince</hi> to ſeek His Safety by neceſſary
Arms, ſince nothing worſe could befall Him after a ſtout, though unhappy Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
than He was to hope for in a tame Submiſſion to their Violence. Therefore
though He perfectly abhorred thoſe Sins which are the Conſequences of War, yet
He wanted not Courage to attempt at Victory, notwithſtanding it ſeemed almoſt
impoſſible againſt ſo well-appointed an Enemy. Therefore with an incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
moving from place to place, from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> from thence to <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and the Confines of <hi>Wales,</hi> by diſcovering thoſe Abilities with which His Soul
was richly fraught unto His deluded Subjects, He appeared not only worthy of
their Reverence, but of their Lives and Fortunes for His Defence; and in all places
incouraging the Good with His Commendations, exciting the fearful by His Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
diſſembling the Imperfections of His Friends, but alwaies praiſing their Vertues,
He ſo prevailed upon thoſe who were not Men of many Times, nor by a former
Guilt debauch'd to Inhumanity, that He had quickly contracted an Army greater than
His Enemies expected, and which was every day increaſed by thoſe Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who refuſed to be polluted any longer with the practices of the Faction by
ſitting among them, and being Perſons of large Fortunes had raiſed their Friends and
Tenants to ſuccour that Majeſty that now laboured under an Eclipſe. Moſt Men
being moved with Pity and Shame to ſee their Prince, whoſe former Reign had made
them wanton in Plenty, to be driven from His own Palaces, and concluded under a
want of Bread, to be neceſſitated to implore their Aid, for the Preſervation of His and
their Rights. So that notwithſtanding all the Impoſtures of the Faction and the
Corruptions of the Age, there were many great Examples of Loyalty and Vertue.
Many Noble Perſons did almoſt impoveriſh themſelves to ſupply the <hi>King</hi> with Men
and Money. Some Private Men made their way through numerous dangers to joyn
with the fight under His Colours. Many great Ladies and vertuous Matrons parted
with the Ornaments of their Sex to relieve His wants, and ſome bravely defended
their Houſes in His Cauſe when their Lords were otherwhere ſeeking Honour in His
ſervice. Both the Univerſities freely devoted their Plate to ſuccour their Prince, the
Supreme Patron and Incourager of all Learning; and the Queen pawned Her Jewels
to provide neceſſaries for the Safety of Her Husband. Which Duty of Hers, though it
deſerved the Honour of all Ages, was branded by the Demagogues with the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>This ſudden and unexpected growth of the Strength of the <hi>King</hi> after ſo many
years of Slanders, and ſuch induſtrious Plots to make him odious and contemptible,
raiſed the admiration of all Men, and the fears of the credulous Party who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up their Faith to the Faction, when they repreſented the <hi>King</hi> guilty of ſo much
Folly and Vice (and ſome corrupted Citizens had repreſented Him as a Prodigie of
both in a Scene at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> an Art uſed by Jeſuites to impreſs more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Calumny,) that they could not imagine any Perſon of Prudence or Conſcience
would appear in His Service, and they expected every day when, deſerted by all as
a Monſter, He ſhould in Chains deliver Himſelf up to the Commands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi rend="margQuotes">Some attributed this ſtrange increaſe in power to <hi>the natural Affection of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60710:20"/>
Engliſh to their Lawful Sovereign, from whom though the Arts and Impulſes of Seditiouc
Demagogues may a while eſtrange and divorce their minds, yet their Genius will irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at laſt force them to their firſt Love;</hi> and therefore they urged the ſaying of that
Obſerving States-man, that <hi>if the Crown of</hi> England <hi>were placed but on a Hedge-ſtake,
he would be on that ſide where the Crown was.</hi> Others referred it to the full evidence
of the wickedneſs of His Adverſaries, for their Counſels were now diſcovered, and
their Ends manifeſt, not to maintain the common Liberty, which was equally
hateful to them as Tyranny when it was not in their hands, but to acquire a Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
and Power that might ſecure and adminiſter to their Luſts: and it was now
every where publiſhed what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hambden</hi> anſwered to one who inquired <hi>What
he did expect from the</hi> King; he replied, <hi>That He ſhould commit Himſelf and all that is
His to our Care.</hi> Others aſcribed it to the fears of ruine to thoſe numerous Families
and Myriads of People which the change of Government deſigned by the Parliament
muſt neceſſarily effect. But this, though it argued that <hi>Cauſe exceeding bad by
which ſo great a part of a Community is utterly deſtroyed, without any abſolute neceſſity for
preſerving the whole;</hi> yet made but an inconſiderable Addition to the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe
greateſt Power was built upon Perſons of the Nobleſt Extract and the faireſt Eſtates
in <hi>England,</hi> of which they could not eaſily ſuſpect to be deveſted without an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
overthrow of all the Laws of Right and Wrong, which nevertheleſs was to
be feared by their invaſions on the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt undoubted Rights. For <hi>when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
it ſelf is aſſaulted, there can be no ſecurity for private Fortunes; and thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
upon deſign from the paths of Equity, will never reſt till they come to the Extremity
of Injuſtice;</hi> as theſe afterwards did. Beſides thoſe that imputed the ſpeedy amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of theſe Forces to the Equity of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe, His moſt Powerful Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
indeſatigable Induſtry, and moſt Obliging Converſe; there were another
ſort that, ſuſpending their Judgments till all the Scenes of War were paſſed, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all into the Providence of God: Who though He were pleaſed to ſingle Him out
of all the Kings of the Earth as the fitteſt Champion to wreſtle with Adverſity, and
to make Him glorious by <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which <hi>being well born truly prove men Great;</hi>
yet would He furniſh Him (almoſt by a Miracle) likewiſe with ſuch Advantages,
in the conduct of which His Prudence and Magnanimity might evidence that He
did deſerve Propſerity, and by clearing up even this way His eminent Vertues, warn
the following Ages from a Credulity to unquiet Perſons, ſince the beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
was thus infamouſly ſlandered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all theſe concurring Cauſes, each one in their Way and Order, did the
<hi>King</hi>'s Strength ſo far increaſe, as that He won many Battles, and was not far from
Conqueſt in the Whole War; had not God ſeen fit to afflict this ſinful Nation with
Numerous and moſt Impious Tyrants, and make us feel, that <hi>no Oppreſſions are ſo
unſupportable as thoſe which are impoſed by ſuch as have made the higheſt Pretenſions to
Liberty:</hi> of which we had bitter experience after the War was finiſhed that was now
begun. For there had been ſome ſlight Conflicts ere this in the ſeveral Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Commiſſioners of <hi>Array</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> with various Succeſſes; which
require juſt Volumes and compleat Hiſtories to relate, and cannot be comprehended
in the ſhort View of the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, where it is only intended to ſpeak of thoſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
in which the King in Perſon gave ſufficient evidence of His Wiſdom and Valour.
The firſt of which was at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> on <hi>Oct.</hi> 23. For the <hi>King</hi> had no ſooner gotten a
conſiderable Force, though not equal to thoſe of His Enemies, but He matched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>London,</hi> and in His way thither met with <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army that were come from
thence to take Him. The <hi>King</hi> having viewed their Army by a Proſpective-glaſs
from the top of that Hill, and being asked afterwards by His Officers what He meant
to do, <hi>To give them battle</hi> (ſaid He with a preſent Courage) <hi>it is the firſt time I ever
ſaw the Rebels in a Body: God, and good Mens Prayers to Him, aſſist the Justice of My
Cauſe:</hi> and immediately prepared for the Fight; which was acted with ſuch a Fury,
that near 6000 were ſlain (according to the common account, but ſome ſay a far
leſs number) were ſlain upon the place. Night concluded this Battle, which had
comprehended the whole War, had not the <hi>King</hi>'s prevailing Horſe preferr'd the
Spoils to Victory, and left the Enemy ſome advantage to diſpute for her. But the
<hi>King</hi> had all the faireſt marks of her Favour. For though He had loſt His General,
yet he kept the Field, poſſeſſed the dead Bodies, opened His way toward <hi>London,</hi>
and in the ſight of ſome part of the Army of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (who accounted it a Victory
that He was not totally routed and killed,) took <hi>Banbury,</hi> and entred Triumphantly
into <hi>Oxford</hi> (which He had deſigned for His Winter-quarters) with 150 Colours
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60710:21"/>
taken in fight. And having aſſured that place, He advances towards <hi>London,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten before Him, and diſpoſed his baffled Regiments within 10
Miles of the City; yet the King fell upon two Regiments of them at <hi>Brainford,</hi>
took 500 Priſoners, and ſunk their Ordnance. From thence intending to draw nearer
<hi>London,</hi> He had intelligence, that the <hi>City</hi> had powred forth all their Auxiliaries to
re-inforce <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Troops; to which being unwilling to oppoſe His Souldiers weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their March, nor thinking it ſafe to force an Enemy to fight upon <hi>Neceſſity,</hi>
which <hi>inſpires a more than Ordinary Fury,</hi> He retreats to <hi>Oxford,</hi> having taught His
Enemies, that He was not eaſily to be overcome.</p>
                  <p>For in the management of this Battle He did not only undeceive the abuſed World
of thoſe Slanders which His Enemies had polluted Him with, but He exceeded that
Opinion His own Party had of His Abilities, and though He parted from <hi>London</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unexperienced in Martial Affairs, yet at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> He appeared a moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Commander. His Valour was alſo equal to His Prudence, and He could as well
endure Labours as deſpiſe Dangers. And by a communication of toils, encouraged His
Souldiers to keep the Field all the Night, when they ſaw He refuſed the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Bed; for He ſought no other Shelter from the injuries of the Air than His
own Coach. Theſe Vertues and this Succeſs made ſuch an impreſſion on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that though they took all courſes to hide the Infamy of their worſted Army,
yet in more humble Expreſſions than formerly they Petitioned the <hi>King</hi> for a Treaty
of Peace, which His Majeſty very earneſtly embraced. But the Faction, who were
frighted with theſe Tendencies to an Accommodation, cauſe ſome of the City to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
againſt it, and to make proffer of their Lives and Fortunes for the proſecution
of the War. Encouraged by this, they form their Propoſitions like the Commands
of Conquerours, and ſo ſtreighten the Power and time of their Commiſſioners, that
the Treaty at <hi>Oxford</hi> became fruitleſs, which there had taken up all the <hi>King</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
this Winter, though abroad His Forces were buſie in ſeveral Parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not without Honour.</p>

that very many of them were preparing to quit the Kingdom: and had the

of all diſcerning men, then finiſhed the War with Glory. But here He lay ſo long
till <hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten a Recruit from <hi>London,</hi> and came time enough to Relieve the
Town; though in his Return the <hi>King</hi> neceſſitated him to fight, worſted him near
<hi>Newbery,</hi> and ſo bravely followed him the next day, that He forced the Parliaments
Horſe which were left in the Reer to ſeek their ſafety by making their way over a

equally dexterous at the Pen and Sword, had won ſome Wreaths in thoſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
that were to be managed by Reaſon, and was eminent in all the Generous parts
of Learning, above any of his Fortune and Dignity. After this Encounter the <hi>King</hi>
returns to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to conſult with thoſe Members of both Houſes that had left the
Impoſtures and Tumults at <hi>London,</hi> to joyn with Him for the Common Benefit, who
being as to the Peers the far greater, and as to the Commons an equal Number with
thoſe at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> they aſſumed the Name and Authority of Parliament, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated

                  <p>For though they pretended ſo highly to God's Cauſe, as if they had the certainty

hands to Heaven, wiſhed <hi>they might rot to his body before he died, if ever he ſhould heave
them up hereafter, or draw his Sword, against ſo gude a King,</hi>) drew that people once
more into Rebellion againſt their Prince; and to make them more eager, and think
the Enterprize eaſie, they firſt raiſed a Report that the <hi>King</hi> was deſerted by moſt
of His Nobility.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> having by a Letter moved the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to endeavour
Peace, did alſo declare againſt this Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> by another Letter ſent to
them, in which alſo they acquaint them with the falſeneſs of their officious Lye, and
ſhew how inconſiderable a Number of Lords were with thoſe that invited them in.
The <hi>King</hi> Himſelf writes alſo to put them in mind of their ſeveral Ingagements to
be Quiet. But with an Inſolency fit for moſt perjured Souls, they commanded the
Letters to be burned by the hand of the Hangman. A more ſecret falſhood He alſo
found in the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> whoſe Treaſons now came to be more ſuſpected.
For His <hi>Majeſty</hi> having written to him, to uſe all his Power and Intereſt to keep his
Country-men at home, (which had not been difficult for one of his Grandeur
in that unquiet Nation) he by ſome ſecret arts doth more inflame them; and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Perfidiouſneſs, flies from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as ſeeking a ſhelter for his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty;
but indeed to be a Spy in the <hi>King</hi>'s Counſels. But his Treaſons had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripp'd
him and his Brother, the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> who came with him, therefore
they were both forbidden the Court. <hi>Lanerick</hi> not willing to tarry till a further Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
gets out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> flies to thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> and by them was employed in the
<hi>Scotch Army;</hi> which made <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Treachery more evident, and he was ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle. But the diſhonour of that Nation was in a great meaſure
repaired by the Gallantry and Faithfulneſs of the Marqueſs <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> who being
Commiſſion'd by the <hi>King,</hi> with an incredible Induſtry by ſmall numbers of men won
many Battels, and overthrew well-formed Armies: and had not the Fate of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
which was to be betrayed by thoſe He truſted, been likewiſe common to him, he
had forced that Nation to Juſtice and Quiet.</p>
                  <p>But ere <hi>Montroſſe</hi> could get his Commiſſion, the <hi>Scots</hi> were entred into <hi>England:</hi>
whoſe coming that it might be leſs odious to the People, who now grew cold in their
Zeal to the Cauſe, and ſaw themſelves deluded into ſo continued Dangers, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
make uſe of ſuch Frauds as ſhould make the People either think them neceſſary
Aſſiſtances, or might divert their Thoughts from apprehending the Miſeries they
brought with them to this Nation; therefore they invent new Slanders of the <hi>King</hi>
and His Party. <hi>That His Majesty did intend to tranſlate Monarchy into a Tyranny:
that He would ſeize upon all their Estates who had any way oppoſed Him, and make their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Slaves: and that there was no hope of Pardon from Him, who was ſo mercileſs: that
He would take away all their Liberties and Privileges as forfeited, destroy the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and introduce Popery, which at</hi> Oxford <hi>He did practiſe Himſelf, and that all men
muſt be forced to go to Maſs.</hi> As for His Party, they ſet them out to be ſuch Monſters,
that the lower ſort of People doubted whether the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> had the ſhapes of men.
For ſad Relations were Printed and Publiſhed of their Inhumanity and barbarous
Murders: <hi>That they did feaſt upon the Fleſh of Men, and that they fed their Dogs and their
Horſes with the ſame Diet, to make them more fierce for the blood of the Godly Party: that
no man's houſe was ſo poor and mean that a</hi> Cavalier <hi>would think beneath his Rapine.</hi>
Thus they wrought upon the Melancholy Spirits of ſome by Fear. For thoſe of a
Moroſe and Cholerick temper they had proper Divertiſements: they permitted to
them a tumultuary Reformation, to pull down the Pictures and Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Saints;</hi> which with great Solemnity they committed to the
Flames, that they might ſuffer as it were another Martyrdom. All Croſſes, though
ſet up for Ornament and Uſe in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and other places, they pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down: they invade the Churches, and there deface what their Humour or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
would call Superſtition, pull down the Organs, tear the Surplices; and all this
was ſuffered to pleaſe the Rabble, who delight in Violences and ſuch Oſtentations of
their Fury, and to make them in ſomething or other guilty, that they might deſpair
of Pardon.</p>
                  <p>For others, who were to be wrought upon by Religion, they entertain them with
Faſts, publick Thankſgivings for ſlight Victories, and ſolemn Spiritual Meetings
(as they called them;) where whatſoever the Faction dictated, was commended by
the Speakers to their unwary Hearers as the Oracles of Heaven: and being thus
wrapp'd up in thoſe true Delights which accompany the Worſhip of God, they were
ſecurely ſwallowed by them, as Poyſon when it is offered in a Sacramental Chalice.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60710:22"/>
To pleaſe their Miniſters whom hitherto they had uſed as their Properties and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Arts, Presbytery is ſet up, that they alſo might have an Imaginary
Empire: but it was not intended they ſhould exerciſe it. For the Pretenſions of that
to a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> did ſo terrifie them who were reſolved againſt all Government
that was not ſubject unto or dependent on theirs, that they preſently raiſed all the
other Sects, <hi>Independents, Eraſtians,</hi> (who for the moſt part were Lawyers, that could
not endure to hear of any Thunderbolts of Excommunication, but what was heated
in their own Forges) <hi>Anabaptists, Seekers,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> (of which there were many
ſprung up, who ſeeing how Religion was abuſed to carnal and unjuſt Ends, began firſt
to deſpiſe that, and afterwards to deny God) to write and declame againſt this new
Polity, as the moſt ſevere and abſolute Tyranny under the Sun, and the Tenth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
But this ſeeming Modeſty of admitting a Church Government ſerved their
Ends for the preſent, till they could acquire a greater ſtrength; in confidence of which
they might ſlight the Terrors of the Law, and the Anathema's of the Church. The
Liturgy alſo was aboliſhed, under pretence of a Spiritual Liberty, for it was accuſed
of putting a reſtraint upon the Spirit; but in truth becauſe it had ſo frequent Offices
for the <hi>King.</hi> To theſe were added the Covenant, the Fetters of the <hi>Scotiſh Slavery:</hi>
this was to bind the whole Nation to the Intereſt of the Faction, and was uſed as the
<hi>Water of Jealouſie,</hi> to diſcover thoſe whom they did ſuſpect. Therefore all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
of what Sect ſoever, whether <hi>Independents</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take it themſelves, (becauſe it did oblige to the Preſervation of the <hi>King</hi>'s
Perſon and Authority) yet were as eager Impoſers of it as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (who in
ſimplicity urged it as the Fundamental Conſtitution of their Empire) upon all who
they thought would not proſtitute their Souls to their Deſigns, or had any thing fit to
be made their Spoils. And by this onely Engine, many thouſand Perſons and Families
were miſerably ruined, eſpecially of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>To oblige more faſtly thoſe that had no patience to expect, nor hopes to receive any
Reward for their Service againſt their <hi>Prince</hi> in the other life, and ſo would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the ſhews of Religion, but ſought more ſolid Encouragements in the Spoils
of it; the Lands of the Biſhops were expoſed to Sale, and that at ſuch eaſie Rates as
might invite the hazard of the Purchaſe, ſatiate their boundleſs Covetouſneſs, and
engage them in a pertinacious Faith to their Merchants. To cement all theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Humours in one common Pleaſure, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was prepared
for a Sacrifice, and about this time began his Tryal, which continued a whole Year,
being when the Houſes were at leiſure called by ſeveral Months and Weeks to anſwer
to his Charge, that by his frequent Paſſages, as a Priſoner, he might give a pleaſant
Diverſion to the <hi>Rabble, who are delighted with the Ruines and Misfortunes of Great Perſons,</hi>
and by their Injuries and Reproaches he might be reduced to ſuch a weakneſs of Spirit
as was not competent with the defence of his Cauſe. But his Cauſe and his Conſcience
were impregnable, and he overthrew their Slanders, though he could not their
Power.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Arts and Ways was the Winter ſpent to prepare for the Attempts of the
following Summer,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1644</label> wherein, though the Parliaments Forces encreaſed by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Succours had the Succeſs over ſeveral bodies of the Royalliſts, yet that ſmall Number
that followed the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, and were guided by His own Counſels and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
obtained two great Victories. For His Majeſty having once more provided for
the Safety of the Queen, (in ſending Her to <hi>Exceſter,</hi> there to lay down the burden
of Her Love, and from thence to ſeek for Shelter in <hi>France</hi>) taken (contrary to their
hopes) His laſt Farewel of Her, and left <hi>Oxford</hi> ſtrengthned againſt the Siege which
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> threatned that Place with, He with a ſmall
Party draws out, intending to form His Counſels according to the future Occurrences.
This made the Enemy divide, and <hi>Eſsex</hi> was deſigned to reduce the Weſt. But <hi>Waller,</hi>
with whom uſually went Sir <hi>Arthur Haſilrigge</hi> (a Perſon fitter to raiſe Seditious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
than manage Armies) was to hunt the <hi>King</hi> upon the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which He ſeemed to direct His Courſe. But hearing of the Reſolutions of
theſe two jealous Generals, He wheels about to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and from thence drew the
greateſt ſtrength of that Garriſon, and with that falling upon <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Cropredy-bridge,</hi>
obtained a great Victory; which would have been more prejudicial to the Enemy,
had not the Tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood reſtrained Him from proſecuting His
Succeſs to a greater Slaughter. But contenting Himſelf to have diverted Injuries from
His own Breaſt, He only uſed this Victory for an advantage to Peace, which in a
Letter from <hi>Eveſham, July</hi> 4. He moves the Parliament unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60710:22"/>
But the unquiet Criminals rendred it vain and fruitleſs, and repreſented to the
People their yet prevailing Forces in the North, and their Army in the Weſt, which
had now taken in ſome conſiderable places to their obedience. Therefore to remove
their Confidence in <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s power, the <hi>King</hi> follows him, and ſo cloſely purſues him,
that He drove him up into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and there did as it were beſiege him. During
which He ſent a Letter to him, which was ſeconded by another from the Lords
and Gentlemen in His Army, to ſollicite His endeavours for the Peace and Quiet of
the bleeding and waſted Kingdom. But it met not its deſired effect: Becauſe that
Earl either valued not that ſolid Glory of being the happy Author of a Nation's Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement;
or feared that his paſt Actions had wholly deſpoiled him of hopes of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in a return to Obedience, or knew that his Authority was not ſo great to put an
iſſue to thoſe Crimes which he had led others to commit. (<hi>For every inconſiderable
perſon may be powerful at Diſturbances, but to form Peace requires much Wiſdom and great
Vertues.</hi>) Which laſt was generally believed, for he had found and complained that
his Credit declined with the Faction, that they were diſtruſtful leſt their own Arts
might teach him to have no faith to them, becauſe he often ſollicited them to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the Kingdoms Diſtractions. Therefore making no return to thoſe Letters, he
provided for his own ſafety in a <hi>Cock-boat,</hi> and ignominiouſly deſerted his Army; of
which the Horſe, taking the advantage of a dark night, made their eſcape, but the
Commanders of the Foot did capitulate for their Lives, and left their Arms, Cannon,
Baggage and Ammunition, to the Diſpoſal of the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpeedy and prudent acquiſition of theſe two Victories ſhewed the <hi>King</hi> had
thoſe Abilities that might have inſerted Him in the Catalogue of the Braveſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and had not want of Succeſs in His following Enterpriſes clouded the Glory of
this Summer, He had been as eminent among the Maſters of War as He was among
the Sons of Peace, the Honour of which laſt He moſt eagerly thirſted, as rendring Him
moſt like that Majeſty He did repreſent. Therefore after this Victory, by a Letter from
<hi>Taveſtock, Sept.</hi> 8. He re-inforces that from <hi>Eveſham</hi> for an Accord with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being not tranſported from His Lenity by the Violence with which Victory uſes
to hurry humane breaſts to an inſolence. But He knew that <hi>Peace, though it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Conquered, yet it is glorious for the Conquerour.</hi> To buſie His Army while He
expected their Anſwer, and formed an Aſſociation in the Weſtern Counties, He ſits
down before <hi>Plymouth;</hi> but finding this Meſſage had an equal reception with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and that the Faction intended not to ſacrifice their ill-acquired Power and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Intereſts to the publick Tranquillity, He riſes from thence, and marches towards
<hi>London,</hi> from whence were by this time in the way to meet Him <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited,
and joyned with the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Forces that were now returned from
their Northern Services. And at <hi>Newbery</hi> both ſides joyn in an eager Fight, which
being varied with different ſucceſſes, in the ſeveral diviſions, each party drew off by
degrees, and neither found cauſe to boaſt of a Victory.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> being returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Parliament wearied with the Complaints
of the oppreſſed Nation, who now grew impatient under the Diſtractions, take into
Conſideration His Majeſty's two Meſſages for Peace, and ſent Propoſitions for it in
the name of the two Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> united by Solemn League
and Covenant. Which though they ſeemed the deſires of minds that intended nothing
leſs than the common Tranquillity, yet the <hi>King</hi> neglects them not, but hoping that
in a Treaty Commiſſioners might argue them into Reaſon, offers it, which with much
difficulty the Houſes are drawn to accept; but yet would have it at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> a place
but about fifteen miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and above twice that diſtance from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
And accordingly Commiſſioners from both Parties met on <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. While the
<hi>King</hi> was providing for the Treaty, and forming Inſtructions for His Miniſters, the
Faction found the Parliament other work by new deſigns; and to habituate the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to an abhorrency of Peace, fed them with blood. The two <hi>Hothams</hi> firſt were to
be the Sport of the Multitude: and that the Father might have more than a ſingle
death, he was drawn back in his journey to the Scaffold, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. that his Son
might be executed before him, as he was <hi>Jan.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. when after he had expreſſed his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to thoſe Maſters whom they had ſerved to their ruines, his Head was chopt off.
And on <hi>Jan.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. the Father is brought to the place that was defiled with his Son's
blood, and had his own added to it. Theſe were not much lamented by any, for the
memory that they firſt kindled the Flame of the Nation kept every eye dry.</p>
                  <p>The People thus fed with courſer blood, a cleaner Sacrifice was afterwards preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>William Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Primate</hi> of all <hi>England.</hi> He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60710:23"/>
Impriſonment four years, and paſſed through a Trial of many months, in
which he had acquitted himſelf with ſuch a confidence as became the Innocency and
Conſtancy of a Chriſtian Biſhop and Confeſſor, but yet muſt fall to pleaſe the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and thoſe mercileſs men who imputed God's anger in the difficulties of Succeſs againſt
their Prince, to the continuance of this Prelate's life:
therefore he was voted guilty of High Treaſon by the
Houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">Some Writers (who ſince have been convinced of their miſinformation) have named amongſt thoſe ſeven Lords, the Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> Earl of <hi>Elgin;</hi> but his Lordſhip upon the firſt notice of this report, did to ſeveral Perſons of Quality and Honour he converſed with, and ſince hath affirmed to me, that he was not then preſent, and that his heart could never conſent to the ſhedding of the blood of that excellent Prelate.</note>
 and was condemned in the Houſe
of Peers, (though they have no power over the life of
the meaneſt Subject without the concurrence of the
<hi>King</hi>) when there were but ſeven Lords preſent, and
all thoſe not conſenting to the Murder, to be drawn,
hanged and quartered. And this was the firſt Example
of murdering men by Votes, of killing by an Order of Parliament, when there is no
Law. It was moved (they ſay) by ſome that he might be ſhipp'd over to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to die by the Contempt and Malice of thoſe People. But this ſeemed too great
an Honour, becauſe it would make his end as his life was, much like that of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Biſhops, who for their Piety were baniſhed to Barbarous Coaſts, or condemned
to the Mines. Or elſe it would be like an <hi>Athenian</hi> Oſtraciſm, and confeſs him too
great and good to live among us. Therefore this motion was rejected; yet the Lords
upon his Petition, to the diſtaſte of ſome Commons, changed the manner of that vile
Execution to that more generous of being beheaded. To the Scaffold he was brought
<hi>Jan.</hi> 10. after he had endured ſome affronts in his Antichamber in the Tower by ſome
ſons of Schiſm and Sedition, who unſeaſonably that morning he was preparing himſelf
to appear before the great Biſhop of our Souls, would have him give ſome ſatisfaction
to the Godly (for ſo they called themſelves) for his Perſecutions, (which he called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.)
To whom he anſwered, <hi>That he was now ſhortly to give account of all his Actions
at an higher and more equal Tribunal, and deſired he might not be diſturbed in his Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for it.</hi> When he came to the Scene of his death, he appeared with that chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſerenity in his face, as a good Conſcience doth beautifie the owners with: and
it was ſo conſpicuous, that his Enemies, who were aſhamed to ſee his Innocency pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traited
in his Countenance, did report he had drunk ſome Spirits, to force his nature
from a paleneſs. He preached his own Funeral Sermon on that Text <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and
concluding his life with Prayer, ſubmitted himſelf to the ſtroke of the Ax.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">He was a Perſon of ſo great <hi>Abilities</hi> (which <hi>are the Deſignations of Nature to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Command,</hi>) that they raiſed him from low beginnings to the higheſt Office
the Proteſtant Profeſſion acknowledges in the Church. And he was equal to it. His
Learning appear'd eminent in his Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and his Piety illuſtrious in his
Diary (although publiſhed by One that was thirſty of his blood, and polluted with
many malicious comments and falſe Surmiſes to make him odious.) He was of ſo
Publick a Spirit, that both the Church and State have laſting Monuments of the
Vertuous uſe of his Prince's favour; at his Admittance into which he dedicated all
the future Emoluments of it to the Glory of God and the Good of Men, by a Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of many noble Works: moſt of which he accompliſhed, and had finiſhed the
reſt had not the Fate of the Nation checked the current of his Deſigns, and cut off
the Courſe of his Life. He was not contented by himſelf only to ſerve his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(for ſo he might have appeared more greedy of Fame, than deſirous of the
Univerſal Benefit) but he endeavoured to render all others as Heroick, if they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at a Capacity for his Friendſhip: for (I have heard it from his Enemies) no
great man was admitted to a confidence and reſpect with him, unleſs he made his
Addreſs by ſome Act that was for the Common Good, or for the Ornament and
Glory of the Proteſtant Faith. Learned men had not a better Friend, nor Learning
it ſelf a greater Advancer; he ſearched all the Libraries of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from ſeveral
parts of the World purchaſed all the Ornaments and Helps of Literature he could,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church might have (if poſſible) by his Care as many Advantages
for Knowledge as almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> did contribute to the Grandeur of that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Outward Splendour of the Clergy was not more his Care than their Honour
by a grave and pious Converſation; he would put them into a power of doing more
good, but was ſevere againſt their Vices and Vanities. He ſcorned a private Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and his Kindred were rather relieved than raiſed to any greatneſs by him. In
his Election of Friends, he was determinated to the Good and Wiſe, and ſuch as had
both Parts and Deſires to profit the Church, had his cloſeſt Embraces; if otherwiſe
it happened, their frauds, not his choice, deſerved the blame. Both Papiſts and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60710:23"/>
were equally his Enemies; one Party feared, and the other hated his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
Some cenſured him of too much Heat, and a Zeal for Diſcipline above the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of the Times. But his greateſt unhappineſs was that he lived in a Factious
Age, and Corrupt State, and under ſuch a Prince, whoſe Vertues not admitting an
immediate approach for Accuſations, was to be wounded in thoſe whom He did
Careſs. But when Faction and Malice are worn out by time, Poſterity ſhall ingrave
him in the Albe of the moſt Excellent Prelates, the moſt indulgent Fathers of the
Church, and the moſt injured Martyrs. His blood was accompanied with ſome
tears that fell from thoſe Eyes which expected a pleaſure at his Death, and it had
been followed with a more general mourning, had not the Publick Miſeries and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
fears of Ruine exacted all the Stock of Grief for other objects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time the Faction clove into two Sects, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi>
which hitherto had been united under one name of <hi>Patriots,</hi> or <hi>Godly,</hi> had joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
War and diſturbed the Peace, and by various arts had acted all their luſts under
the name and Authority of Parliament. For they would either early in the morning
before the Houſe was full, or late at night, when thoſe whoſe cares were moſt for the
Publick were abſent, being aſſured of the Speaker, propoſe and vote what ſerved for
their Deſign. IF any thing contrary to it was about to be reſolved in a full Aſſembly,
they by multitude of Scruples would ſo diſturb the Debates, that the determination
was deferr'd to a deſired Opportunity. But if theſe failed, then would they ſurpriſe
the Houſe with another Vote that ſhould weaken and hinder the Execution of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
When the moſt conſciencious were too numerous for them, then would they
make neceſſities to ſend the leſs pliant to their wills into the Country. Thus the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
but more induſtrious, Party did circumvent the Greater, that were not ſo wary
nor diligent. While they thus joyntly contrive the Publick Ruine, they had gotten
themſelves into the moſt conſiderable and profitable Offices of the Kingdom. But the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> having the advantage in Number and Power, and the diſſenſion in their
Opinions growing ſtill higher, by the Animoſities of the inferiour and obſcurer parts
of their Sects, there was neither Faith nor Love among them, but what Fear and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
did force them unto. The <hi>Independents,</hi> who comprehended all the ſeveral
herds of Hereticks, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Millenaries,</hi> &amp;c. though they were the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the other, yet excelled their Maſters in Art and Induſtry, had their private
<hi>Junto's</hi> and Meetings apart to mould their Projects, and aſſign to each of their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
their ſeveral Scenes and Methods; and, by proper Applications to mens ſeveral
humours, had exceedingly encreaſed their ſtrength in the multitude, only they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Power of the Sword and the moſt uſeful Offices to perfect their Empire.</p>
                  <p>This they effected by thoſe very practices they had learned from the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi>
and by procuring the Ordinance of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> (as they called it) they turned out
<hi>Eſſex</hi> (whom they had before ſecretly cauſed to be ſuſpected, and who had neither
glory in his War, nor ſecurity or quiet in his Peace) from his Generalſhip, and with
him alſo the other Leaders that were favourers of the Presbytery, under pretence that
it was not fit that any Members of Parliament ſhould be encouraged to a continuance
of the War, by enjoying the profitable and powerful Offices in the Army, to which
they would now give a new <hi>Module.</hi> Having by this artifice diſplaced thoſe whoſe
power they feared, they brought in as many Candidates of their own Sect as they
could to be Colonels, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was appointed General. This man both
Parties did the more eaſily conſent in, becauſe he was known to be of ſufficient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Valour, and of no private Deſigns, obſtinate by a natural Melancholy rather
than pertinacious in any Intereſt, and rather free from Baſeneſs, than ambitious of
Vain-glory; by all theſe Qualities they ſuppoſed he would be obedient to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
of his Maſters. But the <hi>Independents,</hi> that were better informed of his ductile
Spirit, and how eaſily he might be impoſed upon by a <hi>Species</hi> of Religion, got the
great Patron of all the wildeſt and moſt unreaſonable Sectaries, <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> at
firſt to be admitted into his Counſels, and afterwards to be the Director of all his
actions, under the Title of Lieutenant General. For although he likewiſe by the
Self-denying Ordinance was made incapable of any Office in the Army, being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Parliament; yet thoſe Troops of <hi>Fanaticks</hi> whom he had amaſſed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lead under the Command of the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi>
(both which he had caſt off) were inſtructed to refuſe the Conduct of any one but
him. He was therefore permitted by the Parliament, as the General deſired, for a
time to continue in the Army; but he never left it till he had changed that, ruined
the Parliament, and turned out the General, that thus was the Author of his unlawful
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60710:24"/>
Power. For this Man, having a long time been poor and neceſſitous, the Patrimony
that was left him being profuſely ſpent, and nothing remaining but the Inſtruments
of his Crimes, a bloody and fierce Nature, a greedy Soul full of bold and unjuſt
hopes, yet able to conceal them with a profeſſion of Modeſty, a contempt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Friendſhip, yet highly pretending to both till he had ſmote under the fifth rib
thoſe credulous hearts that truſted him; he was fitted for the moſt impious Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
for vexed by a preſſing and tedious Poverty, he reſolved to indeavour the utmoſt
diſtance from ſuch a Condition, though by the greateſt wickedneſs, therefore uſed
the Power he had now gotten to overthrow the whole State, and eſtabliſh himſelf in
an abſolute and unſupportable <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which <hi>is the common iſſue of aſſaulting a Juſt
and Lawful Prince with Arms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With theſe Tragedies and Changes was the Winter ſpent at <hi>London,</hi> while the <hi>King</hi> at
<hi>Oxford</hi> waits for the Iſſue of the Treaty at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> which, as all other Conſultations
for Peace, was vain and fruitleſs. For the Faction would alwaies obſtruct thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
by their proper Methods. If the Condition of their Affairs were proſperous,
then would they make their Demands like Impoſitions on conquered Slaves, deteſting
to ſupplicate that the acquiſitions of their Swords and Blood ſhould be confirmed by a
worſted Enemy. In a more humble fortune they would deprecate their drooping
Party, <hi>not then to think of a Reconciliation which their unproſperous Arms muſt neceſſarily
render harder than their hopes; and that it was not for the Honour of a Parliament to ſeem
to yield to any thing by fear or compulſion.</hi> Beſides theſe devices, many fictitious Letters
were compoſed, falſe Rumours divulged, and witneſſes ſuborned, to make Men ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that many dangerous Plots and portentous Deſigns were diſguiſed in theſe Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Accord. Therefore the Commiſſioners of Parliament were inſtructed to
offer no Expedient for an Accommodation, nor hearken to ſuch as were tendred to
them in the name of the <hi>King.</hi> His Majeſty ſeeing and bewailing His Condition,
that He muſt ſtill have to do with thoſe that were Enemies to Peace, prepares Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for the War at the approaching Spring: and although this Winter was infamous
with many loſſes, either through the neglects or perfidiouſneſs of ſome Officers; yet
before the ſeaſon for taking the Field was come, His Counſels and Diligence had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
thoſe Damages.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>April</hi> he ſends the <hi>Prince</hi> to perfect the Weſtern Aſſociation,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1645</label> and raiſe ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as the neceſſities of the Crown, which was His Inheritance, did require: with
Him is ſent, as Moderator of His Youth and prime Counſellor, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> now
Lord <hi>High Chancellor of England,</hi> whoſe faithfulneſs had endeared Him to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
who alſo judged his Abilities equal to the Charge; in which He continued with
the ſame Faith, through all the Difficulties and Perſecutions of his Maſter, till it
pleaſed God to bring the <hi>Prince</hi> back to the Throne of His Fathers, and Him to the
Chief Miniſtery of State. After their departure the <hi>King</hi> draws out His Army to
relieve His Northern Counties and Garriſons. But being on His march, and having
ſtormed and taken <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in His way, He was called back to ſecure <hi>Oxford,</hi> which
the Parliament Army threatned with a Siege. But <hi>Fairfax</hi> having gotten a Letter of
the Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s (whom a Parliament Spy had cajoled to truſt him with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of it) to His Majeſty, wherein he had deſired Him <hi>to forbear ingaging with the
Enemy, till he could be joyned with Him;</hi> he leaves <hi>Oxford,</hi> and made directly towards
the <hi>King</hi> that was now come back as far as <hi>Daventry,</hi> with a purpoſe to fight Him
before that addition of ſtrength, and at a place near <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> both
Armies met on <hi>Saturday, June 14. Cromwell</hi> having then alſo brought ſome freſh
Horſe to <hi>Fairfax;</hi> whoſe abſence from the Army at that time the <hi>King</hi> was aſſured
by ſome (who intended to betray Him) ſhould be effected. Nevertheleſs the <hi>King</hi>
would not decline the Battle, and had the better at firſt, but His vanquiſhing Horſe
following the chaſe of their Enemies too far (a fatal errour that had been twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
committed) left the Foot open to the other Wing, who preſſing hotly upon
them put them to an open rout, and ſo became Maſters of His Canon, Camp and
Carriage, and among theſe of His Majeſties Cabinet, in which they found many of
His Letters, moſt of them written to the <hi>Queen:</hi> which, not contented with their
Victory over His Forces, they print as a Trophee over His Fame, that by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
His ſecret Thoughts, deſigned only for the Breaſts of His Wife, to the debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
multitude, and they looking on them through the Prejudices which the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Faction had already formed in their minds, the Popular hatred might
be increaſed. But the publication of them found a contrary effect, every one that was
not barbarous abhorred that Inhumanity among Chriſtians which Generous Heathens
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60710:24"/>
ſcorned to be guilty of, and the Letters did diſcover that the <hi>King</hi> was not as He was
hitherto characterized; but that He had all the Abilities and Affections, as well as all
the Rights that were fit for Majeſty: And (which is not uſual) He grew greater
in Honour by this Defeat, though he never after recovered any conſiderable power.</p>
                  <p>For the Fate of this Battle had an inauſpicious influence upon all His remaining
Forces, and every day His loſſes were repeated. But though <hi>Fortune</hi> had left the
<hi>King,</hi> yet had not His Valour; therefore gathering up the ſcattered remains of His
broken Army, He marches up and down to encourage thoſe whoſe Faith changed
not with His Condition. At laſt attempting to relieve <hi>Cheſter,</hi> though He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
behind and before, and His Horſe wearied in ſuch tedious and reſtleſs Marches;
yet at firſt He beat <hi>Poyntz</hi> off that followed; but by being charged by freſh Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from the Leaguer, and a greater Number, He was forced to retreat, and leave
ſome of His gallant Followers dead upon the place. After this He draws towards
the North-Eaſt, and commands the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> with the Horſe that were left to march
for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there to join with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who with an inconſiderable company
of Men had got Victories there ſo prodigious that they looked like Miracles. But
this Lord was ſurpriſed before he could get out of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> for His Horſe having
taken 700 of the Enemies Foot, were ſo wanton with their Succeſs, that they were
eaſily maſtered by another Party, and he himſelf was compelled to fly into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
Theſe ſeveral overthrows brought another miſchief along with it; for the <hi>King</hi>'s
Commanders and Officers broke their own <hi>Peace and Agreement,</hi> which <hi>is the only
Comfort and Relief of the Oppreſſed, and which makes them conſiderable, though they are
ſpoiled of Arms,</hi> by imputing (as it uſeth to be in unhappy Councils) the criminous
part of their Misfortunes to one another. But many gallant Perſons, whom Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Religion had drawn to His Service, endured the utmoſt hazards before they
delivered the Holds He had committed to their truſt; and by that means employing
the Enemies Arms, gave the <hi>King</hi> time, who was at laſt returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to
provide for His Safety.</p>
                  <p>Hither every day ſad Meſſages of Ruines from every part of the Nation came,
which though they ſeemed like the falling pieces of the diſſolved World, yet they
found His Spirit erect and undaunted. For He was equal in all the Offices of His
Life, tenacious of Truth and Equity, and not moveable from them by Fears, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner
of worldly Glory, and deſirous of Empire for no other reaſon, but becauſe
He ſaw theſe Kingdoms muſt be ruined, when He relinquiſhed the care of them. But
that which moſt troubled Him were the Importunities of His own diſconſolate Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſeek for Conditions of Peace, which He ſaw was in vain to expect would be
ſuch as were fit to accept; for His former experience aſſured Him, that theſe Men
would follow the Counſels of their Fortune, and be more Inſolent now than ever.
And for Himſelf, He was reſolved not to Sacrifice His Conſcience to Safety, nor His
Honour to Life. This He often told thoſe that thus preſſed Him, and did profeſs in
His Letter to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> (who likewiſe moved Him to the ſame,) that <hi>He would
yield to no more now than what He had offered at</hi> Uxbridge; though He confeſſed <hi>it were
as great a Miracle His Enemies ſhould hearken to ſo much Reaſon, as that He ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
within a Month to the ſame Condition He was in immediately before the Battle at</hi>
Naſeby.</p>
                  <p>But yet to ſatisfie every One how tender He was of the Common Safety, He ſent
ſeveral Meſſages to the Parliament for a Treaty, and offers to come Himſelf to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
if He may have ſecurity for Himſelf and Attendants. All which were either
not regarded, or anſwered with Reproaches. And becauſe the people began to
murmure at ſo great an earneſtneſs of the Faction to continue the Wounds of the
Nation open and bleeding, (ſince there were many Forts yet held out for the <hi>King</hi>
by Gallant Perſons, beſides the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had an Army yet unbroken, and <hi>Ormond</hi>
and <hi>Montroſs</hi> had conſiderable Intereſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> all which might be
perſwaded in a Treaty to part with thoſe Arms which could not be taken from them
without much blood;) and it was the common belief that theſe Men ſought for
Victory, not Peace and Liberty, which was now tendred: therefore to raiſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
in the Vulgar, it is ſuggeſted that the Cavaliers who came to Compound would
take the advantage of the <hi>King</hi>'s Preſence, if he were permitted to be there, and
kindle a new Flame and War in the City. And that it might be thought they had
real grounds for theſe fears, the diſarmed Compounders were commanded to depart
above twenty Miles from <hi>London;</hi> and to injealous the People more, all the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pacification were publiſhed, and amplified with the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60710:25"/>
Slanders and Comments of the implacable and conſcious Demagogues, that ſo
the terrours of the Vulgar being augmented, they might be frighted into a longer
patience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> finding theſe men irreconcileable to Peace, and that they had declared
againſt His Coming, though without a Caution, tries the Leaders of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but they proved no leſs pertinacious, and were now approaching to beſiege
<hi>Oxford.</hi> Providence not leaving any more Choice, but only ſhewing Him a way for a
preſent Eſcape, He goes in a <hi>Diſguiſe (which when Neceſſity cloaths Royal Perſons with,
ſeems like an Ominous Cloud before the Setting of the Sun,</hi>) to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Camp that
was now before <hi>Newark,</hi> where the Ambaſſadour of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was
then in the Leaguer, had before covenanted for His Majeſtie's Safety and Protection;
and the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Officers had engaged <hi>to ſecure both Him and as many of His Party as
ſhould ſeek for Shelter with them, and to ſtand to Him with their Lives and Fortunes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> being come thither <hi>May</hi> 4. made a great alteration in Affairs; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1646</label> 
                     <hi>Newark</hi>
was ſurrendred by the <hi>King</hi>'s Command, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> having gallantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Oxford</hi> till the Beſiegers offered Honourable Conditions, delivered up that
alſo. But the greateſt Change of Counſels were at <hi>London,</hi> where when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
among whom the <hi>King</hi> had ſought a Sanctuary, various and different Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were raiſed. <hi rend="margQuotes">Some wondred that His Majeſty had ſought a refuge there where
the Storm began, and how He could apprehend to find Relief from thoſe that were
not only the Authors of His Troubles, but now the great Advancers of His Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
And they conceived <hi>no Promiſes or Oaths can be a ſufficient Caution from thoſe
People that have been often Perſidious.</hi> Others judged that in thoſe Neceſſities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>King</hi> was concluded, it was as dangerous not to truſt as to be deceived; no
Counſel could be better, than to try whether a Confidence in them would make them
faithful, and whether they would then be honeſt, when they had the Critical Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to teſtifie to the World, that they intended not what they did, but what
they ſaid; <hi>That they fought not againſt Him, but for Him.</hi> But a laſt ſort bewailed
both the greatneſs of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dangers, that ſhould make Him ſeek for Safety
in a tempeſtuous Sea and falſe bottom; as alſo the debaucheries of the Engliſh <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
which was now ſo corrupted, that their Prince was driven to ſeek an <hi>Aſylum</hi>
from their injuries among a People that were infamous and polluted with the Blood
of many Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While others diſcourſed thus of the <hi>King</hi>'s journey, the Parliament heated by the
<hi>Independents</hi> fiercely declared againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were removing the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
and uſed ſeveral methods to make them odious and drive them home. For they
kept back their Pay, that they might exact free-Quarter from the Countrey; then
they did extenuate their Services, derogate from their famed Valour, upbraid them
as Mercenaries, threaten to force them out by the Sword. All which while the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> though they wiſh'd well to their Brethren, yet leſt they ſhould
ſeem to indulge the Inſolencies of a ſtrange Nation, did not dare to plead in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
But the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves for a time did juſtifie their Reception and Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of His Majeſty <hi>by the Laws of Nature, Nations, and Hoſpitality, which forbid the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and betraying of thoſe that have fled to any for Succour.</hi> The Democratick Faction
urged that it <hi>was not lawful for the</hi> Scots, <hi>their Hirelings, and in their Dominion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the</hi> King <hi>into their Camp without the leave of their Maſters, and keep Him without
their Conſent.</hi> Theſe Debates were uſed to raiſe the King's price. Which when the
<hi>Scots</hi> were almoſt aſſured of, to make their ware more valuable, they ſollicit the <hi>King,</hi>
in hopes of their Defence, to command <hi>Montroſs</hi> to depart-from his noble Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he had almoſt recovered the Overthrow <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire</hi>
had betrayed him unto, and was become formidable again; as alſo the Loyal
Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> to deſiſt from his gallant Oppoſitions both of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels,
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces. Which when the <hi>King</hi> had done, being not willing thoſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Perſons ſhould longer hazard their brave Lives, and after both theſe Excellent
Leaders had more in anger than fear parted with their unhappy Arms: that they
might have a colour of betraying Him, whom the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which
uſeth to hatch all the Seditions to the heat and ſtrength of a ſeeming Authority) had
forbid to be brought into <hi>His Native and Ancient Kingdom</hi> (as He affectionately call'd
it) they tender Him the Covenant; pretending without that Chain upon Him they
did not dare to lead Him into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This His Majeſty refuſed not, if they would
firſt looſe thoſe Scruples of Church-Government which lay upon His Conſcience:
Therefore to untie thoſe Knots, Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> that was then the Oracle of the Kirk,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60710:25"/>
and the great Apoſtle of the Solemn <hi>Covenant,</hi> was employed to converſe with Him.
But the Greatneſs of the <hi>King</hi>'s Parts and the Goodneſs of His Cauſe made all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
void (for the Papers being publiſhed, every one yielded the Victory to His
Majeſty) and unfortunate; for he returned home, and not long after died, as ſome
reported, of a Grief contracted from the ſenſe of his Injuries to a Prince whom he had
found ſo Excellent.</p>
                  <p>While theſe things were acting at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the bargain was ſtroke at <hi>London,</hi> and
for 200000 l. His Majeſty, ſtripp'd of thoſe Arms He had when He came among
them, was deliver'd up, as it were, to be ſcourged and crucified, to ſome Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from the Parliament: But to honeſt their Perfidiouſneſs, they add this Caution,
<hi>That there ſhould be no attempt made upon the</hi> King'<hi>s Perſon, but being entertained at one
of His own Palaces, He ſhould there be treated with upon Propoſitions from both Nations,
which ſhould ſpeedily be ſent to Him.</hi> But the Parliament never though of ſending any
Propoſitions till He came under the Power of the Army, who had malicious Deſigns
upon His Perſon. The Commiſſioners receiving Him, convey Him to His own Houſe
at <hi>Holmeby.</hi> This was a very curious and ſtately Building, yet was not therefore cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
becauſe it might be a Majeſtick Priſon; but becauſe it was within Ken of <hi>Naſeby,</hi>
which was infamous with His Overthrow, that ſo the Neighbourhood to it might
more afflict His grieved Spirit. To this unpleaſingneſs of the Place they added other
diſcomforts, by making the reſtraint ſo ſtrict that they ſuffered none to come near
Him, that by owning His Cauſe were aſſured of their Welcome; yea even His Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
(which moſt troubled Him) were debarred from their Miniſtery. But God
ſupplied this Want by more plentiful Aſſiſtances of His Holy Spirit, and made Him,
like the Ancient Patriarchs, both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> (at leaſt for Himſelf:) and here
He ſacrificed Praiſes even to that God that hid himſelf, and compoſed thoſe moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Meditations and Soliloquies that are in His Book, ſpending that time in Converſe
with Heaven, which He was not ſuffered to employ with Men in whom He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>King</hi>'s Soul was thus winged above the Walls of His Priſon and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of His Enemies, they that had put an end to the War, yet could not find the
way to Peace; for their Souls were unequal to the Victory, and could not temper
their Succeſs, the two Sects falling to diſſenſion, and turning all their arts and arms
one againſt another. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the richer and more ſplendid followers,
but the <hi>Independents</hi> the moſt fierce, ſubtle, and moſt ſtrongly principled to Confuſion;
the firſt was powerful in the Parliament, but the latter in the Army. After they had
a long time practiſed on one another the very ſame Methods they had acted againſt
the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch as favoured Him in the Parliament (of which there were always
ſome Number among them) the <hi>Independents</hi> ſtill gained upon their Oppoſites, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> odious, by Libels compoſed to render their Government ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and tyrannical, by putting them upon all the moſt envious Employments, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Univerſities, and Sequeſtring Miniſters that refuſed to take the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
Not contented thus to deal with their elder Brethren, by ſpoiling them of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
they proceeded to ſtrip them of the relicks of their armed Power, ſurpriſing
them in Parliament with a Vote to disband all the Souldiers that were not in <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s
Army: then the General turns out thoſe Commanders of Garriſons that were any
way inclined to them. Beſides this, they either corrupted with Gifts or frighted ſome
of the moſt buſie, yet obnoxious, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> either wholly to come over to them, or
be their Inſtruments in diſturbing and revealing the Counſels of that Party; which
was done under the Scheme of Moderation, and Reconciling the Godly one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at laſt awakened with the daily wounds of their power,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>1647</label> and the
diſhonour of their party, began now to be more afraid of their Stipendiaries than
they were of their Sovereign; for they found that they loſt all that by the Victory
which they ſought by the War: therefore to break the confidence of the <hi>Independents,</hi>
and make themſelves free, they Vote in the Parliament, where they had moſt Voices,
<hi>That to eaſe the Commonwealth of the Charges in maintaining the Army, 12000 of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſhould be ſent over to</hi> Ireland, <hi>and all the reſt to be disbanded, except 6000 Horſe,</hi> 2000
<hi>Dragoons, and 6000 Foot, who ſhould be diſpoſed in different and diſtant places in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to prevent any Riſing.</hi> The Commanders and <hi>Independents</hi> ſoon diſcovered the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that it was not to eaſe the Nation, but weaken them; therefore they employ
the Inferiour Officers (being perſons that by diſſimulation and impudence having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
themſelves to much ſpeaking, did at laſt imagine their Vices were Gifts of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60710:26"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo were fit to diſquiet the minds of men,) to poſſeſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers <hi>with a fear of Disbanding without their Arrears, or elſe to be ſent into that
unquiet Iſland to periſh with hunger and cold, and the ſurpriſes of a treacherous Enemy.</hi> This
preſently ſet the Army to Mutiny, which while it was in the Beginnings, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
make ſemblance of Indignation at it, ſeem very buſie to compoſe it; and
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> to make the Parliament ſecure, calls God to witneſs, that <hi>he was aſſured the
Army would at their firſt Command caſt their Arms at their Feet;</hi> and again ſolemnly
ſwears, that <hi>he had rather himſelf with his whole Family ſhould be conſumed than that the
Army ſhould break out into Sedition.</hi> Yet in the mean time he and his Creatures in the
Army adminiſter new fuel to the flames of it; and when they had raiſed their Fury to
ſuch heat that it was at laſt concocted to a perfect defection from all obedience to the
Parliament, they lay aſide their diſguiſes, and poſt from <hi>London</hi> to the Head Quarters,
where the Synagogue of Agitators was ſeated, and to whom was committed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of this Conſpiracy. This Conventicle was made up of two of the moſt
unquiet and factious in every Regiment of Foot, and each Troop of Horſe: their
buſineſs was to conſult the Intereſts of the whole Army, and when they had moulded
their Pretences and Arts to their grand Deſign, to inſtruct the ruder part of it in
their Clamours and Injuries, and to corrupt all the Garriſons by Emiſſaries to the
ſame enterpriſes. At laſt they extended their Cares to the whole Britiſh Empire, and
dictate what their pleaſures are concerning <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which was in both
Kingdoms <hi>to eſtabliſh the Power and Liberty of the People;</hi> for they openly profeſſed an
intent for Democracy. And becauſe about an hundred Officers in the Army would
not be forward in the Sedition, they were by this Committee of Adjutators, and the
ſecret intimations of the Commanders, caſhiered.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Counſels of both Parties being directed to overthrow their contrary, each
thought the Perſon and Preſence of the <hi>King</hi> would be no vain advantage to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
for they would Honeſt their actions with a care of Him: therefore the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
had it in Conſultation to Order Col. <hi>Greves,</hi> who had the Command of the
Guard about the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> to remove His Majeſty to <hi>London;</hi> the Intelligence
of which coming to the Army by the treachery of a certain Lord, they immediately
ſend a body of Horſe to prevent them, and to force Him into their own Quarters.
Thus was that Religious Prince made once more the mock of Fortune, and the ſport
of the Factions, and was drawn from His peaceful Contemplations, and Proſpect of
Heaven, to behold and converſe with men ſet on Fire of Hell. Theſe, to tempt Him
to a Confidence in their integrity, (that they might the more eaſily to His diſgrace
ruine Him, and murder Him by His own Conceſſions, if He would be deluded by
them) highly <hi>pretend to a Compaſſionate Senſe of His Sufferings, and complain of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Barbarous Impriſoning Him in His own Palaces, wondering they had no more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for Majeſty;</hi> and to beget a belief of this, they <hi>profeſs</hi> (which they would have
to be conceived with them was more ſacred than any Oaths) <hi>that they will never part
with their Arms till they have made His way to His Throne, and rendred the Condition of
His Party more tolerable.</hi> Beſides theſe Promiſes and Compaſſions, they permit Him
the Miniſtery of His Chaplains in the Worſhip of God, (which, it is ſaid, He took
with ſo great a Joy, that He almoſt believed Himſelf free and ſafe, it being His moſt
heavy burden while He was the Parliaments Captive) the Commerce of Letters with
the <hi>Queen,</hi> the Viſits of His own Party, and the Service of His Courtiers; ſome of
whom they alſo admitted to their Council of War, mould Propoſitions which they
will urge in His behalf, and alter them to the <hi>King</hi>'s Guſt and at His Advice. In
their publick Remonſtrances againſt the Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Injuſtice, Cruelty
and Self-mindedneſs of the Parliament, they do ſometimes obliquely, ſometimes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
profeſs, that <hi>the King, Queen, and the Royal Family muſt be reſtored to all their Rights,
or elſe no hope of a ſolid Peace;</hi> but then they would intermix ſuch Conditions as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they ſought Reſerves for a perfidious eſcape. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> did among his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
boaſt of his fine arts, and that by theſe Indulgences was intended nothing but
His Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>By all theſe Impoſtures they prevailed nothing upon the Hopes or Fears of the
<hi>King;</hi> nor did He commit any thing unworthy His former Fortune, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of His Integrity and Wiſdom, or which any of the Diſagreeing Factions could
uſe to His reproach. But they found another kind of Succeſs upon the Parliament, for
they ſacrificed to the commands of their Stipendiaries eleven Members of the Houſe
of Commons, and ſeven of the Peers, cauſing them to forbear ſitting among them,
becauſe they had been accuſed by the Army in a very frivolous Charge. <hi rend="margQuotes">All men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60710:26"/>
wondering at the inequality of thoſe mens Spirits, who had ſo furiouſly rejected
the Articles of their lawful Sovereign againſt five or ſix of their Body, and yet did
now ſo tamely yield to the ſlight Cavils and diſlike of their Mercenaries above thrice
that Number. They therefore concluded that neither <hi>Religion, Justice, or the Love
of Liberty, which are always uniform,</hi> but <hi>unworthy Intereſts and corrupt Souls, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with fears and hopes,</hi> had been the Principles and firſt Movers of their attempts.</hi>
Beſides this, they were ſo prone to Slavery, that they had gone on to Vote all the luſts
of the Army, had not a Tumult (their arts being now turned upon their own heads,)
from <hi>London</hi> ſtopp'd them in their violent ſpeed, and kept the Speaker in his Chair
till they had voted more generouſly, <hi>that it was neither for their Honour nor Intereſt to
ſatisfie the demands of the Souldiers;</hi> and that <hi>the King ſhould come to</hi> London <hi>to treat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe contrary deſires of the divided Faction, which had joyntly oppreſſed their
Sovereign, ſhewed that <hi>Ill men will more eaſily conſpire together in War, than conſent in
Peace:</hi> and that <hi>Combinations in Crimes will conclude in Jealouſies, each Party thinking
the advantages of the other too great; and that Power is never thought faithful which is
accounted exceſſive.</hi> Therefore both prepare for War. With the 140 Members that
ſate in Parliament were joyned the City, and the caſhiered Souldiers and Officers that
had ſerved in their pay. With the Army were the Speakers of both Houſes; who
had fled to them with about 50 of their Members that projected the Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
being either for an Oligarchy or Democracie, yet left ſome of the ſame
judgment behind, to betray and diſturb the Councils at <hi>London.</hi> To theſe did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
the Neighbouring Counties, who were cajoled by the ſplendid Promiſes of the
Army, of <hi>Reſtoring the</hi> King, (which they much boaſted) <hi>Diſſolving the Parliament,
and Eſtabliſhing Peace and Government:</hi> and they more willingly credited theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had conceived an hatred of the Parliament and City, both for beginning
the War, and now obſtructing Peace. The Army intitle their attempts <hi>for King and
People:</hi> Their Adverſaries <hi>for bringing the King to His Parliament.</hi> The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were greedy of that War which promiſed an eaſie Victory, and made the poor
Souldiers hope for the Plunder of the City.</p>
                  <p>For the advantage was clear on the Army's ſide, which conſiſted of veterane Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
united among themſelves by a long Converſe, and known Commanders: but
the force of the other was made up of a tumultuary Multitude, gathered under new
Leaders, and ſo had no mutual confidence: their meetings were full of doubts and
fears, none could determine in private, nor in publick conſult, becauſe they dared
not truſt one another; and it was obſerved that thoſe who were moſt treacherous
talk'd moſt boldly againſt the Enemy. Therefore in the very beginnings the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and City deſert their Enterpriſe, treat with, and open their Gates to the Army,
who march in Triumph through <hi>London,</hi> bringing the Speakers and their Fellow-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
to their Chairs, ſeize upon the <hi>Tower,</hi> diſmantle the Fortifications, pull down
all the Chains and Poſts of the City, ſend the Lord Mayor and the chief Citizens to
the <hi>Tower,</hi> and reduce all the power of the Nation in Obedience to the Commanders.
For <hi>Fairfax</hi> is made General of all the Forces both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Rainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi>
a Leveller, and a violent Head of the Democraticks, High Admiral. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> fled beyond Sea, others of that Sect drooping complyed with the
Fortune of the Conquerours; and that which grieved good Men moſt, was, <hi>a Publick
Thankſgiving</hi> (which <hi>is not to be obſerved but for the happy endeavours of a Nation in their
vertuous and glorious undertakings for Liberty and Safety,</hi> but now was prophaned for our
Slavery and Miſery) to God was appointed for the Army, and they were entertained
now at a Feaſt, whom before the City would have forced from their Walls.</p>
                  <p>While theſe things were in Motion, the <hi>King</hi> conſults Heaven for Direction, and
His Party modeſtly abſtain from either ſide, thought both to be abhorred, and knew
that Party would be the worſt which ſhould overcome. The Army having now the
greateſt ſtrengths of the Nation, the Parliament and City at their Obedience, make
no mention of their former promiſes to the <hi>King;</hi> only the Adjutators were fierce
for breaking that Parliament, and calling another, as they call'd it, <hi>more equal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative.</hi>
But both their Synagogue and the Council of War being now delivered
from fear of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> began to contrive the deſtruction both of the <hi>King</hi> and
Monarchy. As for the <hi>King,</hi> whom they had now brought to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, ſome
that had before contrived His Death, and to murder Him while he was in the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Camp, (ſo at once to ſatisfie their own Revenge, and load their Enemies with the
Infamy of the Murder,) yet could not then perform it, were now fierce for a ſpeedy
and ſecret Aſſaſſination by Piſtol or Poiſon. Others would have Him tryed and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60710:27"/>
condemned by their Council of War. But the Chiefs thought fit to proceed more
artificially in their Crime, and when they ſhould get more Authority, deſtroy Him by
a Parliamentary way of Juſtice. To bring this about, they muſt proceed to make
Him more odious, that the People might be patient while they kill Him, and undoe
them. To proceed therefore to their Impiety, <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Creatures ſtickle
fiercely in the Houſe of Commons, and cauſe the Parliament to ſend, not Conditions
of Peace to be treated on, but Propoſitions like Commands that admitted no Diſpute:
which if the <hi>King</hi> had yielded unto, He had deſpoiled Himſelf of Majeſty, and
been thought guilty of ſo much want of Spirit as would conclude an unfitneſs for
Empire; beſides ſuch a voluntary Diminution would have been equally unſafe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious:
And if he did not, then He was to be eſteemed the only Obſtacle of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Peace. And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould put them to more tedious arts by ſigning them,
they themſelves to divert Him privately promiſed to procure more ſoft Articles, and
profeſſed to be ſorry the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sowreneſs and Rigour did yet leaven the Houſe,
which made theſe Propoſitions ſo unpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> could not but perceive the practices of the Army, yet being reſolved
that no Dangers whatſoever ſhould make Him ſatisfie thoſe unreaſonable Demands
of the Parliament, which granted would have been the heavieſt oppreſſion on His
Subjects, and the greateſt injury to His Poſterity He could poſſibly be guilty of; For
<hi>to good Princes the Safety of their People, and their own Memory, which is built upon the
Happineſs of Poſterity through their Counſels, are more pretions than Life and Power;</hi> and
although Providence and the Malice of His Enemies had obſtructed His way to Glory
by Victories and Succeſs, yet He would trace it in the unenvied and unqueſtionable
paths of Conſtancy and Juſtice: Therefore to make His denial of them advantageous
to Himſelf, by a ſeeming confidence in the Army's proffers, thereby to oblige, if it
were poſſible, thoſe that had no ſenſe either of Faith or Honour, or at leaſt to injea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thoſe two Rivals for His Power, and commit them, the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely rejects
the Parliaments Propoſitions, and requires the <hi>Demands of the Army as more equal, and
fit for a Perſonal Treaty, and that the Army alſo ſhould nominate Commiſſioners. Cromwell</hi>
and his Complices ſeemed to be joyful for this Anſwer of His Majeſty, which had
preferred them before their Competitiors to the Honour of Juſtice and Moderation in
the Eyes of the People; but yet ſecretly did they exaſperate the minds of the more
ſhort-ſighted Commons againſt the <hi>King</hi> for this Affront. And to the <hi>King</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
a ſhame and trouble upon their Spirits (for ſo they loved to ſpeak) that they could
not now perform their Promiſes: ſometimes they excuſed themſelves by a Reverence
to the Parliament, at other times by the fierceneſs of the Adjutators; and when by
theſe excuſes they had coloured their delayes to ſome length, they began to interpret
their ſayings otherwiſe than the <hi>King</hi> apprehended them, to forget what they had
aſſured Him of, and at laſt openly to refuſe any performance. To all theſe Perfidies
they add other Frauds to beget a fear in Him of the Adjutators and the Levellers,
who they informed Him meditated His Murder, profeſſed they could not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
moderate their bloody and impetuous Conſultations, but when they ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the loſt Diſcipline of their Army, then they might eaſily and ſpeedily ſatisfie their
engagements to Him. To give credit to their words, the Fury of the Adjutators was
blown to a more conſpicuous Flame, their Papers were publiſhed for a change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
call'd <hi>The Caſe of the Army,</hi> and, <hi>The Agreement of the People;</hi> the animations
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and another of the ſame Diabolical Spirit, ſaying, <hi>His Majeſty was but a dead
Dog,</hi> were divulged, and all were communicated to ſome Attendants about the <hi>King,</hi>
with an Advice from the Chiefs of the Army to eſcape for His Life, for they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
He ſhould be killed while they helpleſsly look'd on.</p>
                  <p>The Fury and Threatnings of Men of ſuch deſtructive and bloudy Principles, who
accounted <hi>all things lawful that they could do,</hi> that <hi>Providence adminiſtring Opportunity did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and licenſe their Impieties,</hi> and <hi>who imputed all their luſts, that had no colour from Juſtice,
to the Perſwaſions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> were not to be deſpiſed; nor was the <hi>King</hi> to abandon
His Life, if He could without ſin preſerve it to a longer waiting upon God. Therefore
with three of His moſt truſty Attendants, in the dark, tempeſtuous and ominous night
of <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. He leaves <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, ſome ſay, uncertain where to ſeek ſafety; others,
that he intended to take Ship, but being diſappointed in his Expectation, He was at laſt
fatally led into the Power, and, when He could not eſcape, committed Himſelf to the
Loyalty and Honour of Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi> (a Confident of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s, who had been but a
little before made Governour of the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> for this very purpoſe,) and was by
him conveyed to <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle, the very Pit his Enemies had deſigned for Him. For it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60710:27"/>
was diſcourſed in the Army above a fortnight before, that the <hi>King</hi> e're long would
be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight:</hi> and the very night He departed from <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
were withdrawn from their uſual Poſts, on purpoſe to facilitate His Flight. The
all-wiſe God not permitting Him to fly from thoſe greater Trials, and more Glorious
Acts of Patience He had deſigned for Him. Being here in this falſe Harbour, He
minds that buſineſs which lay moſt upon His Heart, the Settlement of the Nation;
He ſends Conceſſions to the Parliament more benign and eaſie than they could deſire or
hope, together with His Reaſons why He could not aſſent to their Demands; and
earneſtly ſollicites them to pity the Languiſhing Kingdom, and come to a Perſonal
Treaty with Him, on His Conceſſions and the Army's Demands.</p>
                  <p>But the Conſpirators, to cut off all hopes of a Treaty, take this Occaſion to ſend
Four Preliminary Articles, which if He would paſs as Acts, they would treat of the
reſt. Theſe were ſo unjuſt, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners in the Name of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
declare againſt them in publick Writings, and following the Meſſengers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> do in the preſence of His Majeſty proteſt againſt them
as contrary to the Religion, the Crown, and Accords of both Kingdoms. The <hi>King,</hi>
according to His wonted Wiſdom and Greatneſs of Mind, preſently returns them an
Anſwer, to ſhew the Injuſtice of having Him grant the chief things before the Treaty,
which ſhould be the Subject of it, and to give them ſuch an Arbitrary Power, to the
ruine of all the People. This Anſwer He delivered ſealed to their Meſſengers, who
deſired that they might hear it read, and that they might be dealt with as Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
not as bare Carriers, (a greater truſt than which their Maſters had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them) and promiſe upon their Honour that it ſhould not be any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to Him. But His Majeſty had no ſooner read it, than they finding it not to the
Guſt of thoſe that ſent them, notwithſtanding the Faith they had given, cauſe their
Juſt Soveraign to be kept cloſe Priſoner, force away His Chaplains, Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> now
Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> both which He highly valued for their
Integrity, Wiſdom, Piety and Learning, and His other Servants, even thoſe whom
the Parliament had placed formerly about Him, and in whom His Goodneſs had
wrought both an Affection and Admiration of Him, and permit none about him but
ſuch as they hoped would be a Watch upon Him, and whoſe barbarous Souls might
trample on His Fortune. Beſides they ſet ſtrict Guards at His Doors and Windows,
leſt any Letters might come to Him, or be ſent from Him.</p>
                  <p>The like reception His Letter found with the Parliament. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his
Officers were reſolved to go on with their Deſign, and having ſo long uſed the <hi>Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
as ſerved to frighten the <hi>King</hi> into the Toils they had ſet, they ſoon quiet them,
(which was not difficult, being a Company of hot-headed Fellows, that could only
talk, not form a Counſel or a Party, to endure a Storm,) by executing ſome of their
moſt pertinacious Leaders; and being free of that Care, applied their Practices whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Deſtruction of His Majeſty. To this purpoſe they mould the Four Votes for
<hi>No Addreſſes to the King;</hi> but before they bring them into Publick, they ſend into their
ſeveral Counties about Forty or Fifty of the Principal Members, who they thought
would oppoſe them, to raiſe Money for the Souldiers. Nevertheleſs the firſt of thoſe
Votes was conteſted againſt ſo ſtrongly, that the Debates laſted from Ten of the Clock
in the Morning till Seven in the Evening; and though they thus wearied the more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Party, yet could it not paſs till the Conſpirators had engaged that no worſe thing
ſhould be done to the <hi>King.</hi> The remaining Votes were diſpatched in half an Hours
time, when thoſe of the moſt ſober Principles were gone forth to refreſh themſelves,
and the Conſpirators ſtill kept their Seats. The Houſe of Peers were not ſo haſty in them
as the Commons had been, and their Debates vexed the Conſpirators with Delays, till
thoſe who were ſent by the Army to thank the Lower Houſe for their Conſent to
theſe Deſires of the Souldiers, did alſo threaten the Upper for their long Deliberations:
ſome new Terrors were alſo added, for they quartered two of their Regiments at
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> under colour of guarding the Parliament, but in truth to work upon the
Lords; which had its effect, for many that had the moſt Honourable thoughts in this
Buſineſs, forſook the Parliament, and then three or four (which often was the fulleſt
Number about thoſe times in that Houſe,) joyn with the Commons in their Votes for
no Addreſſes.</p>
                  <p>This prodigious Perfidiouſneſs in Parliament and Army, both which had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
declared and engaged themſelves by Oaths and Promiſes to preſerve the <hi>King</hi>
in his Juſt Rights, fill'd all men with amazement and indignation, to ſee how little
they valued their Faith, who pretended ſo high to Religion; therefore each of them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60710:28"/>
were put to ſatisfie the Common Fame. <hi>Cromwell</hi> to ſome would have cover'd this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
with another, that as <hi>He was praying for a Bleſſing from God on his Vndertakings,
to restore the</hi> King <hi>to His Priſtine Majeſty, his Tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth, that
he could not ſpeak one word more; which he took as a return of Prayer, and that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Him from being</hi> King. To others he did impudently aſſert, <hi>That it was lawful
to circumvent a wicked man with deceit and frauds.</hi> The Conſpirators in the Parliament ſtrove
to honeſt their Proceedings by a Declaration, and aſſign in it for Cauſes of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
all the Calumnies that had been raiſed againſt the <hi>King</hi> by His moſt profeſſed
Enemies, or from thoſe uncertain Rumours which themſelves had invented, adding
and repeating others which had even in the Parliament Houſe been condemned as
Forgeries, (yet now were uſed as neceſſary Veils for a more execrable Falſhood.) Which
infamous Libel they cauſed to be ſent to all the Pariſhes of the Kingdom, to be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
ſuppoſing that none did dare to refute their black and moſt malicious Slanders,
or that none could publickly do it, becauſe they ſet ſtrict Watches upon all the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Preſſes.
They likewiſe commanded the Curates to read it in their ſeveral Churches,
and commend it to the People. And that theſe might the more readily obſerve their
Orders, they at the ſame time ſtrictly enjoyn the payment of Tithes, and Vote that
the Dean and Chapiter's Lands (which they had deſigned for profane Uſes, and never
intended they ſhould be for the Emolument of Church-men) ſhould be ſet apart for
Augmentations for their Preachers, pretending a ſervent zeal for the propagation of
the Goſpel, when they did moſt diſhonour it. By their Agents and the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi>
with other Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, they ſollicite the unacquainted Rabble to ſign
to Gratulatory Addreſſes to approve what they had already done, and petition for a
ſpeedy progreſs in the Ruine of His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe their curſed Projects failed, for ſeveral Anſwers to their Defamations
were publiſhed, One writ by the <hi>King</hi> Himſelf, another by<note n="*" place="margin">A full Anſwer.</note>
 Sir <hi>Edward Hyde,</hi> and a
third by<note n="†" place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</note>
 Dr. <hi>Bates:</hi> all which proved the Monſtrous Falſhoods of their Paper, and
that the Faction were guilty of what they imputed to the <hi>King;</hi> and this with ſuch
Evidence, that none of their moſt mercenary Writers, or the moſt foul-mouthed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
did dare or hope with Succeſs to reply unto. The Curates coldly, if at all,
obſerved their Orders, and there came ſo few Petitions, and thoſe ſigned by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and lewd perſons, as they rather loaded the Faction with more hatred, than
gave them any credit. While generally in every place none of the People could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Fury againſt theſe Impoſtors, but publickly curſed them and their Infamous
Adherents.</p>
                  <p>For their Miſeries made them ſenſible of the want of that <hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe gentle and
juſt Rule had brought them to ſuch an inebriating Proſperity, that they had forgot
the Miniſter of their Happineſs. But now they found Government when it was out of
His hand, like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod caſt on the ground, transformed to a Serpent; and that
thoſe who pretended to free them from Tyranny had deluded them into the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
Slavery: wherein they were either totally deſpoiled of all things that render
our Being comfortable, or they were not ſecure in the uſe of them. Religion, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of the preſent, and the Pledge of a future Life, was ſo diſhonoured by Schiſms
and Hereſies (ſomented to weaken the People by Diviſions, to a tameneſs under their
Oppreſſors) by Faſts for the moſt impious Deſigns, and Thankſgivings for proſperous
Crimes; that ſome men concluded it to be nothing elſe but the Invention of Tyrants,
and the Diſguiſe of Villains, and therefore did forſake it, and turn Atheiſts. Others
that did ſtill find the Inward Conſolations of it, yet feared openly to profeſs it, leſt they
ſhould be taken for thoſe that pretended a Love to God, that they might more ſecurely
deſtroy men. Liberty alſo was now but an empty name: for all the Common Priſons
were too narrow to receive even thoſe that did not dare to break the Laws; ſo that the
Houſes of Noble men were converted to Gaols, for thoſe that were unfortunate in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Enterpriſes; where they were to languiſh with want and ſickneſs, and not be
called to know their Offence or their Accuſers, becauſe they had not guilt enough for
a publick Condemnation. Some were put a Ship-board in the midſt of Summer, there
to contract Diſeaſes: Others were ſold Slaves to forein Plantations. Many to eſcape
ſuch naſty Confinements, or an ignominious Torture, fled from their Native Soil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Neighbouring Countries, where they were the Evidences of the Infamy and
Barbarouſneſs of our Nation; or ſeeking for Shelter in the Iſles and Deſerts of <hi>America,</hi>
polluted thoſe Rocks and Seas with <hi>Engliſh Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Propriety was no longer hedged up by Law; but whom the Violence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
did not impoveriſh, the Frauds of <hi>Committee</hi>-men would, from whoſe Rapines
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60710:28"/>
none were ſecure that had not been as criminal as themſelves, and few ſafe that did
not ſeek their favour, and bow down to their Greatneſs: Theſe men taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the common evils, to ſatisfie either their private revenge, or luſts: for their
Proceedings were not regulated by the known Laws; but the ſecret Inſtructions of
their Maſters in Parliament and Army, or their own Pleaſures, were the Rules of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring
Juſtice. An honeſt Fame likewiſe was a Mark for Ruine: for if any by
juſt Arts had got the Eſteem of the People and the Affections of His Neighbourhood,
and did not comply with their Intereſt, firſt he was vexed with Slanders and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and afterwards with Sequeſtration; eſpecially if he were a Miniſter: and it
was their common Principle, that <hi>an Honeſt Cavalier was the worſt Enemy,</hi> and <hi>a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
Saint did the moſt hurt;</hi> ſo that both their Vices and Vertues were equally hated.
Common Converſe was dangerous; for they had Informers in every place, and Spies
almoſt in every Family of Note: Servants were corrupted to accuſe their Maſters, and
the Differences in Religion did injealous and arm the neareſt Relations one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
Men out of a mutual diſtruſt would haſten from Company, to conſult in
private their peculiar Safety, for they knew their Words were obſerved, and their
Secrets ſought after. Few Families but had by the Civil War ſome Loſs to bewail;
ſome mourned over their diſagreeing Members in different Camps, and had cauſe to
fear which ſide ſoever proſpered they muſt be miſerable in ſome part.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many more Miſeries were more highly embittered by the uncertainty of
a Remedy: For the Parliament, that had the name of Government, were guilty of
all theſe Reproaches of a Community, being Slaves to thoſe whoſe intereſt it was to
keep us thus miſerable; and if at any time they were free from the yoke of the Army,
the two Sects kept them ſo divided, each Party labouring by Votes and Counſels to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
the other, that they could not mind the Univerſal Benefit. Beſides the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they exerciſed was too much to be well uſed, for they engroſſed the Legiſlative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the Exerciſe of Juriſdiction. So that they would make Laws according
to their Intereſt, and execute them according to their Luſt; this day's Vote ſhould
contradict the former day's Order, and to morrow we muſt violate what to day we
ſolemnly ſwore to obſerve: ſo that men knew not what to obey, nor where to reſt:
Thus all hopes of Liberty and Peace were loſt in the Confinement of the <hi>King,</hi> who
only was found able and willing to determine our Miſeries. For His Principles were
Uniform, and His Endeavours for a Settlement conſtant; beſides His Adverſities had
illuſtrated, if not calcined, His Endowments. For now when He had no Friends,
Counſellors, or Secretaries, His Diſcourſes with Commiſſioners upon their ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
and His Declarations of His own Injuries, the Nations Slavery, the Injuſtice
of His and their Adverſaries, were ſo excellently and prudently managed, that they
undeceived the greateſt part, and reconciled many of His bitter Enemies: therefore
the whole Nation now panted for a Return to the Obedience of ſuch an ineſtimable
Prince.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations cauſed ſeveral attempts for His Deliverance, ſome Private,
and others more Publick. The firſt was managed by thoſe Servants whom the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had placed about Him; for theſe won by His Goodneſs, of which they were
daily witneſſes, twice plotted His Eſcape, and ventured their Lives for His Liberty,
but failed in both deſigns: and the laſt being diſcovered before it could be put into
action, One <hi>Rolfe,</hi> a bloody Villain, (that had alſo endeavoured to poiſon Him, for
which though he was publickly accuſed, yet was acquitted by that Judge whom the
Conſpirators had employed to hear that Cauſe) waited to kill Him as He ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from His Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The more publick was that of the whole Nation; <label type="milestone">

draw up Petitions for a <hi>Perſonal Treaty with the</hi> King; <hi>that the Armies Arrears being paid,
they ſhould immediately be disbanded; that Relief ſhould be ſent into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and</hi> England
<hi>quite eaſed of the Contribution, which they could no longer bear.</hi> To theſe Petitions there
were ſuch innumerable Subſcriptions, that the Officers of the Army, and Parliament
were mad to ſee their Threats of Sequeſtration, Impriſonment and Death, to make no
Impreſſion; and the Promiſes they likewiſe made were ſlighted, becauſe diſcredited
by their former Perjuries. The firſt Petitioners were the <hi>Eſſex</hi> men, who came in
ſuch Numbers as had not been ſeen before, as if they would force, not intreat for, what
was neceſſary. After them thoſe of <hi>Surrey,</hi> whom, by the command of the Officers
and Parliament-men, the Souldiers aſſault at the Parliament-Doors, kill ſome, wound

more, and plunder all: and for this brave Exploit upon unarmed Petitioners, they
have the Thanks of the Commons, and a Largeſs for their Valour; that ſo the People
might be affrighted from offering Petitions, which before the very ſame men had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be <hi>the Birth-right of every Engliſh-man.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">While men ſee and admire the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of the Divine Juſtice, and the reciprocal motions of the Popular heat, that the
very ſame Parliament that firſt ſtirr'd up this way of tumultuary Petitions againſt
the <hi>King,</hi> now complained that the Honour and Safety of Parliaments was indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
by Petitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all their Tyranny upon the complaining Nation prevailed nothing but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them to a higher Indignation and more frequent Petitions. And when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
they dealt with men obſtinate to their own Intereſts, which were not to be
gained but by the Publick Ruine, they fly from Prayers to Arms, and intitle their juſt
War, <hi>For the Liberty of King and People.</hi> And in ſeveral places, as in <hi>Kent, Eſſex,
Suffolk, Norfolk, Cornwall, Yorkſhire, Wales,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Surrey,</hi> multitudes take Arms

The <hi>Scots</hi> likewiſe by an Order of their own Parliament ſend into <hi>England</hi> (to recover
the Liberty and Majeſty of the <hi>King</hi>) an Army under <hi>Hamilton.</hi> But all was in vain,
God had decreed other Triumphs for His Majeſty, and to tranſlate Him to another
Kingdom. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being but tumultuarily raiſed, having no train of Artillery
nor Ammunition conſiderable, were ſoon ſuppreſt by a veterane Army provided with
all neceſſaries. The <hi>Scots,</hi> either through weakneſs or wickedneſs of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who made ſo diſorderly a March, that their Van and Reer were forty miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
were eaſily worſted by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who ſurpriſed their main Body, and <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

they were likewiſe aſſaulted by <hi>Argyle,</hi> a domeſtick Enemy, and forced to ſubmit
thoſe Arms the Parliament had put into their hands to the Faction of that falſe Earl;
who calls another Parliament, from which all were excluded that in the former Voted
for the <hi>King</hi>'s Delivery, and all the Orders of that Convention made void. <hi>Cromwell</hi>
had the Publick Thanks, and the private Faith of <hi>Argyle</hi> to endeavour, as opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
permitted, the extirpation of Monarchy out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Navy alſo deſerts the <hi>Prince,</hi> being corrupted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who
was appointed for this Service; and when he had ingloriouſly bought off their Faith
to their lawful <hi>Prince,</hi> himſelf was ignominiouſly caſhiered by the Conſpirators. Theſe
great diſappointments and overthrows of juſt Enterpriſes men variouſly attributed to
different Cauſes. <hi rend="margQuotes">Some to the Perfidiouſneſs, others to the Weakneſs of thoſe that

Another ſort thought them unhappy, becauſe the greateſt part of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers

betrayed Him, and God would not now bleſs their unexpiated Arms. And ſome

                  </p>
                  <p>But while theſe things were managed by the Army that were now at a diſtance, and
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Terrors were greater in <hi>Scotland</hi> than here, the leſs guilty Parliament-men
ſeriouſly conſidering how impatient the People (who in <hi>London</hi> and other places had
gotten innumerable Subſcriptions to a Petition for a Perſonal Treaty) now were of
thoſe Injuries that were done to their Sovereign, how hateful themſelves grew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had betrayed and inſlaved their own Privileges together with the Liberties
of the Subject to an inſatiable and Phanatick Army, and how an evident Ruine attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even their Conqueſts of Him whom it was unlawful to aſſault, did at laſt (though
too late) contrary to the clamours of their factious and Democratick Members, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
thoſe Votes which they had formerly made, of <hi>No more Addreſſes</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi>
This being paſſed in both Houſes, they afterwards with a ſtrong Conſent vote a <hi>Treaty</hi>
with the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Honour, Freedom, and Safety.</hi> The factious Party in the Parliament
found themſelves too few and weak to oppoſe this impetuous tendency of the Two
Houſes and the whole Kingdom to Peace. But yet they endeavoured to fruſtrate the
labours of their more ſincere Members, and to baffle the People's juſt deſires of it, by
impoſing many unequal Conditions and obſtructive reſtrictions.</p>
                  <p>For they procured that the Treaty ſhould be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and not at <hi>London;</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60710:29"/>
that it ſhould be by Commiſſioners, and not immediately with the two Houſes, as was
petitioned. The Propoſitions that were ſent to be treated were the ſame which had
before been offered to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and were then rejected by Him, and
alſo condemned by the Army it ſelf as too unjuſt. The Commiſſioners were ſo ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Power, that it was not lawful for them to ſoften any one of the Conditions of
Peace, not to alter the Preface, or change the Order of the Propoſitions, nor to debate
a Subſequent till the Precedent were agreed on. They could conclude nothing; they
were only to propoſe the Demands, urge Reaſons for the Royal Aſſent, receive the
<hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer, and refer all in writing to the Parliament, whoſe ſlow Reſolves and
the delays of ſending were ſuppoſed would conſume that narrow meaſure of time which
was appointed to debate ſo many and ſo different things, for they were limited to
forty days. The Commiſſioners they ſent were five of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Houſe</hi> and twelve
of the <hi>Commoners,</hi> and with them ſome of their <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who were to preſs
importunately for their Church-government, to elude the <hi>King</hi>'s Arguments for Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,
and only to impoſe, not to diſpute, their own.</p>
                  <p>With all theſe, upon ſo many ſeveral and different Propoſitions, ſome relating to
the Law of the Land, others to Reaſon of State, and ſome to the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Primitive Churches, the <hi>King</hi> was to deal without publick aſſiſtance. For though
He was permitted the miniſtry of ſome Officers of State, Counſellours and Divines,
yet were they but of private advice, and to ſtand behind the Curtain; He only Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was to ſpeak in the debate, and ſingly to manage matters of Policy with their moſt
exerciſed Statiſts, and the points of Divinity with their beſt-ſtudied Divines. <hi rend="margQuotes">The
Vulgar, to whom the arts of theſe men were not ſo obvious, were much pleaſed
with the Name of a Treaty, and now hoped to exchange their Servitude under ſo
many importunate Tyrants, for the moderate and eaſie Government of one Lawful
<hi>King.</hi> Others that had a clearer inſight, and obſerved with what difficulties it was
burthened, hoped for no benefit from it. Becauſe that if His Majeſty ſhould not
conſent, as they believed he would not, then He would be the object of the popular
impatience: And if He ſhould conſent, He that now was thought to be moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
dealt with, would then be conceived not to deſerve the Pity even of his
Friends; nor could He gain any other thing by His Conceſſions, than to be ruined
with more Diſhonour. So that conſidering both the inviolable Integrity of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and the implacable Malice of His Enemies, they deſpaired of any happy Iſſue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beyond the Faith of theſe men, and the Hopes of the other, the <hi>King</hi>'s incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prudence had found Temperaments for their moſt harſh Propoſitions. And by a
preſent Judgment and commanding Eloquence did ſo urge His own, and refel their
Arguments, that He forced an Admiration of Himſelf, and, which was a Teſtimony
of the Divine Aſſiſtance, drew many of the unwilling Commiſſioners to His own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(though their Commiſſion, and the danger of their Lives, neceſſitated them,
contrary to the dictates of their own Conſciences, to prolong the Debates;) with a
wonderful Lenity proved their Demands unjuſt, yet granted what was not directly
againſt his Honour and Conſcience: thus deveſting Himſelf of His own Rights, He
demonſtrated that He had thoſe Affections which might juſtly ſtyle Him <hi>the Father of
His Country.</hi> For He endeavoured by His own Loſſes to repair the damages of His
People. Yet the <hi>King</hi> ſaw by the Obſtinacy of the moſt powerful of thoſe He treated
with, that they intended nothing leſs than Peace, nor any thing more than His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
which that it might be adequate to their Malice, they would have it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the damnation of His Soul (as He Himſelf in bitterneſs complained
to One of His Servants) preſſing Him to do thoſe things which they themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
ſinful, as the Alienation of Church-Lands. Although His Majeſty was
thus ſenſible of their inſatiable thirſt for His blood, yet becauſe He had paſſed His
Royal Word not to ſtir out of that Iſland, He did not hearken to the ſame Servant,
who perſwaded Him to provide for His Safety by flight, which He aſſured Him was
not difficult, and in adminiſtring to which He offered to hazard his own blood. But
the <hi>King</hi> always thought His Life beneath the Honour of Faithfulneſs, and would not
give His Enemies that advantage over His Fame, which their unjuſt Arms and Frauds
had gotten upon His Perſon, chuſing rather to endure whatſoever Providence had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
for Him, than by any approach to Infamy ſeek to protract thoſe days which He
now began to be weary of: For <hi>that life is no longer deſirable to Juſt Princes, which their
People either cannot or will not preſerve.</hi> And He thought <hi>it more Eligible to die by the
Wickedneſs of Others, than to live by His own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the Treaty thus preceeded, the Army under the Command of the Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60710:30"/>
and <hi>Ireton,</hi> (this laſt was bold, ſubtle, perfidious and active in all deſigns; ſo that
his Soul being congenial with that of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> had been the cauſe of an Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, for he had married one of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Daughters, and therefore was left
to hover about the General as an evil <hi>Genius,</hi> that he might do nothing contrary to
their Impious Deſign,) drew towards <hi>London,</hi> and quartered within half a days march
from the City; that, if their Intereſt did require, they might the more ſuddenly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
thoſe who were leſs favourable to their Enterpriſes. The Officers did at firſt
publickly profeſs a great Modeſty, as that <hi>they would quietly ſubmit to the Orders of the
Parliament; that they did prefer the Common Peace to their own private Advantages, and
ſhould be glad to be diſmiſſed from the toyls of War:</hi> yet in private practiſed an univerſal
Confuſion, for mingling counſels with their Factious party in the two Houſes, they ſet
up again the meetings of their Adjutators, framed among themſelves Petitions againſt
the Treaty, and to require that all Delinquents without difference (wherein they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Perſon of the <hi>King</hi>) might be brought to Tryal; and by their Emiſſaries
abroad drew ſome inconſiderable and ignominious perſons, (by repreſenting large
ſpoils in the ſubverſion of Monarchy, and imaginary advantages by the change of
Government,) to ſubſcribe to them.</p>
                  <p>When they thought theſe practices had produced their deſired effect, and they had
infected moſt of the Souldiers in the ſeveral Garriſons, and that more parties of their
Army were gathered to their Quarters about <hi>London; Ireton,</hi> under pretext of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
betwixt him and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> withdraws himſelf privately to <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, where
being met by ſome of his Complices in the Parliament, they joyntly frame a Declaration
in an imperious and affected Style. Wherein in the name of the Army he maliciouſly
declaims againſt all Peace with the <hi>King,</hi> and His Reſtitution to the Government: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he impiouſly demands that he may be dealt with as the Grand and Capital
Delinquent: with theſe he mingles ſome things to terrifie the Parliament, ſome to
pleaſe the Souldiers, and others to raiſe hopes of Novelty in the Rabble.</p>
                  <p>This being prepared, and the Treaty now drawing towards an End (which thoſe
of the Faction had prolonged and diſturbed, that the Army might have more time to
gather together) and the Commanders having a perfect Intelligence how all things
in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> and in the Parliament did ſtrongly tend to an Accommodation,
they thought it now ſeaſonable to begin their intended Crime. Therefore they ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
call a Council of War, at which met the Colonels, and other inferiour Officers,
all men of Mercenary ſouls, ſeditious, covetous, and ſo accuſtomed to Diſſimulation,
that they ſeemed to be compoſed by nature to frame and colour impoſtures. They
began their Meeting with Prayers and Faſting, pretending to inquire and ſeek the
Will of God concerning the Wickedneſs they had predetermined to act. <hi>This is the
conſtant practice of ſuch who would moſt ſecurely abuſe the Patience of the People, while they
commit the moſt horrid Crimes. For not being able to honeſt their Iniquities by any colour of
Reaſon, or any Command of the known Will of God, they pretend to a guidance by Revelation
and Returns of Prayer.</hi> This Impoſture they had hitherto ſucceſsfully uſed; and the
credulous Rabble of the common Souldiers were drawn to a perſwaſion, that God did
counſel all the Deſigns of theſe armed Saints. Thus having prefaced their Villany,
<hi>Ireton</hi> produces his Remonſtrance, which being read among them, was received by the
<hi>Souldiers</hi> (who, <hi>through a pleaſure in blood, and hopes of Spoil, are uſed to praiſe every thing
of their Chiefs, whether good or bad, that tends to diſturbance, and continuance of War,</hi>)
with as great an Applauſe as if it had been an Oracle from Heaven; and to make it
the more terrible, they ſtyled it the <hi>Remonſtrance of the Army,</hi> and order it to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Parliament in the name of <hi>the Army and People of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">When this Remonſtrance was publiſhed, the minds of men were variouſly affected.
Some wondred that perſons of ſo abject a Condition ſhould dare to endeavour the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of an ancient Government, an attempt ſo far above their fortune; and to
deſign againſt the Perſon of their Sovereign, who by the Splendour of His former
Majeſty, and by a continued Deſcent from ſo many Royal Progenitors, had deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all that challenges the Reverence of the People. And they thought the act ſo
full of a manifeſt Wickedneſs, that the Contrivers could not really intend the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
but only uſed it as a Mormo to frighten the <hi>King</hi> and Parliament to hearken
to their Pretenſions of a leſſer guilt. Others conſidering their former Crimes and
Injuries both to <hi>King</hi> and People, and their damnable blaſphemies of the Almighty
God, did truly judge that their preceding Iniquities had now habituated and temper'd
them for the extremeſt miſchiefs; and that having proceeded thus far, they would
think their Safety conſiſted in an accumulation of their Sins. Only they admired that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60710:30"/>
theſe men would diſcredit their ancient Arts of pretending to God's Direction, (in
which they could not ſo eaſily by every Vulgar judgment be deprehended,) by boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Concurrence of the People, which was too evident a Cheat, for not one
in a thouſand through the whole Nation but did abominate their practices. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more Speculative knew it was <hi>the accuſtomed Method of the Subverters of a lawful
Magiſtracy and Invaders of a Tyranny, firſt to ſeek the favour of the Rabble by high pretences
of Liberty and Juſtice, and then to boaſt of it as though they had it, and were entruſted by the
People to recover what they preſented to their hopes and deſires;</hi> and that theſe men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame practices, would be the greateſt Oppreſſors of thoſe whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to vindicate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament though hitherto they had been very obſequious to the Army, yet
the Members now meeting in greater Numbers than uſually, and preferring the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
hazards to a Compliance with this Remonſtrance, laid it aſide, and fell to debate
the <hi>King's Conceſſions</hi> which then lay before them. This free and ſtout Carriage of
theirs was much reſented by the Souldiers, who ſtormed at the contempt of thoſe
whoſe grandeur depended upon their Arms. And leſt they ſhould miſcarry in their
chief deſign, and loſe the Sacrifice to their Ambition, they immediately ſent a party
of their Army into the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>King:</hi> theſe laying hold upon Him,
with a moſt Inſolent Rudeneſs, not permitting the delay of a Breakfaſt, forced Him
from the <hi>Iſland</hi> into <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> an unwholeſome and ſordid place. The other part
of their Army they cauſe to march towards <hi>London,</hi> with all the imaginable ſigns of
terror, as if they went to ſack and plunder an Enemies Town. When they had entred,
they were quartered in thoſe Houſes of the <hi>King</hi> and Nobility which were neareſt the
Parliament-Houſe, hoping by the greatneſs and nearneſs of the danger, ſo to affright
thoſe Members who were not ſo wicked as to comply with them, that they ſhould
voluntarily withdraw, and hiding themſelves, leave the poſſeſſion to their own ſcanty
party. For then the violence would ſeem leſs, and give more Authority to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Decrees.</p>
                  <p>But the honeſt Members were more in love with Juſtice, and therefore not terrified
with the Menaces and Clamours of the Souldiers, but as inſpired with ſome unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
Courage at this time, and thinking themſelves guarded by the Priviledges of
Parliament, with a greater boldneſs than uſually they did upon juſt deſigns, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Houſe. Where the <hi>Commoners</hi> re-aſſuming the conſideration of the <hi>King's
Conceſſions,</hi> continued that Debate till paſt Midnight; the Factious party and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Army ſtill raiſing new Doubts and Scruples, multiplying Cavils, and by
tedious Harangues waſting the time, that the moſt juſt party, which conſiſted moſt
of Gentlemen of Fortunes, not accuſtomed to ſuch Watchings and Faſtings, might be
wearied out and leave them to their own Reſolves: and alſo that they might give time
to the whole Army to march into the <hi>City</hi> that Night. Among the reſt, Sir <hi>Henry
Vane,</hi> (who was born to diſquiet the World, and to be a firebrand of Communities,
yet ſtill carrying the deſigns of Confuſion under a feigned meekneſs and ſimplicity of
the Goſpel) This man in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> had perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> not to be prodigal
in His <hi>Conceſſions;</hi> that He had already yielded more than was fit for them to ask, or
Him to grant, and undertook to make it evident to the whole World: yet now did
moſt fiercely and perfidiouſly inveigh againſt the <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> as deſigned by the <hi>King</hi>
under the ſpecies of Peace to ruine the Parliament and Commonwealth. Yet at laſt,
notwithſtanding thoſe terrours without and troubles within, the Houſe came to this
Reſolve, that <hi>The King's Conceſſions were a ſufficient ground for Peace.</hi> Which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by 200 Voices, and there were ſcarce 60 diſſenters.</p>
                  <p>The next day the ſame Reſolve was paſſed by the <hi>Lords</hi> in the very ſame terms,
not one diſſenting. Who immediately adjourned for a week, to wait whether this
fury of the Army would ſpend it ſelf after ſo generous an oppoſition. And the Houſe
of Commons ſent ſome of their own Members to acquaint the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his
Officers of this their Vote. This free and publick deteſtation of the Crime, that was
deſigned, did extremely enrage the Projectors of it, and the Democratick party in the
Houſe mingled Threatnings with their Advices. For one of the Chiefs of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could not forbear to aſſure them, that <hi>If they continued in this their Reſolve, they
ſhould never after have Liberty of meeting there again.</hi> Which accordingly was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for the next day they were to meet there, the Colonels had placed a guard of two
Regiments of Foot and one of Horſe upon the Houſe of Commons, who ſtrictly
keeping all the Avenues thereto, that none might enter without their Licence, laid
hold upon forty Members that were Perſons of the moſt known Integrity and higheſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60710:31"/>
Reſolution; they denied admiſſion to 150 more, and ſuffered none to enter of whoſe
ſervile compliance they were not well aſſured. Some that had eſcaped their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and got into the Houſe, by tickets, as from Friends or Servants, they invite forth;
whom being once without doors they violently force away, while they in vain pleaded
the <hi>Priviledges of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The impriſoned Members they vex and torture with great Indignities, expoſing
them to the mockeries and inſolencies of the Common Souldiers: although there were
among them many that had before Commanded Armies, Brigades and Regiments in
the Parliament's cauſe againſt the <hi>King;</hi> and others that had been moſt importunate
aſſertors of their firſt injustice to their Prince. <hi rend="margQuotes">Thoſe that beheld theſe viciſſitudes
wondred, and acknowledged the juſt Judgement of God, that had thus viſibly and
properly puniſhed the Injuſtice of theſe men againſt their Lawful Sovereign, by the

with the falſeneſs of their Principles by which they acted againſt the <hi>King;</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſcarce the eighth part of that Convention, and not much above forty in all, and
others that did abhor the Conditions of ſitting there withdrew themſelves to their own
homes. And many of thoſe who formerly deluded by their pretenſions to Religion,
Juſtice and Liberty, had hitherto been of the Faction, yet now awakened by theſe
clamorous Crimes, forſook their bloody Confederacy.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not this contemptible Number, of which in moſt Votes there were Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Diſſenters, bluſh to aſſume the Authority of managing the weightieſt affairs of the
<hi>Engliſh Empire,</hi> to alter and change the Government, to expoſe His Majeſty to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Murder, and to overthrow the Ancient Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. For
being wholly devoted to the ſervice of the Army, they communicated counſels with
them; and whatſoever was reſolved at the <hi>Council</hi> of War, paſſed into a Law by the
Votes of this Infamous remnant of the Houſe of Commons, who now ſerved the
Souldiers in hopes of part of the Spoil, and a precarious <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> which <hi>being acquired
by ſo much Wickedneſs could not be laſting.</hi> In order therefore to the Army's deſign they
revive thoſe Votes of <hi>No Addreſſes to the</hi> King; (which had at firſt but ſurreptitiouſly
and by baſe practices paſſed, and had been afterwards repealed by a full Houſe.) Thoſe
Votes of <hi>a Treaty with the King,</hi> and of the <hi>Satisfactorineſs of His Conceſſions,</hi> with ſcorn
they raſed out of the <hi>Journal</hi>-Book. And then proceeded to Vote,

                        <item>5. That to raiſe Arms againſt the People's Repreſentative or Parliament, and to make War
upon them, is High Treaſon.</item>
                        <item>6. That the <hi>King</hi> Himſelf took Arms againſt the Parliament, and on that account is guilty

                     <hi rend="margQuotes">Thoſe that were leſs affected with the common Fears and Miſeries could not
temper their mirth and ſcorn at ſuch ridiculous Uſurpers, that thought to adjuſt

the Spoils of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and in the next rob the People to inveſt themſelves. And

they had enjoyed the height of Liberty, ſo under theſe men they were to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed

Foundation of our Laws, could not be deſigned but for ſome horrid Impiety and our
laſting Bondage, which came ſo to paſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in their next Conſultations they conſtitute a <hi>Tribunal</hi> to ſentence their <hi>Sovereign</hi>
(which afterwards they uſed as a Shambles for the moſt Loyal and Gallanteſt of the
<hi>Nobleſs</hi> and <hi>People</hi>) of the moſt abject Subjects; and to procure a Reverence to the
Vileſt of men, they give it the ſpecious name of <hi>The High Court of Justice.</hi> For
which they appoint 150 Judges (that the Number might ſeem to repreſent the whole
Multitude) of the moſt violent and heady of all the Faction: To whom they give <hi>a
power of citing, hearing, judging and puniſhing</hi> CHARLES STUART <hi>King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
To make up this Number they had named ſix <hi>Peers</hi> of the Upper Houſe, and
the twelve <hi>Judges</hi> of the Land. But the greateſt part were Officers of the Army
(who having confederated againſt His Majeſty, and publickly required His Blood,
could not without a contempt to the light of Reaſon be appointed His Judges) and
Members of the Lower Houſe, who were moſt violent againſt Monarchy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all Government wherein themſelves had no ſhare. The reſt were Perſons pick'd
out of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs thereof, who they imagined would be moſt
obſequious to their Luſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">Thoſe that ſurveyed the Liſt, and knew the men, deemed them moſt unfit for a
Truſt of Juſtice, and proper Inſtruments for any wicked undertaking; for of theſe
Judges one or two were <hi>Coblers,</hi> others <hi>Brewers,</hi> one a <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> and many of them
<hi>Mechanicks.</hi> Such among them as were deſcended of ancient Families, were Men
of ſo mean worth that they were only like the <hi>Statues</hi> of their Anceſtors, had nothing
but their Names to make them knownunto the World. Some of them were <hi>Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts,
Bankrupts,</hi> (ſuch as could be neither ſafe nor free, unleſs the Kingdom were
in Bondage) and moſt notorious <hi>Adulterers,</hi> whoſe every Member was infamous with
its proper Vice; Vain and Atheiſtical in their Diſcourſe, Cowardly and Baſe in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Bloody and Cruel in their Counſels, and thoſe Parts that cannot honeſtly be
named were moſt diſhoneſt. <hi>One</hi> of them was accuſed of a <hi>Rape; Another</hi> had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a <hi>Book</hi> of Blaſphemies againſt the <hi>Trinity of the Deity.</hi> Some of them could
not hope to get <hi>impunity</hi> for their Oppreſſions of the Country and Expilations of the
publick Treaſure, but by their miniſtry to this Murther. Others could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
themſelves an <hi>advancement</hi> of their abject or declining Fortune but by this Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Yet all theſe by the Faction were inrolled in the Regiſter of Saints, though
fitter to ſtandas Malefactors at the Bar, than to ſit upon Seats of Judgment. And
notwithſtanding their diligent ſearch for ſuch a Number of Men, who would not
bluſh at nor fear any guilt, ſome of thoſe whom they had named, in abhorrencie
of the Impiety, refuſed to ſit; and ſome that did, yet met there in hopes of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
their Counſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this while the Houſe of <hi>Peers</hi> were not conſulted, and it was commonly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that moſt of them terrified with thoſe Preparations againſt the <hi>King (the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Nobleſs againſt the Popular Envie)</hi> would abſent themſelves from that Houſe,
except four or five that were the Darlings of the Faction; and they deemed the
Names and Compliance of thoſe few were enough to give credit and Authority to
their bloody Act. But in them they were diſappointed alſo; for ſome of the <hi>Peers</hi> did
conſtantly meet, and on that day wherein the <hi>Bill for Trial of the King</hi> was carried
up to that Houſe, there were Seventeen then preſent (a greater Number than uſual,)
who all Unanimouſly (even the Democratick Lords not diſſenting) did reject <hi>the Bill as
Dangerous and Illegal.</hi> This ſo highly provoked the Fury of the Faction, that they
meditated a ſevere revenge, and for the preſent blotted out thoſe <hi>Peers,</hi> whoſe Names
they had before put into their Ordinance, to make the Court more ſplendid. After
this they did alſo raſe out the names of the <hi>Judges of the Land;</hi> for they being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
conſulted concerning theſe Proceedings againſt the <hi>King,</hi> (although they had
been all raiſed to that Dignity and Truſt by the Faction, yet) anſwered that <hi>It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the known Laws and Cuſtoms of</hi> England, <hi>that the King ſhould be brought to Tryal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To heal theſe two wounds which the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> had branded their Cauſe
with, they uſe two other Artifices to keep up the Spirits and Concurrence of their
Party. Firſt, they bring from <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> a Woman (ſome ſay a <hi>Witch</hi>) who ſaid,
that <hi>God by a Revelation to her did approve of the Armie's Proceedings.</hi> Which Meſſage
from Heaven was well accepted of with thanks, <hi>as being very ſeaſonable, and coming
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60710:32"/>
from an humble Spirit.</hi> A ſecond was the <hi>Agreement of the People,</hi> which was a Module
of a <hi>Democratical</hi> Polity, wherein thoſe whoſe abject Condition had ſet them at a great
diſtance from Government, had their hopes raiſed to a ſhare of it, if they conſpired
to remove the great Obſtruction, which was the Perſon and Life of the <hi>King.</hi> This
was preſented to the Houſe of Commons by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> and ſixteen other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
as a temporary remedy; for when they had perpetrated their Impiety, they
diſcountenanced and fiercely profecuted thoſe that endeavoured it.</p>
                  <p>In confidence of theſe their Arts and their preſent Power, notwithſtanding all theſe
publick Abhorrencies and Deteſtations by all Perſons of Honour and Knowledge, they
enacted their Bill. And for <hi>Preſident</hi> of this Court, they choſe one of the Number,
<hi>John Bradſhaw;</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">A perſon of an equal Infamy with his new employment, a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of Impudence, and a moſt fierce Proſecutor of evil purpoſes. Of no repute
among thoſe of his own Robe for any Knowledge in the Law: but of ſo virulent
and petulant a Language, that he knew no meaſure of modeſty in Speaking; and
was therefore more often bribed to be ſilent, than fee'd to maintain a Client's cauſe.
His Vices had made him penurious, and thoſe with his penury had ſeaſoned him for
any execrable undertaking.</hi> They alſo had a <hi>Sollicitor</hi> of the ſame metal, <hi>John
Cook.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">A needy Man, who by various Arts and many Crimes had ſought for a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Subſiſtence, yet ſtill ſo poor, that he was forced to ſeek the ſhelter of obſcure
and ſordid Corners to avoid the Priſon. So that vexed with a redious Poverty, he
was prevailed upon through the hopes of ſome ſplendid booties to venture on this
employment, which at the firſt mention he did profeſs to abhorr.</hi> Theſe were their
chief Agents: other inferiour Miniſters they had equally qualified with theſe their
prime Inſtruments, as <hi>Doriſlaus</hi> a German <hi>Bandito,</hi> who was to draw up the Charge;
<hi>Steel</hi> another of their Counſel, under pretence of ſickneſs covered his fear of the Event,
though he did not abhor the wickedneſs of the Enterpriſe, having before uſed his
Tongue in a cauſe very unjuſt, and relating to this, the Murther of Captain <hi>Burleigh.</hi>
The <hi>Serjeants, Clarks</hi> and <hi>Cryer</hi> were ſo obſcure, that the World had never taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them, but by their ſubſerviency to this Impiety.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the publick Preparations; In private they continually met to contrive
the Form of their Proceedings, and the Matter of their Accuſation. Concerning the
firſt they were divided in Opinions. Some would have the <hi>King</hi> firſt formally degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and deveſted of all His Royal habiliments and Enſigns of Majeſty, and then as a
private perſon expoſed to Juſtice. But this ſeemed to require a longer ſpace of time
than would comport with their project, which, as all horrid acts, was to be done in
a preſent fury, leſt good Counſels might gather ſtrength by their Delay. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
this courſe as too evidently conforming with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> procedure againſt <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes,</hi> and they feared to confirm that common Suſpicion, that they followed
<hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Counſels (whoſe <hi>Society</hi> (it is reported) upon the <hi>King</hi>'s offering to give all
poſſible Security againſt the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at a Council of theirs
did decree to uſe their whole Intereſt and Power with the Faction to haſten the <hi>King</hi>'s
death.) Which ſober <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had reaſon enough to believe, becauſe all or moſt of
the Arguments which were uſed by the Aſſertors of this Violence on His Majeſty were
but gleanings from <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers. Theſe Conſiderations caſt the Determination on
their ſide who, deſigning a Tyrannical <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> whereby they themſelves might
have a ſhare in the Government, would have the <hi>King</hi> proceeded againſt as <hi>King,</hi> that
by ſo ſhedding His Blood they might extinguiſh Majeſty, and with Him murther
Monarchy. For ſeveral of them did confeſs, that indeed He was guilty of no Crime
more than that He was their <hi>King,</hi> and becauſe the Excellency of His Parts, and
Eminent Vertues, together with the Rights of His Birth, would not ſuffer Him to be
a private Perſon.</p>
                  <p>In their ſecond debate about the Matter of Accuſation, all willingly embraced
the Advice of <hi>Harriſon</hi> (who was emulous of the Power of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and though
now his Creature, yet afterwards became the Firebrand and Whirlwind of the
following Times) <hi>to blacken Him</hi> as much as they could; yet found they not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to pollute His Name. For their old Scandals which they had amaſſed in their
Declaration for no more Addreſſes to the <hi>King</hi> had been ſo publickly refuted that they
could afford no colour for His Murther. Therefore they formed their Accuſation
from that War to which they had neceſſitated Him. And their Charge was, that <hi>He
had levied War against the Parliament; that He had appeared in Arms in ſeveral places, and
did there proclaim War, and executed it by killing ſeveral of the Good People; for which they
impeached Him as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer, and an implacable Common Enemy.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">This
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60710:32"/>
Charge, in the Judgment of Conſidering Men argued a greater guilt in thoſe that
proſecuted it, than in Him againſt whom it was formed: for they ſeemed leſs ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the inſtability and infirmities of Humane Nature, than thoſe that had none
but her light to make them generous, for ſuch never reproached their conquered
Enemies with their Victory; but theſe Men would murther their own Prince,
againſt whom they had nothing more to object than the unhappy iſſues of a <hi>War,</hi>
which <hi>leaves the Conquered the only Criminal, while the names of Juſtice and Goodneſs are
the ſpoils of the Conquerour.</hi> How falſe thoſe Imputations of <hi>Tyranny, Treaſon</hi> and
<hi>Murther</hi> were, was ſufficiently underſtood by thoſe who conſidered the peaceful part
of the <hi>King</hi>'s Reign; wherein it was judged, that if in any thing He had declined from
the ſafeſt arts of Empire, it was in the neglect of a juſt Severity on Seditious Perſons
whom the Laws had condemned to die. And in the War it was known how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his Lenity had clipped the Wings of Victory. But it appeared that theſe Men,
as they had broken all Rights of Peace, ſo they would alſo thoſe of Conqueſt, and
deſtroy that which their Arms pretended to ſave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How little Credit their Accuſation found, appeared by the endeavours of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to preſerve the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon from Danger, and the Nation from the guilt of His
Blood. For while they were thus ingaged to perpetrate their intended Miſchiefs, all
Parties declare againſt it. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, almoſt all thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> and
very many out of the ſeveral <hi>Counties,</hi> and ſome, though few, alſo of the <hi>Independents,</hi>
did in their Sermons and Conferences, as alſo by Monitory Letters, Petitions, Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Remonſtrances, publickly divulged, adjure the Aſſaſſinates not to draw ſo
great a Guilt upon themſelves and the whole Nation by that Murder. <hi>For it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to thoſe numerous and fearful Obligations of their many Oaths; to the Publick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Faith, which was exprest in their Protestations and many Declarations; to the Laws of
the Land, thoſe of Nature, and Nations, and the Commands of Scripture. That it was to the
diſhonour of our Religion, and againſt the publick good of the Kingdom.</hi> But all was fruitleſs,
for they had loſt their Miniſterial Authority by ſerving the Faction ſo long, till they
needed not their aſſiſtance, and deſpiſed their admonitions: Beſides the very ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they preached to kindle the War were now beat back into their faces, and made
uſe of againſt them to adjuſt the Murder. The people alſo contemned them for their
ſhort-ſightedneſs, in that they would be the heady and indiſcreet Inſtruments of ſuch
men, and in ſuch practices as muſt of neceſſity at laſt ruine them and all Miniſters, as
well as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> alſo by their Commiſſioners declare and proteſt againſt it. The <hi>States of
Holland</hi> by their Ambaſſadors (if they were faithful in their truſt) did intercede, and
deprecate it as moſt deſtructive to the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt.</hi> Some of the moſt eminent of
the <hi>Nobility,</hi> as the <hi>Earl of Southampton,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Richmond,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs of Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
the <hi>Earl of Lindſey,</hi> and others, neglect no ways, either by Prayers or Ranſom to
ſave the <hi>King.</hi> Yea they offered themſelves, as being the prime Miniſters of the <hi>King</hi>'s
Commands, as <hi>Hoſtages</hi> for Him, and if the Conſpirators muſt needs be fed with
blood, to ſuffer in His ſtead for whatſoever he had done amiſs. The <hi>Prince</hi> piouſly aſſays
all ways and means to deliver His Father from the danger. For beſides the <hi>States Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi>
(whom He had procured) both He and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> did daily ſend
as Agents the Kindred, Relations, and Allies of <hi>Cromwell, Ireton,</hi> and the other Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
with full power to propoſe any Conditions, make any Promiſes, and uſe all
Threatnings to divert them, if it were poſſible, from their intended Cruelty, or at leaſt
to gain ſome time before the Execution. But all was in vain, for no Conditions of Peace
could pleaſe them who were poſſeſſed with unlawful and immoderate deſires: their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
(that is more impetuous than all other affections) had ſwallowed the hopes of
Empire; therefore they would remove the <hi>King</hi> to enthrone themſelves. Some thought
that their deſpair of Pardon had hardened them to a greater Inhumanity, for if after
all theſe attempts they continued the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, they muſt beg their own; which
they knew Juſtice would not, and they reſolved Mercy ſhould not give; for this is
reckoned among the benefits which we hate to receive, and <hi>Men are uſually aſhamed to
confeſs they deſerved death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever it was that truly made them thus cruel, they publickly pretended no
other Motive than the <hi>Calls</hi> and <hi>Ducts of Providence,</hi> and the <hi>Impulſes</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed

that there were in the Army 5000 Saints, no leſs holy than thoſe that now in Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed

                  <p>Into which Scene the <hi>King</hi> enter'd with a generous Miene, ſhewing no ſigns of

in Him the frailty of our Humane condition, whoſe higheſt Greatneſs hath no

                  <p>He being ſet, the Charge againſt Him was read, with all thoſe reproachful terms of
<hi>Tyrant, Traytor,</hi> and <hi>Murderer;</hi> after which He was impleaded in the name of the

                  <p>The Magnanimity of the <hi>King</hi> in this Days Conteſt with theſe inhumane Butchers
did much ſatisfie the People, and they were glad (while they thought not of His
Danger) that He wanted not either Speech or Courage againſt ſo powerful Enemies;
that He had ſpoken nothing unworthy of Himſelf, and had preſerved the Fame of
His. Vertues even in ſo great Adverſities. For He ſeemed to triumph over their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
whoſe Arms He was now ſubject to. The Parricides ſought to break his Spirit
by making His appearances frequent before ſuch contemptible Judges, and often expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Him to the contempt of the Armed Rabble; therefore four days they torture Him
with the Impudence and Reproaches of their Infamous Sollicitor and Preſident. But
He ſtill refuſed to own their Authority, which they could not prove lawful, and ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60710:33"/>
excellently demonſtrated their abominable Impiety, that He made Colonel <hi>Downes,</hi> one
of their Court, to boggle at and diſturb their Proceedings. They therefore at laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to take away that Life which was not to be ſeparated from Conſcience and
Honour, and pronounced their Sentence of Death upon their Lawful and Juſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
<hi>Jan.</hi> 27. not ſuffering Him to ſpeak after the Decree of their Villany, but hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Him back to the place of His Reſtraint.</p>
                  <p>At His departure He was expoſed to all the Inſolencies and Indignities that a phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and baſe Rabble, inſtigated by <hi>Peters</hi> and other <hi>Inſtructors of Villany,</hi> could invent
and commit. And He ſuffer'd many things ſo conformable to <hi>Christ</hi> His <hi>King,</hi> as did
alleviate the ſenſe of them in Him, and alſo inſtruct Him to a correſpondent Patience
and Charity. When the barbarous Souldiers cried out at His departure, <hi>Juſtice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Execution, Execution,</hi> as thoſe deceived <hi>Jews</hi> did once to their KING, <hi>Cruciſie Him,
Crucifie Him;</hi> this <hi>Prince,</hi> in imitation of that moſt <hi>Holy King,</hi> pitied their blind fury,
and ſaid, <hi>Poor Souls! for a piece of Money they would do as much for their Commanders.</hi> As
He paſſed along, ſome in defiance ſpit upon His Garments, and one or two (as it was
reported by an Officer of theirs, who was one of their Court, and praiſed it as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Souldiers Gallantry, while others were ſtupefied with their prodigious
baſeneſs) polluted His Majeſtick Countenance with their unclean ſpittle: the <hi>Good
King,</hi> reflecting on His great <hi>Exemplar</hi> and Maſter, wiped it off, ſaying, <hi>My Saviour
ſuffer'd far more than this for me.</hi> Into His very Face they blowed their ſtinking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
which they knew was very diſtaſteful to Him; and in the way where He was
to go, juſt at His Feet, they flung down pieces of their naſty Pipes. And as they had
deveſted themſelves of all Humanity, ſo were they impatient and furious if any one
ſhewed Reverence or Pity to Him as He paſſed. (For <hi>no honest Spirit could be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of humane fruilty, as not to be troubled at ſuch a ſight; to ſee a Great and Juſt King,
the rightful Lord of three flouriſhing Kingdoms, now forced from His Throne, and led captive
through the Streets.)</hi> Such as pull'd off their Hats, or bowed to Him, they beat with
their Fiſts and Weapons, and knock'd down one dead but for crying out, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
unto Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they had brought Him to His Chamber, even there they ſuffered Him not
to reſt, but thruſting in and ſmoaking their filthy Tobacco, they permitted Him no
Privacy to <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation.</hi> Thus through variety of Tortures did the <hi>King</hi>
paſs this Day, and by His Patience wearied His Tormentors: nothing unworthy His
former greatneſs of Fortune and Mind by all theſe Affronts was extorted from Him,
though <hi>Indignities and Injuries are unuſual to Princes,</hi> and theſe were ſuch as might have
forced Paſſion from the beſt-tempered meekneſs, had it not been ſtrengthned with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
from Heaven. In the Evening the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> were acquainted by a Member
of the Army, of the <hi>King</hi>'s deſire, that ſeeing His Death was nigh, it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to ſee His <hi>Children,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and that Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi>
then Lord <hi>Biſhop of London,</hi> (now <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury</hi>) might be admitted to
pray with Him in His private Chamber. The firſt they did not ſcruple at, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in their power being but two, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Glocester,</hi> and
they very young. The ſecond they did not readily grant. Some would have had <hi>Peters</hi>
to undertake that Employment for which the Biſhop was ſent for: But he declined it
with ſome Scoffs, as knowing that the <hi>King</hi> hated the Offices of ſuch an unhallowed
Buffoon. So that at laſt they permitted the Biſhop's acceſs to the <hi>King,</hi> to whom his
eminent Integrity had made him dear. For with ſo wonderful a Prudence and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs
he had managed the envious Office of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> that that accuſing age
eſpecially of <hi>Church-men,</hi> found not matter for any Impeachment, nor ground for the
leaſt Reproach.</p>
                  <p>The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was removed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where the <hi>Biſhop
of London</hi> read Divine Service, and preached before Him in private on theſe words, <hi>In
the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi>
While the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> at this time, and alſo at other times, were performing
the <hi>Divine Service,</hi> the rude Souldiers often ruſhed in and diſturbed their <hi>Offices</hi> with
vulgar and baſe Scoffs, vain and frivolous Queſtions. The Commanders likewiſe and
other impertinent <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> did interrupt His Meditations, who came to tempt and
try Him, and provoke Him to ſome unneceſſary diſputations. But He maintained
His own Cauſe with ſo irrefragable Arguments, that He put ſome to ſilence, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancy
of others He neglected, and with a modeſt contempt diſſembled their Scoffs
and Reproaches. In the narrow ſpace of this one Day, and under ſo continued Affronts
and Diſturbances, the <hi>King</hi> (whoſe whole Soul was totally compoſed to Religion,)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60710:34"/>
applied Himſelf, as much as was poſſible, to the Reading Holy Scriptures, to Prayer,
Confeſſion of Sins, Supplications for the forgiveneſs of his Enemies, the receiving the
Euchariſt, holy Conferences, and all the Offices of Piety: ſo under the utmoſt Malice
and Hatred of men, He laboured for the Mercy of God, and to fit Himſelf for His laſt
victory over Death.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus ſpent this day, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the ſeveral Churches in <hi>London,</hi>
and in thoſe parts of the Kingdom where His danger was known, were very earneſt
in their Prayers to God for His Diliverance and Spiritual Aſſiſtance. <hi rend="margQuotes">Some of them
in their Sermons declared the horrour of that ſin that was about to be committed,
deteſted the Impiety of the Parricides, and denounced the heavy Judgments which
ſuch a ſinful Nation polluted with their Prince's blood were to expect. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi>
were diſſolved into Tears. Some bewailed the ſad Condition of the <hi>King,</hi>
as the effect of the Sins of the Nation. Others curſed their damnable Credulity of
the Slanders of that Juſt man, and the promiſes of Liberty by their Impoſtors. And
another ſort wept, becauſe their Fears did prognoſticate thoſe Miſeries which the
Iſſue of His blood would let in upon them. And every one found matter of grief,
fear, and indignation in the loſs of ſo Excellent a Prince. All countenances were
full of ſadneſs and aſtoniſhment, there was no Tumults nor any Quiet, every one
liſtning and hearkning, either as impatient to know the greatneſs of their Miſery,
or greedy to receive ſome hopes of Comfort in their Sovereign's Safety; otherwiſe
there was a ſtilneſs like that which too ſtrong Paſſions effect, and might be thought
a Stupidity rather than a Calmneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. the <hi>King</hi> was permitted the ſight of His Children.
His conference and words with them was taken in writing and communicated to the
World by the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> His Daughter, a Lady of moſt eminent Endowments;
who though born in the ſupremeſt Fortune, yet lived in continual Tears, the paſſages
of her Life being ſpent in beholding the Ruines of her Family, and the Murther of her
dear Father, whom ſhe not long ſurvived, but died in that Confinement to which they
had cheated His Majeſty, in <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While theſe things were done in publick, the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> meet in private in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
to appoint every one their part in this Tragedy, determine what Geſtures
they were to affect, what Words they were to uſe, as alſo for the manner, place and
time of the <hi>Murther.</hi> In which Conſultations, both now and before the Sentence, each
one, according to the bloodineſs of his temperament, or ſervilely to flatter <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
by their Cruelty to Him that did obſtruct his Ambition, did propoſe ſeveral ways ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of contempt or hatred in killing their ſentenced, yet anointed, <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Some
would have His Head and Quarters faſtned upon Poles (as it is uſual with Traitors)
that the marks of their Curelty might out-laſt His Death. Others would have Him
hanged, as they puniſhed Thieves and Murtherers. Others gave their Vote that He
ſhould ſuffer in His Royal Habiliments with His Crown, and in His Robes, that it
might be a Triumph of the Peoples power over <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt they think it ſufficient that He ſhould loſe His Head by the ſtroak of an Ax
on a Scaffold near <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gates before the <hi>Banqueting</hi>-Houſe, that ſo from thence
where He uſed to ſit on His Throne, and ſhew the Splendour of Majeſty, He might
paſs to His Grave; there parting with the Enſigns of Royalty, and laying them down
as Spoils, where He had before uſed them as the Ornaments of Empire. Thus did
they endeavour to make their Malice ingenious, and provided Triumphs for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
And becauſe they ſuſpected, or were informed, that as the <hi>King</hi> had not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Authority, ſo He would not ſubmit to their Execution, not willingly ſtoop to
the Block, they cauſed to be faſtned in it ſome Iron Staples and Rings, that by them
with Cords they might draw Him down, if He would not comply. But His prudent
Meekneſs prevented this Inhumanity; and He died diſowning their Authority, though
He could not eſcape their Power.</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe Preparations, they cauſe ſome Souldiers to offer to His <hi>Majeſty</hi>
certain Articles and Conditions, to which if He would ſubſcribe, they promiſe Life,
and the continuance of a precarious Empire: either out of a Terrour and Fear of the
conſequents of their Impieties; for the confidence of contriving great Crimes is often
turned into a ſollicitude when they come to be acted: or out of Deſign to ruine His
Conſcience and Honour together with His mortal Life, if He ſhould conſent. But
when one or two of them had been read to Him, He refuſed to hear any more, ſaying,
<hi>I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths ere I will ſo proſtitute my Honour, or betray the Liberties of my
People.</hi> Thus mindful of Juſtice, He would not deface the Splendor of His former
Vertues with a too impotent deſire of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60710:34"/>
At laſt that Fatal Day <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. approached: and that morning, a little before His
Death, the Conſpirators ordered ſome of their <hi>Miniſters, viz. Marſhall, Nye, Caryl,
Salway</hi> and <hi>Dell,</hi> to pray with Him, as they ſaid, in order to His paſſage out of this
Life; but when theſe ſent to let Him know the end of their coming, He returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that <hi>He was buſie:</hi> they ſent a ſecond time, and He replied that <hi>He was at His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions:</hi>
they importunately ſent a third time, and my Lord of <hi>London</hi> then deſiring
to know what anſwer he ſhould give to ſatisfie them; His Majeſty then as unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Miniſtery ſaid, <hi>My Lord, you may give them what anſwer you pleaſe, but I am
reſolved that they who have ſo often and ſo cauſeleſly prayed</hi> againſt <hi>Me, ſhall not in this My
Agony pray</hi> with <hi>Me, they may pray</hi> for <hi>Me if they pleaſe.</hi> Therefore the <hi>King</hi> arming
Himſelf with His own Devotions in the Offices of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in them
found an unexpected Comfort; for the Goſpel for that Day being the Hiſtory of the
Paſſion of our Saviour, did by that Example ſtrengthen the <hi>King</hi> to follow <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and
to take up His Croſs; and His Majeſty was thankful for that Pattern. Being thus
confirmed by the Blood (for He took the Sacrament that Morning) and Sufferings
of His LORD (whoſe Vicegerent He was) together with His own Innocency, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Terrors of Death, He was brought from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi>'s through the Park to
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> walking very faſt, and with as chearful a Countenance as if He were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Hunting, (a Recreation He was much pleaſed with,) often adviſing His ſlow
guards to move faſter, adding, <hi>I now go before you to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown, with
leſs ſollicitude than I formerly have led My Souldiers for an Earthly Diadem.</hi> And being
come to the end of the Park, He with much Alacrity went up the Stairs leading to the
long Gallery in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Cabinet-Chamber,</hi> where He continued
ſome time in Devotion, while they were fitting the Theatre of His Murther.</p>
                  <p>While theſe things were acting, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had always forborn any
publick appearance in the practices of this Murther, had taken up (as is credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
ſome Reſolutions, (either in abhorrency of the Crime, or by the Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others) with his own Regiment, though none elſe ſhould follow him, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Execution. This being ſuſpected or known, <hi>Cromwell, Ireton</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi>
coming to him, after their uſual way of deceiving, endeavoured to perſwade him,
that the LORD <hi>had rejected the King,</hi> and with ſuch like Language as they knew had
formerly prevailed upon him, concealing that they had that very morning ſigned the
Warrant for the Aſſaſſination; they alſo deſired him <hi>with them to ſeek the</hi> LORD. <hi>by
Prayer, that they might know his mind in the thing.</hi> Which he aſſenting to, <hi>Harriſon</hi>
was appointed for the duty, and by compact to draw out his profane and blaſphemous
diſcourſe to God in ſuch a length as might give time for the Execution, which they
privately ſent to their Inſtruments to haſten; of which when they had notice that it
was paſt, they roſe up, and perſwaded the General that this was a full return of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and God having ſo manifeſted his pleaſure they were to acquieſce in it. There was
likewiſe another attempt made by Col. <hi>Downes,</hi> who had diſturbed them in their Court,
to obſtruct them in their Execution; for it is ſaid that he endeavoured to make a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
in the Army to hinder the Wickedneſs, but the haſt of the Aſſaſſinates prevented
him.</p>
                  <p>While theſe men acted their Wickedneſs by Prayers, to the laſting reproach of
Chriſtianity, the <hi>King,</hi> after He had finiſhed His Supplications, was through the
<hi>Banqueting</hi>-Houſe brought to the Scaffold, which was dreſs'd to terrour, for it was
all hung with Black, where were attending two Executioners in Diſguiſes, and the
Ax and the Block prepared. But it prevailed not to affright Him whoſe Soul was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
panting after another Life. And therefore He entred this ignominious and gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Theatre with the ſame mind as He uſed to carry to His Throne, ſhewing no fear
of death, but a Solicitude for thoſe that ſhould live after Him. Looking about He ſaw
divers Companies of Horſe and Foot ſo placed on each ſide of the Street and about the
Scaffold, that the People could not come near Him, and thoſe that ſaw could not be
Hearers; therefore omitting that Speech which it was probable He would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the People, He ſpoke to the Officers, and thoſe that were then about Him,
that which is now printed among His Works.</p>
                  <p>Having ended His Speech, He declared His Profeſſion of Religion; and while He
was preparing for the Block, He expreſſed what were His Hopes (for all the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
have ſuch) in Death, ſaying, <hi>I have a good Cauſe and a Gracious God on my ſide;
I go from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, no disturbance
in the world.</hi> After this compoſing Himſelf to an addreſs to God, having His Eyes
and Hands like fore-runners lifted up to Heaven, and expreſſing ſome ſhort and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60710:35"/>
Ejaculations, He kneeled down before the Block as at a Desk of Prayer, and meekly
ſubmitted His <hi>Crowned Head</hi> to the pleaſure of His God, to be profaned by the Axe of the
<hi>diſguiſed Executioner:</hi> which was ſuddenly ſevered from His Body by one ſtrong ſtroke.
<hi>So fell</hi> CHARLES <hi>the Firſt, and with Him expired the Glory and Liberty of Three Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>King</hi> finiſhed His Martyrdom, but His Enemies not their Malice, who
extended their Cruelty beyond His Life, and abuſed the Headleſs Trunk. Some waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their hands in the Royal Blood, others dipt their ſtaves in it; and that they might
indulge their inſatiate Covetouſneſs as well as their boundleſs Inhumanity, they ſold
the chips of the Block, and the ſands that were diſcoloured with His Blood, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
His very Hairs to ſale: which the Spectators purchaſed for different uſes. Some
did it to preſerve the Relicks of ſo Glorious a Prince, whom they ſo dearly loved.
Others hoped that they would be as means of Cure for that Diſeaſe which our Engliſh
<hi>Kings</hi> (through the Indulgence of Heaven) by Their touch did uſually heal: and it
was reported that theſe Reliques experienced failed not of the effect. And ſome out of
a brutiſh malice would have them as ſpoils and trophies of their hatred to their Lawful
Sovereign. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he might feed his Eyes with Cruelty, and ſatisfie his ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Ambitions, which aſpired at <hi>Monarchy</hi> when the Lawful King was deſtroyed, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſurveyed the murthered Carcaſs when it was brought in the Coffin into <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
and to aſſure himſelf the <hi>King</hi> was quite dead, with his fingers ſearched the
Wound, whether the Head were fully ſevered from the Body or no.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards they delivered the body to be unbowelled to an infamous <hi>Empirick</hi> of
the Faction, together with the rude <hi>Chirurgions</hi> of the Army (not permitting the
<hi>King</hi>'s own Phyſicians to this Office) who were all moſt implacable Enemies to His
Majeſty, and commanded them <hi>to ſearch</hi> (which was as much as to bid them ſo report)
<hi>whether they could not find in it Symptoms of the French diſeaſe, or ſome evidences of Frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and natural impotency:</hi> that ſo they might have ſome colour to ſlander Him who
was eminent for <hi>Chaſtity;</hi> or to make His Seed infamous. But this wicked Deſign was
prevented by a Phyſician of great Integrity and Skill, who intruding himſelf among
them at the Diſſection, by his Preſence and Authority kept the obſequious Wretches
from gratifying their Opprobrious Maſters. And the ſame <hi>Phyſician</hi> alſo publiſhed
that Nature had tempered the Royal Body to a longer life than commonly is granted
to other men. And as His Soul was fitted by Heroick Vertues to <hi>Eternity,</hi> ſo His
Body by a Temperament almoſt <hi>ad pondus</hi> made as near an approach to it as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Condition of Mortality would permit.</p>
                  <p>Failing in theſe Opportunities of Calumny, with more Impudence and Rancor they
uſe other waies to make Him odious, and raſe the Love of Him out of the People's
hearts. They conclude from the outward unhappineſſes of His Reign unto an hatred
of God againſt Him; and with the ſame Confidence as they inrolled themſelves in the
Liſt of the Saints, and entred their own names in the Book of Life, they blotted His
out, and placed Him in ſome of the dark and comfortleſs Cells of the damned: and
they commonly profeſſed it among the Diſciples of the Faction as an Article of their
belief, that it was impoſſible for Him or any of His Party to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Not content with theſe Injuries to His Body and Soul, they endeavour likewiſe to
murther His <hi>Memory.</hi> For they pull'd down His <hi>Statue</hi> which was placed at the Weſt
end of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and that other in the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> and leaving the Arch
void, they writ over, <hi>Exit Tyrannus Regum ultimus.</hi> But the Providence of God hath
ſhewed them to be not only deceivers, but alſo deceived. For that Juſt Prince hath
of His own ſeed to ſit upon His Throne. And Poſterity ſhall wonder at the Vanity
as well as the Falſeneſs of thoſe men, that they ſhould think to deſtroy the Memory
of that Prince whoſe true and laſting Glory conſiſted not in any thing wherein it was
poſſible for Succeſſors to ſhew the Power of their Malice, but in <hi>a ſolid Vertue, which
flouriſheth by Age, and whoſe Fame gathers ſtrength from multitude of Years, when Statues
and Monuments are obnoxious to the flames of a Violent Envy and the Ruines of Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, they take care to ſuppreſs all thoſe more Lively figures of Him and
more laſting Statues, His Writings, and therefore force from my Lord of <hi>London,</hi>
whom they kept Priſoner, all thoſe Papers His Majeſty had delivered to him, and
make a moſt narrow ſearch of his Cloaths and Cabinets, leſt any of thoſe Monuments
of Piety and Wiſdom ſhould eſcape to the Benefit of Mankind. Yet by the gracious
Goodneſs of the Almighty God, to their Eternal Infamy, and for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
record of the <hi>King</hi>'s great Vertues, there eſcaped their Search, and was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to the World, <hi>The Book of His Meditations and Soliloquies.</hi> In the Compoſition of
which a Sober Reader cannot tell which to admire moſt, either His incredible Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60710:35"/>
His ardent Piety, or His Majeſtick and truly Royal <hi>Style.</hi> Thoſe parts of it
which conſiſted of Addreſſes to God correſponded ſo nearly in the Occaſions, and were
ſo full of the Piety and Elegancie of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> that they ſeemed to be dictated
by the ſame Spirit.</p>
                  <p>His very Aſſaſſinates confeſſed the goodneſs of the Book, though they were aſhamed
He whom they had murthered ſhould be the Author. For <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in his examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Royſton</hi> who printed it, asked him, <hi>How he could think ſo bad a man</hi> (for ſuch
would that Monſter have this Excellent Prince thought to be) <hi>could write ſo good a Book.</hi>
Therefore they laboured by all waies and means to ſuppreſs it, as the greateſt Witneſs
againſt them to Poſterity, and which would make them odious in all Generations.
For <hi>the Blood of the Holy, Wiſe and Eloquent, leaves eternal ſtains of Infamy upon thoſe
that ſpill'd it; becauſe no man reads their Works, but they curſe thoſe cruel hands which cut
the Veins and ſtopp'd the ſtreams of ſo much Goodneſs: and we eſteem them barbarous and
inhumane Monſters who did not Reverence the Perſons of thoſe whoſe Writings we admire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But their fury became ridiculous, while they thought by their preſent power to
corrupt His Memory, and take off the admiration of the following Ages; for the
more they hindred the publication, the more earneſtly it was ſought after: yet they
endeavoured it another way, and therefore hired certain mercenary Souls to deſpoil
the <hi>King</hi> of the Credit of being the Author of it. Eſpecially one baſe Scribe, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fitted to compoſe Satyrs and invent Reproaches, who made himſelf notorious by
ſome licentious and infamous Pamphlets, and ſo approved himſelf as fit for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
This Man they encouraged (by tranſlating him from a needy Pedagogue to
the office of a Secretary) to write that Scandalous Book <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (an Invective
againſt the <hi>King</hi>'s Meditations) and to anſwer the Learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Defence of
<hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi> But all was in vain, for thoſe that were able to judge of <hi>Styles</hi>
found it muſt be the ſame Pen which wrought theſe Meditations, and drew thoſe
Letters which the Faction had publiſhed for His. Others, that were not able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themſelves by ſuch a Cenſure, were aſſured of it by the Relations of Col. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
that was His Keeper, who did atteſt to ſeveral Perſons that he ſaw them in the
<hi>King</hi>'s hand, heard Him read them, and did ſee Him to correct them in his preſence.
The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> did alſo affirm to thoſe he converſed with, that he was
employed by a command from the <hi>King</hi> to get ſome of them out of the hands of the
Faction, for they were taken in His Cabinet at <hi>Naſeby.</hi> And <hi>Royſton</hi> that printed them
did teſtifie to thoſe that enquired of him, that the <hi>King</hi> had ſent to him the <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
before His death, to provide a Preſs for ſome Papers He ſhould ſend to Him, which
were theſe, together with a deſign for a Picture before the Book; which at firſt was
Three Crowns indented on a Wreath of Thorns, but afterwards the <hi>King</hi> recalled
that, and ſent that other which is now before His Book. Thus theſe ſeveral Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
did ſecure the faith of the World againſt the Slanderers, and made their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
as contemptible as themſelves were hateful.</p>
                  <p>While the <hi>Parricides</hi> were ſeeking for freſh occaſions to expreſs their Malice, the
whole Kingdom was compoſed to Mourning and Lamentation; for never any <hi>King,</hi>
not only of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but of whatſoever Throne, had His Death lamented with
greater Sorrows, nor left the World with a higher regret of the People. When the
news of His Death was divulged, Women with Child for grief caſt forth the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruit of their Womb, like Her that fell in travel when <hi>the Glory was departed from
Iſrael.</hi> Others, both Men and Women, fell into Convulſions and ſwounding Fits,
and contracted ſo deep a Melancholy as attended them to the Grave. Some unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of themſelves, as though they could not, or would not, live when their beloved
Prince was ſlaughtered, (it is reported) ſuddenly fell down dead. The Pulpits were
likewiſe bedewed with unſuborned Tears; and ſome of thoſe to whom the living <hi>King</hi>
was for Epiſcopacie's ſake leſs acceptable, yet now bewailed the loſs of Him when
dead. Children (who uſually ſeem unconcerned in publick Calamities) were alſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the news, and became ſo prodigal of their Tears, that for ſome time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
comfort; even ſome of thoſe who ſate as Judges could not forbear to mingle
ſome Tears with His Blood when it was ſpilt. Many compoſed Elegies and ſerious
Poems to preſerve the memory of His Vertues, to expreſs their own Griefs, and to
inſtruct the Mournings of others, and their Paſſions made them above their uſual ſtrain
more elegant. Many who writ the Acts of His time did vindicate His Honour, and
divulged the baſe Arts of His Enemies, even while their Power was dreadful.</p>
                  <p>Men of all Sorts, Degrees and Sects (there being none among which He had not
ſome Admirers) then freely and without Envy recounted His ſeveral Vertues, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60710:36"/>
now appeared as great as Mortality refined by Induſtry was capable of. For <hi>though
Proſperity makes the Severeſt Tryals of Vertues, yet Adverſity renders them moſt Orient.</hi> As
the Night beſt acquaints us with the Splendor of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>That which firſt challenged their Wonder,<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>
 was the compoſure and Inclination of
His Soul to <hi>Religion,</hi> which He uſed not as an Artifice of Empire, but as the Ornament
and Comfort of a private breaſt; for He never affected a Magnifick Piety nor a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Vertue, but laboured to approve Himſelf in ſecret to that God who rewardeth
openly. All His Offices in this were, like His Fortune, far above thoſe of other men;
His Devotion in Prayer was ſo raiſed, that His Soul ſeemed to be wholly ſwallowed up
in the Contemplation of that Majeſty He did adore, and as in an Ecſtaſie to have left
His ſenſes without its Adſiſtencie. An inſtance of this was given at the Death of the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the news of whoſe Murther being whiſpered to the <hi>King</hi> while
He was at Prayers, He took no notice of it (although it was ſo weighty an Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to have His prime Miniſter cut off in the buſie Preparations for a great Deſign)
till He had finiſhed His Addreſſes to Heaven, and His Spirit was diſmiſſed from the
Throne of Grace to attend the Cares of that on Earth. This was ſo clear an Evidence
of a moſt fixed Devotion, that thoſe who built their Hopes upon His Reproaches, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly
imputed it to a ſecret Pleaſure in the fall of him whoſe Greatneſs was now
terrible to the Family that raiſed it; which both His Majeſties care of the Duke's
Children afterwards, as alſo the Conſideration of His Condition, did evince to be
falſe, and that the <hi>King</hi> neither hated him, nor needed to fear him whom He could
have ruined with a Frown, and have obliged the People by permitting their Fury to
paſs upon him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, His Majeſtie's conſtant Diligence in thoſe Duties did demonſtrate, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a principle of Holineſs, which is alwaies uniform, both moved and aſſiſted
Him in thoſe ſacred Performances, to which He was obſerved to go with an exceeding
Alacrity as to a raviſhing pleaſure, from which no leſſer Pleaſures nor Buſineſs were
ſtrong enough for a Diverſion. In the morning before He went to <hi>Hunting</hi> (His belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Sport) the Chaplains were before Day call'd to their Miniſtry: and when He was
at <hi>Brainford</hi> among the Noiſe of Arms, and near the Aſſaults of His Enemies, He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Divine that then waited to perform his accuſtomed Service, before He provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for Safety, or attempted at Victory; and would firſt gain upon the Love of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and then afterwards repel the Malice of Men. Thoſe that were appointed by
the Parliament to attend Him in His Reſtraints wondred at His conſtant Devotions
in His Cloſet; and no Artifice of the Army was ſo likely to abuſe Him to a Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their good Intentions, as the Permiſſion of the Miniſtery of His Chaplains in the
Worſhip of God, a Mercy He valued to ſome of His Servants, above that of enjoying
Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>At Sermons He carried Himſelf with ſuch a Reverence and Attention (that His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
which hated, yet did even admire Him in it,) as if He were expecting new
Inſtructions for Government from that God whoſe Deputy He was, or a new Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a larger Empire: and He was ſo careful not to neglect any of thoſe Exerciſes,
that if on Tueſday Mornings, on which Dayes there uſed to be Sermons at Court,
He were at any diſtance from thence, He would ride hard to be preſent at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of them.</p>
                  <p>When the State of His Soul required, He was as ready to perform thoſe more ſevere
parts of Religion which ſeem moſt diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood. And He never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take to Himſelf the ſhame of thoſe Acts wherein He had tranſgreſſed, that
He might give Glory to His God. For after the Army had forced Him from <hi>Holmeby,</hi>
and in their ſeveral removes had brought Him to <hi>Latmas,</hi> an houſe of the Earl of
<hi>Devonſhire,</hi> on <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. being Sunday in the Morning before Sermon He led forth
with Him into the Garden the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Sheldon</hi> (who then attended on Him,
and whom He was pleaſed to uſe as His Confeſſour) and drawing out of His Pocket
a Paper, commanded him to read it, tranſcribe it, and ſo to deliver it to Him again.
This Paper contained ſeveral Vows, which He had obliged His Soul unto for the
Glory of His Maker, the advance of true Piety, and the emolument of the Church.
And among them this was one, that <hi>He would do Publick Penance for the Injuſtice He
had ſuffered to be done to the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>His conſent to thoſe Injuries that were done
to the Church of</hi> England (though at that time He had yielded to no more than the
taking away of the High Commiſſion, and the Biſhops power to Vote in Parliament)
<hi>and to the Church of</hi> Scotland: and adjured the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>that if ever he ſaw Him in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to obſerve that or any of thoſe Vows, he ſhould ſolicitouſly mind Him of the Obligations,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60710:36"/>
as he dreaded the guilt of the breach ſhould ly upon His own Soul.</hi> This voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Laws of Chriſtianity exceeded that ſo memorable humiliation of the good
Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> for he never bewailed the Blood of thoſe ſeven thouſand Men
which in three hours ſpace he cauſed to be ſpilt at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> till the reſolution of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made him ſenſible of the Crime. But the Piety of King <hi>Charles</hi> anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſeverity of a Confeſſor for thoſe Offences to which He had been precipitated
by the Violence of others.</p>
                  <p>This Zeal and Piety proceeded from the Dedication of His whole Soul to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of His God, for <hi>Religion</hi> was as Imperial in the Intellectual as in the Affectionate
Faculties of it. This Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was His not ſo much by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as Choice, and He ſo well underſtood the Grounds of it, that He valued them
above all other Pretenſions to Truth, and was able to maintain it againſt all its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
His Diſcourſe with <hi>Henderſon</hi> ſhews how juſt a Reverence He had for the
Authority of the Catholick Church, againſt the Pride and Ignorance of Schiſmaticks;
yet not to proſtitute His Faith to the Adulterations of the Roman Infallibility and
Traditions.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the moſt violent Slanders the Faction laboured to pollute Him with,
were thoſe that rendred Him inclinable to Popery. From which He was ſo averſe,
that He could not forbear in His indearments to the <hi>Queen,</hi> (when He committed a
ſecret to Her Breaſt which He would not truſt to any other, and when He admired and
applauded Her affectionate Cares for His Honour and Safety) in a Letter, which He
thought no Eye but Hers ſhould have peruſed, to let Her know that He ſtill differ'd
from Her in Religion; for He ſays, <hi>It is the only thing of Difference in Opinion betwixt
Vs.</hi> Malice made the Slanderers blind, and they publiſhed this Letter to the World,
than which there could not be a greater Evidence imaginable of the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt ſecret
thoughts and Inward Sincerity, nor a more ſhameful Conviction of their Impudence
and damnable Falſhood. Nor did He only tell the <hi>Queen</hi> ſo, but He made Her ſee it
in His Actions. For as ſoon as His Children were born, it was His firſt Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the ſatisfaction of their Mother in baptizing them after the Rites of Her own
Church. When He was to Die, a time moſt ſeaſonable to ſpeak Truth, eſpecially by
Him who all His Life knew not how to Diſſemble, He declares His Profeſſion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to be the ſame with that which He found left by His Father King <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How little the Papiſts credited what the Faction would have the World believe, was
too evident by the Conſpiracies of their <hi>Fathers</hi> againſt His Life and Honour, which
the Diſcovery of <hi>Habernefield</hi> (to whoſe relations the following practices againſt Him
and the Church of <hi>England</hi> gained a belief) brought to light. They were mingled
likewiſe among the Conſpirators, and both heated and directed their Fury againſt Him.
They were as importunate in their Calumnies of Him, even after His Death, as were
the vileſt of the Sectaries; which they had never done, could they have imagined Him
to be theirs; for His Blood would in their Calendar have out-ſhamed the Multitude of
their fictitious Saints. For His ſake they continued their hatred to His Family, abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Uſurpations of the following Tyrant, by impoſing upon the World new <hi>Rules
of Obedience and Government,</hi> invented freſh Calumnies for the Son, and obſtructed by
various Methods His return to the Principality, becauſe He was Heir as well of the
Faith as of the Throne of His Father. Although this Honour is not to be denied to
many Gallant Perſons of that perſwaſion, that their Loyalty was not ſo corrupted by
their Faith to <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they laboured to prevent the Father's Overthrow, and
to haſten the Son's Reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>He was not ſatisfied in being Religious as a particular Chriſtian, but would be ſo
as a <hi>King,</hi> and endeavoured that Piety might be as Univerſal as His Empire. This He
aſſayed by giving Ornaments and Aſſiſtances to the External Exerciſe and Parts of it,
(which is the proper Province of a Magiſtrate, whoſe Power reaches but to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man) that ſo carnal minds, if they were not brought to an Obedience, might
yet to a Reverence, and if men would not honour, yet they ſhould not deſpiſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
This He did in taking Care for the Place of Worſhip, that Comelineſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſhould be there conſpicuous where the God of Order was to be adored. And it
was a Royal Undertaking to reſtore Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church to its primitive ſtrength, and
give it a beauty as magnificent as its Structure. He taught men not to contemn the
Diſpenſers of the Goſpel, becauſe He had ſo great an eſteem for them, admitting ſome
to His neareſt Confidence and moſt Private Counſels, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
and the greateſt Place of Truſt, as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to the Treaſury: conſulting
at once the Emolument of Religion, whoſe Dictates are more powerfully impreſſed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60710:37"/>
when the Miniſter is honoured by the Magiſtrate, and the Benefit of the State, which
wiſe Princes had before found none to ſeek more faithfully, if any did more prudently,
than Church-men.</p>
                  <p>Though a Voluntary Poverty did much contribute to the luſtre and increaſe of the
Church in the Purer times, yet a neceſſitated would have deſtroyed it in a Corrupt
age; therefore the <hi>King,</hi> to obſtruct all acceſs of Ruine that way, ſecured her Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and recovered as much as He could out of the Jaws of Sacrilege, which together
with time had devoured a great part of it. His endeavours this way were ſo ſtrong,
that the Faction in <hi>Scotland</hi> found no Artifice able to divert them but by kindling the
flame of a Civil War; the Criminals there ſeeking to adjuſt their Sacrilegious Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Rebellious practices, and to deſtroy that Church by force which His Majeſty
would not ſuffer them to torture with famine. In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Lord Lieutenant <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
by His Command and Inſtructions, retrived very great Poſſeſſions, which the
tumults of that Nation had advantaged many greedy Perſons to ſeiſe upon, and would
not ſuffer Sedition to be incouraged with the hopes of Impiety. In <hi>England</hi> He coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
thoſe juſt Pleas which Oppreſſed Incumbents entred againſt Rapacious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
and this way many Curates were put into a Condition of giving Hoſpitality,
who before were contemptible in their Miniſtry, becauſe they were ſo in their Fortune.
His Enemies knew how Inviolable was the Faith of His Majeſty in this, and therefore
preſſed Him with nothing more to obſtruct Peace than the Alienation of Church-Lands,
rather than which He did abandon His Life, and parted ſooner with His Blood
than them. He uſed to ſay, <hi>Though I am ſenſible enough of the Dangers that attend My
Care of the Church, yet I am reſolved to defend it or make it My Tomb-ſtone,</hi> (alluding to a
Story which He would tell of a Generous Captain, that ſaid ſo of a Caſtle that was
committed to his truſt.) He had ſo perfect a Deteſtation of that Crime, that it is ſaid
He ſcarce ever mentioned <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. without an Abhorrency of His Sacriledge. He
neglected the Advices of His own Party, if they were negligent of the Welfare of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Conceſſions He had made in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the prejudice of the Church there,
were the ſubject of His grief and penitential Confeſſions both before God (as appears
in His Prayers) and men. For when the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Morley,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> (whom He had ſent for to the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his diligence and prudence to ſearch into the Intrigues and Reſerves of the
Commiſſioners) had acquainted Him how the Commiſſioners were the more pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
for the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy here, becauſe His Majeſty had conſented to it
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and withal told Him what Anſwer he himſelf had made to them, That
<hi>perchance the King was abuſed to thoſe Grants by a miſinformation that that Act which was
made in King</hi> James'<hi>s Minority againſt Biſhops was yet unrepealed, and that His Conceſſion
would but leave them where the Law had;</hi> The King anſwered, <hi>It is true, I was told ſo, but
whenever you hear that urged again, give them this Anſwer, and ſay that you had it from the
King Himſelf; That when I did that in</hi> Scotland, <hi>I ſinned againſt My Conſcience, and
that I have often repented of it, and hope that God hath forgiven Me that great Sin, and by
God's grace for no Conſideration in the World will I ever do ſo again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was careful of Uniformity, both becauſe He knew the Power of Juſt and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Princes conſiſted in the Union of their Subjects, who never are cemented ſtronger
than by a Unity in Religion; but Tyrants, who meaſure their greatneſs by the
weakneſs of their Vaſſals, work that moſt effectually by careſſing Schiſms, and giving
a Licence to different Perſwaſions (as the Uſurpers afterwards did:) Beſides, He ſaw
<hi>there was no greater Impediment to a ſincere Piety, becauſe that Time and thoſe Parts which
might improve Godlineſs to a growth, were all Waſted and Corrupted in Malice and Slanders
betwixt the Diſſenters about forms.</hi> He was more tender in preſerving the Truths of
Chriſtianity, than the Rights of His Throne. For when the Commiſſioners of the
Two Houſes in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> importunately preſſed him for a Confirmation of the
Leſſer <hi>Catechiſm</hi> which the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had compoſed, and uſed this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
becauſe it was a ſmall matter; He anſwered, <hi>Though it ſeem to you a ſmall thing,
it is not ſo to Me: I had rather give you one of the Flowers of My Crown, than permit your
Children to be corrupted in the leaſt point of their Religion.</hi> Thus though He could not infuſe
Spiritual Graces into the minds of His Subjects, yet He would manage their Reaſon
by Pious Arts; and what the <hi>Example of a King (which through the Corruptions of men is
more efficacious to Impiety than to Vertue</hi>) could not do, that His Law ſhould, and He
would reſtrain thoſe Vices which He could not extirpate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Religion</hi> was never uſed by Him to veil Injuſtice;<note place="margin">His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note>
 for this was peculiar to. His Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60710:37"/>
who when they were plotting ſuch acts as Hell would bluſh at, they would
fawn and ſmile on Heaven; and they uſed it as thoſe ſubtle Surpriſers in War, who
wear their Enemies Colours till they be admitted to butcher them within their own
Fortreſſes. But His Majeſty conſulted the Peace of His Conſcience not only in Piety
to God, but alſo in <hi>Juſtice</hi> to Men. He was, as a <hi>Magiſtrate ſhould be, a ſpeaking Law.</hi>
It was His uſual ſaying, <hi>Let me ſtand or fall by My own Counſels. I will ever, with</hi> Job,
<hi>rather chuſe Miſery than Sin.</hi> He firſt ſubmitted His Counſels to the Cenſure of the
Lawyers before they were brought forth to Execution. Thoſe acts of which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made moſt noiſe, were delivered by the Judges to be within the Sphere of the
Prerogative. The cauſes of the Revenue were as freely debated as private Pleas, and
ſometimes decreed to be not good; which can never happen under a bad Prince.
The Juſtice of His Times ſhewed that of His Breaſt, wherein the Laws were feared
and not Men. None were forced to purchaſe their Liberty with the diminution of
their Eſtates, or the loſs of their Credit. Every one had both ſecurity and ſafety for
His Life, Fortune, and Dignity; and it was not then thought, as afterwards, to be a
part of Wiſdom to provide againſt Dangers by obſcurity and Privacies. His Favours
in beſtowing Great Offices never ſecured the Receivers from the force of the Law, but
Equity overcame His Indulgences. For He knew that <hi>Vnjuſt Princes become Odious to
them that made them ſo.</hi> He ſubmitted the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventrey</hi> to an Examination
when a querulous perſon had accuſed him of Bribery. He ſharply reproved one whom
He had made Lord Treaſurer, when he was petitioned againſt by an <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Knight,
on whoſe Eſtate, being held by Leaſe from the Crown, that Treaſurer had a deſign;
and He ſecured the Petitioner in his right. The greateſt Officer of His Court did not
dare to do any the leaſt of thoſe injuries which the moſt contemptible Member of the
Houſe of Commons would with a daily Inſolency act upon his weaker Neighbour. In
the Civil Diſcords He bewailed nothing more, than that the Sword of Juſtice could
not correct the illegal Furies of that of War. Though by His Conceſſions and Grants
He diminiſhed His Power, yet He thought it a Compenſation, to let the World ſee
He was willing to make it impoſſible for Monarchy to have an unjuſt Inſtrument, and
to ſecure poſterity from evil Kings. Although He proved to a Leading Lord of the
Faction, <hi>That a People being too cautious to bind their King by Laws from doing Ill, do
likewiſe fetter Him from doing Good, and their fears of Miſchief do deſtroy their hopes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
And that ſuch is the weakneſs of Humanity, that he which is intruſted only to Good,
may pervert that Power to the extremeſt Ills.</hi> And indeed there is no ſecurity for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
to feel nothing in Government beſides the Advantages of it, but in the Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Providence, and the Juſtice of the Prince, both which we enjoyed while we
enjoyed Him.</p>
                  <p>Though He was thus in Love with Juſtice,<note place="margin">His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note>
 yet He ſuffered not that to leven His
Nature to Severity and Rigour, but tempered it with <hi>Clemency,</hi> eſpecially when His
Goodneſs could poſſibly find out ſuch an Interpretation for the Offence, that it ſtruck
more at His Peculiar than the Publick Intereſt. He ſeemed almoſt ſtupid in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Cholerick Spirits as to a ſenſe of His own Injuries, when there was no fear leſt
His Mercy ſhould thereby increaſe the Miſeries of His People. And He was ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of the Glory of Moderation, that He would acquire it in deſpight of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of the times. For <hi>the Exerciſe of this Vertue depends not only on the temper of the
Prince, but the frame of the People muſt contribute to it; becauſe when the Reverence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and fear of the Laws are proſcribed, ſharper Methods are required to from Obedience.</hi> Yet
He was unwilling to cut off, till He had tried by Mercy to amend, even guilty Souls.
Thus He ſtrove to oblige the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> to peaceful practices, by continuing
that Life which had been employed in Sedition, and forfeited to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Soon after His coming into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> (by which time He had experienced
the numerous Frauds and implacable Malice of His Enemies) being attended on by
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Sheldon</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hammond</hi> (for they were the earlieſt in their duties at that time) a
diſcourſe paſſed betwixt His Majeſty and the Governour, wherein there was mention
made of the fears of the Faction that the King could never forgive them. To which
the King immediately replies, <hi>I tell thee, Governour, I can forgive them with as good an
appetite as ever I eat My Dinner after an hunting, and that I aſſure you was not a ſmall one;
yet I will not make My ſelf a better Chriſtian than I am, for I think if they were Kings I could
not do it ſo eaſily.</hi> This ſhewed how prone His Soul was to Mercy, and found not any
obſtruction but what aroſe from a ſenſe of Royal Magnanimity.</p>
                  <p>He ſooner offered and gave life to His captive Enemies than their Spirits debauched by
Rebellion would require it, and He was ſparing of that blood of which their fury made
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60710:38"/>
them Prodigal. No man fell in battel whom He could ſave. He choſe rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
any Victory by Peace (and therefore continually ſollicited for it when He ſeemed
leaſt to need it) than make one triumph a ſtep to another; and though He was paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to put all in Safety, yet He affected rather to end the War by Treaty than by
Conqueſt. The Priſoners He took He uſed like deluded men, and oftener remembred
that God had made them His Subjects, than that the Faction had transformed them
to Rebels. He provided for them while in His Power, and not to let them languiſh
in Priſon, ſent them by Paſſes to their own homes, only ingaging them by Oath to no
more injuries againſt that Sovereign whom they had felt to be Gracious: for ſo He
uſed thoſe that were taken at <hi>Brainford.</hi> But yet the Caſuiſts of the Cauſe would ſoon
diſpenſe with their Faith, and ſend them forth to die in contracting a new guilt. Thoſe
whom the fury of War had left gaſping in the Field, and fainting under their wounds,
He commends in His Warrants, (as in that to the Mayor of <hi>Newbury</hi>) to the care of
the Neighbourhood, either tenderly to recover, or decently bury: and His Commands
were as well for thoſe that ſought to murther Him as thoſe that were wounded in His
Defence.</p>
                  <p>This made the Impudence and Falſhood of <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> more portentous, when in his
Speech of the Aſſaſſination he belch'd out thoſe Compariſons of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> the
firſt would kill numbers of Senators to make himſelf Sport, and the laſt thought it juſt
enough that <hi>Paetus Thraſeas</hi> ſhould die, becauſe he look'd like a School-maſter. But
this <hi>Prince</hi>'s Anger was without Danger to any, His Admonitions were frequent,
Corrections ſeldom, but Revenge never. He grieved when His Pity had not Power
or Skill to ſave Offenders, and then He puniſhed the bad, but yet gave them ſpace to
repent, and make their Execution as near as He could like a natural Death, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
them from hence to a place where they could not Sin. He had nothing of the
<hi>Beaſt</hi> in Him, which <hi>Machiavel</hi> requires in ſuch Princes as make Succeſs the only end
of their Counſels, and conſult a proſperous Grandeur more than an unſpotted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He ſcorned to abuſe the Character of God upon Him by turning a <hi>Fox</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
and abhorred to think that He whom Heaven had made above other men,
ſhould degenerate to the Cruelty of a <hi>Lion.</hi> He ſooner parted with Mortality than
Mercy; for He ended His days with a Prayer for His Enemies, and laboured to make
His Clemency immortal, by commanding the practice of it to His Son.</p>
                  <p>None of His Vertues were in the Confines of Vice,<note place="margin">His Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note>
 and therefore this Admirable
Clemency proceeded not from a defect of Spirit, as His Detractors imputed it, and <hi>the
Vulgar,</hi> who <hi>miſtake Cruelty for Valour,</hi> imagined; but like the Bowels of the Supremeſt
Mercy which are incircled with an Infinite Power, ſo this Pity to guilty and frail men
was attended with an Incomparable <hi>Fortitude.</hi> For this Vertue conſiſting in deſpiſing
Dangers and Enemies in thoſe Cauſes that render Death comely and glorious, the <hi>King</hi>
gave ſeveral Evidences of a Contempt of all Power beneath that of Heaven. When
the Lord <hi>Rey</hi> firſt acquainted Him with the Conſpiracy of <hi>Ramſey</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> He
was upon a Remove to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> where the Marqueſs was to wait upon Him as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the Bed-Chamber; who having ſome notice given him of the Diſcovery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
His Majeſty to ſpare his attendance till he could clear his innocence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Treaſon upon the Accuſer. The <hi>King</hi> anſwered, that He would therefore
make him <hi>wait, to let him ſee He did as little fear his ſtrength as diſtruſt his Loyalty; for
He knew he durſt not attempt His Life, becauſe He was reſolved to ſell it ſo dear.</hi> And to
make good His Confidence, He made him ride alone with Him in His Coach to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds,</hi>
and lie in His Chamber that Night: while the ſollicitous Court admired, and
even cenſured, His Magnanimity, for it went beyond His pattern, and did more than
that Emperour who was ſtiled the <hi>Delight of Mankind,</hi> who being informed of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
againſt him, invited the two Chiefs of it to accompany him to the <hi>Spectacula,</hi>
and cauſed them both to ſit next on each ſide to him in the Theatre; and to give them
more advantage for their deſign, put the ſwords of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> (under colour of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
their judgments concerning their ſharpneſs) into their hands, to ſhew how
little dread he had of their fury. But the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince's Magnanimity exceeded that
of the Excellent <hi>Roman</hi>'s, as much as the privacies of a Bed-chamber and the darkneſs
of Night make up a fitter Scene for the Aſſaſſination of a beloved Sovereign than a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Theatre.</p>
                  <p>As He never provoked War, ſo He never feared it; and when the miſerable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
lay upon Him to take up Arms to preſerve Himſelf from an unjuſt Violence,
He ſhewed as much if not more Valour than thoſe can boaſt of that with equal force
finiſhed Wars with Conqueſt: in the ſucceſs of theſe, Fortune, the Vanity of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60710:38"/>
and the aſſiſtances of Friends may challenge a part of the Praiſe, but in that none
but His own brave Soul had the Glory. For to attempt at Victory againſt an Enemy
that had almoſt more Forts and Garriſons than He had Families to joyn with Him,
that with Cannon out-vied the number of His Muskets, that had gotten from Him a
Navy which His Care had made the moſt formidable in the World, and not left Him
the command of a Cock-boat, that were prodigal with the Treaſure of a Nation and
His Revenues, when He begged for a ſubſiſtence; was ſuch a Courage that would
have made that <hi>Senate</hi> of Gallant Perſons, who were the moſt competent Judges of
Valour, and never cenſured Vertue by the Succeſs, but thanked their Imprudent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>
for not deſpairing of the Common-wealth, when he gathered up thoſe broken Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
which his Raſhneſs had obtruded to an Overthrow, to have decreed a Triumph
for CHARLES, had His life been an Honour to that Age, or could thoſe Generations
have reckoned Him among their great Examples. Moſt Men indeed thought the
<hi>King</hi>'s ſide moſt glorious, yet they concluded the other more terrible: thoſe that
minded their Duty were in the Royal Camp, but ſuch as cared for Safety took part
with the Faction, or at leaſt did not oppoſe them. As He firſt entred the War, ſo
did He continue in it. His moderation alwaies moved Him to deſire Peace, and His
Fortitude made them ſometimes ſue for it. His Adverſaries never prevailed upon
His Fears, but upon the Treachery and Covetouſneſs of ſome of His Party, who could
not endure an Honourable Want: and on ſuch their Gold was ſtronger than their
Iron on Him, and He was rather Betray'd than Overcome.</p>
                  <p>His Greatneſs of Mind forſook Him not with His Fortune, Arms and Liberty, it
being Natural, and not built upon them; this made Him tenacious of Majeſty when
His Power was gone. For when <hi>Whaley,</hi> that had the Command of the Guards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Him while He was in the Army, inſolently intruded into His Preſence to hear His
Diſcourſe with a Foreign Miniſter of State, and being bold in His Power and Office,
refuſed to obey the Command for a greater Diſtance, the <hi>King</hi> caned him to an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
When the Parricides ſent their party of Souldiers to force Him from the <hi>Iſle of
Wight</hi> to the Slaughter, <hi>Cobbet</hi> that commanded them thruſt himſelf into the Coach
with Him: but the <hi>King</hi> ſenſible that the nearneſs of ſuch a Villain was like a Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to Majeſty, with His Hand forced him away to herd among his bloody fellows.
His Spirit alwaies kept above the barbarous Malice of His Enemies, and of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Injuries would ſeem unſenſible. He told a faithful Servant of His that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
had kept Him for two Months under a want of Linnen and Shirts: <hi>But</hi>
(ſaid He) <hi>I ſcorned to give them that pleaſure ac to tell them I wanted.</hi> Thus all the
ſtrokes of Fortune upon His Magnanimous Soul were but like the breaking of Waves
upon a Rock of Diamonds, which cannot ſhake, but only waſh it to a greater
Brightneſs.</p>
                  <p>But though He knew not how to ſubmit to the Power of men,<note place="margin">His Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>
 yet He would tremble
under the Frowns of God. His great Spirit made Him not unquiet or furious under the
Corrections of the Almighty: But with a wonderful <hi>Patience (a Vertue not uſual with
Kings, to whom the bounds of Equity ſeem a reſtraint, and therefore are more reſtleſs in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries</hi>)
He did ſubmit to the Will of His Eternal Soveregin. He never murmured nor
repined at that Providence which had given Him plenty of tears to drink: But His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
ſtill breath the Juſtice of God and the Holineſs of all His waies with Him.
He would take Occaſions from diſpleaſing Occurrences to thank God that had fitted
Him for the Condition he had brought Him unto. For when he marched after His
Carriage in purſuit of <hi>Eſſex</hi> into the Weſt, one of them broke in a very narrow Lane,
which made Him ſtop till an intolerable Showre of Rain came pouring upon Him;
from which that He might ſeek for a Shelter in the Neighbouring Village, His Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
offered to hew Him out a way through the Hedge with their Swords, but He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed:
and when they wondred at it, He lifting up His Hat and Eyes to worſhip the
Fountain of All Grace, ſaid, <hi>As God hath given me Afflictions to exerciſe My Patience, ſo
He hath given me Patience to bear My Afflictions.</hi> The Indignity He received from <hi>Hotham</hi>
provoked no Curſe from Him, nor could the Injuries from <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> move Him
to any thing more than Prayers for God's ſanctifying them to Him. He wanted not
Temptations to Paſſion from His own Party; for in a Letter to the <hi>Queen,</hi> He tells Her
that She could not but pity Him in His Condition as to them: yet He ſo managed their
ſeveral Humours, and ſo cheriſhed their Expectations with Patience and Meekneſs,
that they quietly waited for a return of His Fortune.</p>
                  <p>When He was in His Captivity at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> under the ſtricteſt Reſtraint, thoſe that
attended Him never almoſt obſerved Him but chearful and pleaſant in His Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60710:39"/>
and ſometimes breaking out into pleaſing Reparties and Jeſts. When in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at <hi>Newport,</hi> (where he had occaſions of Paſſion daily adminiſtred by the Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Peace of the Party He was to deal with) one of the Commiſſioners was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
with Him for more Conceſſions, and minded Him of His ſaying, <hi>That if there
were another Treaty, it ſhould not lie in the power of the Devil's Malice to hinder Peace:</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> anſwered, <hi>It would be ſo when there was a Treaty, but as for this it could not be thought
a Treaty, but He was like the man in the Play, that cried out he had been in a Fray, and
when they asked him what Fray, he replied there was a Fray and no Fray, for there were but
three blows given, and He took them all: ſo this is a Treaty and not a Treaty, for there be
many Conceſſions, but I have made them all.</hi> Another time, when He met one of the
Presbyterian Miniſters near his Chamber enquiring for Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> (who then
waited on Him, and had been faithful to Him in that Service) the <hi>King</hi> told him,
<hi>He wondred he would have any more to do either with</hi> Titus <hi>or</hi> Timothy, <hi>ſince he fared ſo
ill in medling with them in his Diſputes about Epiſcopacy the day before.</hi> Theſe ſhewed
how free His Soul was, and uncontrolled in the greateſt and moſt diſpleaſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</p>
                  <p>He would never take any indirect courſes to avoid the Croſs, nay, He ſcrupled at
ſuch expedients as ſome deemed moſt conducing to His great end. For at the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> there being offered to Him an expedient, to ſecure His Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ſatisfie the Commiſſioners in the Propoſitions about the Church, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
urged by a great and faithful Counſellor, that He muſt grant what poſſibly He
could to preſerve His own Life for the good of the Church, for (it was ſaid) her ſafety
depended on His; with a preſent and pious indignation He replied, <hi>Tell not Me what I
ſhould do for ſaving of My Life, but what I may do with a ſafe Conſcience: God forbid that
the Life or Safety of the Church ſhould depend upon My Life or upon the Life of any mortal
man; and I thank God I have a Son whom I have reaſon to believe will love the Church as
well as I do.</hi> Another time, a little after the Treaty was ended, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Morley</hi> ſhewing to
Him a Billet he had received by the Lady <hi>Wheeler</hi> the King's Laundreſs (who often
conveyed much Intelligence) from an Officer of the Army, that the King's Death was
reſolved on; His Majeſty anſwered, <hi>I have done what I can to ſave My Life without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of my Soul. I can do, I will do no more: God's will be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Pomp of His Murther, wherein He was made a Spectacle to the World, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, no Trials were ever greater, nor ever were any better born: the Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
found it was eaſie to take away His Life, but impoſſible His Honour and Patience;
His Paſſions being then ſo low and quiet, that the natural Infirmity of His Speech did
not in the leaſt meaſure appear, which uſes to be moſt evident in the ſmalleſt diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirit. After the Regicides had paſſed their Decree for His Aſſaſſination,
and cauſed Him to be perſecuted with all the Indignities of the fanatick Souldiers,
there fell from Him nothing like Paſſion or Indignation, but that He gave the Authors
of thoſe Impieties the Title that was due to them: for when my Lord of <hi>London</hi>
came to Him, (which was not till eight a Clock on Saturday Night,) He told him,
<hi>My Lord, that you came no ſooner I believe was not your fault; but now you are come, becauſe
theſe Rogues purſue My Blood, you and I muſt conſult how I may beſt part with it.</hi> Yet even
this was ſpoken without any Fury or Violence; for though all about Him was tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
with Horrour, Deſtruction and Contempt, His Soul ſeemed unconcerned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a Calm Serenity, and was full of its own Majeſty. This Vertue made Him
forget He was a <hi>Prince</hi> born to command, and only conſider that He was a Chriſtian
whoſe Calling obliges to Suffer.</p>
                  <p>He had found out a way to Glory by <hi>Humility.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note>
 For <hi>the Supream Power, to which
nothing can be added, hath no better way to encreaſe, than when ſecured of its own Greatneſs
it humbleth it ſelf. And the Dignity of Princes is in nothing farther from Envy and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than in Humility.</hi> He deſpiſed the converſe of none, though poor, if honeſt: He
ſhewed to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Philip Warwick</hi> (who had much of His Truſt and Affections) in the <hi>Iſle of
Wight,</hi> a poor ragged Old Man, and told him <hi>he was a very honeſt fellow, and had been
His beſt Company for two months together.</hi> He would have thoſe about Him converſe
rather with Himſelf than with His Majeſty, and with them would He mingle Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
as One of the People: none made an end of ſpeaking till His own Modeſty,
not Pride in the <hi>King,</hi> thought it was enough: and He never did contradict any Man
without this mollifying Preface, <hi>By your favour, Sir.</hi> His Diſcourſe as it was familiar,
ſo it was directed to raiſe thoſe that heard it to a nearer approach to Himſelf by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
for He did not proudly ſcoff at, but gently laboured to mend the defects of
His Subjects. When Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> had in ſome degree loſt the Manage of His
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60710:39"/>
Voice, His Majeſty ſhewed him his Infirmity, and taught him to amend it; which
that Excellent Perſon often mentioned as an inſtance of a Gracious Condeſcenſion of
Majeſty. When Noble Youths came to take their leaves of Him before they went to
foreign travel, He would not let them go without His Inſtructions, of which this was
one, <hi>My Lord, Keep always the best Company, and be ſure never to be Idle.</hi> Thus He
would confer the Vertues as well as the Titles of Nobility, He laboured to keep them
as Majeſty had made them, and that that blood might not be tainted in them which
was honoured in their Anceſtors. Nor did He deſire that they ſhould be otherwiſe
than He directed, as <hi>Tyrants and weak Princes will commend thoſe Vertues which they are
afraid of, for they dread or envy their Subjects Parts and Abilities. Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves that
a <hi>Tyrant</hi> cares not to hear his Vaſſals ſpeak any thing that is either Grave or Generous;
and it is reckoned among the Uſurpations of ſuch Monſters, that they would have the
opinion to be the Only <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Gallant. Plato</hi> indangered his Life when he converſed
with the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, becauſe he was thought to underſtand more than his Hoſt.
It was obſerved of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (by one of his confident Teachers) that in the time of
his Tyranny he loved no man that ſpoke Senſe, and had ſeveral Artifices to diſparage
it among his Slaves that attended him; and he would highly extol thoſe Pulpit-Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
that had moſt Canting and leaſt Reaſon. But the <hi>King</hi> thought it the Honour of
Principality to rule over Excellent Perſons, and affected to be Great only by being
Better; and to raiſe their Spirits would ſtoop with His own.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe He always choſe the moſt accompliſhed that He knew,<note place="margin">His Choice of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State.</note>
 to be His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State and cloſeſt Confidents: for as <hi>the fortune of Princes ſtands in need of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Friends, which are the ſurest ſupports of Empire;</hi> ſo He would always ſeek the Beſt,
and thoſe He thought fitteſt for His Employments, which a bad or weak <hi>King</hi> would
hate or fear. Therefore He had always the fineſt Pens and ableſt Heads in His Cauſe,
and Perſons likewiſe of Integrity in His Service: for the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
that were clamoured againſt as the greateſt Criminals, were not guilty enough,
even by thoſe accuſations which they were loaded with, and yet not proved, to receive
the Cenſure of the Law, but were to be condemned in an unaccuſtomed way of ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Engliſh</hi> blood. When ſome diſcovered their Abilities even by oppoſing His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
He preferr'd the Publick Benefit which might be by their Endowments to His
private Injuries; He would either buy them off to His Service by ſome Place of Truſt,
or win them to His Friendſhip; unleſs He ſaw them to be ſuch whoſe Natures were
corrupted by their Deſigns, (for He had a moſt excellent Sagacity in diſcerning the
Spirits of men) or they were ſuch who polluted their parts by proſtituting Religion
to ſome baſe ends (the injuries of which He could never neglect:) and ſuch He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceived Honourable in a Court, nor hoped they would ever be faithful and
quiet in a Community. Among theſe Purchaces were reckoned the Lord Lieutenant
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> and others now living, whoſe Perfections honoured
His Judgment and juſtified His Choice.</p>
                  <p>He had no Favorite,<note place="margin">His Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to His People.</note>
 as a Miniſter of Pleaſures, to gratifie whoſe Luſts and Vanities
He might be ſollicited to do things contrary to the benefit of the Community; but
all were Inſtruments of Government, and muſt be able to ſerve the Publick, whom He
took to ſerve Himſelf. For no Prince was ever more affectionate of His People than
He was, nor did He think His Intereſt ſeparate from theirs. Thoſe nice diſtinctions
and cautious limits of Prerogative and Liberty which the Faction invented to enjealous
the People with, were all indiſtinctly compriſed by Him in an Uniform and Conſtant
care of a juſt Government: none dared to adviſe Him to attempt at a power His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
had parted with, or the Laws had concluded Him from. For He told the
Lords, when He purged the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> from the Accuſation of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi>
(that He had adviſed His Majeſty to make uſe of ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> to reduce this Kingdom;
on which, though it had but a ſingle and various teſtimony, the Faction built their
Practices againſt His Life) <hi>I think no body durſt ever be ſo impudent as to move Me to it;
for if they had, I ſhould have made them ſuch an Example, and put ſuch a mark upon them,
that all Poſterity ſhould know my Intentions by it. For my Intention was ever to govern by
the Law, and not otherwiſe.</hi> He thought He could not be happy unleſs His People were
ſo; as we found our ſelves miſerable when He was not proſperous. Therefore He
parted with ſo much of His Prerogative to buy our Peace, and purchaſe our Content.
He ſought their Love by affecting them, the only way of gaining it, becauſe that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
only is free and impatient of Command. Nor was He ever more pleaſed than in
the enjoyment of it: When His Third Parliament granted five Subſidies, and it was
told Him that <hi>there was not One Voice diſſenting,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He wept for joy;</hi> and it had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60710:40"/>
been happy for the People, if the <hi>King</hi> had always had ſuch cauſe of Tears, and His
Eyes had been always wet with the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Conteſts for Liberty could never have been more unſeaſonable than under this <hi>Prince,</hi>
for He never denied His Subjects the removal of any juſt Grievance, yea He parted
ſometimes, through their own importunity deluded by the Faction, with that which
ſhould have kept them Free: And when He made ſuch Conceſſions, which tended to
the prejudice of thoſe that deſired it, He would ſay to ſome about Him, that <hi>He would
never have granted theſe things, but that He hoped they would ſee the Inconvenience of that
Power which they begg'd from Him, yet themſelves could not manage, and return it to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place, before it became their Ruine.</hi> He was far from the ambition of <hi>Ill Princes</hi> to
<hi>ſeek an unlimited Power;</hi> but He thought it <hi>the Office of the best Sovereign to ſet bounds to
Liberty.</hi> He deſpiſed His Life if it were to be bought by the Miſery of the Nation,
and therefore rejected the Propoſitions of the Army as the Conditions of His Safety,
when tendred to Him the day before His Murther, becauſe they would inſlave the
People. Neither would He expoſe particular perſons to an evident and inevitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
though it were to ſecure Himſelf: for when my Lord <hi>Newburgh</hi> and his Noble
Lady, at whoſe houſe in <hi>Bagſhot</hi> He did ſtay as He was removed from <hi>Carisbrook</hi> to
<hi>Windſor,</hi> propoſed to Him a way to eſcape from that bloody Guard that hurried Him
to the Slaughter, He rejected it, ſaying, <hi>If I ſhould get away, they would cut you in pieces;</hi>
and therefore would not try their deſign, though it ſeemed feaſible.</p>
                  <p>With theſe arts He did ſeek to oblige the Community;<note place="margin">His Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</note>
 but the Faction's Slanders
hindred the Succeſs: which they the more eaſily obſtructed, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> never
affected <hi>Popularity,</hi> for that <hi>conſiſts in an induſtrious pleaſing of the People in minute and
ordinary Circumſtances,</hi> but He always endeavoured by a ſolid Vertue their real Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and therefore in confidence of that neglected a ſpecious Compliance with the leſs
beneficial Humours of the Vulgar: ſo that the <hi>Multitude,</hi> who <hi>are taken with things of
the lighteſt conſideration,</hi> could not ſufficiently value Him, being not able to apprehend
His Worth: for a <hi>Statiſt</hi> obſerves, <hi>Moderate Princes are always admired, but Heroick are
never underſtood.</hi> On particular Perſons (if not the ſworn creatures of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and by Treaſon made inhumane) He feldom failed by converſing to take them.
His Trophies in this kind, even when He was deſpoiled of means to bribe their hopes,
were innumerable; and thoſe that engaged againſt Him ere they knew Him, after
the Knowledge of Him did curſe their Credulity and their proſperous Arms. A clear
inſtance of this (to mention no more) was in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Vines,</hi> one of the Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
(who are conceived to be too tenacious of a prejudice againſt thoſe that diſlike
their Government) that were ſent to diſpute againſt Epiſcopacy: for he admiring the
Abilities of the <hi>King</hi> which He manifeſted in aſſerting of it, profeſſed to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Burroughs,</hi>
(one whoſe Attendance the <hi>King</hi> required, and found him faithful to the extremeſt
dangers in thoſe enterpriſes in which he ſeveral times engaged for His Safety,) <hi>how he
had been deluded to unworthy thoughts of the King, but was now convinced to an exceeding
Reverence of Him, and hoped ſo of others;</hi> and earneſtly ſolicited thoſe that attended on
Him, to uſe all means to reſcue Him from the intended Villany of the Army; ſaying,
<hi>Our happineſs was great in ſuch a Prince, and our Miſery in the Loſs of Him would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</hi>
Yet He never courted, although He won them, but His paſſage to their
hearts was through their brain, and they firſt Admired and then Loved Him.</p>
                  <p>As He was powerful to gain,<note place="margin">His Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>
 ſo He was careful to keep Friends. <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the
Publick and Private was His chiefeſt Care; for He knew how <hi>neceſſary it is for Princes
to be faithful, becauſe it is ſo much their Intereſt that others ſhould not be falſe.</hi> Though it
is a Myſtery of Empire with other <hi>Kings</hi> to proportion their Faith to their Advantage,
yet He abhorred to promiſe any thing which He could not Religiouſly obſerve. Some
over-fine <hi>Politici</hi> would have had Him grant all the Deſires of the Faction as the moſt
immediate way to their Ruine; for it was ſuppoſed they could never agree in dividing
the Spoil, and their diſſenſions would have opened a way for the recovery of His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
Rights. But He was ſo conſtant in all that was good, that He thought the
purchaſe of Greatneſs too vile for the breach of His Faith, and He hated thoſe acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which would give Him cauſe to bluſh. This Heroick Expreſſion often fell from
Him, <hi>Leave Me to My Conſcience and Honour, and let what will befal Me.</hi> His Enemies
knew this ſo natural, that if they could make their Propoſitions repugnant to His
Conſcience, they were ſure no Peace ſhould obſtruct their Deſigns. Nay, He was
faithful in thoſe Stipulations wherein their firſt Breach would have juſtified a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from His Promiſe; though He ſaw this Vertue would be rewarded with His Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For when ſome of His Attendants at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> daily importuned Him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60710:40"/>
for His Safety from the perfidious Violence of the Army, which every day they
had informations of, He made this return; <hi>Trouble not your ſelves, I have the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Faith and Honour engaged for My remaining here in Honour, Freedom, and Safety, and
I will not diſhonour My ſelf by Eſcaping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As He was to the Publick ſo to His Private Obligations. No aſſaults could take the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> from His Protection: for though His forein Enterpriſes required
ſupplies of Money, and the Faction would not let the Bills for Subſidies paſs unleſs
they might be gratified with the Dukes blood, or Degradation from His Truſt, the
<hi>King</hi> would not buy them with the Life or Diſhonour of His Friend. And although
he fell afterwards as a Sacrifice to the Common hate, (for ſo the Aſſaſſinate pretended,
that he might give a Splendor to his Crime, <hi>It being more ſpecious to revenge the Publick
than private Injuries,</hi>) yet was he not the <hi>King</hi>'s Offering. In the caſe of the Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi> this Honour ſeemed to be clouded: But Poſterity will ſee that that Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was rather raviſhed from Him, (on deſign by his Enemies to rob him of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Fidelity,) than deſerted by Him; for He never left him till the Earl did aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
himſelf. And a Penitence for a Submiſſion (not Conſent) to the Rape made a
Satisfaction for the Offence, and repaired the damage of the Injury. For His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Tears over him will emblam and preſerve his name and blood to the honur of
Following Ages, more than the remnant of his days would have adminiſtred to his
glory.</p>
                  <p>It would be an Injury to His other Vertues to mention His <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>

becauſe it is an Infamy to be otherwiſe; unleſs to let Poſterity know, that no injured
Husband nor Diſhonoured Family conſpired to His Ruine, but ſuch who were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to Him for preſerving all their Rights in thoſe Relations unattempted, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them by His own example. He witneſſed His Conjugal <hi>Chastity</hi> the day before
His Death, (a time not to be ſpent in falſities, which was too little for neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
to appear before the God of Truth;) when He commanded the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
to tell her Mother, that <hi>His thoughts had never ſtrayed from Her, and His Love
ſhould be the ſame to the Laſt.</hi> The purity of His Speech likewiſe teſtified the Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of His Heart, for He did abhor all Obſcene and wanton Diſcourſe. And He was
ſo far from defiling the Beds, that He would not pollute the Ears of His Subjects.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Chaſtity</hi> found no Aſſaults from Intemperance,<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note>
 for He never fed to Luxury but
Health. His ſtrong Conſtitution required large Meals, but His Vertue took care they
ſhould not be gluttonous; for He delighted not in Sawces or Artifices to pleaſe the
Palate and raiſe the Luſt, but all was ſincere and ſolid, and therefore he never was
ſubject to a Surfeit. He always mingled Water with His Wine, which He never
drank pure but when He eat Veniſon; and He was ſo nice in obſerving the bounds of
<hi>Sobriety,</hi> that moſt times Himſelf would meaſure and mingle both together. He did
uſually at every Meal drink one Glaſs of Beer, another of wine, and a third of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſeldom drank between His Meals. Theſe though Ordinary Vertues, were
yet eminent in Him, ſince they could not be corrupted by the Power nor the Flatteries
of Fortune. And they are therefore mentioned to gratifie Poſterity; for <hi>men are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to know all even the minute Paſſages of Great and Vertuous Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being free from Incontinency and Intemperance,<note place="margin">His Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note>
 the gulphs of Treaſure and
Drayners of the Largeſt Exchequer, He had no other Vice to exhauſt the Publick
Stock, and ſo neceſſitate Him to fill it up by Oppreſſions, but He would by <hi>Frugality</hi>
make His Revenue ſufficient for the Majeſty of the Crown, and the Neceſſities of the
State. His own Nature indeed inclined Him to Magnificence, but the Vices of others
did inſtruct Him to moderate Expences. For He had found the Treaſury low, and
the Debts great, in His beginnings: He was aſſaulted with two expenſive Wars from
the two great Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Faction had obſtructed the uſual way of
Supplies by Parliaments. Therefore He was to find a Mine in Vertue; and by ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from Vanities, make proviſions for neceſſary and glorious Enterpriſes, which He
did effect: for in that ſhort time of Peace which He enjoyed He ſatisfied all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Debts, ſo furniſhed and increaſed His Navy, that it was the moſt conſiderable in
the whole World, ſupported His Confederate the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and by Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him for the Victories of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſo fill'd His own Treaſury, that it was
able of it ſelf to bear the weight of the firſt <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition without the Aids of the
Subject, who were never more able to contribute to their own ſafety, nor ever had
more reaſon, the ſwellings of that Nation breaking all the Banks and Fences of their
Liberty and Happineſs. But the <hi>King</hi> would let them ſee that as by His Government
He had made them rich, He would alſo keep them ſo by His Frugality. But thoſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60710:41"/>
whoſe firſt care was to make Him neceſſitous, and the next odious, did brand it with
the name of Covetouſneſs, which was as Falſe as Malicious; for He never ſpared when
Juſt Deſigns call'd for Expences, and was magnificent in Noble Undertakings, as in
the Repair of <hi>Paul</hi>'s. He was always Grateful, although thoſe men who meaſured
their Services not by their Duties, or their Merits, but by their Expectations from His
Fortune, thought Him not Liberal. He choſe rather not to burthen His People by
Subſidies, than load particular Servants with unequal Bounties. For <hi>Good Princes
chuſe to be loved rather for their Benefits to the Community than for thoſe to private perſons.
And it may be Vanity and Oſtentation, but not Liberality, when the gifts of the Prince are
not proportioned to the Common Neceſſity.</hi> His ſparings were like thoſe of Indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that His Subjects as Children might have the more. He never, like ſubtle and
rapacious Kings, made or pretended a Neceſſity for Taxes, but was troubled when He
found it. The Contributions of Parliament He eſteemed not the increaſe of His pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Treaſure, but the Proviſions for the Common Safety, of which He would rather
be accounted a Steward than a Lord. When Faction and Sedition ſo deluded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that they could not ſee the preſervation of the whole conſiſted in contributing ſome
ſmall part, He freely parted with His own Inheritance to preſerve intire to them the
price of their Sweat and Labour.</p>
                  <p>As He had theſe Moral Vertues,<note place="margin">His Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>
 which are both the ſignatures of Majeſty and the
Ornaments of a Royal Spirit, ſo He was no leſs compleat in the Intellectual. His Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
was as Comprehenſive as His Juſt Power, and He was Maſter of more
ſorts of Knowledge than He was of Nations. How much He knew of the Myſteries
and Controverſies of Divinity was evident in His Diſcourſes and Papers with <hi>Hender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and thoſe at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where He ſingly Diſputed for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> one whole
day againſt Fifteen Commiſſioners and their Four Chaplains, (the moſt experienced
and ſubtle members of all the Oppoſite Party) with ſo much Acuteneſs and Felicity
that even His Oppoſers admired Him. He ſo dexterouſly managed His Diſcourſe with
the Miniſters, that He made it evident they perſwaded Him to that which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
judged unlawful, and had condemned as Sacriledge, when they pretended to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Scruples of His Conſcience, and to aſſure Him He might ſafely alienate the
Church-Lands. And the Commiſſioners ſenſible how unequal their Miniſters were to
diſcourſe with Him, for ever after ſilenced them, and permitted no Diſputes but by
Papers. At that time He exceeded the opinion of His friends about Him. One of
them ſaid in aſtoniſhment, that <hi>Certainly God had inſpired Him.</hi> Another, that <hi>His
Majeſty was to a Wonder improved by His Privacies and Afflictions.</hi> But a third, that
had had the Honour of a nearer Service, aſſured them that the <hi>King was never leſs, only
He had now the opportunity of appearing in His full Magnitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Law of the Land He was as knowing (as Himſelf ſaid to the Parricides, yet
was no boaſter of His own Parts) as any Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> who did not profeſs
the Publick Practice of it: eſpecially thoſe Parts of it which concerned the Commerce
between <hi>King</hi> and People. In that Art which is peculiar to Princes, <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi>
He knew as much as the moſt proſperous Contemporary <hi>Kings</hi> or their moſt exerciſed
Miniſters, yet ſcorned to follow thoſe Rules of it which lead from the Paths of Juſtice.
The Reſerves that other Princes uſed in their Leagues and Contracts, to colour the
breaches of Faith, and thoſe inglorious and dark Intrigues of ſubtle Politicians, He
did perfectly abhor: but His Letters, Declarations, Speeches, Meditations, are full of
that Political Wiſdom which is conſiſtent with Chriſtianity. He had ſo quick an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
into theſe Myſteries, and ſo early arrived to the Knowledge of it, that when He
was young, and had juſt gotten out of the Court and Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> He cenſured
the Weakneſs of that Myſterious Council. For He was no ſooner on Shipboard, but
the firſt words He ſpake were, <hi>I diſcovered two Errors in thoſe great Maſters of Policy;
One that they would uſe Me ſo Ill, and another that after ſuch Vſage they permitted Me to
Depart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As thoſe former parts of Knowledge did enable Him to know <hi>Men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Skill in all Arts.</note>
 and how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their different humours, and to temper them to a fitneſs for Society, and make
them ſerviceable to the Glory of that God whoſe Miniſter He was: ſo His Soul was
ſtored with a full Knowledge of the Nature of <hi>Things,</hi> and eaſily comprehended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all kinds of Arts that either were for Delight or of a Publick Uſe; for He was
ignorant of nothing but of what He thought it became Him to be negligent, (for
many parts of Learning that are for the Ornament of a Private perſon are beneath the
Cares of a Crowned Head.) He was well skilled in things of Antiquity, could judge
of Meddals whether they had the Number of years they pretended unto; His Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60710:41"/>
and Cabinets were full of thoſe things on which length of Time put the Value of
Rarities. In Painting He had ſo excellent a Fancy, that He would ſupply the defect
of Art in the Workman, and ſuddenly draw thoſe Lines, give thoſe Airs and Lights,
which Experience and Practice had not taught the Painter. He could judge of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
and cenſure whether the Cannon were mounted to Execution or no. He
had an excellent Skill in Guns, knew all that belonged to their making. The exacteſt
arts of building Ships for the moſt neceſſary uſes of ſtrength or good ſailing, together
with all their furniture, were not unknown to Him. He underſtood and was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the making of Clocks and Watches. He comprehended the Art of Printing.
There was not any one Gentleman of all the three Kingdoms that could compare with
Him in an Univerſality of Knowledge. He incouraged all the Parts of Learning, and
He delighted to talk with all kind of Artiſts, and with ſo great a Facility did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Myſteries of their Profeſſions, that He did ſometime ſay, <hi>He thought He
could get His Living, if Neceſſitated, by any Trade He knew of, but making of Hangings:</hi>
although of theſe He underſtood much, and was greatly delighted in them; for He
brought ſome of the moſt curious Workmen from Forein Parts to make them here in
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Writings ſhew what Notions He had gathered from the whole ſtore of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note>

                     <hi>which He cloathed with a Wonderful and moſt charming</hi> Eloquence. <hi>Which was
unqueſtionably ſo great, that thoſe who endeavoured to deſpoil Him of His Civil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
granted Him a deſerved Empire among famous Writers. The Book of His
Meditations is alone ſufficient to make His Aſſaſſinates execrable to all that in any Age
ſhall have a ſenſe of Piety, or a love to Wiſdom and Eloquence.</hi> For ſo great an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Breaſts of men do excellent Writings acquire for their Authors, that though they
may be otherwiſe blameable, yet their Works render their Memories precious; and the violent
Deaths of ſuch increaſe their Glory, while they load their Murtherers with Ignominy. All men,
eſpecially among Poſterity, deeming ſo great Wits could not be cut off but to the Publick Injury,
and by Perſons brutiſhly mad, or by ſome horrid ſins debauched to an Enmity with mankind.
So that all future times ſhall admire and applaud His Writings againſt them, and curſe their
Injuſtice to Him.</p>
                  <p>His Wiſdom was not only Speculative in His Writings,<note place="margin">His Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
 but alſo Practical in His
Counſels. None found out better means for accompliſhing a Deſign, provided ſafer
expedients for the Reſſorts of Difficulties, or more clearly foreſaw the Event at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
nor were any Counſels ſo proſperous as His own, when they were vigorouſly
proſecuted by thoſe whom He intruſted with the Execution; and He ſeldom miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but when He inclined to follow the Advices of others; as He did in that inauſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attempt to take <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> wherein He forſook His own Reaſons, which He ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with all poſſible Evidence of Succeſs, to march towards <hi>London.</hi> He ſaw into the
Intrigues of His Enemies; and had not the Treacheries (which being ſecret are
above the Caution of Humane Nature) of ſome that followed Him opened to them
His Deſigns, He had (by the Ordinary Courſe of Providence) covered them with
the ſhame both of Imprudence and Overthrow. Thoſe Miſeries that the Faction af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they got into Power brought upon the Nation, and the Events of their deſtructive
Enterpriſes, were diſcovered and foretold by Him in the very beginnings to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
World, who notwithſtanding were Fatally blinded to chuſe their own Ruine.</p>
                  <p>Whenſoever His Secretaries had drawn up, by the Direction of the <hi>Council,</hi> Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
or any other Papers, and offered them to His peruſal, though both they and
the Council had done their parts, yet He would always with His own hand correct
them both as to Matter and Form. He commonly uſing theſe words when He took
the Pen in His hand, <hi>Come, I am a good Cobler:</hi> and the Corrections were acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them all to be both for the greater luſtre and advantage of the Writings. His
Inſtructions to His Ambaſſadors, Commiſſioners, Deputies, were ſo full of Wiſdom,
and ſuch prudent proviſions for all the Reſſorts of thoſe they were to treat with, that
there was nothing to be ſupplied on their parts to make their Negotiations happy, but
ſeaſonable Applications, or a fortune to deal with reaſonable men. It was the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a Noble Perſon (who was dear to Him for his Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs,
and was of His Council in all His Troubles) that <hi>had the King been a Counſellor to any
other Prince, He would have gained the Eſteem of an Oracle,</hi> all His Propoſals being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the greateſt Reaſon, and proper to the Buſineſs conſulted about. Thoſe that
have been forward to interpret His Actions by the Succeſs, and from thence have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the Cenſure of His Prudence, conſidered not the numerous Difficulties in
forming any Reſolution, nor the fallacious repreſentations of Affairs to Him, but only
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60710:42"/>
looked upon His unproſperous Reſolves according to the Fate of unhappy Counſels,
which <hi>is to have that condemned which was put in Execution, and that praiſed as beſt which
was never tried.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was He made for Empire as well as born unto it;<note place="margin">The Cenſure of His For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note>
 and had all thoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
which, if we had been free to chuſe, muſt have determined our Election of a
Sovereign to Him alone, there being nothing wanting in Him that the ſevereſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Princes do number among the Requiſites of a compleat Monarch. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wonder of thoſe who conceive every man to be the Artificer of His own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
how it came to paſs that He had not that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an uninterrupted current of
Succeſs (which ſome men reckon among the conſtitutives of Happineſs) in all His
Enterpriſes. To Others that impute all our affairs here below to an inviolable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the Decrees of Heaven, which yet they acknowledge juſt, though dark, it
ſeemed one of the Riddles of Providence, that a <hi>King</hi> of ſo great Vertues ſhould yet
be calamitous: for let Poſterity judge how great and how good this <hi>Prince</hi> was, that
could not be ruined even after a <hi>War</hi> (which <hi>uſually imbitters the Spirits of thoſe that
are moleſted by it</hi>) and a total <hi>Overthrow (whoſe common Conſequent is Contempt</hi>) but by
ſo various and ſuch wicked Arts; and was judged by all men, though He wanted,
yet <hi>to deſerve Proſperity (as to humane judgment,)</hi> which (as ſome think) <hi>is the trueſt
Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe Doubts there appears no Reſolution ſo obvious as that into the Pleaſure
of the Divine Majeſty, who provoked by our ſins, which had profaned his Mercies,
and abuſed the Peace and Plenty he gave us, would chaſtiſe us by the ſcourge of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War, the corrective of too much felicity, and taking away the beſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> leave
us to the Pride and Violence of the baſeſt of men. And that it was a wrath directed
againſt us was apparent, becauſe the misfortunes and fall of that Incomparable <hi>Prince</hi>
opened upon us an avenue for all thoſe miſeries that a Community is obnoxious unto
in the want of a lawful Government, while the Almighty ſecured the Glory of the
<hi>King</hi> even in His Sufferings, provided for the Support and Honour of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in its loweſt Eſtate, and miraculouſly preſerved the Chief of it from innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dangers, and made us to ſee afterwards in the Series of his Providences that he had
not withdrawn his loving-kindneſs from the Houſe of <hi>King</hi> CHARLES, by reſtoring
it to its primitive Grandeur.</p>
                  <p>And this he was pleaſed to ſignifie to the <hi>King</hi> by a Paſſage that appeared little leſs
than a Miracle.<note place="margin">A Preſage of His Fall, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State of the Royal Family.</note>
 For while He was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> now Lord
High-Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> (a Perſon of unqueſtionable Honour and Veracity, of an
eminent Integrity, above the Flattery of Princes, who doth atteſt this Occurrence) as
Gentleman of the Bed-chamber lay one Night in the ſame Chamber with Him, the
Wax-<hi>Mortar,</hi> which according to Cuſtom the <hi>King</hi> always had in His Chamber, was in
the night, as they both conceived and took notice of, fully extinguiſhed. But my Lord
riſing in the Morning found it lighted, and ſaid to the KING, <hi>Sir, this Mortar now
burns very clearly:</hi> at which they both exceedingly wondred, as fully concluding it
had been out in the Night, and they could not imagine how any of the Grooms or any
other could poſſibly light it, the Door being locked with a Spring within. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying
the wonder of both for the preſent, the <hi>King</hi> afterwards when He ſaw the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of His Enemies preſs hard upon His Life and Ruine, reflecting upon this Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
drew it into this Preſage, <hi>That though God would permit His Light to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
for a time, yet He would at last light it again;</hi> which was verified in the Event:
for though God ſuffered the Faction to ſpill His blood, yet after many years of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and when he had permitted thoſe Monſters to bring us to the brinks of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he reſtored His Son to the Crown in as much Splendour and Greatneſs as any
of His Predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>As His Abilities for the Publick adminiſtration of Government were all apt to raiſe
Admiration;<note place="margin">His Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</note>
 ſo His Recreations and Privacies gave a Delight to ſuch as communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſight of them, and there needed no more to beget an Honour of Him than
to behold Him in His Diverſions, which were all ſerious, and there was no part of
His time which either wanted benefit or deſerved not Commendation. In His youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
days, His pleaſures were in Riding, and ſometimes in breaking the great Horſe;
and He did it ſo gracefully, that He deſerved that Statue of Braſs which did repreſent
Him on Horſe-back. Beſides this He delighted in Hunting, an active and ſtirring
Exerciſe to accuſtom Him to toils, and harden that body whoſe mind abhorred the
ſoftneſs of <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Eaſe,</hi> which <hi>Vicious Princes think a part of Power and the Rewards
of Publick Cares:</hi> but He uſed this as the way whereby the Antient Heroes were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60710:42"/>
to Labours, and by contending with ſome beaſts in Strength, and others in
Swiftneſs, firſt to rout, then to chaſe their flying Enemies. When the ſeaſon of the
year did not permit this ſport, then Tennis, Gough, Bowls were the ways of His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
and in all theſe He was wonderfully active and excellent.</p>
                  <p>His ſofter pleaſures were Books, and of His time ſpent in theſe there were many
Monuments. In His Library at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>James</hi>'s there was kept a Collection of His, of the
excellent Sayings of Authors, written with His own hand, and in his Youth, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to His Father <hi>King</hi> JAMES: and there is yet extant in the hands of a Worthy
Perſon, His Extracts written with His own hand, out of My Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Book
againſt <hi>Fiſber,</hi> of all the Arguments againſt the Papiſts, digeſted into ſo excellent a
Method, that He gave Light and Strength to them even while He did epitomiſe them
into a ſheet or two of Paper. The ſame Care and Pains He had beſtowed in reading
the moſt Judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the learned Works of Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> out of all which
He had gathered whatſoever was excellent in them, and fitted them for His ready
uſe. When He was tired with Reading, then He applied Himſelf to Diſcourſe,
wherein He both benefited Himſelf and others; and He was good at the relation of a
Story, or telling of an Occurrence. When theſe were tedious by continuance, He
would either play at Cheſs, or pleaſe Himſelf with His Pictures, of which He had
many choice Pieces of the beſt Maſters, as <hi>Titian, Rafael, Tintoret</hi> and others, with
which He had adorned His moſt frequented Palaces, as alſo with moſt antique Pieces
of Sculpture; ſo that to thoſe that had travelled it ſeemed that <hi>Italy</hi> was tranſlated to
His Court.</p>
                  <p>As His Spirit was thus accompliſhed,<note place="margin">The Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of His Body.</note>
 ſo His Body had its Elegancies. His Stature
was of a juſt height, rather decent than tall; His Body erect, and not enclining to a
Corpulency, nor meager, till His Afflictions wrought too ſtrongly upon it to a Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
His Limbs exactly proportioned, His Face full of Majeſty, and His Brow large
and fair: His Eyes ſo quick and piercing, that they went farther than the Superficies
of men, and ſearched their more Inward parts; for at the firſt ſight He would paſs a
judgment upon the frame of a man's Spirit and Faculties, and He was not often miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
having a ſtrange happineſs in Phyſiognomy, and by reaſon of this He would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
any one He had ſeen but once many years after. His Complexion was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to a Paleneſs, His Hair a brown, which He wore of a moderate length, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in gentle and eaſie curles: upon His left ſide He indulged one Lock to a greater
length in the youthful part of His Life. His Beard He wore picked, but after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
had paſſed thoſe <hi>Votes of No Addreſſes,</hi> He permitted it to grow neglectedly and
to cover more of His face. His Geſtures had nothing of affectation, but full of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
gravity. His motions were ſpeedy, and His gate faſt: which ſhewed the
Alacrity and Vigour of His Mind, for His Affections were temperate. He was of a
moſt healthful Conſtitution, and after the infirmities of His Childhood was never ſick.
Once He had the ſmall Pox, but the Malignity of it was ſo ſmall, that it altered not
His Stomach, nor put Him to the abſtinence of one Meal, neither did it detain Him
above a fortnight under the Care of His Phyſicians.</p>

                  <p>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou haſt a ſhort account how this beſt of Princes Lived and Died;
a Subject that was fit to be writ only with the point of a Scepter: none but a Royal
Breaſt can have Sentiments equal to His Vertues, nor any but a Crowned Head can
frame Expreſſions to repreſent His Worth. He that had nothing Common or Ordinary
in His Life and Fortune is almoſt prophaned by a Vulgar Pen. The attempt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
admits no Apology but this, That it was fit that Poſterity, when they read His
Works (for they ſhall continue while theſe Iſlands are inhabited, to upbraid Time, and
reproach Marble Monuments of weakneſs) ſhould alſo be told that His Actions were as
Heroick as His Writings, and His Life more elegant than His Style. Which not being

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know very well what a great diſadvantage it is for Me, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Argument of Divinity with ſo able and learned a Man as
your ſelf, it being your, not My profeſſion; which really was the
cauſe that made Me deſire to hear ſome learned man argue My
Opinion with you, of whoſe Abilities I might be confident, that I
ſhould not be led into an Errour, for want of having all which
could be ſaid layed open unto Me. For indeed my humour is
ſuch, that I am ſtill partial for that ſide which I imagine ſuffers
for the weakneſs of thoſe that maintain it; alwaies thinking that
equal Champions would caſt the balance on the other part. Yet
ſince that you (thinking that it will ſave time) deſire to go another way, I ſhall not conteſt
with you in it, but treating you as my Phyſician, give you leave to take your own way of cure:
only I thought fit to warn you, leſt if you (not I) ſhould be miſtaken in this, you would be
fain (in a manner) to begin anew.</p>
                     <p>Then know, that from my Infancy I was blest with the King my Fathers love, which I thank
God, was an invaluable Happineſs to me all his daies: and among all his cares for my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
his chief was, to ſettle Me right in Religion; in the true knowledge of which He
made Himſelf ſo eminent to all the World, that I am ſure none can call in queſtion the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Fame in that particular, without ſhewing their own ignorant baſe Malice. He it
was who laid in Me the grounds of Chriſtianity, which to this day I have been conſtant in.
So that whether the Worthineſs of my Inſtructor be conſidered, or the not few years that I have
been ſetled in my Principles; it ought to be no ſtrange thing, if it be found no eaſie work to
make Me alter them: and the rather, that hitherto I have (according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22.) been happy in <hi>Not condemning my ſelf in that thing which I allow.</hi>
Thus having ſhewed you How, it remains to tell you what I believe, in relation to theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Diſtractions.</p>
                     <p>No one thing made Me more reverence the Reformation of My Mother, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
than that it was done (according to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> defence, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 18.) <hi>neither with
multitude, nor with tumult,</hi> but legally and orderly, and by thoſe whom I conceive to have
the Reforming power; which, with many other inducements, made Me alwaies confident that
the work was very perfect as to Eſſentials; of which number <hi>Church-Government</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
one, I put no queſtion, but that would have been likewiſe altered if there had been
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60710:44"/>
cauſe. Which opinion of Mine was ſoon turned into more than a confidence, when I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that in this particular (as I must ſay of all the reſt) we retained nothing, but according
as it was deduced from the Apoſtles to be the conſtant univerſal cuſtom of the Primitive
Church; and that it was of ſuch conſequence as by the alteration of it we ſhould deprive our
ſelves of a lawful Prieſthood; and then, how the Sacraments can be duly adminiſtred, is eaſie
to judge. Theſe are the principal Reaſons which make Me believe that Biſhops are neceſſary for
a Church, and, I think, ſufficient for Me (if I had no more) not to give my conſent for
their expulſion out of <hi>England.</hi> But I have another obligation, that to My particular is a no leſs
tie of Conſcience, which is, my <hi>Coronation Oath.</hi> Now if (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23.)
<hi>He that doubeth is damned if he eat,</hi> what can I expect, if I ſhould not only give way
knowingly to my Peoples ſinning, but likewiſe be perjured My ſelf?</p>
                     <p>Now conſider, ought I not to <hi>keep My ſelf from preſumptuous ſins?</hi> and you know who
ſaies, <hi>What doth it profit a Man though he ſhould gain the whole World, and loſe
his own Soul?</hi> Wherefore my conſtant maintenance of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (where there
was never any other Government ſince Chriſtianity was in this Kingdom) methinks, ſhould
be rather commended than wondred at; my Conſcience directing Me to maintain the Laws of
the Land: which being only my endeavours at this time, I deſire to know of you, <hi>what
warrant there is in the Word of God, for Subjects to endeavour to force their King's
Conſcience, or to make him alter Laws againſt his will.</hi> If this be not My preſent
caſe, I ſhall be glad to be miſtaken; or if my Judgment in Religion hath been miſled all this
time, I ſhall be willing to be better directed: till when you muſt excuſe Me, to be conſtant to
the Grounds which the <hi>King my Father</hi> hath taught Me.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>IT is Your Majeſtie's Royal Goodneſs, and not my merit, that hath made Your
Majeſty to conceive any opinion of my Abilities; which (were they worthy of
the ſmalleſt teſtimony from Your Majeſty) ought in all duty to be improved for Your
Majeſtie's ſatisfaction. And this I intended in my coming here at this time, by a free,
yet modeſt, expreſſion of the true motives and inducements which drew my mind to
the diſlike of Epiſcopal Government, wherein I was bred in my younger years in the
Univerſity. Like as I did apprehend that it was not Your Majeſtie's purpoſe to have
the Queſtion diſputed by Divines on both ſides; which I would never (to the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cauſe) have undertaken alone, and which ſeldom or never hath proved an
effectual way for finding of Truth, or moving the minds of Men to relinquiſh their
former Tenents, <hi>Dum res tranſit à judicio in affectum;</hi> witneſs the Polemicks between
the Papiſts and us, and among our ſelves about the matter now in hand, theſe many
years paſt.</p>
                     <p>1. SIR, when I conſider Your Majeſtie's Education under the hand of ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the length of time wherein Your Majeſty hath been ſetled in Your Principles of
Church-Government, the Arguments which have continually in private and publick,
eſpecially of late at <hi>Oxford,</hi> filled Your Majeſtie's ears for the Divine Right thereof,
Your Coronation Oath, and divers State reaſons which Your Majeſty doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I do not wonder, nor think it any ſtrange thing, that Your Majeſty hath not
at firſt given place to a contrary impreſſion. I remember that the famous <hi>Joannes
Picus Mirandula</hi> proveth by irrefragable Reaſons (which no rational man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict)
<hi>That no man hath ſo much power over his own Vnderstanding, as to make himſelf
believe what he will, or to think that to be true which his Reaſon telleth him is falſe; much
leſs is it poſſible for any Man to have his Reaſon commanded by the will or at the pleaſure of
another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It is a true ſaying of the School-men, <hi>Voluntas imperat intellectui quoad exercitium,
non quoad ſpecificationem;</hi> Mine own will or the will of another may command me to
think upon a matter, but no will or command can conſtrain me to determine otherwiſe
than my Reaſon teacheth me. Yet, Sir, I hope Your Majeſty will acknowledge (for
Your Paper profeſſeth no leſs) that according to the ſaying of <hi>Ambroſe, Non est pudor
ad meliora tranſire,</hi> It is neither ſin nor ſhame to change to the better. <hi>Symmachus</hi> in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60710:44"/>
one of his Epiſtles (I think to the Emperours <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi>) alledgeth all
thoſe motives from Education, from Preſcription of time, from worldly Proſperity,
and the flouriſhing condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and from the Laws of the Land,
to perſwade them to conſtancy in the ancient Pagan profeſſion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> againſt
the imbracing of the Chriſtian Faith. The like reaſons were uſed by the Jews for
<hi>Moſes</hi> againſt <hi>Christ;</hi> and may be uſed both for Popery and for the Papacy it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Reformation of Religion and Church-Government; and therefore can have
no more ſtrength againſt the Change now than they had in former times.</p>
                     <p>3. But Your Majeſty may perhaps ſay, That this is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> and nothing
elſe but the begging of the Queſtion: and I confeſs it were ſo, if there can be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
brought for a Reformation or Change. Your Majeſty reverences the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as being done legally and orderly, and by thoſe who
had the Reforming Power; and I do not deny but it were to be wiſh'd that Religion,
where there is need, were alwaies Reformed in that manner, and by ſuch power,
and that it were not committed to the Prelates, who have greateſt need to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
themſelves, nor left to the multitude, whom God ſtirreth up when Princes are
negligent. Thus did <hi>Jacob</hi> reform his own Family, <hi>Moſes</hi> deſtroyed the golden Calf,
the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> reformed the Church in their time: but that ſuch Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been perfect, I cannot admit. <hi>Aſa</hi> took away Idolatry, but his Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not perfect; for <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> removed the High places, yet was not his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
perfect; for it was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that brake the Braſen Serpent, and <hi>Joſiah</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Idol-Temples, who therefore beareth this Elogie, <hi>That like unto him there was
no King before him.</hi> It is too well known that the Reformation of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII.
was moſt imperfect in the Eſſentials of Doctrine, Worſhip and Government: And
although it proceeded by ſome degrees afterward, yet the Government was never refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
the Head was changed, <hi>Dominus, non Dominium,</hi> and the whole lims of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
Hierarchy retained, upon what Snares and Temptations of Avarice and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
the great Enchanters of the Clergy, I need not expreſs. It was a hard ſaying
of <hi>Romanorum Malleus, Groſthed</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> That Reformation was not to be expected
<hi>niſi in ore gladii cruentandi.</hi> Yet this I may ſay, that the <hi>Laodicean</hi> lukewarmneſs of
Reformation here hath been matter of continued complaints to many of the Godly in
this Kingdom; occaſion of more Schiſm and Separation than ever was heard of in any
other Church, and of unſpeakable grief and ſorrow to other Churches, which God
did bleſs with greater purity of Reformation. The glory of this great work we hope
is reſerved for Your Majeſty, that to Your comfort and everlaſting Fame the praiſe of
godly <hi>Joſiah</hi> may be made Yours; which yet will be no diſpraiſe to Your Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. or any other Religious Princes before You; none of them
having ſo fair an opportunity as is now by the ſupreme Providence put into Your
Royal hands. My ſoul trembleth to think and to foreſee what may be the event, if
this opportunity be neglected. I will neither uſe the words of <hi>Mordecai, Eſth.</hi> 4. 14.
nor what <hi>Savonarola</hi> told another <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe I hope better things from Your
Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>4. To the Argument brought by your Majeſty (which I believe none of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
had they been all about You, could more briefly, and yet ſo fully and ſtrongly,
have expreſſed) [<hi>That nothing was retained in this Church but according as it was deduced
from the Apoſtles to the conſtant univerſal practice of the Primitive Church; and that it was
of ſuch conſequence, as by the alteration of it we ſhould deprive our ſelves of the lawfulneſs of
Priesthood;</hi> (I think Your Majeſty means a lawful Miniſtry) <hi>and then how the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can be adminiſtred is eaſy to judge</hi>] I humbly offer theſe conſiderations. Firſt,
What was not in the times of the Apoſtles, cannot be deduced from them. We ſay
in <hi>Scotland, It cannot be brought But, that is not the Ben:</hi> But (not to inſiſt now on a
Liturgy, and things of that kind) there was no ſuch Hierarchy, no ſuch difference
betwixt a Biſhop and a Presbyter in the times of the Apoſtles, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thence be deduced; for I conceive it to be as clear as if it were written with a
Sun-beam, that Presbyter and Biſhop are to the Apoſtles one and the ſame thing, no
majority, no inequality, or difference of office, power or degree betwixt the one and the
other, but a mere Identity in all. 2. That the Apoſtles intending to ſet down the
Offices and Officers of the Church, and ſpeaking ſo often of them, and of their
gifts and duties, and that not upon occaſion, but of ſet purpoſe, do neither expreſs
nor imply any ſuch Paſtor or Biſhop as hath power over other Paſtors; although
it be true, that they have diſtinctly and particularly expreſt the Office, Gifts and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the meaneſt Officers, ſuch as Deacons. 3. That in the Miniſtery of the New
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60710:45"/>
Teſtament there is a comely, beautiful, and Divine Order and ſubordination; one kind of
Miniſters both ordinary and extraordinary being placed in degree and dignity before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Apoſtles firſt, the Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their own ranks: but we
cannot find in Offices of the ſame kind, that one hath majority of power, or priority of
degree before another; no Apoſtle above other Apoſtles, (unleſs in moral reſpects) no
Evangeliſt above other Evangeliſts, or Deacon above other Deacons; why then a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
above other Paſtors? In all other ſorts of Miniſters ordinary and extraordinary
a Parity in their own kind, only in the office of Paſtor an Inequality. 4. That the
whole power and all the parts of the Miniſtry which are commonly called <hi>The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Order and Juriſdiction,</hi> are by the Apoſtles declared to be common to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
and Biſhop: and that, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 16, 17. the gradation in matter of Diſcipline
or Church cenſures is from one to two or more; and <hi>if he ſhall neglect them, tell it to
the Church:</hi> he ſaith not, tell it to the Biſhop; there is no place left to a retrograda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from more to one, were he never ſo eminent. If theſe conſiderations do not
ſatisfie, Your Majeſty may have more, or the ſame further cleared.</p>
                     <p>5. Secondly, I do humbly deſire Your Majeſty to take notice of the fallacy of that
Argument, from the Practice of the Primitive Church and the univerſal Conſent of
the Fathers. It is the Argument of the Papiſts for ſuch Traditions as no Orthodox
Divine will admit. The Law and Teſtimony muſt be the Rule. We can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
knowledge of the Practice univerſal of the Church for many years; <hi>Euſebius</hi> the
prime Hiſtorian confeſſeth ſo much: the learned <hi>Joſephus Scaliger</hi> teſtifieth, that from
the end of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> until a good time after, no certainty can be had from
Eccleſiaſtical Authors about Church matters. It is true, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> ſought the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
in the Apoſtles times, and the Myſtery of iniquity did then begin to work;
and no doubt in after times ſome puffed up with Ambition, and others overtaken
with Weakneſs, endeavoured alteration of Church-Government: but that all the
Learned and Godly of thoſe times conſented to ſuch a Change as is talked of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
will never be proved.</p>
                     <p>6. Thirdly, I will never think that Your Majeſty will deny the lawfulneſs of a
Miniſtery and the due adminiſtration of the Sacraments in the Reformed Churches
which have no Dioceſan Biſhops, ſith it is not only manifeſt by Scripture, but a great
many of the ſtrongeſt Champions for Epiſcopacy do confeſs, that Presbyters may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
other Presbyters; and that Baptiſm adminiſtred by a private Perſon, wanting a
publick Calling, or by a Midwife and by a Presbyter, although not ordained by a
Biſhop, are not one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>7. Concerning the other Argument taken from Your Majeſty's Coronation Oath,
I confeſs that both in the taking and keeping of an Oath (ſo ſacred a thing is it, and ſo
high a point of Religion) much tenderneſs is required: and far be it from us, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi
to obſerve our own Solemn Oath, to preſs Your Majeſty with the violation of Yours.
Yet, Sir I will crave Your leave, in all humbleneſs and ſincerity to lay before Your
Majeſty's eyes this one thing, (which perhaps might require a larger diſcourſe) That
although no humane authority can diſpenſe with an Oath, <hi>Quia Religio juramenti
pertinet ad forum Divinum;</hi> yet in ſome caſes it cannot be denied but the obligation of
an Oath ceaſeth: As when we ſwear homage and obedience to our Lord and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who afterwards ceaſeth to be our Lord and Superiour; for then the formal cauſe
of the Oath is taken away, and therefore the Obligation, <hi>Sublatâ Cauſâ tollitur Effectus,
Sublato Relato tollitur Correlatum:</hi> or when any Oath hath a ſpecial reference to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of thoſe to whom I make the promiſe, if we have their deſire or conſent, the
obligation ceaſeth; becauſe all ſuch Oaths from the nature of the thing do include a
condition. When the Parliaments of both Kingdoms have covenanted for the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or altering of a Law, Your Majeſty's Oath doth not bind You or Your Conſcience
to the obſerving of it; otherwiſe no Laws could be altered by the Legiſlative Power.
This I conceive hath been the ground of removing Epiſcopal Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and of removing the Biſhops out of the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> And I aſſure my ſelf that
Your Majeſty did not intend at the taking of Your Oath, that although both Houſes
of Parliament ſhould find an alteration neceſſary, although (which God Almighty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert)
You ſhould loſe Your ſelf and Your Poſterity and Crown, that You would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſent to the aboliſhing of ſuch a Law. If Your Majeſty ſtill object, <hi>that the
matter of the Oath is neceſſary and immutable;</hi> that doth not belong to this, but to the
former Argument.</p>
                     <p>8. I have but one word more concerning Your Piety to Your Royal Father and
Teacher of Happy Memory, with which Your Majeſty does conclude. Your Majeſty
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60710:45"/>
knows that King <hi>James</hi> never admitted <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> upon Divine Right; That His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
did ſwear and ſubſcribe to the Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline of the Church
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> That in the Preface of the latter Edition of <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> His Majeſty
gives an honourable teſtimony to thoſe that loved better the ſimplicity of the Goſpel,
than the pomp and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that He conceived
the Prelates to ſavour of the Popiſh Hierarchy; and that (could His Ghoſt now
ſpeak to Your Majeſty) He would not adviſe Your Majeſty to run ſuch hazards for
thoſe men who will chuſe rather to pull down Your Throne with their own ruine,
than that they periſh alone. The Lord give Your Majeſty a wiſe and diſcerning
Spirit to chuſe that in time which is right.</p>

A Reply to his Anſwer to my firſt Paper.
<date>June 6. 1646.</date>

                     <p>IF it had been the Honour of the Cauſe which I looked after, I would not have undertaken
to put Pen to Paper, or ſingly to have maintained this Argument againſt you (whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to my former Paper is ſufficient, without further proofs, to juſtifie my opinion of your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities:)
but it being merely (as you know) for my particular ſatisfaction, I aſſure you
that a Diſputation of well choſen Divines would be moſt effectual; and, I believe, you cannot
but grant, that I muſt beſt know how My ſelf may be beſt ſatisfied; for certainly My Taſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be guided by another man's Palate: and indeed I will ſay, that when it comes (as it muſt)
to Probations, I muſt have either Perſons or Books to clear the Allegations, or it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to give Me ſatisfaction. The fore-ſeeing of which made Me at firſt (for the ſaving
of time) deſire that ſome of thoſe Divines which I gave you in a Liſt might be ſent for.</p>
                     <p>2. Concerning your ſecond Section, I were much to blame if I ſhould not ſubmit to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> which you mention, for I would be unwilling to be found leſs ingenuous than
you ſhew your ſelf to be in the former part of it: wherefore my Reply is, that as I ſhall not be
aſhamed <hi>to change for the better,</hi> ſo I muſt ſee that it is <hi>better</hi> before I <hi>change,</hi> otherwiſe
Inconſtancy in this were both Sin and Shame; and remember (what your ſelf hath learnedly
enforced) that <hi>no man's Reaſon can be commanded by another man's Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Your third begins, but I cannot ſay that it goes on, with that Ingenuity which the other
did; for I do not underſtand how thoſe Examples cited out of the Old Testament do any way
prove that the way of <hi>Reformation</hi> which I commend hath not been the moſt perfect, or that
any other is lawful, thoſe having been all by the Regal Authority: and becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth's <hi>Reformation</hi> was not perfect, will it prove that of King <hi>Edward</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
to be unperfect? I believe a new Mood and Figure muſt be found out to form a Syllogiſm
whereby to prove that. But however you are miſtaken; for no man who truly underſtands the
<hi>Engliſh Reformation</hi> will derive it from <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for he only gave the occaſion;
it was his Son who began, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that perfected it. Nor did I ever aver that the
beginning of any Humane Action was perfect, no more than you can prove that <hi>God hath ever
given approbation to Multitudes to Reform the Negligence of Princes:</hi> For, you know,
there is much Difference between Permiſſion and Approbation. But all this time I find no
Reaſons (according to your promiſe) for a <hi>Reformation</hi> or change, (I mean ſince Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
time.) As for your <hi>Romanorum Malleus</hi> his ſaying, it is well you come off it with
[<hi>yet this I may ſay;</hi>] for it ſeems to imply, as if you neither ought nor would juſtifie that
<hi>bloudy ungodly ſaying:</hi> and for your comparing our <hi>Reformation</hi> here to the <hi>Laodicean
lukewarmneſs,</hi> proved by <hi>Complaints, Grievings,</hi> &amp;c. all that doth, and but unhandſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>petere Principium;</hi> nor can Generals ſatisfie Me; for you must firſt prove that thoſe
men had reaſon to <hi>complain,</hi> thoſe Churches to be <hi>grieved,</hi> and how we were truly the Cauſers
of this Schiſm and Separation. As for thoſe words which you will not uſe, I will not anſwer.</p>
                     <p>4. Here indeed you truly repeat the firſt of my two main Arguments; but, by your favour,
you take (as I conceive) a wrong way to convince Me: It is I must make good the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
for I believe a Negative cannot be proved. In ſtead of which, if you had made appear
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60710:46"/>
the practice of the <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> you had done much;
for I do aver that this <hi>Government</hi> was never practiſed before <hi>Calvin</hi>'s time: the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of which I leave you to prove; My task being to ſhew the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſion of
Epiſcopacy,</hi> and, as I believe, the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it. For doing whereof I must have ſuch
Books as I ſhall call for; which poſſibly upon peruſal may, one way or other, give Me ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
but I cannot abſolutely promiſe it without the aſſistance of ſome Learned man, whom I
can trust to find out all ſuch Citations as I have uſe of: wherefore blame Me not if time be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily
lost.</p>
                     <p>5. Now for the <hi>fallaciouſneſs</hi> of my <hi>Argument,</hi> (to my knowledge) it was never My
practice, nor do I confeſs to have begun now. For if the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>
and the <hi>univerſal conſent of the Fathers</hi> be not a convincing Argument, when the <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of <hi>Scripture</hi> is doubtful, I know nothing: For if this be not, then of neceſſity the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of private Spirits</hi> must be admitted; the which contradicts St. <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi>
1. 20. is the Mother of all <hi>Sects,</hi> and will (if not prevented) bring theſe Kingdoms into
confuſion. And to ſay that an Argument is ill, becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe it, or that ſuch a
thing is good, becauſe it is the Custom of <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> cannot weigh
with Me, until you prove theſe to be <hi>infallible,</hi> or that to maintain <hi>no Truth.</hi> And how
<hi>Diotrephes</hi> Ambition (who directly oppoſed the Apostle <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John</hi>) can be an Argument against
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> I do not understand.</p>
                     <p>6. When I am made a Judge over the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> then, and not before, will I
cenſure their <hi>Actions;</hi> as you must prove, before I confeſs it, that <hi>Presbyters without a
Biſhop may lawfully ordain other Presbyters.</hi> And as for the Administration of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>
as I think none will ſay that a Woman can lawfully or duely administer it, though when
done it be valid; ſo none ought to do it but a lawful Presbyter, whom you cannot deny but to
be abſolutely neceſſary for the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. You make a learned ſuccinct diſcourſe of <hi>Oaths</hi> in general, and their ſeveral <hi>Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
to which I fully agree; intending in the particular now in question to be guided by your
own Rule, which is [<hi>when any Oath hath a ſpecial reference to the Benefit of thoſe to
whom I make the Promiſe, if we have their deſire or conſent, the Obligation ceaſeth.</hi>]
Now it must be known, <hi>to whom</hi> this Oath hath reference, and to <hi>whoſe benefit.</hi> The
Anſwer is clear, Only to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as by the Record will be plainly made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
And you much mistake in alledging that the two <hi>Houſes of Parliament</hi> (eſpecially as
they are now constituted) can have this <hi>Diſobligatory power;</hi> for (beſides that they are
not named in it) I am confident to make it clearly appear to you, that this Church never did
ſubmit nor was ſubordinate to them, and that it was only the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> who made the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> merely ſerving to help to give the <hi>Civil Sanction.</hi> All this
being proved (of which I make no question) it must neceſſarily follow, that it is only the
<hi>Church of England</hi> (in whoſe favour I took this Oath) that can releaſe Me from it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the <hi>Church of England</hi> (being lawfully aſſembled) ſhall declare that I am free,
then, and not before, I ſhall esteem My ſelf ſo.</p>
                     <p>8. To your last, concerning the <hi>King My Father,</hi> of Happy and Famous Memory both
for his Piety and Learning, I must tell you, that I had the Happineſs to know Him much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than you; wherefore I deſire you not to be too confident in the knowledge of His Opinions:
for I dare ſay, ſhould his Ghost now ſpeak, He would tell you, that a <hi>bloody Reformation
was never lawful, as not warranted by God's Word,</hi> and that <hi>Preces &amp; lachrymae ſunt
Arma Eccleſiae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. To conclude, having replied to all your Paper, I cannot but obſerve to you, that you
have given Me no Anſwer to my laſt <hi>Quaere.</hi> It may be you are (as <hi>Chaucer</hi> ſays) like the
People of <hi>England, What they not like, they never underſtand:</hi> but in earneſt, that
queſtion is ſo pertinent to the Purpoſe in hand, that it will much ſerve for My ſatisfaction,
and beſides, it may be uſeful for other things.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THE ſmaller the encouragements be in relation to the ſucceſs, (which how ſmall
they are Your Majeſty well knows) the more apparent and, I hope, the more
acceptable will my obedience be, in that which in all humility I now go about at Your
Majeſty's command: yet while I conſider that the way of man is not in himſelf, nor
is it in man that walketh to direct his own ſteps; and when I remember how many
ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, have been openly and in ſecret offered up
in Your Majeſty's behalf unto God that heareth prayer, I have no reaſon to deſpair
of a bleſſed ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>1. I have been averſe from a diſputation of Divines, 1. For ſaving of time; which
the preſent exigence and extremity of affairs make more than ordinarily pretious.
While <hi>Archimedes</hi> at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was drawing his figures and circlings in the ſand, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
interrupted his Demonſtration. 2. Becauſe the common reſult of Diſputes of
this kind, anſwerable to the prejudicate opinions of the Parties, is rather Victory than
Verity; while <hi>tanquam tentativi Dialectici,</hi> they ſtudy more to overcome their adverſe
Party, than to be overcome of Truth, although this be the moſt glorious Victory.
3. When I was commanded to come hither, no ſuch thing was propoſed to me nor
expected by me: I never judged ſo meanly of the Cauſe, nor ſo highly of my ſelf, as
to venture it upon ſuch weakneſs. Much more might be ſpoken to this purpoſe, but
I forbear.</p>
                     <p>2. I will not further trouble Your Majeſty with that which is contained in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Section, hoping that Your Majeſty will no more inſiſt upon <hi>Education, Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of time,</hi> &amp;c. which are ſufficient to prevent Admiration, but (which Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
acknowledges) muſt give place to Reaſon, and are no ſure ground of reſolution
of our Faith in any point to be believed: although it be true that the moſt part of
men make theſe and the like to be the ground and rule of their Faith; an Evidence
that their Faith is not a Divine Faith, but an humane Credulity.</p>
                     <p>3. Concerning <hi>Reformation of Religion</hi> in the third Section; I had need have a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to ſo thorny a Theme as your Majeſty hath brought me upon. 1. For the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
power;</hi> it is conceived, when a General Defection, like a Deluge, hath covered
the whole face of the Church, ſo that ſcarcely the tops of the Mountains do appear, a
General Council is neceſſary: but becauſe that can hardly be obtained, ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
(which we ſee was done at the time of the Reformation) are to Reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and that by the Authority of their Prince and Magiſtrates: if the Prince or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate be unwilling, then may the inferior Magiſtrate and the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before rightly informed in the grounds of Religion, lawfully Reform within their
own ſphere; and if the light ſhine upon all, or the major part, they may, after all
other means aſſayed, make a publick Reformation. This before this time I never
wrote or ſpoke; yet the Maintainers of this Doctrine conceive that they are able to
make it good. But, Sir, were I worthy to give advice to Your Majeſty, or to the
Kings and ſupreme Powers on Earth, my humble Opinion would be, that they ſhould
draw the Minds, Tongues and Pens of the Learned, to diſpute about other matter
than the Power or Prerogative of Kings and Princes; and in this kind Your Majeſty
hath ſuffered and loſt more than will eaſily be reſtored to Your ſelf or Your Poſterity
for a long time. It is not denied but the prime Reforming power is in Kings and
Princes; <hi>quibus deficientibus,</hi> it comes to the inferior Magiſtrate; <hi>quibus deficientibus,</hi>
it deſcendeth to the Body of the People; ſuppoſing that there is a neceſſity of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and that by no means it can be obtained of their Superiors. It is true that
ſuch a Reformation is more imperfect in reſpect of the Inſtruments and manner of
Procedure; yet for the moſt part more pure and perfect in relation to the effect and
product. And for this end did I cite the Examples of old of Reformation by Regal
Authority; of which none was perfect, in the ſecond way of perfection, except that
of <hi>Joſiah.</hi> Concerning the ſaying of <hi>Grosthed,</hi> whom the Cardinals at <hi>Rome</hi> confeſt
to be a more Godly man than any of themſelves, it was his Complaint and Prediction
of what was likely to enſue, not his deſire or election, if Reformation could have
been obtained in the ordinary way. I might bring two unpartial Witneſſes, <hi>Juel</hi> and
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> both famous Engliſh Biſhops, to prove that the Tumults and Troubles raiſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60710:47"/>
in <hi>Scotland</hi> at the time of Reformation, were to be imputed to the Papiſts oppoſing
of the Reformation both of Doctrine and Diſcipline as an Heretical Innovation; and
not to be aſcribed to the Nobility or People, who under God were the Inſtruments of
it, intending and ſeeking nothing but the purging out of Errour, and ſetling of the
Truth, 2. Concerning the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I conceive, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was begun or not in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, it was not finiſhed by Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth:</hi>
the Father ſtirred the Humors of the diſeaſed Church; but neither the Son
nor the Daughter (although we have great reaſon to bleſs God for both) did purge
them out perfectly: This Perfection is yet reſerved for Your Majeſty. Where it is
ſaid, <hi>that all this time I bring no Reaſons for a further Change;</hi> the fourth Section of my
laſt Paper hath many hints of <hi>Reaſons against Epiſcopal Government,</hi> with an offer of
more, or clearing of thoſe; which Your Majeſty hath not thought fit to take notice
of. And Learned men have obſerved many Defects in that Reformation; As, That
the Government of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (for about this is the Queſtion now) is not
builded upon the foundation of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles;</hi> which they at leaſt cannot
deny, who profeſs <hi>Church-Government</hi> to be <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>ambulatory;</hi> and ſuch were
the greater part of <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> contenting themſelves with the
<hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>munificence</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> till of late that
ſome few have pleaded it to be <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> That the <hi>Engliſh Reformation</hi> hath not
perfectly purged out the <hi>Roman</hi> Leaven; which is one of the reaſons that have given
ground to the comparing of this Church to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as being neither
hot nor cold, neither <hi>Popiſh</hi> nor <hi>Reformed,</hi> but of a lukewarm temper betwixt the two:
That it hath depraved the Diſcipline of the Church, by conforming of it to the Civil
Policy: That it hath added many Church-Offices, higher and lower, unto thoſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Son of God; which is as unlawful, as to take away Offices warranted by
the Divine Inſtitution: and other the like, which have moved ſome to apply this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Church of <hi>England, Multi ad perfectionem pervenirent, niſi jam ſe perveniſſe
crederent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. In my Anſwer to the firſt of Your Majeſty's many Arguments, I brought a Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
of ſome Reaſons to prove that <hi>a Biſhop and Presbyter are one and the ſame in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
from which by neceſſary Conſequence I did infer the <hi>negative,</hi> Therefore, no
difference in Scripture between a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> the one name ſignifying <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriam
Curiae Pastoralis,</hi> the other <hi>Sapientiae Maturitatem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beda.</hi> And whereas
Your Majeſty averrs, <hi>the Presbyterian Government was never practiſed before</hi> Calvin's
<hi>time;</hi> Your Majeſty knows the common Objection of the <hi>Papists</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformed
Churches,</hi> Where was your Church, your Reformation, your Doctrine, before <hi>Luther</hi>'s
time? One part of the common Anſwer is, <hi>that it was from the beginning, and is to be
found in Scripture.</hi> The ſame I affirm of Presbyterian Government. And for the
proving of this, the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> at <hi>Westminſter</hi> have made manifeſt, <hi>that the
Primitive Christian Church at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was governed by a Presbytery;</hi> while they ſhew,
1. That the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> conſiſted of more Congregations than one, from the
multitude of Believers, from the many Apoſtles and other Preachers in that Church,
and from the diverſity of Languages among the Believers. 2. That all theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
were under one Presbyterial Government, becauſe they were for Government
one Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 22, 26. and becauſe that Church was governed by Elders, <hi>Acts</hi>
11. 30. which were Elders of that Church, and did meet together for acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And the Apoſtles themſelves, in that meeting <hi>Acts</hi> 15. acted not as Apoſtles,
but as Elders, ſtating the Queſtion, debating it in the ordinary way of diſputation;
and having by ſearch of Scripture found the will of God, they conclude, <hi>It ſeemed good
to the Holy Ghost and us:</hi> which, in the judgment of the learned, may be ſpoken by
any Aſſembly upon like evidence of Scripture. The like Presbyterian Government
had place in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Theſſalonica,</hi> &amp;c. in the times of the
Apoſtles; and after them, for many years, when one of the Presbytery was made
<hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes,</hi> even then, <hi>Communi Presbyterorum Conſilio Eccleſiae gubernabantur,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Jerome;</hi> and, <hi>Epiſcopos magis conſuetudine quam Diſpoſitionis Divinae veritate Presbyteris
eſſe majores, &amp; in commune debere Eccleſiam regere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Far be it from me to think ſuch a thought, as that Your Majeſty did intend any
Fallacy in Your other main Argument from Antiquity. As we are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Intentio operantis</hi> and <hi>Conditio operis;</hi> ſo may we in this caſe conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Intentio Argumentantis</hi> and <hi>Conditio Argumenti.</hi> And where Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
argues, That, if Your opinion be not admitted, we will be forced to give place
to the <hi>Interpretation of private ſpirits,</hi> which is contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60710:47"/>
                        <hi>Peter,</hi> and will prove to be of dangerous conſequence; I humbly offer to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Your Majeſty, what ſome of chief note among the <hi>Papists</hi> themſelves have
taught us, That the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits</hi> whence they proceed,
may be called <hi>private</hi> in a threefold ſenſe. 1. <hi>Ratione Perſonae,</hi> if the Interpreter be of
a private condition. 2. <hi>Ratione Modi &amp; Medii,</hi> when Perſons, although not private,
uſe not the publick means which are neceſſary for finding out the Truth, but follow
their own Fancies. 3. <hi>Ratione Finis,</hi> when the Interpretation is not propoſed as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical
to bind others, but is intended only for our own private ſatisfaction. The
firſt is not to be deſpiſed; the ſecond is to be exploded, and is condemned by the
Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> the third ought not to be cenſured: But that Interpretation which is
Authentical, and of ſupreme Authority, which every mans conſcience is bound to
yield unto, is of an higher nature. And although the General Council ſhould reſolve
it, and the Conſent of the Fathers ſhould be had unto it, yet there muſt always be
place left to the judgment of Diſcretion, as <hi>Davenant,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> beſide
divers others, hath learnedly made appear in his Book <hi>De Judice Controverſiarum;</hi>
where alſo the Power of Kings in matter of Religion is ſolidly and unpartially deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Two words only I add. One is, that notwithſtanding all that is pretended
from Antiquity, a Biſhop having ſole power of Ordination and Juriſdiction, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be found in <hi>Prime Antiquity.</hi> The other is, that many of the Fathers did, unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly,
bring forth that <hi>Antichrist</hi> which was conceived in the times of the Apoſtles,
and therefore are incompetent Judges in the Queſtion of <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> And upon the
other part, the Lights of the Chriſtian Church at and ſince the beginning of the
Reformation, have diſcovered many ſecrets concerning the <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
which were not known to former Ages: And divers of the Learned in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church have not feared to pronounce, That whoſoever denies the true and literal ſenſe
of many Texts of Scripture to have been found out in this laſt Age, is unthankful to
God, who hath ſo plentifully poured forth his Spirit upon the Children of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and ungrateful towards thoſe men who with ſo great pains, ſo happy ſucceſs,
and ſo much benefit to God's Church, have travailed therein. This might be inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in many places of Scripture. I wind together <hi>Diotrephes</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
the one as an old example of Church-ambition, which was alſo too palpable in the
Apoſtles themſelves; and the other as a cover of Ambition, afterwards diſcovered:
which two brought forth the great Myſtery of the Papacy at laſt.</p>
                     <p>6. Although Your Majeſty be not made a Judge of the Reformed Churches, yet You
ſo far cenſure them and their actions, as without Biſhops, in Your Judgment, they
cannot have a lawful Miniſtery, nor a due Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Againſt
which dangerous and deſtructive Opinion I did alledge what I ſuppoſed Your Majeſty
would not have denied. 1. That Presbyters without a Biſhop may ordain other
Presbyters. 2. That Baptiſm adminiſtred by ſuch a Presbyter, is another thing than
Baptiſm adminiſtred by a private perſon or by a Midwife. Of the firſt Your Majeſty
calls for proof. I told before, that in Scripture it is manifeſt, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. Neglect
not the Gift that is in thee, which was given thee by the Prophecy, with the laying on of the
hands of the Presbytery,</hi> ſo it is in the Engliſh Tranſlation: And the word <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
To often as it is uſed in the New Teſtament, always ſignifies the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and not the
<hi>Office.</hi> And although the Offices of <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were diſtinct; yet doth not
the <hi>Presbyter</hi> derive his power of Order from the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> The Evangeliſts were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the Apoſtles; yet had they their power not from the Apoſtles, but from Chriſt.
The ſame I affirm of the Seventy Diſciples, who had their power immediately from
Chriſt, no leſs than the Apoſtles had theirs. It may upon better reaſon be averred
that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> have their power from the Pope, than that <hi>Presbyters</hi> have their power
from the <hi>Prelats.</hi> It is true, <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid facit, exceptâ ordinatione, Epiſcopus,
quod non facit Presbyter?</hi> But in the ſame place he proves from Sccipture, that <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are one and the ſame; and therefore when he appropriates Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Biſhop, he ſpeaketh of the degenerated cuſtom of his time. Secondly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> a private perſon may perform the external Action and Rites both of
it and of the Euchariſt; yet is neither of the two a Sacrament, or hath any efficacy,
unleſs it be done by him that is lawfully called thereunto, or by a perſon made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and cloathed with Authority by Ordination. This Errour in the matter of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
is begot by another Errour, of the Abſolute Neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. To that which hath been ſaid concerning Your Majeſties <hi>Oath,</hi> I ſhall add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
not being willing to enter upon the Queſtion of the ſubordination of the Church
to the Civil Power, whether the King or Parliament, or both, and to either of them
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60710:48"/>
in their own place. Such an Headſhip as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have claimed, and ſuch
a Supremacy as the Two Houſes of Parliament crave, with the Appeals from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Eccleſiaſtical Judicature to them as ſet over the Church in the ſame line of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
I do utterly diſclaim upon ſuch Reaſons as give my ſelf ſatisfaction; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
no man ſhall be more willing to ſubmit to Civil powers, each one in their own
place, and more unwilling to make any trouble, than my ſelf. Only concerning the
application of the Generals of an Oath to the particular caſe now in hand; under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
I conceive not how the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, or ought to be, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intended in Your Oath. For although they were eſteemed to be the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Church; yet even that is for the benefit of the Church Collective, <hi>Salus Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
being <hi>Suprema lex,</hi> and to be principally intended. Your Majeſty knows it was ſo
in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the like alteration was made. And if nothing of
this kind can be done without the conſent of the Clergy, what Reformation can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf? It is not to be expected that the Pope or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
will conſent to their own ruine.</p>
                     <p>8. I will not preſume upon any ſecret knowledge of the Opinions held by the King
Your Majeſty's Father of famous Memory, they being much better known to Your
Majeſty: I did only produce what was profeſt by Him before the world. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Prayers and Tears be the Arms of the Church;</hi> yet it is neither acceptable to God,
nor conducible for Kings and Princes, to <hi>force the Church to put on theſe Arms.</hi> Nor
could I ever hear a reaſon, why a neceſſary Defenſive War againſt unjuſt Violence is
unlawful, although it be joyned with Offence and Invaſion which is intended for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but ſo that Arms are laid down when the Offenſive War ceaſeth: by which it
doth appear, that the War on the other ſide was, in the nature thereof, Defenſive.</p>
                     <p>9. Concerning the forcing of Conſcience, which I pretermitted in my other Paper,
I am forced now, but without forcing of my conſcience, to ſpeak of it. Our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may be ſaid to be forced either by our ſelves, or by others. By our ſelves, 1. When
we ſtop the ear of our Conſcience, and will not hearken, or give place to informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
reſolving obſtinately, <hi>Ne ſi perſuaſeris, perſuadebis;</hi> which is no leſs than a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Ghoſt, and the hardning of our hearts. 2. Or when we ſtop the
mouth and ſuppreſs the clamours of our Conſcience; reſolving rather to ſuffer the
worm to gnaw, and the fire to burn inwardly, than to make profeſſion of that we are
convinced to be Truth. 3. Or when we ſear our Conſcience as with an hot Iron,
that it becometh ſenſleſs, which is the puniſhment of the former: unto which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the truly tender Conſcience, ſuch as <hi>Joſiah</hi> had, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 19. Again, our
Conſcience is ſaid to be forced by others, 1. when they obtrude upon us what is in it
ſelf evil and unlawful; which if we admit againſt our own Conſcience, we ſin two
ways: one is, <hi>by doing that which is in it ſelf evil and unlawful;</hi> the other is, <hi>by doing it
againſt a dictate of Conſcience,</hi> which is a contempt of God, whoſe Vicegerent it is.
2. Or when others urge us to do that which is in it ſelf good, or may lawfully be
done, but through error of Conſcience we judge it to be evil and unlawful: in this
caſe, if we do not that which is preſt upon us, we ſin, becauſe the thing is good and
lawful; and if we do it, we ſin, becauſe we do againſt our Conſcience, which in this
caſe bindeth, but obligeth not. And yet there is a way to eſcape out of this laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
it being repugnant to the equity of the will of God to lay a neceſſity of ſinning
upon any man: The only way is, <hi>to lay aſide ſuch a Conſcience,</hi> it being a part of the
Old man, which we are commanded to <hi>put off;</hi> otherwiſe, we being ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and yet cleaving to our old Error, we rather do violence to our Conſcience
our ſelves, than ſuffer violence from others. The application, for Anſwering the
<hi>Quaere,</hi> I leave to Your Majeſty.</p>

                     <opener>For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Alexander Henderſon:
In Reply to his ſecond Paper. <date>June 22. 1646.</date>
                     </opener>
                     <p>1. IT were arrogance, beſides loſs of time, in Me to vie <hi>Preambles</hi> with you; for it is <hi>Truth</hi>
I ſeek, and neither <hi>Praiſe</hi> nor <hi>Victory:</hi> wherefore I ſhall only inſist upon thoſe things
which are merely neceſſary to my own ſatisfaction; in order to which I deſired the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of
ſome <hi>Divines;</hi> whereupon I will inſist no further, ſave only to wiſh that you may not (as I
have known many men do) <hi>loſe</hi> time by being miſtaken in the way to <hi>ſave</hi> it, wherein I have
only ſought to diſburthen My ſelf, but to lay no blame upon you, and ſo I leave it.</p>
                     <p>2. Nor will I ſay more of the ſecond than this, that I am glad you have ſo well approved
of what I have ſaid concerning my <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but then remember, that <hi>another
Man's will</hi> is at leaſt as weak a ground to build My Faith upon as my former <hi>Education.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. In this there are two points; firſt, concerning the <hi>Reforming power,</hi> then anent the
<hi>Engliſh Reformation.</hi> For the firſt, I confeſs you now ſpeak clearly, which before you did
but darkly mention, wherein I ſhall mainly differ with you, until you ſhall ſhew Me better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Yet thus far I will go along with you, that when a <hi>General Council</hi> cannot be had, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> may <hi>Reform</hi> themſelves, (which is learnedly and fully proved by the late
<hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his diſputation againſt <hi>Fiſher:</hi>) but that the <hi>inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
or <hi>People</hi> (take it which way you will) have this <hi>power,</hi> I utterly deny; for which,
by your favour, you have yet made no ſufficient proof to my judgment. Indeed, if you could
have brought, or can bring authority of Scripture for this Opinion, I would, and will yet, with
all reverence ſubmit: but as for your <hi>Examples out of the Old Teſtament,</hi> in My mind they
rather make for than againſt Me, all thoſe <hi>Reformations</hi> being made by <hi>Kings:</hi> and it is a
good <hi>probable</hi> (though I will not ſay <hi>convincing) Argument,</hi> that if God would have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of a <hi>Popular reforming way,</hi> there were <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſufficiently negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and ill to have made ſuch examples by; but on the contrary, the 16. Chap. of <hi>Numbers</hi>
ſhews clearly how God <hi>diſapproves</hi> of ſuch courſes. But I forget this Aſſertion is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by you; yet I may put you in the way: wherefore let Me tell you that this <hi>pretended
power</hi> in the <hi>People</hi> muſt (as all others) either be directly or elſe declaratorily by approbation
given by God; which how ſoon you can do, I ſubmit; otherwiſe you prove nothing. For the
citing of private mens Opinions (more than as they concur with the <hi>general conſent of the
Church</hi> in their time) weighs little with Me, it being too well known, that <hi>Rebels never
wanted Writers to maintain their unjuſt actions:</hi> and though I much reverence Biſhop
<hi>Juel</hi>'s memory, I never thought him <hi>infallible.</hi> For <hi>Bilſon,</hi> I remember well what opinion the
<hi>King</hi> my <hi>Father</hi> had of him for thoſe Opinions, and how He ſhewed him ſome favour in hope
of his <hi>recantation,</hi> (as His good nature made Him do many things of that kind;) but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did or not, I cannot ſay. To conclude this point, untill you ſhall prove this <hi>poſition</hi>
by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> (as I will <hi>Regal Authority</hi>) I ſhall think all <hi>popular Reformation</hi>
little better than <hi>Rebellion;</hi> for I hold that <hi>no Authority is lawful but that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly given, or,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>approved by god.</hi> Secondly, Concerning the <hi>Engliſh
Reformation,</hi> the firſt reaſon you bring why Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not finiſh it is, <hi>becauſe ſhe
took not away Epiſcopacy,</hi> the <hi>hints of reaſon againſt which government</hi> you ſay <hi>I take
no notice of:</hi> now I thought it was ſufficient notice, yea and anſwer too, when I told you, <hi>a
Negative</hi> (as I conceived) <hi>could not be proved,</hi> and that it was for Me to prove the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative;</hi>
which I ſhall either do, or yield the Argument, as ſoon as I ſhall be aſſiſted with
<hi>Books,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Men</hi> of My Opinion, who like you, have a Library in their brain. And ſo I
muſt leave this particular, until I be furniſhed with <hi>means</hi> to put it to an <hi>iſſue;</hi> which had
been ſooner done, if I could have had my will. Indeed your ſecond well proved is moſt ſufficient,
which is, That <hi>the Engliſh Church Government is not builded upon the foundation of
Chriſt and the Apoſtles:</hi> but I conceive your probation of this doubly defective. For first,
albeit our <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould have <hi>profeſſed Church-Government</hi> to be <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ambulatory,</hi> I conceive it not ſufficient to prove your Aſſertion: and ſecondly, I am
confident you cannot prove that moſt of them maintained this <hi>walking</hi> poſition, (for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
muſt not conclude the general) for which you muſt find much better Arguments than
their being content with the <hi>Conſtitution of the Church,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Princes,</hi> or you will fall extremely ſhort. As for the <hi>retaining</hi> of the <hi>Roman
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>en,</hi> you muſt prove it as well as ſay it, elſe you ſay little. But that the conforming of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60710:49"/>
                        <hi>Church Diſcipline</hi> to the <hi>Civil Policy</hi> ſhould be a depraving of it, I abſolutely deny; for I
aver, that without it the Church can neither flouriſh nor be happy. And for your laſt inſtance,
you ſhall do well to ſhew the prohibition of our Saviour againſt addition of more Officers in the
Church than he named: and yet in one ſenſe I do not conceive that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
hath added any; for an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> is only a distinction for <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> not
a <hi>new Officer,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; and of this kind I believe there are divers now in <hi>Scotland</hi>
which you will not condemn, as the <hi>Moderators of Aſſemblies,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>4. Where you find a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in Scripture to be one and the ſame (which I
deny to be alwaies ſo) it is in the <hi>Apoſtles time;</hi> now I think to prove the Order of <hi>Biſhops</hi>
ſucceeded that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that the name was chiefly altered in reverence to thoſe
who were immediately choſen by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (albeit in their time they cauſed divers to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others) ſo that I believe this Argument makes little for you. As for
your proof of the antiquity of <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> it is well that the <hi>Aſſembly of
Divines at Weſtminſter</hi> can do more than <hi>Euſebius</hi> could, and I ſhall believe when I ſee it:
for your former Paper affirms, that thoſe times were very dark for matter of fact, and will be
ſo still for Me if there be no clearer Arguments to prove it than thoſe you mention: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there were <hi>divers Congregations in Jeruſalem;</hi> Ergo, what? are there not <hi>divers
Pariſhes in one Dioceſs?</hi> (your two first I anſwer but as one Argument) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Apoſtles met with thoſe of the inferiour Orders for Acts of Government;</hi>
what then? even ſo in theſe times do the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> and many times thoſe of the
<hi>inferiour Clergy</hi> aſſist the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But I hope you will not pretend to ſay, that there was
an equality between the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which not being, doth (in My judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
quite invalidate theſe Arguments. And if you can ſay no more for the Churches of
<hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Theſſalonica,</hi> &amp;c. than you have for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it will gain no ground
on Me. As for Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> it is well known that he was no great Friend to Biſhops, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none himſelf; yet take him altogether, and you will find that he makes a clear distinction
between a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as your ſelf confeſſes: but the truth is, he was angry with
thoſe who maintained <hi>Deacons</hi> to be equal to <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. I am well ſatisfied with the explanation of your meaning concerning the word <hi>Fallacy,</hi>
though I think to have had reaſon for ſaying what I did: but by your favour, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that you have anſwered the ſtrength of my Argument; for when you and I differ upon
the <hi>interpretation of Scripture,</hi> and I appeal to the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and
<hi>the univerſal conſent of the Fathers,</hi> to be Judge between us, Methinks you ſhould either
find a fitter, or ſubmit to what I offer; neither of which (to My underſtanding) you have yet
done; nor have you ſhewn how, waving thoſe Judges I appeal unto, the miſchief of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
by <hi>private Spirits</hi> can be prevented. Indeed, if I cannot prove by <hi>Antiquity</hi> that
<hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> belong to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> (thereby clearly diſtinguiſhing them from
other <hi>Presbyters</hi>) I ſhall then begin to miſdoubt many of my former Foundations; (as for
Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> he is none of thoſe to whom I have appealed, or will ſubmit unto.) But for
the exception you take to <hi>Fathers,</hi> I take it to be <hi>a begging of the Queſtion;</hi> as likewiſe
thoſe great diſcoveries of ſecrets, not known to former Ages, I ſhall call <hi>new-invented fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
until particularly you ſhall prove the contrary: and for your <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, it is no
great wonder for them to ſeek ſhifts whereby to maintain <hi>Novelties</hi> as well as the <hi>Puritans.</hi>
As for <hi>Church-ambition,</hi> it doth not at all terminate in ſeeking to be <hi>Pope;</hi> for I take it
to be no point of humility to indeavour to be <hi>independent of Kings,</hi> it being poſſible that
<hi>Papacy</hi> in a <hi>multitude</hi> may be as dangerous as in <hi>one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. As I am no <hi>Judge</hi> over the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> ſo neither do I cenſure them; for
many things may be avowable upon <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which otherwayes <hi>are unlawful:</hi> but know once
for all, that I eſteem nothing the better becauſe it is done by ſuch a <hi>particular Church</hi> (though
it were by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which I avow moſt to reverence;) but I esteem that
<hi>Church</hi> moſt which comes neareſt to the <hi>purity of the Primitive Doctrine and Diſcipline,</hi>
as I believe this doth. Now concerning <hi>Ordination,</hi> I bad you prove that <hi>Presbyters</hi> without
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> might lawfully <hi>ordain;</hi> which yet I conceive you have not done: for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.
it is evident that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Timothie</hi>'s <hi>ordination;</hi> and albeit that all the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
had their power immediately from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet it is as evident that our <hi>Saviour</hi> made a clear
diſtinction between the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> which is ſet down by
three of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whereof Saint <hi>Mark</hi> calls it an <hi>Ordination, Mark</hi> 3. 15. and
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>And of them he choſe Twelve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 13. only Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>
doth but barely enumerate them by their name of diſtinction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. I ſuppoſe out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
himſelf being one, and the other two being none, are more particular. For <hi>the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of Baptiſm,</hi> giving, but not granting, what you ſay, it makes more for Me than
you: but I will not engage upon new Queſtions not neceſſary for My purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:60710:49"/>
7. For my <hi>Oath,</hi> you do well not to enter upon thoſe Queſtions you mention; and you had
done as well to have omitted your inſtance; but out of diſcretion, I deſire you to collect your
Anſwer out of the laſt Section; and for your Argument, though the intention of my Oath be
for the good of the <hi>Church collective,</hi> therefore can I be diſpenſed withal by others than the
<hi>repreſentative Body?</hi> certainly no more than the People can diſpenſe with Me for any
<hi>Oaths</hi> I took in their favours, without the two Houſes of Parliament. As for future Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
I will only tell you, that <hi>incommodum non ſolvit Argumentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. For the <hi>King</hi> my <hi>Father</hi>'s opinion, if it were not to ſpend time (as I believe) needleſly,
I could prove by living and written teſtimonies all and more than I have ſaid of Him,
for His perſwaſion in theſe points which I now maintain: and for your <hi>defenſive War,</hi>
as I do acknowledge it a great ſin for any King to <hi>oppreſs the Church,</hi> ſo I hold it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unlawful for <hi>Subjects</hi> (upon any pretence whatſoever) to make War (though <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive</hi>)
againſt their <hi>lawful Sovereign;</hi> against which no leſs proofs will make Me
yield but God's Word: and let Me tell you, that upon ſuch points as theſe, <hi>inſtances</hi> as well
as <hi>compariſons</hi> are <hi>odious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Laſtly, You miſtake the <hi>Quaere</hi> in My firſt Paper to which this pretends to anſwer;
for my Queſtion was not concerning <hi>force of Arguments</hi> (for I never doubted the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it) but <hi>force <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>f Arms,</hi> to which, I conceive, it ſays little or nothing, (unleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
My example) you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

of the queſtion,</hi> after a fine diſcourſe of the ſeveral ways of <hi>perſwading</hi> rather than <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
of Conſcience. I cloſe up this Paper, deſiring you to take notice, that there is none of
theſe Sections but I could have inlarged to many more lines, ſome to whole pages; yet I choſe
to be thus brief, knowing you will underſtand more by a word than others by a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
trusting likewiſe to your ingenuity, that <hi>Reaſon epitomized</hi> will weigh as much
with you as if it were at large.</p>

                     <opener>For His MAJESTY:
Concerning the Authority of the Fathers, and Practice of the Church.
<date>July 2. 1646.</date>
                     </opener>
                     <p>HAving in my former Papers preſſed the ſteps of Your Majeſty's Propoſitions,
and finding by Your Majeſty's laſt Paper, Controverſies to be multiplied, (I
believe) beyond Your Majeſty's intentions in the beginning; as concerning The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Power,</hi> The <hi>Reformation of the Church of</hi> England, The <hi>difference betwixt a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
and a Presbyter,</hi> The <hi>warrants of Presbyterian Government,</hi> The <hi>Authority of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
Scripture,</hi> The <hi>taking and keeping of Publick Oaths,</hi> The <hi>forcing of Conſcience,</hi> and
many other inferiour and ſubordinate Queſtions, which are Branches of thoſe main
Controverſies; all which in a ſatisfactory manner to determine in few words I leave
to more preſuming Spirits, who either ſee no knots of Difficulties, or can find a way
rather to cut them aſunder than to unlooſe them: yet will I not uſe any Tergiverſation,
nor do I decline to offer my humble Opinion with the Reaſons thereof, in their own
time, concerning each of them: which in obedience to Your Majeſty's Command I
have begun to do already. Only, Sir, by Your Majeſty's favourable permiſſion, for
the greater expedition, and that the preſent velitations may be brought to ſome Iſſue,
I am bold to intreat that the Method may be a little altered, and I may have leave
now to begin at a Principle, and that which ſhould have been <hi>inter Praecognita,</hi> I mean,
the Rule by which we are to proceed, and to determine the preſent Controverſy of
<hi>Church-Policy;</hi> without which we will be led into a labyrinth, and want a thred to
wind us out again. In Your Majeſty's Firſt Paper, the <hi>univerſal Cuſtom of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church</hi> is conceived to be the Rule; in the Second Paper, Section 5. the <hi>Practice
of the Primitive Church, and the univerſal Conſent of the Fathers</hi> is made a convincing
Argument, when the <hi>Interpretation of Scripture</hi> is doubtful; in your Third Paper, Sect.
5. <hi>the Practice of the Primitive Church and the univerſal Conſent of Fathers</hi> is made Judge:
And I know that nothing is more ordinary in this Queſtion than to alledge <hi>Antiquity,
perpetual Succeſſion, univerſal Conſent of the Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>univerſal Practice</hi> of the
<hi>Primitive Church,</hi> according to the Rule of <hi>Auguſtine, Quod univerſa tenet Eccleſia, nec
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60710:50"/>
à Concilio inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non niſi authoritate Apoſtolica traditum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſimè
creditur.</hi> There is in this Argument at the firſt view ſo much appearance of
Reaſon, that it may much work upon a modeſt mind; yet being well examined, and
rightly weighed, it will be found to be of no great weight: for beſide that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
will never be made good in the behalf of a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop</hi> having ſole power
of Ordination and Juriſdiction, there being a multitude of Fathers who maintain that
<hi>Biſhop and Presbyter are of one and the ſame Order;</hi> I ſhall humbly offer ſome few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
about the Major, becauſe it hath been an Inlet to many dangerous Errours,
and hath proved a mighty hinderance and obſtruction to Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>1. I deſire it may be conſidered, that whiles ſome make two Rules for defining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
the <hi>Word</hi> of God and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> (which they will have to be received with
equal veneration) or, as the Papiſts call them, <hi>Canonical Authority,</hi> and <hi>Catholical
Tradition;</hi> and others make <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the only <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity</hi> the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Interpreter;</hi> the latter of the two ſeems to me to be the greater Errour: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the firſt ſetteth up a <hi>parallel</hi> in the ſame degree with Scripture; but this would
create a <hi>Superiour,</hi> in a higher degree above Scripture. For the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the
Fathers ſhall be the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and accounted the very Cauſe and Reaſon for which we
conceive and believe ſuch a place of Scripture to have ſuch a ſenſe: and thus men
ſhall have <hi>dominion over our Faith,</hi> againſt 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. Our <hi>faith ſhall ſtand in the
wiſdom of man,</hi> and not <hi>in the power of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 5. and <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhall be of
<hi>private interpretation; For the Prophecy came not of old by the will of man,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 20,
22. <hi>Niſi homini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit; Homo jam Deo propitius eſse debebit,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That Scripture cannot be Authentically interpreted but by Scripture, is manifeſt
from Scripture. The Levites gave the ſenſe of the Law by no other means but by
Scripture it ſelf. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. Our Saviour, for example to us, gave the true ſenſe of
Scripture againſt the depravations of Satan, by comparing Scripture with Scripture,
and not by alledging any Teſtimonies out of the Rabbins, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
in their Epiſtles, uſed no other help but the diligent comparing of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
writings: like as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> will have us to compare the clearer light of
the Apoſtles with the more obſcure light of the Prophets, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. And when
we betake our ſelves to the Fathers, we have need to take heed that, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
we accuſe not the Scriptures of Obſcurity or Imperfection.</p>
                     <p>3. The Fathers themſelves (as they are cited by Proteſtant Writers) hold this
Concluſion, That Scripture is not to be interpreted but by Scripture it ſelf. To
this purpoſe amongſt many other Teſtimonies, they bring the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian,
Surge, Veritas, ipſa Scripturas tuas interpretare, quam Conſuetudo non novit; nam ſi noſſet,
non eſſet:</hi> if it knew Scripture it would be aſhamed of it ſelf, and ceaſe to be any
more.</p>
                     <p>4. That ſome Errours have been received and continued for a long time in the
Church. The Errour of <hi>Free-will,</hi> beginning at <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> continued till the
time of <hi>Reformation,</hi> although it was rejected by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as the <hi>Divine Right of
Epiſcopacy</hi> was oppoſed by others. The Errour about the Viſion of God, That <hi>the
Souls of the Saints departed ſee not the face of God till the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi>
was held by univerſal Conſent. The ſame may be ſaid of the Errour of the <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
and, which more nearly toucheth upon the preſent Queſtion, the Ancients er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
groſly about the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> which did begin to work in
the days of the Apoſtles. Many other Inſtances might be brought to prove ſuch
<hi>univerſal practice of the Church,</hi> as was not warranted by the Apoſtles; as in the
Rites of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the forming up and drawing together of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of that <hi>Creed</hi> that is called <hi>Symbolum Apoſtolicum,</hi> the obſervation of many <hi>Feasts</hi>
and <hi>Faſts</hi> both Anniverſary and weekly.</p>
                     <p>5. That it is not a matter ſo incredible or impoſſible as ſome would have it appear
to be, for the Primitive Church to have made a ſudden defection from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
purity. The people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the ſhort time of <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence on the mount,
turned aſide quickly, and fell into horrible Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. Soon after the death
of <hi>Joſuah,</hi> and the Elders that had ſeen the great works which the Lord had done for
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> there aroſe another Generation after them, which did evil in the ſight of the
Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. Soon after the building of the Temple, and ſetling of Religion by
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the worſhip of God was defiled with Idolatry: when <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
had eſtabliſhed the Kingdom, he forſook the Law of the Lord, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60710:50"/>
him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 1. And the Apoſtle ſays to the Galatians, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that
you are ſo ſoon removed unto another Goſpel.</hi> Why then ſhall we think it ſtrange, that
in the matter of Diſcipline there ſhould be a ſudden defection, eſpecially it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in the time of the Apoſtles? I know it is a common Opinion, but I believe there
be no ſtrong reaſons for it, that the Church which was neareſt the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
was the moſt pure and perfect Church.</p>
                     <p>6. That it is impoſſible to come to the knowledge of the univerſal Conſent and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Primitive Church: for many of the Fathers wrote nothing at all, many
of their writings are periſhed, (it may be that both of theſe have diſſented from the
reſt) many of the Writings which we have under their names are ſuppoſititious and
counterfeit, eſpecially about Epiſcopacy, which was the foundation of Papal Primacy.
The Rule of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> afore-mentioned doth too much favour Traditions, and is not
to be admitted without cautions and exceptions.</p>
                     <p>Many the like Conſiderations may be added; but theſe may be ſufficient to prove,
that the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers and the univerſal Practice of the Primitive
Church is no ſure ground of Authentical interpretation of Scripture. I remember of
a grave Divine in <hi>Scotland,</hi> much honoured by K. <hi>James</hi> of Happy memory, who did
often profeſs that he did learn more of one Page of <hi>John Calvin</hi> than of a whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Nor can there be any good reaſon, (many there be againſt it) why
the Ancients ſhould be ſo far preferred to the Modern Doctors of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and the one in a manner Deified, and the other vilified. It is but a poor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that ſome give, <hi>Fama miratrix ſenioris aevi,</hi> and is abundantly anſwered by the
Apologiſt for Divine Providence. If Your Majeſty be ſtill unſatisfied concerning the
Rule, I know not to what purpoſe I ſhould proceed, or trouble Your Majeſty any more.</p>

                     <p>I Shall very willingly follow the <hi>method</hi> you have begun in your third Paper; but I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that my last Paper multiplies more Controverſies than my first gave occaſion for; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſo far from augmenting the Heads of our Diſputation, that I have omitted the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
many things in both your Papers, expreſly to avoid raiſing of new and needleſs <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
deſiring to have only ſo many debated as are ſimply neceſſary to ſhew, whether or not <hi>I may
with a ſafe conſcience give way to the alteration of Church-Government in</hi> England.
And indeed I like very well, to begin with the <hi>ſetling of the Rule,</hi> by which we are to proceed,
and determine the preſent <hi>Controverſie:</hi> to which purpoſe (as I conceive) My third Paper
ſhews you an excellent way; for there I offer you a <hi>Judge</hi> between us, or deſire you to <hi>find out a
better,</hi> which, to My judgment, you have not yet done, (though you have ſought to invalidate
Mine:) for, if you underſtand to have offered the <hi>Scripture,</hi> though no man ſhall pay more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
nor ſubmit more humbly to it, than My ſelf; yet we must find ſome Rule to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us, when you and I differ upon the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the ſelf-ſame Text, or it can never
determine our Queſtions. As for example, I ſay you miſapply that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14. to <hi>Me</hi> (let
others anſwer for themſelves) for I know not how I make <hi>other men to have dominion over
My Faith,</hi> when I make them only <hi>ſerve</hi> to <hi>approve my Reaſon.</hi> Nor do I conceive how
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. can be applied to this purpoſe: for there Saint <hi>Paul</hi> only ſhews the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Eloquence,</hi> making no mention of any kind of <hi>interpretation</hi>
throughout the whole Chapter, as indeed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> does, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. which I conceive makes
for <hi>Me:</hi> for, ſince that no <hi>Prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation,</hi> First,
I infer, that <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be <hi>interpreted,</hi> for elſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would have omitted the
word <hi>Private;</hi> Secondly, that at least the conſent of many learned Divines is neceſſary, and
ſo, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> that of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> ought to be an <hi>authentick Judge,</hi> when men
differ. And is it a good Argument, becauſe (<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10.) Scripture is best interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it ſelf, therefore that all other interpretations are unlawful? certainful you cannot think
it. Thus having ſhewed you that we differ about the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Scripture, and are like
to do ſo; certainly there ought to be for this, as well as other things, a <hi>Rule</hi> or a <hi>Judge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, to determine our differences, or, at least, to make our Probations and Arguments
<hi>Relevant:</hi> therefore evading for this time to Anſwer your <hi>Six Conſiderations</hi> (not, I aſſure
you, for the difficulty of them, but the ſtarting of new Questions) I deſire you only to ſhew Me
a better than what I have offered unto you.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>UNtil you ſhall find out a <hi>fitter way</hi> to decide our <hi>Difference</hi> in Opinion concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Scripture,</hi> than the <hi>Conſent of the Fathers and the Univerſal
Practice of the Primitive Church,</hi> I cannot but paſs my Judgment anent thoſe Six <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi>
which you offered to invalidate thoſe Authorities that I ſo much reverence.</p>
                     <p>1. In the first you mention <hi>two Rules for defining of Controverſies,</hi> and ſeek a most
odd way to confute them, as I think; for you alledge, that <hi>there is more attributed to them</hi>
than I believe you can prove by the Conſent of most learned Men (there being no queſtion,
but there are always ſome flattering fools that can commend nothing but with hyperbolick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions)
and you know that <hi>ſuppoſito quolibet, ſequitur quidlibet:</hi> beſides, do you think,
that albeit ſome ignorant Fellows ſhould attribute more power to <hi>Presbyters</hi> than is really due
unto them, that thereby their Juſt reverence and Authority is diminiſhed? So I ſee no reaſon
why I may not ſafely maintain that the <hi>Interpretation of Fathers</hi> is a most excellent <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
to My Opinion, though others ſhould attribute the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of their Faith
unto it.</p>
                     <p>2. As there is no queſtion but that <hi>Scripture</hi> is far the <hi>beſt Interpreter</hi> of it ſelf, ſo I
ſee nothing in this, negatively proved, to exclude any other, notwithſtanding your poſitive
affirmation.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor in the next; for I hope you will not be the first to condemn your ſelf, Me, and
innumerable others, who yet unblameably have not tied themſelves to this Rule.</p>
                     <p>4. If this you only intend to prove, that <hi>Errours</hi> were always <hi>breeding in the Church,</hi>
I ſhall not deny it; yet that makes little (as I conceive) to your purpoſe. But if your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be, to accuſe the <hi>Univerſal practice of the Church</hi> with <hi>Errour,</hi> I must ſay, it is a
very bold undertaking, and (if you cannot juſtifie your ſelf by clear places in Scripture) much
to be blamed: wherein you must not alledge that to be univerſally received which was not; as
I dare ſay that the <hi>Controverſie about Free-will</hi> was never yet decided by <hi>Oecumenical</hi> or
<hi>General Council:</hi> nor muſt you preſume to call that an <hi>Errour,</hi> which really the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> maintained (as in <hi>Rites of Baptiſm, Forms of Prayer, Obſervation of Feaſts,
Faſts,</hi> &amp;c.) except you can prove it ſo by the Word of God; and it is not enough to ſay that
ſuch a thing was not warranted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but you muſt prove by their <hi>Doctrine</hi> that
ſuch a thing was <hi>unlawful,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Practice of the Church</hi> is warrant enough for Me to
follow and obey that Cuſtom, whatſoever it be, and think it good; and I ſhall believe that the

                     <p>WE have with unſpeakable grief of heart long beheld the diſtractions of this our
Kingdom; Our very Soul is full of anguiſh until We may find ſome remedy to
prevent the Miſeries which are ready to overwhelm this whole Nation by a Civil
War: and tho' all Our endeavours tending to the compoſing of thoſe unhappy Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Us and Our two Houſes of Parliament, which happily may be prevented by
ſome other way of Treaty, wherein the matters in difference may be more clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

ſome fit perſons may be by you enabled to treat with the like Number to be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed

that happy concluſion which all good men deſire, <hi>The peace of the Kingdom:</hi> wherein
as We promiſe in the word of a King all ſafety and encouragement to ſuch as ſhall be

wholly leave to you, preſuming on the like care of the ſafety of thoſe We ſhall imploy,

if you ſhall name another place; ſo We aſſure you and all Our good Subjects, that (to
the beſt of Our Underſtanding) nothing ſhall be therein wanting on Our part which
may advance the true Proteſtant Religion, oppoſe Popery and Superſtition, ſecure the
Law of the land (upon which is built as well Our juſt Prerogative as the Propriety
and Liberty of the Subject) confirm all juſt Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and
render Us and Our People truly happy by a good underſtanding betwixt Us and Our
two Houſes of Parliament. Bring with you as firm reſolutions to do your Duty, and
let all Our People joyn with Us in Our Prayers to Almighty God for his bleſſing upon
this Work.</p>
                     <p>If this Propoſition ſhall be rejected by you, We have done Our duty ſo amply, that
God will abſolve Us from the guilt of any of that Blood which muſt be ſpilt. And
what opinion ſoever other men may have of Our Power, We aſſure you nothing but
Our Chriſtian and pious care to prevent the effuſion of Blood hath begot this motion;
Our proviſion of Men, Arms and Money being ſuch as may ſecure Us from further
Violence, till it pleaſe God to open the Eyes of Our People.</p>

of the Rights of His Majeſty, both Houſes, and His good Subjects;</p>
                     <p>1. As ſoon as His Majeſty is ſatisfied in His firſt Propoſition concerning His own
Revenue, Magazines, Ships and Forts, in which He deſires nothing but that the
Juſt, Known, Legal Rights of His Majeſty (devolved to him from His Progenitors)
and of the Perſons truſted by Him, which have been violently taken from both, be

Writs new Elections have been made:</p>
                     <p>3. As ſoon as His Majeſty and both Houſes may be ſecured from ſuch tumultuous
Aſſemblies, as to the great breach of the Priviledges and the high diſhonour of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have formerly aſſembled about both Houſes, and awed the Members of the ſame,

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60710:56"/>
the Parliament to ſome other place, at the leaſt twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi>
the choice of which His Majeſty leaves to both Houſes:</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will moſt cheerfully and readily conſent that both Armies be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
disbanded, and give a preſent meeting to both His Houſes of Parliament at the
time and place at and to which the Parliament ſhall be agreed to be adjourned.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being moſt confident that the Law will then recover the due credit and
eſtimation, and that upon a free debate in a full and peaceable Convention of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch proviſions will be made againſt ſeditious Preaching and Printing againſt
His Majeſty and the eſtabliſhed Laws, which hath been one of the chief cauſes of the
preſent Diſtractions, and ſuch care will be taken concerning the legal and known Rights
of His Majeſty, and the Property and Liberty of His Subjects, that whatſoever hath been
publiſhed or done in or by colour of any illegal Declaration, Ordinance or Order of one
or both Houſes, or any Committee of either of them, and particularly the power to
raiſe Arms without His Majeſty's conſent, will be in ſuch a manner recalled, diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and provided againſt, that no ſeed will remain for the like to ſpring out of for
the future, to diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom, and to endanger the very Being
of it.</p>
                     <p>And in ſuch a Convention His Majeſty is reſolved, by His readineſs to conſent to
whatſoever ſhall be propoſed to Him by Bill for the real good of His Subjects, and
particularly for the better diſcovery and ſpeedier conviction of Recuſants, for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of the Children of Papiſts by Proteſtants, in the Proteſtant Religion, for
the prevention of the practices of Papiſts againſt the State, and the due execution of
the Laws, and true levying of the penalties againſt them; to make known to all the
world how cauſeleſs thoſe Fears and Jealouſies have been which have been raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Him, and by that ſo diſtracted this miſerable Kingdom. And if this offer of
His Majeſty be not conſented to, (in which He asks nothing for which there is not
apparent Juſtice on His ſide, and in which He defers many things highly concerning
both Himſelf and People, till a full and peaceable Convention of Parliament, which
in Juſtice He might now require) His Majeſty is confident that it will then appear
to all the World, not only who is moſt deſirous of Peace, and whoſe fault it is that
both Armies are not now disbanded, but who have been the true and firſt cauſe that this
Peace was ever interrupted, or theſe Armies raiſed; and the beginning or continuance of
the War, and the deſtruction and deſolation of this poor Kingdom (which is too likely
to enſue) will not, by the moſt intereſſed, paſſionate or prejudicate perſon, be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

well believe Himſelf abſolved before God and man from the leaſt poſſible charge of
not having uſed His utmoſt endeavour for Peace: yet when he conſiders that the
Scene of all this Calamity is in the Bowels of His own Kingdom, that all the bloud
which is ſpilt, is of His own Subjects, and that what Victory ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to
give Him muſt be over thoſe who ought not to have lifted up their hands againſt Him;

to be totally loſt; That the heavy Judgments of God, Plague, Peſtilence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
will be the inevitable attendants of this unnatural Contention, and That in a
ſhort time there will be ſo general a habit of Uncharitableneſs and Cruelty contracted
throughout the Kingdom, that even Peace it ſelf will not reſtore His People to their
old temper and ſecurity; His Majeſty cannot but again call for an Anſwer to that
His Meſſage, which gives ſo fair a riſe to end theſe unnatural Diſtractions. And His
Majeſty doth this with the more earneſtneſs, becauſe He doubts not the condition of
His Armies in ſeveral parts, His ſtrength of Horſe, Foot and Artillery, His plenty of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60710:57"/>
Ammunition (which ſome men lately might conceive He wanted) is ſo well known
and underſtood, that it muſt be confeſſed, that nothing but the Tenderneſs and Love to
His people, and thoſe Chriſtian Impreſſions which always have, and He hopes always

them, as they will anſwer to God, to Himſelf, and all the World, that they
will no longer ſuffer their fellow-Subjects to welter in each others bloud; that they
will remember by whoſe Authority, and to what end they met in that Council, and
ſend ſuch an Anſwer to His Majeſty, as may open a door to let in a firm Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to the whole Kingdom. If His Majeſty ſhall again be diſappointed of His
intentions herein, the Bloud, Rapine and Diſtraction which muſt follow in <hi>England</hi>

                     <head type="sub">By the Duke of Richmond and Earl of Southampton.</head>
                     <p>HIS Majeſty hath ſeriouſly conſidered your Propoſitions, and finds it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
in reſpect they import ſo great an alteration in Government, both in
Church and State, to return a particular and poſitive Anſwer before a full debate,
wherein thoſe Propoſitions, and all neceſſary Explanations, and Reaſons for aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
diſſenting, or qualifying, and all inconveniences and miſchiefs which may enſue,
and cannot otherwiſe be ſo well foreſeen, may be diſcuſſed and weighed. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
therefore propoſeth and deſireth as the beſt expedient for Peace, That you will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
ſuch a number of Perſons as you ſhall think fit, to Treat with the like number
of Perſons to be appointed by His Majeſty upon the ſaid Propoſitions, and ſuch other
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60710:58"/>
things as ſhall be propoſed by His Majeſty, for the preſervation and defence of the
Proteſtant Religion (with due regard to the eaſe of tender Conſciences, as His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
hath often offered) the Rights of the Crown, the Liberty and Property of the
Subject, and the Priviledges of Parliament: and upon the whole matter to conclude a
happy and bleſſed Peace.</p>

your part of a deep and ſeeming ſenſe of the Miſeries of this afflicted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and of the dangers incident to His Perſon during the continuance of this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

theſe Arms hath been only for the neceſſary defence of God's true Religion, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's

leſs from Subjects to their King. But His Majeſty is reſolved that no diſcouragements

                     <p>NOtwithſtanding the ſtrange and unexpected delays (which can be precedented
by no former times) to His Majeſties two former Meſſages, His Majeſty will
lay aſide all expoſtulations, as rather ſerving to loſe time, than to contribute any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to the evils which (for the preſent) do afflict this diſtracted Kingdom: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without further preamble, His Majeſty thinks it moſt neceſſary to ſend theſe
Propoſitions this way, which He intended to do by the Perſons mentioned in His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Meſſages, though He well knows the great diſadvantage which overtures of this
kind have by the want of being accompanied by well-inſtructed Meſſengers.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty conceiving that the former Treaties have hitherto proved ineffectual
chiefly for want of Power in thoſe Perſons that Treated, as likewiſe becauſe thoſe from
whom their Power was derived (not poſſibly having the particular informations of
every ſeveral debate) could not give ſo clear a Judgment as was requiſite in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a buſineſs; If therefore His Majeſty may have the engagement of the two
Houſes of Parliament at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council and Militia of <hi>London,</hi> of the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders

His Servants now attending Him, and their followers, not exceeding in all the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Majeſty ſhall nominate at any time before His going from <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Weſtminster</hi>)
His Majeſty propounds to have a Perſonal Treaty with the two Houſes of Parliament
at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which may conduce to the reſtoring of Peace and happineſs to theſe miſerable
diſtracted Kingdoms: and to begin with the three Heads which were Treated on at
<hi>Vxbridge.</hi> And for the better clearing of His Majeſties earneſt and ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of putting an end to theſe unnatural Diſtractions, (knowing that point of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
may prove the greateſt obſtacle to this moſt bleſſed work) His Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declares, That He is willing to commit the great truſt of the Militia of this

Anſwer, yet His Majeſty lays that aſide, as not ſo proper for His preſent
endeavours, leaving all the World to judge, whether His Propoſition for a Perſonal
Treaty, or the flat denial of a ſafe Conduct for Perſons to begin a Treaty, be greater
ſigns of a real intention to Peace; and ſhall now only inſiſt upon His former Meſſage of
the 26. of this <hi>December;</hi> That upon His repair to <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> He doubts not but ſo to
joyn His endeavours with His two Houſes of Parliament, as to give juſt ſatisfaction,
not only concerning the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but alſo for the ſetling of a way for the
payment of the publick Debts, as well to the <hi>Scots</hi> and to the City of <hi>London</hi> as others.
And as already He hath ſhewn a fair way for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo He ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
endeavour in all other particulars, that none ſhall have cauſe to complain for
want of ſecurity, whereby juſt Jealouſies may ariſe to hinder the continuance of the
deſired Peace. And certainly this Propoſition of a Perſonal Treaty could never have
entred into His Majeſties thoughts, if He had not reſolved to make apparent to all the
World, that the publick good and Peace of this Kingdom is far dearer to Him than
the reſpect of any particular Intereſt. Wherefore none can oppoſe this motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a manifeſt demonſtration that he particularly envies His Majeſty ſhould be the
chief Author in ſo bleſſed a work, beſides the declaring himſelf a direct oppoſer of the
happy Peace of theſe Nations. To conclude, whoſoever will not be aſhamed that his
fair and ſpecious proteſtations ſhould be brought to a true and publick teſt, and thoſe
who have a real ſenſe, and do truly commiſerate the miſeries of their bleeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

                     <p>BUT that theſe are times wherein nothing is ſtrange; it were a thing much to
be marvelled at, what ſhould cauſe this unparallel'd long detention of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Trumpeter, ſent with His gracious Meſſage of the 26. of <hi>December</hi> laſt; Peace
being the only ſubject of it, and His Majeſties Perſonal Treaty the means propoſed
for it. And it were almoſt as great a wonder that His Majeſty ſhould be ſo long from
enquiring after it, if that the hourly expectation thereof had not in ſome meaſure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
His impatience. But leſt His Majeſty by His long ſilence ſhould condemn Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of Careleſneſs in that which ſo much concerns the good of all His People, He
thinks it high time to enquire after His ſaid Trumpeter: For ſince all men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60710:59"/>
any goodneſs muſt deſire Peace; and that all men know Treaties to be the beſt
and moſt Chriſtian way to procure it; and there being as little queſtion, that His
Majeſties Perſonal preſence in it is the likelieſt way to bring it to an happy iſſue;
He judges there muſt be ſome ſtrange variety of accidents which cauſeth this moſt
tedious delay. Wherefore His Majeſty earneſtly deſires to have a ſpeedy account of His
former Meſſage, the ſubject whereof is Peace, and the means His Perſonal preſence at
<hi>Weſtminster;</hi> where the Government of the Church being ſetled as it was in the times
of the happy and glorious Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> and full liberty
for the eaſe of their Conſciences who will not communicate in that Service eſtabliſhed
by Law, and likewiſe for the free and publick uſe of the Directory (preſcribed, and
by command of the two Houſes of Parliament now practiſed in ſome parts of the City
of <hi>London</hi>) to ſuch as ſhall deſire to uſe the ſame, and all Forces being agreed to be
disbanded; His Majeſty will then forthwith (as He hath in His Meſſage of the 29. of
<hi>December</hi> laſt already offered) joyn with His two Houſes of Parliament, in ſetling
ſome way for the payment of the publick Debts to His <hi>Scotch</hi> Subjects, the City of
<hi>London,</hi> and others. And His Majeſty having propoſed a fair way for the ſetling of
the <hi>Militia,</hi> which now by this long delay ſeems not to be thought ſufficient ſecurity;
His Majeſty (to ſhew how really He will imploy Himſelf at His coming to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
for making this a laſting Peace, and taking away all Jealouſies, how groundleſs
ſoever) will endeavour upon debate with His two Houſes ſo to diſpoſe of it (as likewiſe
of the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi>) as may give to them and both Kingdoms juſt ſatisfaction:
not doubting alſo but to give good contentment to His two Houſes of Parliament in the
choice of the Lord Admiral, the Officers of State, and others, if His two Houſes by
their ready inclinations to Peace ſhall give Him encouragement thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Thus His Majeſty having taken occaſion by His juſt impatience ſo to explain His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
that no man can doubt of a happy iſſue to this ſucceeding Treaty; if now
there ſhall be ſo much as a delay of the ſame, He calls God and the World to witneſs,
who they are that not only hinder but reject this Kingdoms future Happineſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much the ſtranger, that His Majeſties coming to <hi>Weſtminster</hi> (which was
firſt the greateſt pretence for taking up Arms) ſhould be ſo much as delayed, much

                     <p>HIS Majeſty thinks not fit now to anſwer thoſe Aſperſions which are returned as
arguments for His not admittance to <hi>Weſtminster</hi> for a Perſonal Treaty, becauſe
it would enforce a ſtyle not ſuitable to His end, it being the Peace of theſe miſerable
Kingdoms: yet thus much He cannot but ſay to thoſe who have ſent Him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that if they had conſidered what they have done themſelves in occaſioning the
ſhedding of ſo much innocent blood, by withdrawing themſelves from their Duty
to Him in a time when He had granted ſo much to His Subjects, and in violating the
known Laws of the Kingdom to draw an exorbitant power to themſelves over their
fellow-Subjects, (to ſay no more, to do as they have done) they could not have given
ſuch a falſe character of His Majeſties Actions. Wherefore His Majeſty muſt now
remember them, that having ſome hours before his receiving of their laſt Paper of the
13. of <hi>January,</hi> ſent another Meſſage to them of the 15, wherein by divers particulars
He enlargeth Himſelf to ſhew the reality of His endeavors for Peace, by His deſired Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Treaty (which He ſtill conceives to be the likelieſt way to attain to that bleſſed
End) He thinks fit by this Meſſage to call for an Anſwer to that, and indeed to all the
former. For certainly, no rational man can think their laſt Paper can be any Anſwer
to His former demands, the ſcope of it being, That becauſe there is a War, therefore
there ſhould be no Treaty for Peace. And is it poſſible to expect that the Propoſitions
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60710:60"/>
mentioned ſhould be the grounds of a laſting Peace, when the perſons that ſend them
will not endure to hear their own King ſpeak? But whatever the ſucceſs hath been of
His Majeſty's former Meſſages, or how ſmall ſoever His hopes are of a better, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the high ſtrain of thoſe who deal with His Majeſty, yet He will neither want Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Bowels to His Subjects in general, nor will He forget that God hath appointed
Him for their King with whom He treats. Wherefore He now demands a ſpeedy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to His laſt and former Meſſages.</p>

For Anſwer to His former Meſſage, and concerning their Reaſons againſt
a Perſonal Treaty.</head>
                     <opener>For the Speaker of the Houſe of Peers pro tempore, to be communicated to the two

                     </opener>
                     <p>THE procuring Peace to theſe Kingdoms by Treaty is ſo much deſired by His
Majeſty, that no unjuſt Aſperſions whatſoever or any other Diſcouragements
ſhall make Him deſiſt from doing His indeavour therein, until He ſhall ſee it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impoſſible; and He therefore hath thought fitting ſo far only to make reply to
that Paper or Anſwer which He hath received of the 13 of this Inſtant <hi>January,</hi> as
may take away thoſe objections which are made againſt His Majeſty's coming to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
expecting ſtill an Anſwer to His Meſſages of the fifteenth and ſeventeenth,
which He hopes by this time have begotten better thoughts and reſolutions in the
Members of both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt therefore, whereas in the ſaid laſt Paper it is objected as an impediment to
His Majeſty's Perſonal Treaty, that much innocent Blood hath been ſhed in this War
by His Majeſty's Commiſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will not now diſpute, (it being apparent to all
the World by whom this Blood hath been ſpilt) but rather preſſeth that there ſhould
be no more; and to that end only He hath deſired this Perſonal Treaty, as judging it
the moſt immediate means to aboliſh ſo many horrid Confuſions in all His Kingdoms.
And it is no Argument, to ſay that there ſhall be no ſuch Perſonal Treaty becauſe
there have been Wars, it being a ſtrong inducement to have ſuch a Treaty to put an
end to the War.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That there ſhould be no ſuch Perſonal Treaty, becauſe ſome of His <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Subjects have repaired to His aſſiſtance in it, ſeems an argument altogether as ſtrange
as the other, as alwaies urging that there ſhould be no Phyſick becauſe the Party is
ſick. And in this particular it hath been often obſerved unto them, that thoſe whom
they call <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who have ſo expreſſed their Loyalty to their Soveraign, were indeed
(for the moſt part) ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants as had been formerly ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> by
the two Houſes, impoſſibilitated to ſtay there any longer by the neglect of thoſe that
ſent them thither, who ſhould there have better provided for them. And for any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Forces, it is too apparent that their Armies have ſwarmed with them, when His
Majeſty hath had very few or none.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, for a third Impediment, it is alledged that the Prince is in the head
of an Army in the Weſt, and that there are divers Garriſons ſtill kept in His Majeſty's
obedience, and that there are Forces in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it muſt be as much confeſſed as that
as yet there is no Peace: And therefore it is deſired, that by ſuch a Perſonal Treaty
all theſe impediments may be removed. And it is not here amiſs to put them in mind,
how long ſince His Majeſty did preſs a disbanding of all Forces on both ſides, the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
whereof hath been the cauſe of this objection.</p>
                     <p>And whereas exception is taken, that there is a time limited in the Propoſition for
His Majeſty's Perſonal Treaty, thereupon inferring, that He ſhould again return to
Hoſtility, His Majeſty proteſteth that He ſeeks this Treaty to void future Hoſtility,
and to procure a laſting Peace; and if He can meet with like inclinations to Peace
in thoſe He deſires to Treat with, He will bring ſuch Affections and reſolutions in
Himſelf as ſhall end all theſe unhappy bloody Differences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:60710:60"/>
As for thoſe engagements which His Majeſty hath deſired for His ſecurity, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall call to mind the particular occaſions that enforced His Majeſty to leave
His City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> will judge His demand very reaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for His Safety. But He no way conceiveth how the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
Common-Council and <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> were either ſubject or ſubordinate to that
Authority which is alledged, as knowing neither Law nor Practice for it: And if the
two Armies be, He believes it is more than can be parallel'd by any former times in
this Kingdom. Nor can His Majeſty underſtand how His Majeſty's ſeeking of a
Perſonal ſecurity can be any breach of Priviledge: it being likely to be infringed by
hindring His Majeſty from coming freely to His two Houſes.</p>
                     <p>As for the objection, that His Majeſty omitted to mention the ſetling Religion,
and ſecuring the Peace of His Native Kingdom, His Majeſty declares, that He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
that it was included in His former, and hath been particularly mentioned in
His latter Meſſage of the 15. preſent. But, for their better ſatisfaction, He again expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that it was, and ever ſhall be, both His meaning and endeavour in this Treaty deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
and it ſeems to Him very clear, that there is no way for a final ending of ſuch
Diſtractions as afflict this Kingdom, but either by Treaty or Conqueſt, the latter of
which His Majeſty hopes none will have the Impudency or Impiety to wiſh for. And
for the former, if his Perſonal aſſiſtance in it be not the moſt likely way, let any
reaſonable man judge: when by that means not only all unneceſſary Delaies will be
removed, but even the greateſt Difficulties made eaſie. And therefore He doth now
again earneſtly inſiſt upon that Propoſition, expecting to have a better Anſwer upon
mature conſideration. And can it be imagined that any Propoſitions will be ſo effectual,
being formed before a Perſonal Treaty, as ſuch as are framed and propounded upon a
full debate on both ſides? Wherefore His Majeſty, who is moſt concerned in the good
of His People, and is moſt deſirous to reſtore Peace and Happineſs to His three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
doth again inſtantly deſire an Anſwer to His ſaid former Meſſages, to which
He hath hitherto received none.</p>

Concerning the Negotiations in Ireland; with His Majeſty's further Conceſſions,

                     <p>HIS Majeſty having received information from the Lord Lieutenant and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> hath, without his or their directions
or privity, entred into a Treaty with ſome Commiſſioners on the Roman Catholick
party there, and alſo drawn up and agreed unto certain Articles with the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
highly derogatory to His Majeſty's Honour and Royal Dignity, and moſt
prejudicial unto the Proteſtant Religion and Church there in <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereupon the
ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> is arreſted upon ſuſpicion of high Treaſon, and impriſoned by
the ſaid Lord Lieutenant and Council, at the inſtance and by the impeachment of the
Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> who (by reaſon of his place and former imployment in theſe affairs) doth
beſt know how contrary that proceeding of the ſaid Earl hath been to His Majeſty's
intentions and directions, and what great prejudice it might bring to His Affairs, if
thoſe proceedings of the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> ſhould be any waies underſtood to have
been done by the directions, liking, or approbation of His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty, having in His former <hi>Meſſages</hi> for a Perſonal Treaty offered to give
contentment to his two Houſes in the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath now thought fitting,
the better to ſhew His clear intentions, and to give ſatisfaction to His ſaid Houſes of
Parliament, and the reſt of His Subjects in all His Kingdoms, to ſend this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to His ſaid Houſes, containing the whole truth of the buſineſs; Which is,</p>
                     <p>That the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> having made offer unto Him to raiſe Forces in the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to conduct them into <hi>England</hi> for His Majeſty's Service, had
a Commiſſion to that purpoſe, and to that purpoſe only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60710:61"/>
That he had no Commiſſion at all to treat of any thing elſe, without the privity
and directions of the Lord Lieutenant, much leſs to capitulate any thing concerning
Religion, or any propriety belonging either to Church or Laity.</p>
                     <p>That it clearly appears by the Lord Lieutenants Proceedings with the ſaid Earl,
that he had no notice at all of what the ſaid Earlhad treated and pretended to have capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated
with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> until by accident it came to his knowledge.</p>
                     <p>And his Majeſty doth proteſt, that until ſuch time as He had advertiſement that
the perſon of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was arreſted and reſtrained, as is aboveſaid, He
never heard, nor had any kind of notice that the ſaid Earl had entred into any kind of
Treaty or Capitulation with thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſsioners; much leſs that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
or ſigned thoſe Articles ſo deſtructive both to Church and State, and ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to His Majeſty's publick profeſsions and known reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>And for the further vindication of His Majeſties Honour and Integrity herein, He
doth declare, That He is ſo far from conſidering any thing contained in thoſe Papers
or Writings framed by the ſaid Earl, and thoſe Commiſſioners with whom he treated,
as He doth abſolutely diſavow him therein, and hath given commandment to the
Lord Lieutenant and the Council there, to proceed againſt the ſaid Earl as one who
either out of Falſeneſs, Preſumption or Folly, hath ſo hazarded the blemiſhing of His
Majeſty's Reputation with His good Subjects, and ſo impertinently framed thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of his own head, without the conſent, privity, or directions of His Majeſty, or
the Lord Lieutenant, or any of His Majeſties Council there. But true it is, that for
the neceſſary preſervation of His Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe caſe
was daily repreſented unto Him to be ſo deſperate, His Majeſty had given Commiſſion
to the Lord Lieutenant to treat and conclude ſuch a Peace there as might be for the
ſafety of that Crown, the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and no way dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to His Own Honour and publick profeſſions.</p>
                     <p>But to the end that His Majeſty's real intentions in this buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be the
more clearly underſtood, and to give more ample ſatisfaction to both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> eſpecially concerning His
Majeſties not being engaged in any Peace or Agreement there, He doth deſire, if the
two Houſes ſhall admit of His Majeſty's repair to <hi>London</hi> for a Perſonal Treaty, (as
was formerly propoſed) that ſpeedy notice be given thereof to His Majeſty, and a Paſs
or Safe-Conduct with a blank ſent for a Meſſenger to be immediately diſpatcht into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to prevent any accident that may happen to hinder His Majeſty's reſolution of
leaving the managing of the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> wholly to the Houſes, and to make no
Peace there but with their conſent; which, in caſe it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſs His en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
in the Treaty with ſucceſs, His Majeſty doth hereby engage Himſelf to do.</p>
                     <p>And for a further explanation of His Majeſty's intentions in His former Meſſages,
He doth now declare, that if His Perſonal repair to <hi>London,</hi> as aforeſaid, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and a Peace thereon ſhall enſue, He will then leave the nomination of the
Perſons to be intruſted with the <hi>Militia</hi> wholly to His two Houſes, with ſuch power
and limitations as are expreſſed in the Paper delivered by His Majeſty's Commiſſioners
at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> 1644. for the term of ſeven years, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
to be given immediately after the concluſion of the Peace, the disbanding of all
Forces on both ſides, and the diſmantling of the Garriſons erected ſince theſe preſent
Troubles, ſo as at the expiration of the time before mentioned the power of the <hi>Militia</hi>
ſhall entirely revert and remain as before.</p>
                     <p>And for their further ſecurity, His Majeſty (the Peace ſucceeding) will be content
that, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> the two Houſes ſhall nominate the <hi>Admiral,</hi> Officers of State, and
Judges, to hold their places during life, or <hi>quam diu ſe bene geſſerint,</hi> which ſhall be
beſt liked, to be accountable to none but the King and the two Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>As for matter of Religion, His Majeſty doth further declare, That by the Liberty
offered in His Meſſage of the 15 preſent, for the eaſe of their Conſciences who will
not communicate in the Service already eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
He intends that all other Proteſtants behaving themſelves peaceably in and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Civil Government, ſhall have the free exerciſe of their Religion according
to their own way.</p>
                     <p>And for the total removing of all Fears and Jealouſies, His Majeſty is willing to
agree, that upon the concluſion of Peace, there ſhall be a general Act of Oblivion and
free Pardon paſt by Act of Parliament in both His Kingdoms reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>And leſt it ſhould be imagined, that in the making theſe Propoſitions His Majeſty's
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> and His Subjects there have been forgotten or neglected, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60710:61"/>
declares, That what is here mentioned touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the naming
of Officers of State, and Judges, ſhall likewiſe extend to His Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now His Majeſty having ſo fully and clearly expreſſed His intentions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of making a happy and well-grounded Peace, if any perſon ſhall decline that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
by oppoſing of ſo apparent a way of attaining it, he will ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to all the World his intention and deſign can be no other, than the total ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

maintain Him in His Honour, and in His juſt and lawful Rights, which is the only
way to make a happy compoſure of theſe unnatural Diviſions; and likewiſe will think
upon a ſolid way of conſerving the Peace between the two Kingdoms for the time
to come; and will take a ſpeedy courſe for eaſing and quieting His afflicted People,
by ſatisfying the publick Debts, by disbanding of all Armies, and whatſoever elſe ſhall
be judged conducible to that end: that ſo all hindrances being removed, He may return
to His Parliament with mutual comfort.</p>

may give contentment to them; His Majeſty doth earneſtly deſire, That the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

He reſolves to comply with His Houſes of Parliament in every thing which may be

Houſes of Parliament to disburthen the Kingdom of all Forces and Garriſons in their

that they are ſo bound up from any capacity either to give reaſons for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
they bring, or to give ear to ſuch deſires as His Majeſty is to propound, as it is

                     <p>HIS Majeſties thoughts being alwaies ſincerely bent to the Peace of His Kingdoms,
was and will be ever deſirous to take all ways which might the moſt clearly make
appear the candour of His intentions to His People; and to this end could find no better
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60710:63"/>
way than to propoſe a Perſonal free debate with His two Houſes of Parliament upon
all the preſent Differences: Yet finding, very much againſt His expectations, that this
offer was laid aſide, His Majeſty bent all His thoughts to make His intentions fully
known by a particular Anſwer to the Propoſitions delivered to Him in the name of
both Kingdoms the 24. of <hi>July</hi> laſt. But the more He endeavoured it, He more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaw, that any anſwer He could make would be ſubject to miſ-informations and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions,
which upon His own Paraphraſes and Explanations He is moſt confident
will give ſo good ſatisfaction, as would doubtleſs cauſe a happy and laſting Peace. Leſt
therefore that good intentions may produce ill effects, His Majeſty again propoſeth,
and deſires again to come to <hi>London,</hi> or any of His Houſes thereabouts, upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith and ſecurity of his two Houſes of Parliament and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners,
that He ſhall be there with Honour, Freedom and Safety: Where, by His Perſonal
preſence, He may not only raiſe a mutual Confidence betwixt Him and His People,
but alſo have thoſe Doubts cleared and thoſe Difficulties explained to Him, without
which He cannot (but with the aforeſaid miſchievous inconveniences) give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Anſwer to the Propoſitions; and with which He doubts not but ſo to manifeſt His
real intentions for the ſetling of Religion, the juſt Privileges of Parliament, with the
Freedom and Property of the Subject, that it ſhall not be in the power of wicked and
malicious men to hinder the eſtabliſhing of that firm Peace which all honeſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Aſſuring them, as He will make no other Demands but ſuch as He believes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to be juſt, and much conducing to the tranquillity of the People; ſo He will be
moſt willing to condeſcend to them in whatſoever ſhall be really for their good and
happineſs. Not doubting likewiſe but you will alſo have a due regard to maintain
the juſt Power of the Crown, according to your many proteſtations and profeſſions:
For certainly, except King and People have reciprocal care each of other, neither can
be happy.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, 'tis your King who deſires to be heard, (the which if refuſed to a
Subject by a King, he would be thought a Tyrant for it) and for that end which all
men profeſs to deſire. Wherefore His Majeſty conjures you, as you deſire to ſhew
your ſelves really what you profeſs, even as you are good Chriſtians and Subjects, that
you will accept this His offer, which He is confident God will ſo bleſs, that it will
be the readieſt means by which theſe Kingdoms may again become a Comfort to their
Friends, and a Terrour to their Enemies.</p>

                     <p>AS the daily expectation of the coming of the Propoſitions, hath made His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
this long time to forbear giving His Anſwer unto them; ſo the appearance
of their ſending being no more for any thing He can hear than it was at His firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hither, notwithſtanding that the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> hath been at <hi>London</hi> above
theſe ten days, (whoſe not coming was ſaid to be the only ſtop) hath cauſed His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
thus to anticipate their coming to Him. And yet conſidering His condition, that
His Servants are denied acceſs to Him, all but very few, and thoſe by appointment,
not His own election, and that it is declared a crime for any but the Commiſſioners or
ſuch who are particularly permitted by them to converſe with His Majeſty, or that
any Letters ſhould be given to or received from Him, may He not truly ſay, that He
is not in caſe fit to make Conceſſions or give Anſwers, ſince He is not maſter of theſe
ordinary actions which are the undoubted rights of any free-born man, how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his birth be? And certainly He would ſtill be ſilent as to this Subject, until His
condition were much mended, did He not prefer ſuch a right underſtanding betwixt
Him and His Parliaments of both Kingdoms, which may make a firm and laſting Peace
in all His Dominions, before any particular of His own, or any earthly bleſſing: and
therefore His Majeſty hath diligently imployed His utmoſt endeavours for divers months
paſt, ſo to inform His underſtanding and ſatisfie His Conſcience, that He might be able
to give ſuch Anſwers to the Propoſitions as would be moſt conformable to His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but He ingenuouſly profeſſes, that notwithſtanding all the pains that He hath
taken therein, the nature of ſome of them appears ſuch unto Him, that without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
that Reaſon which God hath given Him to judge by, for the good of Him
and His People, and without putting the greateſt violence upon His own Conſcience,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60710:64"/>
He cannot give His Conſent to all of them. Yet His Majeſty (that it may appear to
all the world how deſirous He is to give full ſatisfaction) hath thought fit hereby to
expreſs His readineſs to grant what He may, and His willingneſs to receive from
them, and that Perſonally, if His two Houſes at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſhall approve thereof, ſuch
further information in the reſt as may beſt convince His Judgement, and ſatisfie thoſe
doubts which are not yet clear unto Him: deſiring them alſo to conſider, that if His
Majeſty intended to wind Himſelf out of theſe Troubles by indirect means, were it
not eaſie for Him now readily to conſent to what hath or ſhall be propoſed unto Him,
and afterwards chuſe His time to break all, alledging, that forced Conceſſions are not
to be kept? ſurely He might, and not incur a hard cenſure from indifferent men. But
Maxims in this kind are not the guides of His Majeſty's Actions, for He freely and
clearly avows, that He holds it unlawful for any man, and moſt baſe in a King, to
recede from His Promiſes for having been obtained by force or under reſtraint. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
His Majeſty not only rejecting thoſe acts which He eſteems unworthy of Him,
but even paſſing by that which He might well inſiſt upon, a point of Honour, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of His preſent condition, thus anſwers the firſt Propoſition:</p>
                     <p>That upon His Majeſty's coming to <hi>London,</hi> He will heartily joyn in all that ſhall
concern the Honour of His two Kingdoms, or the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
or of the Commiſſioners or Deputies of either Kingdom, particularly in thoſe things
which are deſired in that Propoſition, upon confidence that all of them reſpectively
with the ſame tenderneſs will look upon thoſe things which concern His Majeſty's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to all the Propoſitions concerning Religion, His Majeſty propoſeth, That
He will confirm the Presbyterial Government, the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and the Directory, for three years, being the time ſet down by the two Houſes, ſo
that His Majeſty and His Houſhold be not hindred from that form of God's Service
which they formerly have had: And alſo that a free conſultation and debate be had
with the Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (twenty of His Majeſty's nomination being added
unto them) whereby it may be determined by His Majeſty and the two Houſes, how
the Church ſhall be governed after the ſaid three years, or ſooner, if differences may
be agreed. Touching the Covenant, His Majeſty is not yet therein ſatisfied, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to reſpite His particular Anſwer thereunto until His coming to <hi>London,</hi> becauſe
it being a matter of Conſcience, He cannot give a reſolution therein till He may be
aſſiſted with the Advice of ſome of His own Chaplains (which hath hitherto been
denied Him) and ſuch other Divines as ſhall be moſt proper to inform Him therein;
and then He will make clearly appear both His zeal to the Proteſtant Profeſſion and
the Union of theſe two Kingdoms, which He conceives to be the main drift of this
Covenant.</p>
                     <p>To the ſeventh and eighth Propoſitions His Majeſty will conſent.</p>
                     <p>To the ninth His Majeſty doubts not but to give good ſatisfaction, when he ſhall
be particularly informed how the ſaid penalties ſhall be levied and diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>To the tenth His Majeſty's Anſwer is, That He hath been always ready to prevent
the practices of Papiſts, and therefore is content to paſs an Act of Parliament for that
purpoſe; and alſo that the Laws againſt them be duly executed.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will give his conſent to the Act for the due obſervation of the Lord's
day, for the ſuppreſſing of Innovations, and thoſe concerning the Preaching of God's
Word, and touching Non-reſidence and Pluralities; and His Majeſty will yield to
ſuch Act or Acts as ſhall be requiſite to raiſe moneys for the payment and ſatisfying
all publick Debts, expecting alſo that His will be therein included.</p>
                     <p>As to the Propoſition touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> though His Majeſty cannot conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it <hi>in terminis</hi> as it is propoſed, becauſe thereby He conceives He wholly parts with
the power of the Sword, entruſted to Him by God and the Laws of the Land for the
protection and government of His People, thereby at once deveſting Himſelf and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting
His Poſterity of that right and Prerogative of the Crown which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to the Kingly Office, and ſo weakning Monarchy in this Kingdom,
that little more than the name and ſhadow of it will remain: yet if it be only ſecurity for
the preſervation of the Peace of this Kingdom after the unhappy Troubles, and the
due performance of all the agreements which are now to be concluded, which is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
(which His Majeſty always underſtood to be the caſe, and hopes that herein He
is not miſtaken) His Majeſty will give abundant ſatisfaction; to which end He is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by Act of Parliament, That the whole power of the <hi>Militia</hi> both by Sea and
Land for the ſpace of ten years be in the hands of ſuch perſons as the two Houſes ſhall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60710:65"/>
nominate, giving them power during the ſaid term to change the ſaid perſons, and
ſubſtitute others in their places at pleaſure, and afterwards to return to the proper
Chanel again, as it was in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed
memory. And now His Majeſty conjures His two Houſes of Parliament, as they
are Engliſhmen and Lovers of Peace, by the duty they owe to His Majeſty their King,
and by the bowels of compaſſion they have to their fellow-Subjects, that they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of this His Majeſty's offer, whereby the joyful news of Peace may be reſtored to
this languiſhing Kingdom. His Majeſty will grant the like to the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lund,</hi>
if it be deſired, and agree to all things that are propounded touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of Peace betwixt the two Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Ireland</hi> (other things being agreed) His Majeſty will give ſatisfaction
therein. As to the mutual Declaration propoſed to be eſtabliſhed in both Kingdoms
by Act of Parliament, and the Modifications, Qualifications, and branches which
follow in the Propoſitions, His Majeſty only profeſſes, that He doth not ſufficiently
underſtand nor is able to reconcile many things contained in them: but this He well
knoweth, that a general Act of Oblivion is the beſt Bond of Peace; and that after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Troubles, the wiſdom of this and other Kingdoms hath uſually and happily in
all ages granted general Pardons, whereby the numerous diſcontentments of many
perſons and families othewiſe expoſed to ruine might not become fuel to new diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or ſeeds to future troubles. His Majeſty therefore deſires, that His two Houſes
of Parliament would ſeriouſly deſcend into theſe conſiderations, and likewiſe tenderly
look upon His condition herein, and the perpetual diſhonour that muſt cleave to Him,
if He ſhall thus abandon ſo many perſons of condition and fortune that have engaged
themſelves with and for Him out of a ſenſe of Duty; and propounds as a very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
teſtimony of their affection to Him, that a general Act of Oblivion and free Pardon
be forthwith paſſed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Touching the new great Seal, His Majeſty is very willing to confirm both it and
all the Acts done by virtue thereof until this preſent time, ſo that it be not thereby
preſſed to make void thoſe Acts of His done by virtue of His great Seal, which in
Honour and Juſtice He is obliged to maintain: and that the future government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be in His Majeſty, according to the due courſe of Law.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Officers mentioned in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, His Majeſty when He ſhall
come to <hi>Weſtminster</hi> will gratifie His Parliament all that poſſibly He may, without
deſtroying the alterations which are neceſſary for the Crown.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will willingly conſent to the Act for the confirmation of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and cuſtoms of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all that is mentioned in the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for their particular advantage.</p>
                     <p>And now that His Majeſty hath thus far endeavoured to comply with the deſires
of His two Houſes of Parliament, to the end that this agreement may be firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without the leaſt face or queſtion of reſtraint to blemiſh the ſame, His Majeſty
earneſtly deſires preſently to be admitted to His Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with that
Honour which is due to their Sovereign, there ſolemnly to confirm the ſame, and legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to paſs the Acts before mentioned, and to give and receive as well ſatisfaction in all
the remaining particulars, as likewiſe ſuch other pledges of mutual love, truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
as ſhall moſt concern the good of Him and His People; upon which happy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
His Majeſty will diſpatch His Directions to the Prince His Son, to return
immediately to Him, and will undertake for His ready obedience thereunto.</p>

                     <p>HIS Majeſty cannot chuſe but be paſſionately ſenſible (as He believes all His good
Subjects are) of the late great Diſtractions, and ſtill languiſhing and unſetled
ſtate of this Kingdom; and He calls God to witneſs, and is willing to give teſtimony
to all the World of His readineſs to contribute His uttermoſt endeavours for reſtoring
it to a happy and flouriſhing condition. His Majeſty having peruſed the Propoſitions
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60710:65"/>
now brought to Him, finds them the ſame in effect which were offered to Him at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle:</hi>
To ſome of which as He could not then conſent without violation of His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and Honour; ſo neither can He agree to others now, conceiving them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reſpects more diſagreeable to the preſent condition of affairs than when they were
formerly preſented unto Him, as being deſtructive to the main principal Intereſts of
the Army, and of all thoſe whoſe affections concur with them. And His Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeen the Propoſals of the Army to the Commiſſioners from His two Houſes reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with them, and with them to be treated on, in order to the clearing and ſecuring
of the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and the ſetling of a Juſt and laſting
Peace: to which Propoſals as He conceives His two Houſes not to be ſtrangers; ſo
He believes they will think with Him, that they much more conduce to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all Intereſts, and may be a fitter foundation for a laſting Peace, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
which at this time are tendered unto Him: He therefore propounds (as the
beſt way in His judgment in order to a Peace) that His two Houſes would inſtantly
take into conſideration thoſe Propoſals upon which there may be a Perſonal Treaty
with His Majeſty, and upon ſuch other Propoſitions as His Majeſty ſhall make; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that the ſaid Propoſals may be ſo moderated in the ſaid Treaty, as to render them
the more capable of His Majeſty's full Conceſſion: Wherein He reſolves to give full
ſatisfaction to His People, for whatſoever ſhall concern the ſetling of the Proteſtant
Profeſſion, with liberty to tender Conſciences, and the ſecuring of the Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Properties of His Subjects, and all the juſt Privileges of Parliaments for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And likewiſe by His preſent deportment in this Treaty, He will make the
World clearly judge of His intentions in matters of future Government. In which
Treaty His Majeſty will be well pleaſed (if it be thought fit) that Commiſſioners
from the Army (whoſe the Propoſals are) may likewiſe be admitted. His Majeſty
therefore conjures His two Houſes of Parliament by the duty they owe to God and His
Majeſty their King, and by the bowels of compaſſion they have to their fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
both for the relief of their preſent Sufferings and to prevent future Miſeries,
that they will forthwith accept of this His Majeſty's offer, whereby the joyful news of
Peace may be reſtored to this diſtreſſed Kingdom. And for what concerns the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> mentioned in the Propoſitions, His Majeſty will very willingly Treat
upon thoſe particulars with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, and doubts not but to give reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

                     <p>LIberty being that which in all times hath been, but eſpecially now is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
theme and deſire of all men; common reaſon ſhews that Kings leſs than
any ſhould endure Captivity. And yet I call God and the world to witneſs with what
Patience I have endured a tedious Reſtraint; which ſo long as I had any hopes that
this ſort of My Suffering might conduce to the Peace of My Kingdoms, or the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of more effuſion of bloud, I did willingly undergo: but now finding by too
certain proofs, that this my continued Patience would not only turn to my Perſonal
Ruine, but likewiſe be of much more prejudice than furtherance to the publick good,
I thought I was bound as well by natural as political obligations to ſeek My Safety,
by retiring My ſelf for ſome time from the publick view both of my Friends and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And I appeal to all indifferent men to judge, if I have not juſt cauſe to free
My ſelf from the hands of thoſe who change their Principles with their condition, and
who are not aſhamed openly to intend the deſtruction of the Nobility, taking away
their negative voice, and with whom the Levellers doctrine is rather countenanced
than puniſhed. And as for their intentions to my Perſon, their changing and putting
more ſtrict Guards upon Me, with the diſcharging moſt of all thoſe ſervants of Mine
whom formerly they willingly admitted to wait upon Me, does ſufficiently declare.
Nor would I have this Retirement miſ-interpreted; for I ſhall earneſtly and unceſſantly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60710:66"/>
endeavour the ſetling of a ſafe and well-grounded Peace where-ever I am or ſhall be,
and that (as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſtian blood: for which
how many times have I deſired, preſt to be heard? and yet no ear given to Me. And
can any reaſonable man think that (according to the ordinary courſe of affairs) there
can be a ſetled Peace without it; or that God will bleſs thoſe who refuſe to hear their
own King? Surely no. Nay I muſt further add, that (beſides what concerns My
ſelf) unleſs all other chief Intereſts have not only a hearing, but likewiſe juſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
given unto them, (to wit, the Presbyterians, Independents, Army, thoſe who
have adhered to Me, and even the <hi>Scots</hi>) I ſay, there cannot (I ſpeak not of Miracles,
it being, in My opinion, a ſinful preſumption in ſuch caſes to expect or truſt to them)
be a ſafe or laſting Peace.</p>
                     <p>Now as I cannot deny but that My Perſonal ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of this My
Retirement; ſo I take God to witneſs that the publick Peace is no leſs before Mine
eyes: and I can find no better way to expreſs this My profeſsion (I know not what
a wiſer may do) than by deſiring and urging that all chief Intereſts may be heard, to
the end each may have juſt ſatisfaction. As for Example, the Army (for the reſt,
though neceſſary, yet I ſuppoſe are not difficult to content) ought (in My Judgment)
to enjoy the Liberty of their Conſciences, have an Act of Oblivion or Indemnity
(which ſhould extend to all the reſt of My Subjects) and that all their Arrears ſhould
be ſpeedily and duly paid; which I will undertake to do, ſo I may be heard, and
that I be not hindred from uſing ſuch lawful and honeſt means as I ſhall chuſe. To
conclude, let Me be heard with Freedom, Honour and Safety, and I ſhall inſtantly
break through this Cloud of Retirement, and ſhew My ſelf really to be <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>

                     <p>HIS Majeſt is confident that before this time His two Houſes of Parliament have
received the Meſſage which He left behind Him at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court the eleventh
of this month, by which they will have underſtood the reaſons which enforced Him
to go from thence, as likewiſe His conſtant endeavours for the ſetling of a ſafe and
well-grounded Peace whereſoever He ſhould be: And being now in a place where He
conceives Himſelf to be at much more Freedom and Security than formerly, He thinks
it neceſſary (not only for making good of His Own profeſſions, but alſo for the ſpeedy
procuring of a Peace in theſe languiſhing and diſtreſſed Kingdoms) at this time to
offer ſuch grounds to His two Houſes for that effect, which upon due examination of
all Intereſts may beſt conduce thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe Religion is the beſt and chiefeſt foundation of Peace, His Majeſty will
begin with that particular.</p>
                     <p>That for the aboliſhing Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. His Majeſty clearly profeſſeth,
that He cannot give His Conſent thereunto, both in relation as He is a Chriſtian, and
a King. For the firſt, He avows that He is ſatisfied in His Judgment that this Order
was placed in the Church by the Apoſtles themſelves, and ever ſince their time hath
continued in all Chriſtian Churches throughout the world until this laſt Century of
years; and in this Church in all times of Change and Reformation it hath been upheld
by the wiſdom of His Anceſtors, as the great preſerver of Doctrine, Diſcipline and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the ſervice of God. As a King at His Coronation, He hath not only taken a
ſolemn Oath to maintain this Order, but His Majeſty and His Predeceſſours in their
confirmations of the Great Charter have inſeparably woven the Right of the Church
into the Liberties of the reſt of the Subjects. And yet He is willing it be provided
that the particular Biſhops perform the ſeveral duties of their Callings, both by their
perſonal Reſidence and frequent Preachings in their Dioceſes, as alſo that they exerciſe
no Act of Juriſdiction or Ordination without the conſent of their Presbyters; and will
conſent that their powers in all things be ſo limited, that they be not grievous to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſciences. Wherefore ſince His Majeſty is willing to give eaſe to the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of others, He ſees no reaſon why He alone and thoſe of His Judgment ſhould be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60710:66"/>
preſſed to a violation of theirs. Nor can His Majeſty conſent to the alienation of
Church-Lands, becauſe it cannot be denied to be a ſin of the higheſt Sacrilege; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that it ſubverts the intentions of ſo many pious Donors, who have laid a heavy
Curſe upon all ſuch profane violations, which His Majeſty is very unwilling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go:
And beſides the matter of Conſcience, His Majeſty believes it to be a prejudice to
the publick good, many of His Subjects having the benefit of renewing Leaſes at much
eaſier Rates than if thoſe poſſeſſions were in the hands of private men: not omitting
the diſcouragement which it will be to all Learning and induſtry when ſuch eminent
rewards ſhall be taken away, which now lye open to the Children of meaneſt perſons.</p>
                     <p>Yet His Majeſty conſidering the great preſent diſtempers concerning Church-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and that the Presbyterian Government is now in practice, His Majeſty, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew
Confuſion as much as may be, and for the ſatisfaction of His two Houſes, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that the ſaid Government be legally permitted to ſtand in the ſame condition it now
is for three years: provided that His Majeſty and thoſe of His Judgment (or any other
who cannot in Conſcience ſubmit thereunto) be not obliged to comply with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Government, but have free practice of their own profeſſion, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any prejudice thereby; and that a free Conſultation and Debate be had with the
Divines at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> (twenty of His Majeſties nomination being added unto them)
whereby it may be determined by His Majeſty and the two Houſes how the Church-government
after the ſaid time ſhall be ſetled, (or ſooner, if differences may be agreed)
as is moſt agreeable to the Word of God, with full liberty to all thoſe who ſhall differ
upon Conſcientious grounds from that ſettlement. Always provided, that nothing
aforeſaid be underſtood to tolerate thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> profeſſion, nor exempting of
any Popiſh Recuſant from the penalties of the Laws, or to tolerate the publick profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Atheiſm or Blaſphemy, contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, <hi>Nicene</hi> and
<hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds, they having been received by and had in reverence of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches, and more particularly by this of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation.</p>
                     <p>Next, the <hi>Militia</hi> being that Right which is inſeparably and undoubtedly inherent
in the Crown by the Laws of this Nation, and that which former Parliaments, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
this, have acknowledged ſo to be, His Majeſty cannot ſo much wrong that truſt
which the Laws of God and this Land have annexed to the Crown for the protection
and ſecurity of His People, as to deveſt Himſelf and Succeſſors of the power of the
Sword: Yet to give an infallible evidence of His deſire to ſecure the performance of ſuch
agreements as ſhall be made in order to a Peace, His Majeſty will conſent to an Act of
Parliament, that the whole power of the <hi>Militia</hi> both by Sea and Land, for and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
His whole Reign, ſhall be ordered and diſpoſed by His two Houſes of Parliament,
or by ſuch perſons as they ſhall appoint, with powers limited for ſuppreſſing of Forces
within this Kingdom to the diſturbance of the publick Peace, and againſt foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions;
and that they ſhall have power during His ſaid Reign to raiſe Monies for the
purpoſes aforeſaid; and that neither His Majeſty that now is or any other (by any
Authority derived only from Him) ſhall execute any of the ſaid powers during His
Majeſties ſaid Reign, but ſuch as ſhall act by the conſent and Approbation of the two
Houſes of Parliament. Nevertheleſs His Majeſty intends that all Patents, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and other Acts concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> be made and acted as formerly; and that
after His Majeſties Reign, all the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhall return entirely to the
Crown, as it was in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory.</p>
                     <p>After this head of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the conſideration of the Arrears due to the Army is
not improper to follow; for the payment whereof, and the eaſe of His People, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is willing to concur in any thing that can be done without the violation of His
Conſcience and Honour. Wherefore if His two Houſes ſhall conſent to remit unto
Him ſuch benefit out of Sequeſtrations from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, and out of Compoſitions
that ſhall be made before the concluding of the Peace, and the Arrears of ſuch as have
been already made, the aſsiſtance of the Clergy, and the Arrears of ſuch Rents of His
own Revenue as His two Houſes ſhall not have received before the concluding of the
Peace, His Majeſty will undertake within the ſpace of eighteen months the payment
of four hundred thouſand pounds for the ſatisfaction of the Army: and if thoſe means
ſhall not be ſufficient, His Majeſty intends to give way to the ſale of Foreſt-Lands for
that purpoſe, this being the publick Debt which in His Majeſties Judgment is firſt to
be ſatisfied. And for other publick Debts already contracted upon Church-Lands
or any other Ingagements, His Majeſty will give His Conſent to ſuch Act or Acts for
raiſing of monies for payment thereof as both Houſes ſhall hereafter agree upon, ſo as
they be equally laid, whereby His People (already too heavily burthened by theſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60710:67"/>
late Diſtempers) may have no more preſſures upon them than this abſolute neceſsity
requires.</p>
                     <p>And for the further ſecuring of all fears, His Majeſty will conſent, that an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
be paſſed for the diſpoſing of the great Offices of State and naming of Privy
Councellors for the whole term of His Reign by the two Houſes of Parliament, their
Patents and Commiſſions being taken from His Majeſty, and after to return to the
Crown, as is expreſſed in the Article of the <hi>Militia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Court of Wards and Liveries, His Majeſty very well knows the conſequence
of taking that away, by turning of all Tenures into common Soccage, as well in point
of Revenue to the Crown, as in the protection of many of His Subjects being Infants.
Nevertheleſs if the continuance thereof ſeem grievous to His Subjects, rather than
He will fail on His part in giving ſatisfaction, He will conſent to an Act for taking
of it away, ſo as a full recompence be ſetled upon His Majeſty and His Succeſſors in
perpetuity, and that the Arrears now due be reſerved unto Him towards the payment
of the Arrears of the Army.</p>
                     <p>And that the memory of theſe late Diſtractions may be wholly wiped away, His
Majeſty will conſent to an Act of Parliament for the ſuppreſſing and making null of
all Oaths, Declarations and Proclamations againſt both or either Houſe of Parliament,
and of all Indictments and other proceedings againſt any perſons for adhering to them:
And His Majeſty propoſeth, (as the beſt expedient to take away all ſeeds of future
Differences) that there be an Act of Oblivion to extend to all His Subjects.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Ceſſation there is long ſince determined; but for the future (all
other things being fully agreed) His Majeſty will give full ſatisfaction to His two
Houſes concerning that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And although His Majeſty cannot conſent in Honour and Juſtice to avoid all His
own Grants and Acts paſt under His great Seal ſince the two and twentieth of <hi>May</hi>
1642, or to the confirming of all the Acts and Grants paſſed under that made by the
two Houſes; yet His Majeſty is confident, that upon peruſal of particulars, He ſhall
give full ſatisfaction to His two Houſes as to what may reaſonably be deſired in that
particular.</p>
                     <p>And now His Majeſty conceives that by theſe His offers (which He is ready to
make good upon the ſettlement of a Peace) He hath clearly manifeſted His intentions
to give full ſecurity and ſatisfaction to all Intereſts, for what can juſtly be deſired in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the future Happineſs of His People: and for the perfecting of theſe Conceſſions,
as alſo for ſuch other things as may be propoſed by the two Houſes, and for ſuch juſt
and reaſonable demands as His Majeſty ſhall find neceſſary to propoſe on His part, He
earneſtly deſires a Perſonal Treaty at <hi>London</hi> with His two Houſes, in Honour, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Safety, it being in His Judgement the moſt proper, and indeed, only means
to a firm and ſettled Peace, and impoſſible without it to reconcile former, or avoid fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Miſunderſtandings.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things being by Treaty perfected, His Majeſty believes His Houſes will
think it reaſonable, that the Propoſals of the Army concerning the Succeſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and their due elections ſhould be taken into conſideration.</p>
                     <p>As for what concerns the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> His Majeſty will very readily apply
Himſelf to give all reaſonable ſatisfaction, when the deſires of the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
on their behalf, or of the Commiſſioners of that Kingdom, or of both joyned
together, ſhall be made known unto Him.</p>

in things of greater concernment than the Peace of this miſerable diſtracted
Kingdom, He would have expected with more patience their leiſure in acknowledging
the receipt of His Meſſage of the 17. of <hi>November</hi> laſt. But ſince there is not in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60710:67"/>
any conſideration preceding to that of Peace, His Majeſty's conſtant tenderneſs of
the welfare of His Subjects hath ſuch a prevalence with Him, that He cannot forbear
the vehement proſecution of a Perſonal Treaty: which is only ſo much the more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by His Majeſty, as it is ſuperior to all other means of Peace. And truly, when
His Majeſty conſiders the ſeveral complaints He daily hears from all parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
That Trade is ſo decayed, all commodites ſo dear, and Taxes ſo inſupportable,
that even natural ſubſiſtence will ſuddenly fail; His Majeſty (to perform the Truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in Him) muſt uſe His uttermoſt endeavours for Peace, though He were to have
no ſhare in the benefit of it. And hath not His Majeſty done His part for it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting
Himſelf of ſo much Power and Authority as by His laſt Meſſage He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to do, upon the concluding of the whole Peace? And hath He met with that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
from His two Houſes which this great Grace and Favour juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves?
Surely the blame of this great retarding of Peace muſt fall ſomewhere elſe

be done, if you the two Houſes will wait on His Majeſty with the ſame reſolutions
for Peace as He will meet you, He no way doubts but that ye will willingly agree to
this His Majeſty's earneſt deſire of a Perſonal Treaty, and ſpeedily deſire His preſence
amongſt you: where all things agreed on being digeſted into Acts (till when it is
moſt unreaſonable for His Majeſty or His two Houſes to deſire each of other the leaſt
conceſſion) this Kingdom may at laſt enjoy the bleſſing of a long-wiſht-for Peace.</p>

                     <p>THE neceſſity of complying with all engaged Intereſts in theſe great Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
for a perfect ſettlement of Peace, His Majeſty finds to be none of the leaſt
difficulties He hath met with ſince the time of His Afflictions. Which is too viſible,
when at the ſame time that the two Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament do preſent to
His Majeſty ſeveral Bills and Propoſitions for His Conſent, the Commiſſioners for
<hi>Scotland</hi> do openly proteſt againſt them. So that, were there nothing in the caſe but
the conſideration of that difference, His Majeſty cannot imagine how to give ſuch an
Anſwer to what is now propoſed, as thereby to promiſe Himſelf His great end, <hi>A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Peace.</hi> And when His Majeſty further conſiders how impoſſible it is (in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
He now ſtands) to fulfil the deſires of the two Houſes, ſince the only ancient
and known ways of paſſing Laws are either by His Majeſty's perſonal aſſent in the
Houſe of Peers, or by Commiſſion under His great Seal of <hi>England:</hi> He cannot but
wonder at ſuch failings in the manner of addreſs which is now made unto Him; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
His two Houſes intend that His Majeſty ſhall allow of a great Seal made without
His Authority, before there be any conſideration had thereupon in a Treaty. Which
as it may hereafter hazard the ſecurity it ſelf, ſo for the preſent it ſeems very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>And though His Majeſty is willing to believe that the intentions of very many in
both Houſes, in ſending theſe Bills before a Treaty, was only to obtain a Truſt from
Him, and not to take any advantage by paſſing them to force other things from Him
which are either againſt His Conſcience or Honour: yet His Majeſty believes it clear
to all underſtandings, that theſe Bills contain (as they are now penned) not only the
deveſting Himſelf of all Soveraignty, and that without poſſibility of recovering it
either to Him or His Succeſſors (except by repeal of thoſe Bills) but alſo the making
His Conceſſions guilty of the greateſt preſſures that can be made upon the Subject, as
in other particulars, ſo by giving an arbitrary and unlimited power to the two Houſes
for ever, to raiſe and levy Forces for Land or Sea ſervice of what perſons (without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or quality) and to what numbers they pleaſe; and likewiſe for the payment
of them, to levy what Moneys, in ſuch ſort and by ſuch ways and means (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
upon the Eſtates of whatſoever perſons) as they ſhall think fit and appoint;
which is utterly inconſiſtent with the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and His
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60710:68"/>
Majeſty's Truſt in protecting them. So that if the major part of both Houſes ſhall
think it neceſſary to put the reſt of the Propoſitions into Bills, His Majeſty leaves all
the World to judge how unſafe it would be for Him to conſent thereunto: and if not,
what a ſtrange condition (after the paſſing of theſe four Bills) His Majeſty and all
His Subjects would be caſt into. And here His Majeſty thinks it not unfit to wiſh His
two Houſes to conſider well the manner of their proceeding; that when His Majeſty
deſires a perſonal Treaty with them for the ſettling of a Peace, they in anſwer propoſe
the very ſubject matter of the moſt eſſential part thereof to be firſt granted. A thing
which will be hardly credible to Poſterity. Wherefore His Majeſty declares,That
neither the deſire of being freed from this tedious and irkſom condition of life His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath ſo long ſuffered, nor the apprehenſion of what may befal Him in caſe His
two Houſes ſhall not afford Him a Perſonal Treaty, ſhall make Him change His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
of not conſenting to any Act till the whole Peace be concluded. Yet then
He intends not only to give juſt and reaſonable ſatisfaction in the particulars preſented
to Him; but alſo to make good all other Conceſſions mentioned in His Meſſage of the
16. of <hi>November</hi> laſt: which He thought would have produced better effects than
what He finds in the Bills and Propoſitions now preſented unto Him.</p>
                     <p>And yet His Majeſty cannot give over, but now again earneſtly preſſeth for a Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Treaty (ſo paſſionately is He affected with the advantages which Peace will bring
to His Majeſty and all his Subjects) of which He will not at all deſpair, (there being
no other viſible way to obtain a well-grounded Peace.) However His Majeſty is very
much at eaſe within Himſelf, for having fulfilled the offices both of a Chriſtian and of
a King; and will patiently wait the good pleaſure of Almighty God, to incline the
hearts of His two Houſes to conſider their King, and to compaſſionate their fellow-Subjects
miſeries.</p>

                     <p>IF the Peace of My Dominions were not much dearer to Me than any particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
whatſoever, I had too much reaſon to take notice of the ſeveral Votes which
paſſed againſt Me, and the ſad condition I have been in now above theſe ſeven months:
But ſince you My two Houſes of Parliament have opened (as it ſeems to He) a fair
beginning to a happy Peace, I ſhall heartily apply My ſelf thereunto; and to that end,
I will as clearly and ſhortly as I may ſet you down thoſe things which I conceive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to this bleſſed work, ſo that We together may remove all impediments that may
hinder a happy concluſion of this Treaty, which with all chearfulneſs I do embrace.</p>
                     <p>And to this wiſhed end your ſelves have laid moſt excellent grounds: For what can
I reaſonably expect more than to Treat with <hi>Honour, Freedom</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> upon ſuch
Propoſitions as you have or ſhall preſent unto He, and ſuch as I ſhall make to you?
But withal remember, that it is the definition, not names, of things which makes them
rightly known; and that without means to perform, no Propoſition can take effect:
Aud truly My preſent condition is ſuch, that I can no more treat than a blind man
judge of colours, or one run a race who hath both his feet faſt tied together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
My firſt neceſſary demand is,</p>
                     <p>That you will recall all ſuch Votes and Orders by which people are frighted from
coming, writing, or ſpeaking freely to Me.</p>
                     <p>Next, That ſuch men of all profeſſions whom I ſhall ſend for, as of neceſſary uſe to
Me in this Treaty, may be admitted to wait upon Me. In a word, that I may be in
the ſame ſtate of freedom I was in when I was laſt at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And indeed leſs
cannot in any reaſonable meaſure make good thoſe offers which you have made Me by
your Votes. For how can I treat with <hi>Honour,</hi> ſo long as people are terrified with
Votes and Orders againſt coming to ſpeak or write to Me? And am I honourably
treated, ſo long as there is none about Me (except a Barber who came now with the
Commiſſioners) that ever I named to wait upon Me? Or with <hi>Freedom,</hi> until I may
call ſuch unto Me of whoſe ſervices I ſhall have uſe in ſo great and difficult a work?
And for <hi>Safety</hi> (I ſpeak not of My Perſon, having no apprehenſion that way) how
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60710:68"/>
can I judge to make a <hi>ſafe</hi> and well-grounded Peace, until I may know (without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe)
the true preſent ſtate of all My Dominions, and particularly of all thoſe whoſe
Intereſts are neceſſarily concerned in the Peace of theſe Kingdoms? Which leads Me
naturally to the laſt neceſſary demand I ſhall make for the bringing of this Treaty to
an happy end, which is,</p>
                     <p>That you alone, or you and I joyntly, do invite the <hi>Scots</hi> to ſend ſome perſons au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by them to treat upon ſuch Propoſitions as they ſhall make; for certainly the
publick and neceſſary Intereſt they have in this great Settlement is ſo clearly plain to all
the world, that I believe no body will deny the neceſſity of their concurrence in this
Treaty in order to durable Peace. Wherefore I will only ſay, that as I am a King of
both Nations, ſo I will yield to none in either Kingdom for being truly and zealouſly
affected for the good and honour of both; My reſolution being, never to be partial
for either to the prejudice of the other.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Place, (becauſe I conceive it to be rather a circumſtantial than real
part of this Treaty, I ſhall not much inſiſt upon it) I name <hi>Newport</hi> in this Iſle: yet
the fervent zeal I have that a ſpeedy end be put to theſe unhappy Diſtractions, doth
force Me earneſtly to deſire you to conſider what a great loſs of time it will be to treat
ſo far from the body of My two Houſes, when every ſmall debate (of which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there will be many) muſt be tranſmitted to <hi>Westminſter</hi> before it be concluded.
And really I think (though to ſome it may ſeem a Paradox) that peoples minds will
be much more apt to ſettle, ſeeing Me treat in or near <hi>London,</hi> than in this Iſle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo long as I am here, it will never be believed by many that I am really ſo free
as before this Treaty begins I expect to be. And ſo I leave and recommend this Point
to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have not only fully accepted of the Treaty which you have propoſed to
Me by your Votes of the third of this Month; but alſo given it all the furtherance
that lies in Me, by demanding the neceſſary means for the effectual performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
All which are ſo neceſſarily implied by, though not particularly mentioned in,
your Votes, as I can no ways doubt of your ready compliance with Me herein. I have
now no more to ſay, but to conjure you by all that is dear to Chriſtians, honeſt men or
good Patriots, that ye will make all the expedition poſſible to begin this happy Work,
by haſtening down your Commiſſioners fully authorized and well inſtructed, and by
enabling Me (as I have ſhewed you) to Treat; praying the God of Peace ſo to bleſs
our endeavours, that all My Dominions may ſpeedily enjoy a ſafe and well-grounded

Month, containing the Names of thoſe who are to Treat with Me; and
though they do not come at the time appoint, I ſhall not wonder, at firſt judging it
too ſhort in reſpect of My two Houſes, not of My ſelf, ſo that I did not imagine it
could be kept, (as I then commanded Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew</hi> to tell you by word of mouth:)
and therefore it ſhall be far from Me to take exceptions for their having elapſed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time, for God forbid that either My two Houſes or I ſhould carp at Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to give the leaſt impediment to this Treaty, much leſs to hinder the happy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of it. I ſay this the rather, becauſe I know not how it is poſſible (in this I
ſhall wiſh to be deceived) that in forty days Treaty the many Diſtractions of theſe
Kingdoms can be ſetled; and if ſo, it were more than ſtrange that time enough ſhould not
be given for the perfecting of this moſt great and good Work, which as I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

                     <head>XXXVIII. From NEWPORT, <date>Sept. 29. MDCXLVIII.</date>
Containing His Conceſſions.</head>
                     <p>HIS Majeſty did uſe many earneſt endeavours for a Perſonal Treaty, which He
hoped might have been obtained at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> between Him and His two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament immediately; yet they having made choice of this way by you their
Commiſſioners, His Majeſty did gladly and chearfully accept thereof in this place, as
a fit means to begin a Treaty for Peace, which might put an end to His own ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and the Miſeries of His Kingdom: For an entrance whereunto, His Majeſty
hath already expreſſed His conſent to the Firſt Propoſition. But finding you are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by Inſtructions which you have no warrant to communicate unto Him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cauſe by your Paper of the twentieth of this preſent to believe that you have no
power to omit or alter any thing; though He ſhall give you ſuch reaſons as may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you ſo to do, without tranſmitting the Papers to the two Houſes at a far diſtance,
where His Majeſties reaſons, expreſſions, and offers upon debate cannot be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
and from whence their Anſwers cannot be returned without much waſte
of the time allotted for the Treaty here; and having lately received another Paper
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60710:69"/>
concerning the Church, containing in it ſelf many particulars of great importance, and
referring to divers Ordinances, Articles of Religion, and other things (eleven or twelve
in number) of great length, and ſome of them very new, and never before preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to His Majeſty, the due conſideration whereof will take up much time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
His Majeſties preſence with His two Houſes before a full reſolution can well be
had in matters of ſo high conſequence: To the end therefore that the good Work
now in hand may (by God's bleſſing) proceed more ſpeedily and effectually to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
concluſion, and that His two Houſes of Parliament may at preſent have further ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
and an earneſt of future ſatisfaction, His Majeſty, upon conſideration had of
yours, makes theſe Propoſitions following.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Church, His Majeſty will conſent that the calling and ſitting of the
Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> be confirmed for three years by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And will by Act of Parliament confirm for three years the <hi>Directory</hi> for the publick
Worſhip of God in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And will likewiſe confirm for three years by Act of Parliament the Form of Church-Government
which ye have preſented to Him, to be uſed for the Churches of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales:</hi> Provided that His Majeſty and thoſe of His
Judgment, or any others who cannot in Conſcience ſubmit thereunto, be not in the
mean time obliged to comply with the ſame Government or Form of Worſhip, but
have free practice of their own profeſſion. And that a free conſultation and debate be
had with the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the mean time (twenty of His
Majeſties nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by His
Majeſty and His two Houſes of Parliament, how the ſaid Church-Government and
Form of Publick Worſhip after the ſaid time may be ſetled, or ſooner, if Differences
may be agreed: and how alſo Reformation of Religion may be ſetled within the
Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi> And the Articles of
Chriſtian Religion now delivered to Him may in like manner be then conſidered of
and determined, and care taken for the eaſe of tender Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the Biſhops Lands and Revenues, His Majeſty conſidering that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe troubleſom times divers of His Subjects have made contracts and purchaces,
and divers have disburſed great ſumms of moneys upon ſecurity and engagement of
thoſe Lands; His Majeſty, for their ſatisfaction, will conſent to an Act or Acts of
Parliament, whereby legal eſtates for lives or for years (at their choice,) not exceeding
99 years ſhall be made of thoſe Lands towards the ſatisfaction of the ſaid Purchaſers,
Contractors, and others to whom they are engaged, at the old Rents, or ſome other
moderate Rent, whereby they may receive ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>And in caſe ſuch Leaſes ſhall not ſatisfie, His Majeſty will propound and conſent to
ſome other way for their further ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Provided that the propriety and inheritance of thoſe Lands may ſtill remain and
continue to the Church and Church-men reſpectively, according to the pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Donors and Founders thereof: and the rent that ſhall be reſerved to be for
their maintenance.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will give his Royal aſſent for the better obſervation of the Lord's day,
for ſuppreſſing of Innovations in Churches and Chappels in and about the Worſhip of
God, and for the better advancement of the Preaching of God's Holy Word in all parts
of this Kingdom; and to an Act againſt enjoying pluralities of Benefices by Spiritual
perſons, and Non-reſidency; and to an Act for regulating and Reforming both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
and the Colledges of <hi>Weſtminſter, Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Eaton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will conſent to an Act for the better diſcovery and ſpeedy conviction of
Popiſh Recuſants, as is deſired in your Propoſitions; and alſo to an Act for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                     <p>As alſo to an Act for the true levying of the penalties againſt Papiſts, to be levied
and diſpoſed in ſuch manner as both Houſes ſhall agree on, and as is propoſed on His
Majeſties behalf.</p>
                     <p>As alſo to an Act to prevent the practices of Papiſts againſt the State, and for putting
the Laws in Execution; and for a ſtricter courſe to prevent hearing and ſaying of Maſs.</p>
                     <p>But as to the Covenant, His Majeſty is not yet therein ſatisfied, that He can either
ſign or ſwear it, or conſent to impoſe it on the Conſciences of others: nor doth He
conceive it proper or uſeful at this time to be inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> His Majeſty conceives that your Propoſition demands a far
larger power over the perſons and eſtates of His Subjects than hath ever hitherto
been warranted by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm: Yet conſidering the preſent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60710:70"/>
Diſtractions require more, and truſting in His two Houſes of Parliament that they will
make no further uſe of the power therein mentioned, after the preſent Diſtempers ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
than ſhall be agreeable to the legal exerciſe thereof in times paſt, or juſt neceſſity
ſhall require, His Majeſty will conſent to an Act of Parliament,</p>
                     <p>That the Lords and Commons in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> now aſſembled, or
hereafter to be aſſembled, or ſuch as they ſhall appoint, during the ſpace of ten years,
ſhall arm, train and diſcipline, or cauſe to be armed, trained or diſciplined, all the
Forces of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Iſles of
<hi>Gerneſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> already raiſed both for Sea

any other Forces for Land and Sea ſervice in the Kingdoms, Dominions and places afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
as in their judgments they ſhall from time to time during the ſaid ſpaceof ten years
think fit to appoint; and that neither the King, His Heirs or Succeſſors, or any other but
ſuch as ſhall Act by the Authority or approbation of the ſaid Lords and Commons,
ſhall during the ſaid ſpace of ten years exerciſe any of the powers aforeſaid:</p>
                     <p>That Monies be raiſed and levied for the maintenance and uſe of the ſaid Forces for
Land-ſervice, and of the Navy and Forces for Sea-ſervice, in ſuch ſort and by ſuch
ways and means as the ſaid Lords and Commons ſhall from time to time during the
ſaid ſpace of ten years think fit and appoint, and not otherwiſe:</p>
                     <p>That all the ſaid Forces both for Land and Sea-ſervice, ſo raiſed or levied, or to be
raiſed or levied, and alſo the Admiralty and Navy, ſhall from time to time during the
ſaid ſpace of ten years be imployed, managed, ordered and diſpoſed by the Lords and
Commons in ſuch ſort and by ſuch ways and means as they ſhall think fit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
and not otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid Lords and Commons, or ſuch as they ſhall appoint, during the ſaid
ſpace of ten years ſhall have power,</p>
                     <p>1. To ſuppreſs all Forces raiſed or to be raiſed without authority and conſent of the
ſaid Lords and Commons, to the diſturbance of the publick Peace of the Kingdoms of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Gerneſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and the Town
of <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> or any of them.</p>
                     <p>2. To ſuppreſs any foreign Forces who ſhall invade or indeavour to invade the
Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Gerneſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi>
and the Town of <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> or any of them.</p>
                     <p>And after the expiration of the ſaid ten years, neither the King, His Heirs or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
or any perſon or perſons by colour or pretence of any Commiſſion, power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
or authority to be derived from the King, His Heirs or Succeſſors, or any of
them, ſhall without the conſent of the ſaid Lords and Commons raiſe, arm, train, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
imploy, order, manage, disband, or diſpoſe any the Forces by Sea or Land, of
the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> Iſles of <hi>Gerneſey</hi> and
<hi>Jerſey,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed;</hi> nor exerciſe any of the ſaid powers or
authorities herein before-mentioned, and expreſſed to be during the ſpace of ten years
in the ſaid Lords and Commons; nor do any act or any thing concerning the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſaid powers or authorities, or any of them, without the conſent of the ſaid
Lords and Commons firſt had and obtained:</p>
                     <p>And with the ſame Proviſoes for ſaving the ordinary legal power of Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
not being Military Officers, as is ſet down in your Propoſitions:</p>
                     <p>and with a Declaration, That if any perſons ſhall be gathered and aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a warlike manner or otherwiſe, to the number of thirty perſons, and ſhall not
forthwith diſperſe themſelves, being required thereto by the ſaid Lords and Commons,
or command from them, or any by them eſpecially authorized for that purpoſe, then
ſuch perſon or perſons not ſo diſperſing themſelves ſhall be guilty, and incur the pains
of high Treaſon, being firſt declared guilty of ſuch offence by the ſaid Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
any Commiſſion under the Great Seal or other Warrant to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding:
and he or they that ſhall ſo offend herein to be uncapable of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
from His Majeſty, His Heirs or Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe that it be provided that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall have and enjoy all
their Rights, Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in raiſing and imploying the Forces of that City in ſuch
ſort as is mentioned in the ſaid Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>With theſe Proviſoes following to be inſerted in the ſaid Act.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That none be compelled to ſerve in the War againſt their Wills, but in caſe
of coming in of ſtrange Enemies into this Kingdom.</p>

                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60710:70"/>
And that the powers above-mentioned as concerning the Land-Forces, other than
for keeping up and maintenance of Forts and Garriſons, and the keeping up, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
and pay of this preſent Army ſo long as it ſhall be thought fit by both Houſes
of Parliament, be exerciſed to no other purpoſes than for the ſuppreſſing of Forces raiſed
or to be raiſed without authority and conſent of the ſaid Lords and Commons as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
or for ſuppreſſing of any Foreign Forces which ſhall invade or endeavour to invade
the Kingdoms, Dominions or places aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>And that the Monies be raiſed by general and equal Taxations, ſaving that Tunnage
and Poundage, and ſuch Impoſts as have been applyed to the Navy, be raiſed as hath
been uſual.</p>
                     <p>And that all Patents, Commiſſions and other Acts concerning the premiſſes be made and
acted in His Majeſties name by Warrant, ſignified by the Lords and Commons, or ſuch
others as they ſhall authorize for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall be more ſatisfactory to His two Houſes to have the <hi>Militia</hi> and powers
thereupon depending during the whole time of His Majeſty's Reign, rather than for the
ſpace of ten years, His Majeſty gives them the election.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majeſty having in the two preceding Propoſitions given His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
concerning the Church and the <hi>Militia</hi> there in all things as in <hi>England;</hi> as to all other
matters relating to that Kingdom, after advice with His two Houſes, He will leave it to their
determination, and give His conſent accordingly, as is herein hereafter expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Touching publick Debts, His Majeſty will give His conſent to ſuch an Act for raiſing of
Monies by general and equal Taxations, for the payment and ſatisfying the Arrears of the
Army, publick Debts and engagements of the Kingdom, as ſhall be agreed on by both Houſes
of Parliament, and ſhall be audited and aſcertained by them, or ſuch perſons as they ſhall
appoint, within the ſpace of twelve Months after the paſſing of an Act for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will conſent to an Act, that during the ſaid ſpace of ten years the Lord
Chancellour, or Lord Keeper, Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, or Treaſury, Lord Warden
of the Cinque-ports, Chancellour of the Exchequer and Dutchy, Secretaries of State, Maſter

by both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to continue <hi>quam diu ſe bene geſſerint;</hi> and in
the intervals of Parliament, by ſuch others as they ſhall authorize for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will conſent that the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof,
during the ſpace of ten years, may be in the ordering and Government of the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Commons in the Common Council aſſembled, or ſuch as they ſhall from
time to time appoint (whereof the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs for the time being to be three)
to be imployed and directed from time to time, during the ſaid ſpace of ten years, in
ſuch manner as ſhall be agreed upon and appointed by both Houſes of Parliament; and
that no Citizen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> nor any of the Officers of the ſaid City, ſhall be

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>M I thus laid aſide? and muſt I not ſpeak for My ſelf? No:
I will ſpeak, and that to all My People, (which I would have
rather done by the way of My two Houſes of Parliament, but
that there is a publick Order, neither to make Addreſſes to, or
receive Meſſages from Me.) And who but you can be judge of
the differences betwixt Me and My two Houſes? I know none
elſe: for I am ſure you it is who will enjoy the Happineſs, or
feel the Miſery of good or ill Government; and we all pretend
who ſhould run faſteſt to ſerve you, without having a regard
(at leaſt in the firſt place) to particular Intereſts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I deſire you to conſider the ſtate I am and have been in this long time, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
My Actions have more tended to the Publick or My own particular good. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
will look upon Me barely as I am a Man, without that liberty (which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of My Subjects enjoys) of going whither and converſing with whom I will; as a
Husband and Father, without the comfort of My Wife and Children; or laſtly as a King,
without the leaſt ſhew of Authority or Power to protect My diſtreſſed Subjects; muſt
conclude Me not onely void of all Natural Affection, but alſo to want common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
if I ſhould not moſt cheerfully embrace the readieſt way to the ſettlement of
theſe diſtracted Kingdoms. As alſo on the other ſide, do but conſider the form and draught
of the Bills lately preſented unto Me, and as they are the Conditions of a Treaty, ye will
conclude, that the ſame Spirit which hath ſtill been able to fruſtrate all My ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
endeavours for Peace, hath had a powerful influence on this Meſſage: For though I
was ready to grant the ſubſtance, and comply with what they ſeem to deſire; yet as
they had framed it, I could not agree thereunto, without deeply wounding My Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Honour, and betraying the Truſt repoſed in Me, by abandoning My People to
the Arbitrary and Unlimited Power of the two Houſes for ever, for the levying and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Land or Sea Forces, without diſtinction of quality or limitation for Money-Taxes.
And if I could have paſſed them in terms, how unheard-of a Condition were
it for a Treaty to grant beforehand the moſt conſiderable part of the ſubject matter? How
ineffectual were that Debate like to prove, wherein the moſt potent Party had nothing
of moment left to ask, and the other nothing more to give? ſo, conſequently, how hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of mutual compliance? without which a ſettlement is impoſſible. Beſides, if after
My Conceſſions the two Houſes ſhould inſiſt on thoſe things from which I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
how deſperate would the condition of theſe Kingdoms be, when the moſt proper
and approved remedy ſhould become ineffectual? Being therefore fully reſolved that I
could neither in Conſcience, Honour or Prudence, paſs thoſe four Bills; I onely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make the Reaſons and Juſtice of my Denial appear to all the World, as they do
to me, intending to give as little diſ-ſatisfaction to the two Houſes of Parliament (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
betraying My own Cauſe) as the matter would bear: I was deſirous to give My
Anſwer of the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> laſt to the Commiſſioners ſealed, (as I had done others
heretofore, and ſometimes at the deſire of the Commiſſioners) chiefly, becauſe when My
Meſſages or Anſwers were publickly known before they were read in the Houſes, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
interpretations were forced on them, much differing, and ſometimes contrary to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60710:71"/>
My meaning. For example, My Anſwer from <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court was accuſed of dividing
the two Nations, becauſe I promiſed to give ſatisfaction to the <hi>Scots</hi> in all things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that Kingdom: And this laſt ſuffers in a contrary ſenſe, by making Me intend to
intereſt <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Laws of this Kingdom (than which nothing was, nor is, further
from my thoughts) becauſe I took notice of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners proteſting againſt
the Bills and Propoſitions, as contrary to the Intereſts and Engagements of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
Indeed, if I had not mentioned their diſſent, an Objection, not without ſome
probability, might have been made againſt Me, both in reſpect the <hi>Scots</hi> are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Bill for the <hi>Militia,</hi> and in ſeveral other Propoſitions; and My ſilence
might, with ſome Juſtice, have ſeemed to approve of it: But the Commiſſioners refuſing
to receive My Anſwer ſealed, I (upon the engagement of their and the Governor's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that no other uſe ſhould be made or notice taken of it than as if it had not been
ſeen) read and delivered it open unto them; whereupon what hath ſince paſſed, either
by the Governour, in diſcharging moſt of My Servants, redoubling the Guards, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
Me of My former Liberty, (and all this, as himſelf confeſs'd, merely out of his
own diſlike of My Anſwer, notwithſtanding his beforeſaid Engagement) or afterwards
by the two Houſes, (as the Governour affirms) in confining Me within the Circuit of
this Caſtle, I appeal to God and the World, whether My ſaid Anſwer deſerved the reply
of ſuch proceedings; beſides the unlawfulneſs for Subjects to impriſon their King. That
by the permiſſion of Almighty God I am reduced to this ſad condition, as I no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine;
ſo I am not without hope, but that the ſame God will in due time convert theſe
Afflictions into My advantage. In the mean time, I am confident to bear theſe croſſes
with Patience, and a great Equality of Mind. But by what means or occaſion I am
come to this Relapſe in My Affairs, I am utterly to ſeek; eſpecially when I conſider, that
I have ſacrificed to My two Houſes of Parliament, for the Peace of the Kingdome, all but
what is much more dear to Me than My life, My Conſcience and Honour; deſiring nothing
more than to perform it in the moſt proper and natural way, a Perſonal Treaty. But that
which makes Me moſt at a loſs is, the remembring My ſignal compliance with the Army
and their Intereſts: and of what importance My compliance was to them, and their often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repeated
Profeſſions and Engagements for My juſt Rights in general, at <hi>Newmarket</hi> and
S. <hi>Albans,</hi> and their particular explanation of thoſe Generals by their voted, and re-voted
Propoſals, which I had reaſon to underſtand ſhould be the utmoſt extremity would be
expected from Me, and that in ſome things therein I ſhould be eaſed; (herein appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Conſciences of ſome of the chiefeſt Officers in the Army, if what I have ſaid be
not punctually true) and how I have failed of their expectations, or My profeſſions to
them, I challenge them and the whole World to produce the leaſt colour of Reaſon. And
now I would know what it is that is deſired. Is it Peace? I have ſhewed the way, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both willing and deſirous to perform My part in it) which is, a juſt compliance with
all chief Intereſts. Is it Plenty and Happineſs? They are the inſeparable effects of Peace.
Is it Security? I, who wiſh that all Men would forgive and forget like Me, have offered
the <hi>Militia</hi> for My time. Is it Liberty of Conſcience? He who wants it is moſt ready to
give it. Is it the right adminiſtration of Juſtice? Officers of truſt are committed to the
choice of My two Houſes of Parliament. Is it frequent Parliaments? I have legally, fully
concurr'd therewith. Is it the Arrears of the Army? Upon a ſettlement they will certainly
be payed with much eaſe, but before there will be found much difficulty, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
in it.</p>
                     <p>Thus all the World cannot but ſee my reall and unwearied endeavours for Peace, the
which (by the grace of God) I ſhall neither repent Me of nor ever be ſlackned in, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
My paſt, preſent, or future ſufferings: but if I may not be heard, let every one
judge who it is that obſtructs the good I would or might do. What is it that Men are afraid
to hear from Me? It cannot be Reaſon, (at leaſt, none will declare themſelves ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
as to confeſs it:) and it can leſs be impertinent or unreaſonable Diſcourſes; for
thereby, peradventure, I might more juſtifie this My Reſtraint than the cauſers themſelves
can do: ſo that of all wonders yet this is the greateſt to Me. But it may be eaſily gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how thoſe men intend to govern who have uſed Me thus. And if it be My hard Fate
to fall together with the Liberty of this Kingdom, I ſhall not bluſh for My ſelf, but much
lament the future Miſeries of My People, the which I ſhall ſtill pray to God to avert,
whatever becomes of Me.</p>

                     <head>II. An Anſwer to a Pamphlet entitled, A Declaration of the Commons of England in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
aſſembled, expreſſing their Reaſons and Grounds of paſſing the late Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
touching no farther Addreſs or Application to be made to the KING.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Publiſhed by His Majeſtie's appointment.</head>
                     <p>I Believe that it was never heard of until now, that heavy Imputations were laid on
any man (I ſpeak not now of Kings, which I confeſs makes the caſe yet more ſtrange
and unjuſt) and He not permitted to ſee, much leſs to anſwer them: but ſo it is now
with the King; which does (though ſilently, yet) ſubject Him to as great an Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as there is any in the ſaid Declaration; for thoſe who know no better, may think that
He cannot, becauſe He does not, anſwer it. Wherefore I hold it my Duty (knowing
theſe things better than every ordinary man) to do my beſt that the King ſhould not be
injured by the Ignorance of His People: and albeit I (lying under Perſecution for My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and love to Regal Authority) have not the means in every thing to make full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations;
yet I am confident in all the moſt material Points ſo to make the truth of the
King's Innocency appear, that I ſhall ſatisfie any impartial judicious Reader.</p>
                     <p>What the Iſſue of former Addreſſes to the King hath been is moſt certainly known to
all the World; but where the fault reſts whereby Peace hath not enſued, bare Aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without Proofs cannot, I am ſure, ſatisfie any judicious Reader. And indeed, it ſeems
to me that the Penner of theſe ſeeks more to take the ears of the ignorant Multitude with
big words and bold Aſſertions, than to ſatisfie Rational men with real proofs or true Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For at the very firſt he begs the Queſtion, taking it for granted that the King could
eaſe the <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Groans,</hi> dry the <hi>Tears,</hi> and ſtanch the <hi>Blood</hi> of His diſtreſſed Subjects.
Alas! Is it He that keeps Armies on foot when there is none to oppoſe? Is it He that will
not lay down Exciſe, Taxations and Free-quarterings? But it is He indeed who was ſo
far from Power, even at that time, (being far worſe ſince) that in moſt things He wanted
the Liberty of any free-born man: It is He who never refuſed to eaſe His People of their
Grievances; witneſs more Acts of Grace paſſed in His Reign than (to ſpeak within my
compaſs) in any five Kings or Queens Times that ever were before Him: Moreover it is
He who, to ſettle the preſent unhappy Diſtractions, and (as the beſt means to it) to obtain
a Perſonal Treaty, hath offered ſo much, that (to ſay truth) during His own time He hath
left Himſelf little more than the <hi>Title</hi> of a King; as it plainly appears by His Meſſage from
the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> and chuſing the Officers of State and Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours,
beſides other points of Compliance, which it is needleſs here to mention.</p>
                     <p>Good God! are theſe <hi>Offers unfit for them to receive?</hi> Have they <hi>tendred ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that might occaſion the World to judge that they have yielded up not only their Wills and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but their Reaſons alſo and Judgments, for obtaining a true Peace or good Accommodation?</hi>
It is true, that if they can ſhew what reaſonably they could have asked more, or wherein
the King's Offers were deficient (either in Point of Security, or by with-holding from any
His Subjects a jot of their juſt Priviledges) then they ſaid ſomewhat to challenge Belief:
But bare Aſſeverations, even againſt what a Man ſees, will not get credit with any but
ſuch who abandon their Judgments to an implicite Faith: nor can the Determinations of
all the Parliaments in the World make a thing Juſt or Neceſſary, if it be not ſo of it ſelf.
And can it be imagined, that any who were ever acquainted with the Paſſages at the
Treaties of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Vxbridge</hi> will believe (though it be ſaid) that <hi>the Propoſitions tendred
at</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>were the ſame in effect which had been preſented to the King before, in the midſt of
all His ſtrength and Forces?</hi> Indeed methinks ſuch groſs ſlips as theſe ſhould at leaſt make
a man be wary how to believe ſuch things for which He ſees no Proofs: And yet it ſhould
ſeem that a man muſt either take their words for good payment, or remain unſatisfied; for
a little after it is ſaid, <hi>that the Kings ſtrange, unexpected and conditional Anſwers or Denials
might juſtly have made them conſider ſome other courſe for ſetling the Kingdom in Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without any farther Application;</hi> but never ſhewn wherein the ſtrangeneſs of His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
or Denials conſiſts. And I ſhould think that thoſe Reaſons upon which the laying by
of a King's Authority is grounded (for it is no leſs) ought to be particularly mentioned for
the Worlds ſatisfaction, and not involved in general big words: for it thereby ſeems that it
is their force of Arms, more than that of Reaſon which they truſt to, for procuring of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Determinations, or belief to what they ſay: Otherways can it be imagined
that their ſaying, that <hi>their laſt Propoſitions were ſo qualified, that (where it might ſtand with
the publick Safety) the wonted Scruples and Objections were prevented or removed,</hi> can give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to any rational man, who hath ſeen all their former Propoſitions? for it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that their Demands have always encreaſed with their good Fortune.</p>
                     <p>And for their great Condeſcenſion to a <hi>Perſonal Treaty</hi> (which, under favour, can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60710:72"/>
be called ſo; for the King, though He had granted what was deſired, was not to come
either to or near <hi>London,</hi> but to ſtay in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and there to Treat with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners)
upon ſigning the Four Bills; ſurely they incurred therein but little danger:
for it is moſt evident that they contain the very ſubſtance of the moſt eſſential parts of
their Demands; which being once granted, the King would neither have had power to
deny, nor any thing left worth the refuſing: for after He had confeſſed that He had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up Arms to invade the Liberty of His People, (whereas it was only for the Defence
of His own Rights) and had likewiſe condemned all thoſe who had faithfully ſerved Him,
of Rebellion; and that He had totally deveſted Himſelf, His Heirs and Succeſſors for ever,
of the power of the Sword, whereby the Protection of His Subjects (which is one of the
moſt eſſential and neceſſary Rights belonging to Regal Authority) is totally torn away
from the Crown; and that by a ſilent Confeſſion He had done Himſelf and Succeſſors an
irreparable prejudice concerning the great Seal (I ſpeak not of the other two Bills, neither
of which are of little importance) what was there more for Him to grant (worth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
upon) after ſuch Conceſſions? or, indeed, what power was left Him to deny any
thing? So that the King's neceſſity of giving the Anſwer He did (for it was no abſolute
Refuſal) is moſt evident; unleſs He had reſolved to have lived in quiet without Honour,
and to have given His People Peace without Safety, by abandoning them to an arbitrary
and unlimited power of the two Houſes for ever, concerning the levying of Land or Sea-Forces,
without ſtinting of numbers or diſtinction of perſons; and for Payments, to levy
ſuch ſummes of Monies, in ſuch ſort and by ſuch ways and means, as they ſhall think fit
and appoint. And now I cannot but ask, is this the <hi>Militia</hi> that the King contends for? or
did ever any King of <hi>England</hi> pretend to or ſeek for ſuch a Power? ſurely no; but this is
a new <hi>Militia:</hi> and take heed leſt this ſhould prove like the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetorian Cohorts,
that what they did in chuſing and changing Emperours, theſe do not to this Government,
by moulding and altering it according to their Fancies. Now my eagerneſs to clear this
Point concerning the four Bills had almoſt made me forget a moſt material Queſtion. I
wonder much wherein the <hi>Danger</hi> conſiſts of a <hi>Perſonal Treaty</hi> with the King ever ſince
He was laſt at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> Surely He cannot bring Forces along with Him to awe His two
Houſes of Parliament; and it is as well known that He hath not Money to raiſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and truly there is as little fear that the Eloquence of His Tongue ſhould work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
but on the contrary if He were ſo ill a man as you deſcribe Him to be, whatſoever
He ſhall ſay or write muſt more prejudice Him than You: for let Him never flatter Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it muſt be clear, not doubtful, Reaſon that can prevail againſt that great viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Power which now oppoſes Him; nor do I ſay it will, but certainly leſs cannot
do it. Where is then the <hi>Danger?</hi> Believe it, Reaſon will hardly maintain thoſe who
are afraid of her.</p>
                     <p>After this it is ſaid, that <hi>they had cauſe enough to remember that the King ſometimes denied
to receive their humble Petitions:</hi> but they neither tell where nor when; which I am
moſt confident they cannot: but I am certain that the King hath ſent divers Meſſages of
Peace to them, unto which He hath yet had no Anſwer; namely, His laſt from <hi>Oxford,</hi>
of the 15. <hi>January</hi> 1645. and all the reſt ſince. As for the Fight at <hi>Brainford,</hi> whoſoever
will read the Collection of the Declarations in print upon that ſubject, will clearly find
that the King hath more reaſon to complain, that they under colour of Treaty ſought to
environ Him with their Forces, than they for what He then did: and His retreat was
neither for Fear nor with Shame; for the appearing of the Enemy made Him retard,
not haſten His orders for retiring, which divers hours before their appearing He had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
which He did without any loſs at all, but (on the contrary) retreated with more
Arms, eleven Colours, and fifteen pieces of Ordnance (beſide good ſtore of Ammunition)
than He had before. And for Cruelty, there was not a drop of Blood ſhed but in the
heat of the Fight, for I ſaw above five hundred Priſoners who (only promiſing <hi>never
after to bear Arms against the King</hi>) were freely releaſed.</p>
                     <p>Again, they ſeem to have good Memories, ſaying, that <hi>the King once ſent them a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Meſſage of renewing a Treaty, when at the ſame time His Meſſenger was inſtructed how to
manage that bloody Maſſacre in</hi> London, <hi>which was then deſign'd by virtue of the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſince publiſhed.</hi> And hath the King ſent but one Meſſage for the renewing of a
Treaty? Then what was that from <hi>Taveſtock</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1644. and<note n="*" place="margin">5, 15, 26, 29. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 84 15. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1645.</note>
 five others from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
the next year? But indeed this that is here mentioned they knew not how to anſwer
(for at that time they knew not the way of ſilence) but by this forged Accuſation againſt
the Meſſenger; who, I dare ſay, knew nothing of that which might have been (at that
time) intended for the King's ſervice by ſome who had more Zeal than Judgment. But
that there was a <hi>Maſſacre</hi> intended, or that any <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the King ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſuch a Deſign, is a moſt notorious Slander. As for the King's mentioned Letter to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60710:73"/>
the Queen, I am confident that any judicious Reader will find the Gloſs made upon it very
much wreſted. And certainly after-Ages will think theſe Times very barbarous, wherein
private Letters betwixt Man and Wife are publiſhed to open view: and in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
there is ſuch reſpect carried to private Letters of Princes, that (to my knowledge)
the laſt Emperour, in the greateſt heat of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> War, having intercepted a Packet
wherein were private Letters to King JAMES of bleſſed Memory (who was then known
no great Friend to the Emperour) from His only Daughter, then avowedly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
greateſt Enemy; yet He ſent them to the King, without the leaſt offer of violence
to the Seals.</p>
                     <p>And now I come to their Determination upon the whole matter, what Courſe they
have reſolved to take with the King: their words are, <hi>But notwithſtanding this and other
former Tenders, we have now received ſuch a Denial, that we are in Deſpair of any good by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to the King; neither must we be ſo injurious to the People in further delaying their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
as any more to preſs His Conſent to theſe or any other Propoſitions.</hi> Beſides, it is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed
upon the Queſtion, That they will receive no more any Meſſage from the King;</hi> and do
enjoyn, <hi>That no perſons do preſume to receive or bring any Meſſage from the King to both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Houſes of Parliament, or to any other perſon.</hi> Thus you ſee that the King is laid by:
but that is not all; for He muſt neither juſtifie His Innocency againſt Calumny, nor is
there any way left Him to mend any Errour that He may have committed. Is this a
Juſt way of proceeding, when Truth, though offered, muſt not be heard, and that no way
muſt be left to recant an Errour? And why all this Severity? Becauſe (as I have already
ſhewn you) the King will not injure His Conſcience or Honour, nor ſuffer His People to
be oppreſſed; to which they give the Term of <hi>ſuch a Denial,</hi> though really it was none.
But ſince they thus ſeek to hoodwink the People, it is no great Wonder that they forbid
the King to repent Him of thoſe Faults which He never committed: and I believe all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
men will eaſily judge of the King's Innocency even by their way of accuſation:
for thoſe who will lay ſuch high Crimes to His charge, as the <hi>breach of Oaths, Vows, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations</hi>
and <hi>Imprecations,</hi> would not ſpare to bring their Proofs if they had any. But on
the contrary it is known to all the World, that He had not ſuffer'd as He has done, if He
would have diſpenſed with that part of His <hi>Coronation-Oath</hi> which He made to the <hi>Clergy;</hi>
which is no great ſign that He makes ſlight of His Engagements: of which it is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
known that He has been ſo Religiouſly careful, as I hold it a wrong to His Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to ſeek to clear Him of ſuch Slanders for which there are no Proofs alledged; for
Malice being once detected, is beſt anſwered with Neglect and Silence. And was there
ever greater or more apparent Malice, than to offer to put the horrid ſlander of Parricide
upon Him, who was eminently known to be as obedient and loving a Son to His bleſſed
Father as any Hiſtory can make mention of? But indeed the loſs of <hi>Rochel</hi> doth fitly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
to ſhew how Malice, when it is at the height, is ordinarily accompanied: for there
are none but ignorant or forgetful men, who know not that it was merely the want of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
from the Two Houſes of Parliament (contrary to their Publick General Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that loſt <hi>Rochel;</hi> and there is nothing more clear (to any who hath known French
Occurrences) than that real Aſſiſtance, which the King, to the uttermoſt of His Power,
gave to thoſe of the <hi>Religion</hi> at that time, made the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> an irreconcileable
enemy to the King. Wherefore I cannot but ſay, that it is a ſtrange forgetful Boldneſs
to charge the King with that which was evidently other mens faults.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo other things that to any knowing man will rather ſeem Jeers than Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations;
as the <hi>German Horſe,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Fleet</hi> in the year 1639. But my Affection ſhall
not ſo blind me, as to ſay that the King never erred; yet, as when a juſt Debt is paid,
Bonds ought to be cancell'd; ſo Grievances, be they never ſo juſt, being once redreſſed,
ought no more to be objected as Errours. And it is no Paradox to affirm, that Truths
this way told are no better than Slanders: and ſuch are the Catalogue of Grievances here
enumerated; which when they are well examined, every one of them, will not be found
ſuch as here they are deſcribed to be.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning thoſe Diſcourſes which mention the beginnings of theſe Troubles,
(which are in Two ſeveral places of this Declaration) I will only ſay this, that what the
King did upon thoſe Occaſions, was merely to defend the Rights of His Crown, which
were and are evidently ſought to be torn from Him. Nor can I acknowledge all thoſe
Relations to be true, ſuch as <hi>Private Levies of men by Popiſh Agents, Arming of Papiſts in the
North, Calling in of Daniſh Forces,</hi> and the like: And as for the ſtale Slander of <hi>calling up
the Northern Army,</hi> now renewed, it is well known that the Two Houſes (even at that
time) were not ſo partial to the King, as to have conceal'd a Practice of that kind, if they
could have got it ſufficiently proved.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion</hi> can be juſtly charged upon the King, then I ſhall not blame any
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60710:73"/>
for believing all the reſt of the Allegations againſt Him: only I proteſt againſt all <hi>Rebels</hi>
Teſtimony as good Proof; it being moſt certain by experience, that they who make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of Rebelling, will make leſs of Lying when it is for their Advantage. And it is no
little wonder that ſo grave an Aſſembly as the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> ſhould ſo ſlightly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a Buſineſs of that Great Weight, as to alledg that the <hi>Scots</hi> Great Seal did counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; when I know it can be proved by Witneſſes without exception,
that for many months before, until the now Lord Chancellor had the keeping of it, there
was nothing at all Sealed by it. Nor concerning this great point will I only ſay, that the
King is Innocent, and bid them prove (which to moſt Accuſations is a ſufficient Anſwer)
but I can prove, that if the King had been obeyed in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs before He went laſt
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> there had been no <hi>Iriſh Rebellion;</hi> and after it was begun, it had in few months
been ſuppreſſed, if His Directions had been obſerved. For if the King had been ſuffered to
have performed His Engagements to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents, and had diſpoſed of the diſcontented
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Army beyond Sea (according to His Contracts with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours)
there is nothing more clear, than that there could have been no Rebellion in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
becauſe they had wanted both Pretence and Means to have made one. Then, when it was
broken forth, if thoſe vigorous courſes had been purſued which the King propoſed, (firſt to
the <hi>Scots,</hi> then to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament) doubtleſs that Rebellion had been ſoon ſuppreſſed.
But what He propoſed took ſo little effect, that in many months after there was nothing
ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> but what the King Himſelf ſent (aſſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi>) before
He came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> unto Sir <hi>Rob. Steward;</hi> which, though it were little, will be found
to have done much ſervice, as may be ſeen by the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s voluntary Teſtimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in writing to the Parliament Commiſſioners then attending the King at <hi>Stoak.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a greater Evidence for Conſtancy in Religion there cannot be, than the King ſhewed
in His <hi>Iriſh</hi> Treaty; for in the time that He moſt needed Aſſiſtance, it was in His Power
to have made that Kingdom declare unanimouſly for Him, and have had the whole Forces
thereof employed in His Service, if He would have granted their Demand in Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they not inſiſting on any thing of Civil Government, which His Majeſty might not
have granted without prejudice to Regal Authority: and this can be clearly proved by the
Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Treaties with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> not without very good Evidence by ſome
of the King's Letters to the Queen which were taken at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> that are purpoſely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
leſt they ſhould too plainly diſcover the King's deteſtation of that Rebellion, and His
rigid firmneſs to the Proteſtant Profeſſion. Nor can I end this Point, without remarking
with wonder, that Men ſhould have ſo ill Memories as again to renew that old Slander of
the <hi>King's giving Paſſes to divers Papiſts, and Perſons of Quality who headed the Rebels;</hi> of
which He ſo cleared Himſelf, that He demanded Reparation for it, but could not have it,
albeit no ſhew of Proof could be produced for that Allegation: as is moſt plainly to be ſeen
in the firſt book of the Collection of all Remonſtrances, Declarations, &amp;c. fol. 69, &amp; 70.</p>
                     <p>Thus having given a particular Anſwer to the moſt material Points in this Declaration,
the reſt are ſuch frivolous, malicious, and many of them groundleſs Calumnies, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is the beſt Anſwer for them. Yet one thing more I muſt obſerve, that they not only
endeavour to make Fables paſs for currant Coyn, but likewiſe ſeek to blind mens Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with falſe Inferences upon ſome Truths. For Example, it is true that <hi>the King hath
ſaid in ſome of His Speeches or Declarations, That He oweth an Accompt of His Actions to none
but God alone; and that the Houſes of Parliament joynt or ſeparate have no Power either to make
or declare any Law:</hi> But that this is <hi>a fit foundation for all Tyranny,</hi> I muſt utterly deny. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if it had been ſaid, that <hi>the King without the Two Houſes of Parliament could make or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
Laws,</hi> then there might be ſome ſtrength in the Argument: but before this Parliament
it was never ſo much as pretended, that either or both Houſes without the King could
make or declare any Law; and certainly His Majeſty is not the firſt (and I hope will not
be the laſt) King of <hi>England,</hi> that hath not held Himſelf Accomptable to any Earthly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Beſides, it will be found that this His Majeſty's Poſition is moſt agreeable to all Divine
and Humane Laws; ſo far it is from being <hi>Deſtructive to a Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>a Foundation for
Tyranny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, I appeal to God and the World, whether it can be parallel'd by Example,
or warranted by Juſtice, that any man ſhould be ſlander'd, yet denied the ſight thereof, and
ſo far from being permitted to anſwer, that if he have erred, there is no way left him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
or mend it: and yet this is the King's preſent Condition; who is at this time
laid aſide, becauſe He will not conſent that the old Fundamental Laws of this Land be
changed, Regal Power deſtroyed, nor His People ſubmitted to a new Arbitrary Tyrannical
Government.</p>

                     <p>WHen large pretences prove but the ſhadows of weak performance, then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
labours produce the ſmalleſt effects; and when a period is put to a work of
great concernment, all mens ears do (as it were) hunger till they are ſatisfied in their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations.
Hath not this diſtracted Nation groaned a long time under the burthen of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Oppreſſion? and hath not all the blood that hath been ſpilt theſe ſeven years been
caſt upon My head, who am the greateſt ſufferer, though the leaſt guilty? and was it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to endeavour the ſtopping of that flux, which, if not ſtopt, will bring an abſolute
deſtruction to this Nation? And what more ſpeedy way was there to conſummate thoſe
diſtractions than by a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> being agreed upon by My two Houſes of Parliament,
and condeſcended to by Me? And I might declare, that I conceive it had been the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
had not the operation been hindred by the interpoſition of this imperious Army, who
were ſo audacious as to ſtyle Me, in their unparallel'd <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> their <hi>capital Enemy.</hi>
But let the World judge whether Mine endeavours have not been attended with reality
in this late Treaty, and whether I was not as ready to grant as they were to ask; and yet
all this is not ſatisfaction to them, that purſue their own ambitious ends more than the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of a miſerable Land. Were not the dying hearts of My poor diſtreſſed People much
revived with the hopes of a happineſs from this Treaty? and how ſuddenly are they fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their expectations? Have not I formerly been condemned for yielding too little to
My two Houſes of Parliament, and ſhall I now be condemned for yielding too much? Have
I not formerly been impriſoned for making War, and ſhall I now be condemned for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Peace? Have I not formerly ruled like a King, and ſhall I now be ruled like a Slave?
Have I not formerly enjoyed the ſociety of My dear Wife and Children in peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs,
and ſhall I now neither enjoy them, nor Peace? Have not My Subjects formerly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Me, and ſhall I now be obedient to My Subjects? Have I not been condemned for Evil
Counſellors, and ſhall I now be condemned for having no Counſel but God? Theſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable
miſeries, that the more I endeavour for Peace, the leſs My endeavours are reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And how ſhall I know hereafter what to grant, when your ſelves know not what to
ask? I refer it to your Conſciences, whether I have not ſatisfied your deſires in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſince this Treaty; if you find I have not, then let Me bear the burthen of the fault: but
if I have given you ample ſatisfaction, (as I am ſure I have) then you are bound to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Me from the fury of thoſe whoſe thoughts are filled with blood: though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
zeal, yet they are but Wolves in Sheeps cloathing.</p>
                     <p>I muſt further declare, that there is nothing can more obſtruct the long-hoped-for Peace
of this Nation, than the illegal proceedings of them that preſume from Servants to become
Maſters, and labour to bring in Democracy, and to aboliſh Monarchy. Needs muſt the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
alteration of Fundamentals be not only deſtructive to others, but in concluſion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
for they that endeavour to rule by the Sword, ſhall at laſt fall by it; for Faction is the
Mother of Ruine: and it is the humour of thoſe who are of this Weather-cock-like diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
to love nothing but mutabilities, neither will that pleaſe them, but only <hi>pro tempore;</hi>
for the too much variety doth but confound the ſenſes, and makes them ſtill hate one folly,
and fall in love with another.</p>
                     <p>Time is the beſt cure for Faction, for it will at length (like a ſpreading Leproſie) infect
the whole body of the Kingdom, and make it ſo odious, that at laſt they will hate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for love of that, and, like the Fiſh, for love of the bait, be catch'd with the hook.</p>
                     <p>I once more declare to all My loving Subjects, and God knows whether or no this may
be My laſt, that I have earneſtly laboured for Peace, and that My thoughts were ſincere and
abſolute, without any ſiniſter ends, and there was nothing left undone by Me that My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
would permit Me to do. And I call God to witneſs, that I do firmly conceive that
the interpoſition of the Army (that cloud of Malice) hath altogether eclipſed the glory of
that Peace which began again to ſhine in this Land: And let the World judg, whether it be
expedient for an Army to contradict the Votes of a Kingdom, endeavouring, by pretending
Laws and Liberties, to ſubvert both. Such Actions as theſe muſt produce ſtrange conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſet open the floud-gates of ruine, to overflow this Kingdom in a moment. Had this
Treaty been only Mine own ſeeking, then they might have had fairer pretences to have
ſtopt the courſe of it; but I being importun'd by My two Houſes, and they by moſt part of
the Kingdom, could not but with a great deal of alacrity concur with them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60710:74"/>
for the performance of ſo commodious a work: and I hope by this time that the hearts
and eyes of My People are opened ſo much, that they plainly diſcover who are the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners
of this Treaty.</p>
                     <p>For Mine own part, I here proteſt before the face of Heaven, that Mine own Afflictions
(though they need no addition) afflict Me not ſo much as My Peoples ſufferings; for I know
what to truſt to already, and they know not. God comfort both them and Me, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
our Patience to our Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>And when the Malice of Mine Enemies is ſpun out to the ſmalleſt thread, let them know
that I will, by the grace of God, be as contented to ſuffer, as they are active to advance My
ſufferings: and Mine own Soul tells Me, that the time will come, when the very clouds ſhall
drop down vengeance upon the heads of thoſe that barricado themſelves againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of Peace: for if God hath proclaimed a bleſſing to the Peace-makers, needs muſt
the Peace-breakers draw down curſes upon their heads.</p>
                     <p>I thank My God, I have armed My ſelf againſt their fury: and now let the arrows of
their Envy fly at Me, I have a breaſt to receive them, and a heart poſſeſt with patience to
ſuſtain them; for God is My Rock and My Shield, therefore I will not fear what man can do
unto Me. I will expect the worſt; and if any thing happen beyond My expectation, I
will give God the glory, for vain is the help of man.</p>

                     <p>I Never till now knew the good of Ignorance, for I did not know the danger that Thou
wert in by the ſtorm, before I had certain aſſurance of Thy happy eſcape; we
having had a pleaſing falſe report of Thy ſafe landing at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which Thine of the 19.
<hi>Jan.</hi> ſo confirmed us in, that we at leaſt were not undeceived of that hope, till we knew
certainly how great a danger Thou haſt paſt, of which I ſhall not be out of apprehenſion,
until I may have the happineſs of Thy company; for indeed I think it not the leaſt of My
misfortunes, that for My ſake Thou haſt run ſo much hazard: In which Thou haſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
ſo much love to Me, that I confeſs it is impoſſible to repay by any thing I can do,
much leſs by words: but My heart being full of affection for Thee, admiration of Thee,
and impatient paſſion of gratitude to Thee, I could not but ſay ſomething, leaving the reſt
to be read by Thee out of Thine own noble heart.</p>
                     <p>The intercepting of Mine to Thee of the<note n="*" place="margin">Jan. 23. 2 Feb.</note>
 23. <hi>February</hi> has bred great diſcourſe in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perſons, and of ſeveral kinds: as My ſaying I was perſecuted for places, is applied to all
and only thoſe that I there name to be Suitors; whereas the truth is, I meant thereby the
importunity of others whom at that time I had not time to name, as well as ſome there
mentioned: for I confeſs 174. and 133. are not guilty of that fault. Some find fault with too
much kindneſs to Thee (Thou maiſt eaſily vote from what Conſtellation that comes) but I
aſſure ſuch, that I want expreſſion, not will, to do it ten times more to Thee on all occaſions.
Others preſs Me, as being brought upon the Stage: but I anſwer, that having profeſt to
have Thy advice, it were a wrong to Thee to do any thing before I had it.</p>
                     <p>As for our Treaty (leaving the particulars to this incloſed) I am confident Thou wilt be
content with it as concerning My part in it; for all the Souldiers are well pleaſed with what
I have done: but expect no Ceſſation of Arms, for the lower Houſe will have none without
a disbanding, and I will not disband till all be agreed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for our Military affairs, I thank God that here and in the Weſt they proſper
well: as for the North I refer Thee to 226. 140. information.</p>

                     <p>I Need not tell You from whence this Bearer comes; only I will tell You that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
which he brings You are good, but 260. I believe that it is not yet time to
put them into execution: therefore find ſome means to ſend them back, which may not
diſcontent them, and do not tell who gave You this advice.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmely</hi> is come with a Troop of Horſe to kiſs My Hands; the reſt of his
people he left at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> with a Ship laden with Arms, which the Ships of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had taken and brought thither: ſo ſhe is ours.</p>
                     <p>The Rebels have quitted <hi>Tadcaſter</hi> upon our ſending Forces to <hi>Wetherby,</hi> but they are
returned with twelve hundred men: we ſend more forces to drive them out, though thoſe
we have already at <hi>Wetherby</hi> are ſufficient: but we fear leſt they have all their Forces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
and leſt they have ſome deſign; for they have quitted <hi>Selby</hi> and <hi>Cawood,</hi> the laſt of
which they have burnt. Between this and to morrow night we ſhall know the iſſue of
this buſineſs, and I will ſend You an expreſs. I am the more careful to advertiſe You of
what we do, that You and we may find means to have paſs-ports, to ſend: And I wonder
that upon the Ceſſation You have not demanded that You might ſend in ſafety. This ſhews
My Love.</p>
                     <p>I underſtand to day from <hi>London,</hi> that they will have no Ceſſation, and that they treat
at the beginning of the two firſt Articles, which is of the Forts, Ships, and Ammunition;
and afterwards of the disbanding of the Army. Certainly, I wiſh a Peace more than any,
and that with greater reaſon; but I would the disbanding of the perpetual Parliament firſt,
and certainly the reſt will be eaſily afterwards. I do not ſay this of My own head alone;
for generally both thoſe who are for You and againſt You in this Country-wiſh an end of
it: And I am certain that if You demand it at the firſt, in caſe it be not granted, <hi>Hull</hi> is
ours, and all <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> which is a thing to conſider of. And for My particular, if You
make a Peace, and disband Your Army before there is an end to this perpetual Parliament,
I am abſolutely reſolved to go into <hi>France,</hi> not being willing to fall again into the hands
of thoſe People, being well aſſured, that if the power remain with them, it will not be
well for Me in <hi>England.</hi> Remember what I have written to You in three precedent Letters,
and be more careful of Me than You have been, or at leaſt diſſemble it, to the end that no
notice be taken of it. Adieu. The Man haſtens Me, ſo that I can ſay no more.</p>

ſtaying but for one thing for which You will well pardon two days ſtop; It is to have
<hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Lincoln.</hi> Young <hi>Hotham</hi> having been put in priſon by Order of Parliament, is
eſcaped, and hath ſent to 260. that he would caſt himſelf into His arms, and that <hi>Hull</hi> and
<hi>Lincoln</hi> ſhould be rendred. He is gone to his Father, and 260. writes for Your anſwer. So
that I think I ſhall go hence Friday or Saturday, and ſhall go lye at <hi>Werton,</hi> and from
thence to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> where we will reſolve what way to take; and I will ſtay there a day,
becauſe that the march of the day before will have been ſomewhat great, and alſo to know
how the Enemy marches, all their Forces of <hi>Nottingham</hi> at preſent being gone to <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
and <hi>Derby,</hi> which makes us believe that it is to intercept our paſſage. As ſoon as we have
reſolved, I will ſend you word. At this preſent I think it fit to let You know the ſtate in
which we march, and what I leave behind Me for the ſafety of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire.</hi>
I leave 2000 foot, and wherewithal to arm 500 more; 20 Companies of Horſe:
all this to be under <hi>Charles Cavendiſh,</hi> whom the Gentlemen of the Country have deſired Me
not to carry with Me againſt his will, for he deſired extreamly not to go. The Enemies have
left within <hi>Nottingham</hi> 1000. I carry with Me 3000 Foot, 30 Companies of Horſe and
Dragoons, 6 pieces of Cannon, and two Morters. <hi>Harry Jermyn</hi> commands the Forces which
go with Me, as Colonel of My Guard, and Sir <hi>Alexander Leſley</hi> the Foot under Him, and
<hi>Gerard</hi> the Horſe, and <hi>Robin Legg</hi> the Artillery, and Her She-Majeſtie Generaliſſima, and
extreamly diligent with 150 Waggons of Baggage to govern in caſe of a Battle. Have a care
that no Troop of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army incommodate us, for I hope that for the reſt we ſhall be
ſtrong enough, for at <hi>Nottingham</hi> we have had the experience, one of our Troops having
beaten ſix of theirs, and made them fly.</p>
                     <p>I have received Your Proclamation or Declaration, which I wiſh had not been made,
being extreamly diſadvantagious for You; for You ſhew too much fear, and do not what

not of that importance as to make Me curious to inquire upon your Actions. But the great

                     <p>I Am ſorry to find by Colonel <hi>Barry</hi> the ſad condition of your particular fortune, for which
I cannot find ſo good and ſpeedy remedy as the Peace of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it being likewiſe moſt
neceſſary to redreſs affairs here: wherefore I command you to diſpatch it out of hand, for
the doing of which I hope My publick Diſpatch will give you ſufficient Inſtruction and
Power; yet I have thought it neceſſary, for your more encouragement in this neceſſary
work, to make this addition with My own hand.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Poining's Act,</hi> I refer you to My other Letter: And for matter of Religion, though
I have not found it fit to take publick notice of the Paper which <hi>Brown</hi> gave you, yet I muſt
command you to give him, My L. <hi>Muskery</hi> and <hi>Plunket</hi> particular thanks for it, aſſuring
them that without it there could have been no Peace; and that ſticking to it, their Nation
in general and they in particular ſhall have comfort in what they have done. And to ſhew
that this is more than words, I do hereby promiſe them, (and command you to ſee it
done) that the Penal Statutes againſt Roman Catholicks ſhall not be put in execution, the
Peace being made, and they remaining in their due obedience: and further, that when the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> give Me that aſſiſtance which they have promiſed for the ſuppreſſion of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and I ſhall be reſtored to My Rights, then I will conſent to the Repeal of them by
a Law; but all thoſe againſt Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Praemunire</hi> muſt ſtand.</p>
                     <p>All this in Cypher you muſt impart to none but thoſe three already named, and that
with injunction of ſtricteſt ſecrecy. So again recommending to your care the ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch

that You have a care of Your Honour; and that if You have a Peace, it may be ſuch as may
hold; and if it fall out otherwiſe, that You do not abandon thoſe who have ſerved You, for
fear they do forſake You in Your need. Alſo I do not ſee how You can be in ſafety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Regiment of Guard; for My ſelf, I think I cannot be, ſeeing the malice which they
have againſt Me and My Religion, of which I hope You will have a care of both. But in
My opinion Religion ſhould be the laſt thing upon which You ſhould treat: for if You do
agree upon ſtrictneſs againſt the Catholicks, it would diſcourage them to ſerve You and
if afterwards there ſhould be no Peace, You could never expect ſuccours either from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

                     <p>I Know Thy affection to Me ſo truly grounded, that Thou wilt be in as much (if not
more) trouble to find My Reputation, as My Life in danger: Therefore leſt the falſe
ſound of My offering a Treaty to the Rebels upon baſe and unſafe terms ſhould diſturb
Thy thoughts, I have thought it neceſſary (to aſſure Thy mind from ſuch rumors) to tell
Thee the ways I have uſed to come to a Treaty, and upon what grounds. I ſhall firſt ſhew
Thee My grounds, to the end Thou maieſt the better underſtand and approve of My ways.</p>
                     <p>Then know (as a certain truth) that all, even My party, are ſtrangely impatient for
Peace, which obliged Me ſo much the more (at all occaſions) to ſhew My real intentions to
Peace: And likewiſe I am put in very good hope (ſome hold it a certainty) that if I could
come to a fair Treaty, the Ring-leading Rebels could not hinder Me from a good Peace;
Firſt, becauſe their own party are moſt weary of the War, and likewiſe for the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
which at this time moſt aſſuredly are amongſt themſelves, as Presbyterians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Independents in Religion, and General againſt General in point of Command.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe grounds a Treaty being moſt deſirable (not without hope of good ſucceſs)
the moſt probable means to procure it was to be uſed, which might ſtand with Honour
and Safety. Amongſt the reſt (for I will omit all thoſe which are unqueſtionably counce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable)
the ſound of My return to <hi>London</hi> was thought to have ſo much force of popular
Rhetorick in it, that upon it a Treaty would be had, or if refuſed, it would bring much
prejudice to them, and be advantageous to Me. Yet leſt fooliſh and malicious people ſhould
interpret this as to proceed from fear or folly, I have joyned Conditions with the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(without which this ſound will ſignifie nothing) which Thou wilt find to be moſt of
the chief ingredients of an honourable and ſafe Peace. Then obſerve, If a Treaty at <hi>London</hi>
with Commiſſioners for both ſides may be had without it, it is not to be uſed; nor in caſe
they will treat with no body but My ſelf: ſo that the Conditions ſave any aſperſion of
diſhonour, and the treating at <hi>London</hi> the malignity which our factious ſpirits here may
infuſe into this Treaty upon this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>This I hope will ſecure Thee from the trouble which otherwiſe may be cauſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
rumours: and though I judge My ſelf ſecure in Thy thoughts from ſuſpecting Me
guilty of any baſeneſs; yet I held this account neceſſary, to the end Thou maieſt make
others know as well as Thy ſelf this certain truth, That no danger of death or miſery
(which I think much worſe) ſhall make Me do any thing unworthy of Thy Love.</p>
                     <p>For the ſtate of My preſent affairs, I refer Thee to 92. concluding (as I did in My laſt
to Thee) by conjuring Thee, as Thou loveſt Me, that no appearance of Peace (and I now
add) nor hopeful condition of Mine, make Thee neglect to haſte ſuccour for Him who is
eternally Thine.</p>

for want, never miſt any occaſion of ſending to Thee; and I aſſure Thee, never any
Diſpatch went from either of My Secretaries without one from Me, when I knew of it.</p>
                     <p>As for My calling thoſe at <hi>London</hi> a Parliament, I ſhall refer Thee to <hi>Digby</hi> for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſatisfaction: this in general, If there had been but two (beſides My ſelf) of My opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I had not done it; and the Argument that prevailed with Me was, that the calling
did no ways acknowledge them to be a Parliament; upon which condition and conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I did it, and no otherways, and accordingly it is regiſtred in the Council-Books, with
the Councils unanimous approbation. But Thou wilt find that it was by misfortune, not
neglect, that Thou haſt been no ſooner advertiſed of it.</p>
                     <p>As for the Concluſion of Thy Letter, it would much trouble Me, if Thou didſt not
know Thy deſire granted before it was asked; yet I wonder not at it, ſince that which
may bear a bad conſtruction hath been preſented to Thee in the uglieſt form, not having
received the true reaſon and meaning of it. The fear of ſome ſuch miſchance made Me the
more careful to give Thee a full account by <hi>Tom Elliot</hi> of the reaſons of the D. of <hi>R.</hi> and E.

                     <p>MY Dear Heart, <hi>Tom Elliot</hi> two days ſince hath brought Me much joy and ſorrow:
the firſt, to know the good eſtate in which You are; the other, the fear I have
that You go to <hi>London.</hi> I cannot conceive where the wit was of thoſe who gave You this
Counſel, unleſs it be to hazard Your Perſon to ſave theirs. But thanks be to God, to day I
received one of Yours by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal,</hi> dated in <hi>January,</hi> which comforted
Me much, to ſee that the Treaty ſhall be at <hi>Vxbridge.</hi> For the Honour of God truſt not
Your ſelf in the hands of theſe people: And if ever You go to <hi>London</hi> before the Parliament
be ended, or without a good Army, You are loſt. I underſtand that the Propoſitions for the
Peace muſt begin by disbanding the Army. If You conſent to this You ſhall be loſt, they
having the whole power of the Militia, they have done and will do whatſoever they will.</p>
                     <p>I received yeſterday Letters from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who ſends Me word, if his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
be agreeable to You, he will bring You ten thouſand men. Dr. <hi>Goffe,</hi> whom I have ſent
into <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhall treat with him in his paſſage upon this buſineſs; and I hope very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to ſend good news of this, as alſo of the Money. Aſſure Your ſelf, I will be wanting
in nothing You ſhall deſire, and that I will hazard My Life, that is, to die by famine, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than not to ſend to You. Send Me word always by whom You receive My Letters, for
I write both by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Reſident of <hi>France.</hi> Above all, have a
care not to abandon thoſe who have ſerved You, as well the Biſhops, as the poor Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.
Adieu. You will pardon Me if I make uſe of another to write, not being able to
do it; yet My ſelf in Cyphers ſhew to My Nephew <hi>Rupert,</hi> that I intreat You to impart
all that I write to You, to the end that he may know the reaſon why I write not to him.
I know not how to ſend great Packets.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>POoly</hi> came the 12. 22. <hi>Jan.</hi> to whoſe great Diſpatch though for ſome dayes I cannot
give a full anſwer, I cannot but at this opportunity reply to ſomething in Thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not without relating to ſomething of his diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>As I confeſs it a misfortune (but deny it a fault) Thy not hearing oftner from Me, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Me to deny that it can be of ſo ill conſequence as Thou mentioneſt, if their affections
were ſo real as they make ſhew to Thee; for the difficulty of ſending is known to all, and
the numbers of each Letter will ſhew My diligence; and certainly there goes no great wit
to find out waies of ſending: wherefore if any be neglected more, then our wits are faulty.
But to imagine that it can enter into the thought of any fleſh living, that any body here
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60710:79"/>
ſhould hide from Thee what is deſired that every one ſhould know, (Excuſe Me to ſay it)
is ſuch a folly, that I ſhall not believe that any can think it, though he ſay it. And for My
affection to Thee, it will not be the miſcarrying of a Letter or two that will call it in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
But take heed that theſe diſcourſes be not rather the effect of their wearineſs of thy
company, than the true image of their thoughts: and of this is not the propoſal of thy
journey to <hi>Ireland</hi> a pretty inſtance? for ſeriouſly of it ſelf, I hold it one of the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
propoſition that I have heard; Thy giving ear to it being moſt aſſuredly only to
expreſs Thy love to Me, and not Thy judgment in My Affairs. As for the buſineſs it ſelf,
(I mean the Peace of <hi>Ireland</hi>) to ſhew Thee the care I have had of it, and the fruits I hope
to receive from it, I have ſent Thee the laſt Diſpatches I have ſent concerning it, earneſtly
deſiring Thee to keep them to Thy ſelf: only Thou mayeſt in general let the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Miniſters there underſtand, that I have offered My <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects ſo good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that a Peace will ſhortly enſue, which I really believe. But for God's ſake let none
know the particulars of My Diſpatches.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but tell Thee, that I am much beholding to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Agent (and little to
the <hi>French</hi>) it being by his means that I have ſent Thee all My Letters (beſides Expreſſes)
ſince I came hither, though I expected moſt from <hi>Sabran.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not trouble Thee with repetitions of News, <hi>Digby</hi>'s diſpatch, which I have ſeen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo full. Yet I cannot but paraphraſe a little upon that which he calls his ſuperſtitious
obſervation: It is this; Nothing can be more evident than that <hi>Strafford</hi>'s innocent blood
hath been one of the great cauſes of God's juſt Judgments upon this Nation by a furious
civil War, both ſides hitherto being almoſt equally puniſhed, as being in a manner equally
guilty; but now this laſt crying blood being totally theirs, I believe it is no preſumption
hereafter to hope that his hand of Juſtice muſt be heavier upon them, and lighter upon
us, looking now upon our Cauſe, having paſſed by our Faults.</p>

                     <p>MY Dear Heart, ſince My laſt I have received one of Your Letters marked 16. by
which You ſignifie the receipt of My Letters by <hi>Pooly,</hi> which hath a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Me, ſeeming to Me that You write as if I had in My Letter ſomething which had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
You. If that hath been, I am very innocent in My intention; I only did believe that
it was neceſſary You ſhould know all.</p>
                     <p>There is one other thing in Your Letter which troubles Me much, where You would
have Me keep to My ſelf Your Diſpatches, as if you believe that I ſhould be capable to ſhew
them to any, only to Lord <hi>Jer.</hi> to uncypher them, My Head not ſuffering Me to do it My
ſelf; but if it pleaſe You I will do it, and none in the world ſhall ſee them. Be kind to Me, or
You kill Me; I have already affliction enough to bear, which without You I could not do,
but Your ſervice ſurmounts all. Farewel, My Dear Heart: Behold the mark which You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have, to know when I deſire any thing in earneſt. And I pray begin to remember
what I ſpake to You concerning <hi>Jack Barkly</hi> for Maſter of the Wards. I am not engaged,
nor will not, for the places of L. <hi>Per.</hi> and others: Do You accordingly.</p>

                     <p>SInce My laſt by <hi>Choquen</hi> I have had no means of writing, and as little new matter.
That which is now, is the progreſs of the Treaty, of which theſe encloſed Papers will
give Thee a full accompt; but if Thou have them ſooner from <hi>London</hi> than Me, Thou haſt
no reaſon to wonder, conſidering the length and uncertainty of the way I am forced to
ſend by, in reſpect of the other. For the buſineſs it ſelf, I believe Thou wilt approve of My
choice of Treaters, and for My Propoſitions, they differ nothing in ſubſtance (very little in
words) from thoſe which were laſt; wherefore I need to ſay nothing of them: and for My
Inſtructions, they are not yet made, but by the next I hope to ſend them.</p>
                     <p>Now upon the whole matter, I deſire Thee to ſhew the Queen and Miniſters there the
improbability that this preſent Treaty ſhould produce a Peace, conſidering the great ſtrange
difference (if not contrariety) of grounds that are betwixt the Rebels Propoſitions and Mine,
and that I cannot alter Mine, nor will they ever theirs, until they be out of hope to prevail
by force, which a little aſſiſtance by Thy means will ſoon make them be; for I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
if ever I could put them to a defenſive (which a reaſonable ſum of money would do)
they would be eaſily brought to reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Concerning our interferings here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I deſire Thee to ſuſpend Thy Judgement,
(for I believe few but partial relations will come to Thee) until I ſhall ſend ſome whom I

may truſt by word of mouth; it being too much trouble to Us both to ſet them down in

                        <p>SUnday laſt I received three Letters from Thee, one a Duplicate of the 30. <hi>Decemb.</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the 6. <hi>Jan.</hi> and the laſt of the 14. <hi>Jan.</hi> and even now one <hi>Petit</hi> is come with a
Duplicate of the laſt: wherein as I infinitely joy in the expreſſions of Thy confident love of
Me, ſo I muſt extreamly wonder that any who pretend to be a friend to Our Cauſe (for I
believe Thou wouldſt not mention any information from the other ſide) can invent ſuch
lyes, that Thou haſt had ill offices done to Me by any, or that Thy care for My aſſiſtance
hath been the leaſt ſuſpected; it being ſo far from truth, that the juſt contrary is true. For I
proteſt to God I never heard Thee ſpoken of, but with the greateſt expreſſions of eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Thy love to Me, and particularly for Thy diligent care for My aſſiſtance: But I am
confident that it is a branch of that root of knavery which I am now digging at; and of
this I have more than a bare ſuſpicion. And indeed if I were to find fault with Thee, it
ſhould be for not taking ſo much care of Thine Own health as of My aſſiſtance, at leaſt not
giving Me ſo often account of it as I deſire; theſe three laſt making no mention of Thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Now as for the Treaty (which begins this day) I deſire Thee to be confident, that I ſhall
never make a Peace by abandoning My Friends, nor ſuch a one as will not ſtand with My
Honour and Safety: Of which I will ſay no more, becauſe, knowing Thy Love, I am ſure
Thou muſt believe Me, and make others likewiſe confident of Me.</p>
                        <p>I ſend Thee herewith My Directions to My Commiſſioners: But how I came to them
My ſelf, without any others, <hi>Digby</hi> will tell Thee, with all the News as well concerning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
as Cabaliſtical matters. At this time I will ſay no more, but that I ſhall in all things
(only not anſwering for words) truly ſhew My ſelf to be eternally Thine.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> Agent hath made Me two Propoſitions: firſt, concerning the releaſe of his
Maſter's Brother, for which I ſhall have 50000 <hi>l.</hi> if I can procure his liberty from the King
of <hi>Spain;</hi> the other is for a Marriage betwixt My Son <hi>Charles</hi> and his Maſter's Eldeſt Daughter.
For the firſt, I have freely undertaken to do what I can; and for the other, I will give ſuch
an Anſwer as ſhall ſignifie nothing.</p>
                        <p>I deſire Thee not to give too much credit to <hi>Sabran</hi>'s Relations, nor much countenance
to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agents in <hi>Paris;</hi> the particular reaſons Thou ſhalt have by <hi>Pooly</hi> (whom I intend
for My next Meſſenger.)</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place I recommend to Thee the care of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Gernſey,</hi> it being impoſſible
for us here to do much, though we were rich, being weak at Sea.</p>

                           <p>In this, the Government of the Church (as I ſuppoſe) will be the chief queſtion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two things are to be conſidered, Conſcience, and Policy.</p>
                           <p>For the firſt, I muſt declare unto you, that I cannot yield to the change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Biſhops: not only as I fully concur with the moſt general opinion of Chriſtians in
all Ages, as being the beſt; but likewiſe I hold My ſelf particularly bound by the Oath I took
at My Coronation, not to alter the Government of this Church from what I found it. And
as for the Churches Patrimony, I cannot ſuffer any diminution or alienation of it, it being
without peradventure Sacriledge, and likewiſe contrary to My Coronation Oath. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall be offered for rectifying of abuſes, if any have crept in, or yet for the eaſe of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſciences (ſo that it endamage not the foundation) I am content to hear, and will be
ready to give a gracious Anſwer thereunto.</p>
                           <p>For the ſecond, As the King's duty is to protect the Church, ſo it is the Churches to aſſiſt
the King in the maintenance of His juſt Authority. Wherefore My Predeceſſors have been
always careful (and eſpecially ſince the Reformation) to keep the dependency of the Clergy
entirely upon the Crown; without which it will ſcarcely ſit faſt upon the King's Head.
Therefore you muſt do nothing to change or leſſen this neceſſary dependency.</p>

                           <p>After Conſcience, this is certainly the fitteſt ſubject for a King's Quarrel, for without it
the Kingly Power is but a ſhadow; and therefore upon no means to be quitted, but to be
maintained according to the ancient known Laws of the Land. Yet becauſe (to attain to
this ſo much wiſhed Peace by all good men) it is in a manner neceſſary, that ſufficient and

they will neither be threatned nor diſputed from the grounds I have given them; which
(upon My word) is according to the little Note Thou ſo well remembreſt: And in this
not only their obedience, but their judgments concur.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs in ſome reſpects Thou haſt reaſon to bid Me beware of going too ſoon to <hi>London;</hi>
for indeed ſome amongſt us had a greater mind that way than was fit: of which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<hi>Percy</hi> is one of the chief, who is ſhortly like to ſee Thee; of whom having ſaid this,
is enough to ſhew Thee how he is to be truſted, or believed by Thee concerning our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
here.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, there is little or no appearance but that this Summer will be the hotteſt for
War of any that hath been yet. And be confident, that in making Peace I ſhall ever ſhew
My conſtancy in adhering to Biſhops and all our Friends, and not forget to put a ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to this perpetual Parliament. But as Thou loveſt Me, let none perſwade Thee to
ſlacken Thine aſſiſtance for Him who is eternally Thine</p>

                     <p>DEAR Heart, I cannot yet ſend Thee any certain word concerning the iſſue of our
Treaty; only the unreaſonable ſtubbornneſs of the Rebels gives daily leſs and leſs
hopes of any accommodation this way: wherefore I hope no rumours ſhall hinder Thee
from haſtning all Thou mayeſt all poſſible aſſiſtance to Me, and particularly that of the D.
of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s, concerning which I received yeſterday good news from D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Goffe,</hi> that the P. of
<hi>Orange</hi> will furniſh Shipping for his Tranſportation; and that the reſt of his Negotiation
goes hopefully on: by which, and many other ways, I find Thy affection ſo accompanied
with dexterity, as I know not whether (in their ſeveral kinds) to eſteem moſt. But I
will ſay no more of this, leſt Thou mayeſt think that I pretend to do this way what is
but poſſible to be done by the continued actions of My Life.</p>
                     <p>Though I leave news to others, yet I cannot but tell Thee that even now I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certain intelligence of a great defeat given to <hi>Argyle</hi> by <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who upon ſurprize
totally routed thoſe Rebels, killed 1500 upon the place.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday I received Thine of 27. <hi>Jan.</hi> by the <hi>Portugal</hi> Agent, the only way (but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes)
I am confident on, either to receive Letters from Thee, or to ſend them to Thee.
Indeed <hi>Sabrian</hi> ſent Me word yeſterday, beſides ſome Complements, of the Imbargo of the
Rebels Ships in <hi>France</hi> (which I likewiſe put upon Thy ſcore of kindneſs) but is well enough
content that the <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould be charged with Thy Diſpatches.</p>
                     <p>As for truſting the Rebels, either by going to <hi>London,</hi> or disbanding My Army before a
Peace, do no ways fear my hazarding ſo cheaply or fooliſhly; for I eſteem the intereſt Thou
haſt in Me at a far dearer rate, and pretend to have a little more wit (at leaſt by the
Sympathy that is betwixt Us) than to put My ſelf into the reverence of perfidious Rebels.
So impatiently expecting the Expreſs Thou haſt promiſed Me, I reſt eternally Thine.</p>
                     <p>I can now aſſure Thee that <hi>Hertogen</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Agent is an arrant knave, which ſhall be
made manifeſt to Thee by the firſt opportunity of ſending Pacquets.</p>

                     <p>THE impoſſibility of preſerving My Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland</hi> by a continuation
of the War, having moved Me to give you thoſe powers and directions which I have
formerly done for the concluding of a Peace there, and the ſame growing daily much more
evident, that alone were reaſon enough for Me to enlarge your powers, and to make My
commands in the point more poſitive. But beſides theſe conſiderations, it being now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels have (as far as in them lies) given the command of <hi>Ireland</hi>
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> that their aim is a total ſubverſion of Religion and Regal Power, and that
nothing leſs will content them, or purchaſe Peace here; I think My ſelf bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
not to let ſlip the means of ſetling that Kingdom (if it may be) fully under My obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
nor to loſe that aſſiſtance which I may hope from My <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects, for ſuch ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as in a leſs preſſing condition might reaſonably be ſtuck at by Me. For their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I do therefore command you to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> whatever it coſt,
ſo that My Proteſtant Subjects there may be ſecured, and my Regal Authority preſerved.
But for all this, you are to make Me the beſt bargain you can, and not diſcover your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60710:81"/>
of power till you needs muſt. And though I leave the managing of this great
and neceſſary work entirely to you; yet I cannot but tell you, that if the ſuſpenſion of
<hi>Poining</hi>'s Act for ſuch Bills as ſhall be agreed upon between you there, and the preſent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of the Penal Laws againſt Papiſts by a Law, will do it, I ſhall not think it a
hard bargain; ſo that freely and vigorouſly they engage themſelves in My aſſiſtance againſt

                     <p>NOW is come to paſs what I foreſaw, the fruitleſs end (as to a preſent Peace of this
Treaty; but I am ſtill confident that I ſhall find very good effects of it: For beſides
that My Commiſſioners have offered, to ſay no more, full-meaſured reaſon, and the Rebels
have ſtucken rigidly their demands, which I dare ſay had been too much, though they had
taken Me Priſoner, ſo that aſſuredly the breach will light foully upon them; We have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
at this time diſcovered, and ſhall make it evidently appear to the world, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Rebels (whether baſely or ignorantly will be no very great difference) have, as much
as in them lies, tranſmitted the Command of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to the
<hi>Scots,</hi> which (beſides the reflection it will have upon theſe Rebels) will clearly ſhew,
that Reformation of the Church is not the chief, much leſs the only end of the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>But it being preſumption, and no piety, ſo to truſt to a good Cauſe, as not to uſe all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to maintain it, I have thought of one means more to furniſh Thee with for My
aſſiſtance than hitherto Thou haſt had. It is, that I give Thee power to promiſe in My
Name (to whom thou thinkeſt moſt fit) that I will take away all the Penal Laws againſt
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as God ſhall make Me able to do it; ſo as by
their means, or in their favours, I may have ſo powerful aſſiſtance as may deſerve ſo great
a favour, and enable Me to do it. But if Thou ask what I call that aſſiſtance, I anſwer,
that when Thou knoweſt what may be done for it, it will be eaſily ſeen if it deſerve to
be ſo eſteemed. I need not tell Thee what ſecrecy this buſineſs requires; yet this I will ſay,
that this is the greateſt point of confidence I can expreſs to Thee: for it is no thanks to
Me to truſt Thee in any thing elſe but in this, which is the only thing of difference in
opinion betwixt Us. And yet I know Thou wilt make as good a bargain for Me, even in
this; I truſting thee (though it concern Religion) as if Thou wert a Proteſtant, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good of My Affairs ſo much depending on it.</p>
                     <p>I have ſo fully inſtructed this Bearer <hi>Pooly,</hi> that I will not ſay more to Thee now, but
that herewith I ſend Thee a new Cypher, aſſuring Thee that none hath or ſhall have any
Copy of it but My ſelf, to the end Thou mayeſt uſe it when Thou ſhalt find fit to write
any thing which Thou wilt judge worthy of Thy pains to put in Cypher, and to be decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered

unhandſom or diſadvantageous to My ſelf or Friends in order to a Treaty, it will be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
My own Fault. For I confeſs, when I wrote laſt, I was in fear to have been preſſed
to make ſome mean overtures to renew the Treaty, (knowing that there were great labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
to that purpoſe: but now I promiſe Thee, if it be renewed, (which I believe will
not, without ſome eminent good ſucceſs on My ſide) it ſhall be to My honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
I being now as well freed from the place of baſe and mutinous motions (that is to
ſay, our Mungrel Parliament here) as of the chief cauſers, for whom I may juſtly expect
to be chidden by Thee, for having ſuffered Thee to be vexed by them, <hi>Wilmot</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
there, <hi>Percy</hi> on his way, and <hi>Suſſex</hi> within few daies taking his journey to Thee;
but that I know thou careſt not for a little trouble to free Me from great inconveniences.
Yet I muſt tell Thee, that if I knew not the perfect ſtedineſs of Thy love to Me, I might
reaſonably apprehend that their repair to Thee would rather prove a change than an end
of their Villanies; and I cannot deny but My confidence in Thee was ſome cauſe of this
permiſſive trouble to Thee.</p>

I have received Thine of the third of <hi>March,</hi> by which Thou putteſt Me in hope of
aſſiſtance of men and money; and it is no little expreſſion of Thy love to Me, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of My buſineſs) Feſtivals are troubleſome to Thee: but I ſee that Aſſemblies in no
Countries are very agreeable to Thee, and it may be done a purpoſe to make Thee weary
of their companies: and excuſe Me to tell Thee in earneſt, that it is no wonder that mere
Stateſmen ſhould deſire to be rid of Thee. Therefore I deſire Thee to think whether it
would not advantage Thee much to make a perſonal Friendſhip with the Queen Regent
(without ſhewing any diſtruſt of Her Miniſters; though not wholly truſting to them)
and to ſhew Her, that when Her Regency comes out (and poſſibly before) She may have
need of Her Friends; ſo that She ſhall but ſerve Her ſelf by helping of Thee: and to ſay
no more, but certainly, if this Rebellion had not begun to oppreſs Me when it did, a late
great Queen had ended more glorious than She did.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, I deſire Thee to give Me a weekly account of Thy health, for I fear
leſt in that alone Thou takeſt not care enough to expreſs Thy kindneſs to Him who is
eternally Thine.</p>
                     <p>The Northern news is rather better than what we firſt heard; for what by Sir <hi>Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke

that in this no news is good news, yet I am not ſo ſatisfied without a more perfect aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;

the Refractary Horſe (as the <hi>London</hi> Rebels call them) may be reckoned in, for yet it is
not known what fomenters they have, or whether they have none; if the latter, there is
the more hope of gaining them to Me: howſoever I doubt not but, if they ſtand out (as it

                     <p>DEAR Heart, Since My laſt (which was but 3. days ago) there are no alterations
happened of moment, preparations rather than actions being yet our chiefeſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
in which we hope that we proceed faſter than the Rebels, whoſe Levies both of men
and money (for certain) go on very ſlowly; and I believe they are much weaker than is
thought even here at <hi>Oxford.</hi> For inſtance; A very honeſt Servant of Mine, and no fool,
ſhewed Me a Propoſition from one of the moſt conſiderable <hi>London</hi> Rebels, who will not let
his name be known until he have hope that his Propoſition will take effect: It is this, That
ſince the Treaty is ſo broken off, that neither the Rebels nor I can reſume it without at
leaſt a ſeeming total yielding to the other, the Treaty ſhould be renewed upon Thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with a pre-aſſurance that the Rebels will ſubmit to reaſon. The anſwer that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
My Servant to give was, That Thou art much the fitteſt perſon to be the means
of ſo happy and glorious a work as is the Peace of this Kingdom: but that upon no terms
Thy name was to be prophaned, therefore he was to be ſatisfied of the Rebels willingneſs
to yield to reaſon, before he would conſent that any ſuch intimation ſhould be made to
Thee; and particularly concerning Religion and the Militia, that nothing muſt be inſiſted
upon, but according to My former offers. This I believe will come to nothing, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but advertiſe Thee of any thing that comes to My knowledge of this conſequence.</p>
                     <p>I muſt again tell Thee, that moſt aſſuredly <hi>France</hi> will be the beſt way for tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Army, there being divers fit and ſafe places of landing for them
upon the Weſtern coaſts, beſides the Ports under My Obedience, as <hi>Shelſey</hi> near <hi>Chicheſter,</hi>
and others, of which I will advertiſe Thee when the time comes.</p>
                     <p>By My next I think to tell Thee when I ſhall march into the Field, for which Money is
now His greateſt want (I need ſay no more) who is eternally Thine.</p>

                        <hi>HArry,</hi> Leſt My Wife ſhould not yet be fit for any buſineſs, I write this to you, not to
excuſe My pains, but eaſe Hers: and that She may know, but not be troubled with
My kindneſs, I refer to your diſcretion how far to impart My Letter to Her, or any other
buſineſs, that ſo Her health in the firſt place be cared for, then My affairs. And now I muſt
tell you, that undoubtedly if you had not truſted to <hi>Digby</hi>'s ſanguine complection (not to
be rebated from ſending good news) you would not have found fault with him for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miſtaken intelligence; for if he ſhould ſtrictly tie himſelf to certain truths in this kind,
you muſt have nothing from him but My Proclamations, or Ordinances from the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Houſes. But tell Me, can you not diſtinguiſh between what we ſend you upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and what upon uncertain reports, without making an oath the mark of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And are you obliged to publiſh all the news we ſend you? Seriouſly I think news
may be ſometimes too good to be told in the <hi>French</hi> Court; and certainly there is as much
dexterity in publiſhing of news, as in matters which at firſt ſight may ſeem of greater
difficulty: for as I would not have them think that all aſſiſtance beſtowed upon Me were
in vain; ſo I would not have them believe that I needed no help, leſt they ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
aſſiſt any Rebels, to keep the balance of diſſention amongſt us equal.</p>
                     <p>For matter of News and preſent ſtate of My affairs I refer you to <hi>Digby;</hi> only this in
general, that if it pleaſe God to aſſiſt us this year but half ſo miraculouſly as He did the
laſt (My preſent ſtate compared with what it was this time twelve-month) I am very
hopeful to ſee a joyful harveſt before next Winter. Nor do I think this in any humane
probability poſſible, except My Wife can procure Me conſiderable aſſiſtance both of men
and money; of which I conceive little reaſon to deſpair, your laſt giving Me good hope
concerning <hi>Lorrain:</hi> and though I ſay not that for the other I have ſo good an Author as
196. yet I hope you will not much blame My confidence, when 149. in hers the 10. of

                     <p>In the laſt place I will impoſe that upon you that is not reaſonable to expect from My

quarters are ſo free, that I hope to be marching within three or four daies, and am ſtill

wherefore I thought fit to put My Nephew <hi>Rupert</hi> in that place, which will both ſave

                     <p>DEAR Heart; Marching takes away the conveniency of ſending My Letters ſo ſafe
and quick to Thee as when I was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> however I ſhall not fail to do what I
can to ſend often to Thee. There is ſo little news for the preſent, as I will leave that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for others; only upon Saturday laſt I received a Diſpatch from <hi>Montroſs,</hi> which aſſures
Me his condition to be ſo good, that he bids Me be confident that his Country-men ſhall
do Me no great harm this year; and if I could lend him but 500. Horſe, he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to bring Me 20000. men before the end of this Summer.</p>
                     <p>For the general ſtate of My affairs, we all here think it to be very hopeful; this Army
being of a good ſtrength, well ordered, and increaſing; My Sons ſuch, that <hi>Fairfax</hi> will
not be refuſed to be fought with, of which I hope Thou wilt receive good ſatisfaction from
himſelf. It's true that I cannot brag of ſtore of money, but a ſharp ſword alwaies hinders
ſtarving at leaſt; and I believe the Rebels Coffers are not very full (and certainly we ſhall
make as good ſhift with empty purſes as they) or they muſt have ſome greater defect, elſe
their Levies could not be ſo backward as they are; for I aſſure Thee that I have at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
many more men in the Field than they. I am not very confident what their Northern
Forces are, but except they are much ſtronger than I am made believe, I may likewiſe
include them.</p>
                     <p>Now I muſt make a complaint to Thee of My Son <hi>Charles,</hi> which troubles Me the more,
that Thou maieſt ſuſpect I ſeek by equivocation to hide the breach of My word, which
I hate above all things, eſpecially to Thee. It is this, He hath ſent to deſire Me, that Sir
<hi>John Greenvil</hi> may be ſworn Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, but is already ſo publickly
ingaged in it, that the refuſal would be a great diſgrace both to my Son and the young
Gentleman, to whom it is not fit to give a juſt diſtaſte, eſpecially now, conſidering his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
merits, his own hopefulneſs, beſides the great power that Family has in the Weſt.
Yet I have refuſed the admitting of him until I ſhall hear from Thee. Wherefore I deſire
Thee, firſt to chide My Son for ingaging himſelf without one of Our conſents; then, not
to refuſe Thy own conſent; and laſtly, to believe that directly or indirectly I never knew
of this while yeſterday at the delivery of My Son's Letter. So farewel, Sweet Heart, and
God ſend Me good news from Thee.</p>

I could have expected, which makes Me believe that My good news will not
be very ſtale, which in ſhort is this: Since the taking of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> My marching down
hither to relieve <hi>Oxford</hi> made the Rebels raiſe their ſiege before I could come near them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had their Quarters once or twice beaten up by that Garriſon, and loſt four hundred
men at an aſſault before <hi>Boſtol</hi>-Houſe. At firſt I thought they would have fought with Me,
being marched as far as <hi>Brackly,</hi> but they are ſince gone aſide to <hi>Brickhill,</hi> ſo as I believe
they are weaker than they are thought to be; whether by their diſtractions, (which are
certainly very great, <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> having been at Cudgels, and his men and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
likewiſe at blows together, where a Captain was ſlain) or waſting their men, I will
not ſay. Beſides <hi>Goring</hi> hath given a great defeat to the Weſtern Rebels, but I do not yet
know the particulars. Wherefore I may (without being too much ſanguine) affirm, that
(ſince this Rebellion) My Affairs were never in ſo fair and hopeful a way; though among
our ſelves we want not our own follies, which is needleſs, and I am ſure tedious, to tell
Thee, but ſuch as I am confident ſhall do no harm, nor much trouble Me. Yet I muſt tell
Thee, that it is Thy Letter by <hi>Fitz-Williams,</hi> aſſuring Me of Thy perfect recovery, with
Thy wonted kindneſs, which makes Me capable of taking contentment in theſe good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes:

Me yeſterday. And firſt I aſſure you, I have been (and ever will be) very careful
to advertiſe you of My reſolutions ſo ſoon as they were taken; and if I enjoyned ſilence to
that which was no ſecret, it was not My fault, for I thought it one, and I am ſure it ought
to have been ſo.</p>
                     <p>Now as for your opinion of My Buſineſs, and your Counſel thereupon, If I had any other
quarrel but the defence of My Religion, Crown and Friends, you had full reaſon for your
advice: For I confeſs that ſpeaking either as a meer Souldier or Stateſman, I muſt ſay there
is no probability but of My Ruine; yet as a Chriſtian I muſt tell you, that God will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Rebels and Traitors to proſper, nor this Cauſe to be overthrown. And whatſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
puniſhment it ſhall pleaſe Him to inflict upon Me, muſt not make Me repine, much
leſs give over this quarrel: and there is as little queſtion, that a compoſition with them at
this time is nothing elſe but a ſubmiſſion, which by the grace of God I am reſolved againſt,
whatſoever it coſt Me; for I know My obligation to be, both in Conſcience and Honour,
neither to abandon God's Cauſe, injure My Succeſſors, nor forſake My Friends. Indeed I
cannot flatter My ſelf with expectation of good ſucceſs more than this, to end My days
with Honour and a good Conſcience, which obligeth Me to continue My endeavours, in
not deſpairing that God may yet in due time avenge His own Cauſe; though I muſt aver to
all My Friends, that he that will ſtay with Me at this time, muſt expect and reſolve either
to die for a good Cauſe, or (which is worſe) to live as miſerable in maintaining it as the
violence of inſulting Rebels can make him.</p>
                     <p>Having thus truly and impartially ſtated My Caſe unto you, and plainly told you My
reſolutions, which by the grace of God I will not alter, they being neither lightly nor ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
grounded, I earneſtly deſire you not in any wiſe to hearken now after Treaties, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you, that as low as I am, I will do no more than was offered in My Name at <hi>Vxbridge;</hi>
confeſſing that it were as great a miracle that they ſhould agree to ſo much reaſon, as that
I ſhould be within a month in the ſame condition that I was immediately before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
at <hi>Naſeby.</hi> Therefore for God's ſake let us not flatter our ſelves with theſe conceits. And
believe Me, your very imagination that you are deſirous of a Treaty will but loſe Me ſo
much the ſooner: wherefore as you love Me, whatſoever you have already done, apply your
diſcourſe hereafter according to My reſolution and judgement.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I aſſure you they ſhall not cheat Me; but it is poſſible they may cozen
themſelves: for be aſſured, what I have refuſed to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I will not grant to the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Rebels, never truſting to that kind of people (of what Nation ſoever) more than I ſee by
their Actions. And I am ſending to <hi>Ormond</hi> ſuch a Diſpatch, as I am ſure will pleaſe you
and all honeſt men; a Copy whereof by the next opportunity you ſhall have.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, be confident I would not have put you nor My ſelf to the trouble of this long
Letter, had I not a great eſtimation of you, and a full confidence of your Friendſhip
too.</p>

                     <p>HAving commanded your fellow-Secretary to give you a full account as well of our
proceedings here as reſolutions, I will neither trouble you nor My ſelf with repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Only for My ſelf, I muſt deſire you to let every one know, that no diſtreſſes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
whatſoever ſhall make Me, by the grace of God, in any thing recede from thoſe grounds
I laid down to you who were My Commiſſioners at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> and which (I thank them)
the Rebels have publiſhed in print. And though I could have wiſhed their pains had been
ſpared, yet I will neither deny that thoſe things are Mine which they have ſet out in My
Name (only ſome words here and there are miſtaken, and ſome Comma's miſplaced, but
not much material) nor, as a good Proteſtant or honeſt man, bluſh for any of thoſe Papers.
Indeed as a diſcreet man I will not juſtifie My ſelf; and yet I would fain know him who
would be willing that the freedom of all his private Letters were publickly ſeen, as Mine
have now been. However, ſo that one clauſe be rightly underſtood, I care not much though
the reſt take their fortune: It is concerning the Mungrel Parliament. The truth is, that <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>'s
factiouſneſs at that time put Me ſomewhat out of patience, which made Me freely
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60710:84"/>
vent My diſpleaſure againſt thoſe of his party to My Wife; and the intention of that phraſe
was, that his Faction did what they could to make it come to that, by their raiſing and
fomenting of baſe Propoſitions. This is clearly evidenced by My following excuſe to Her,
for ſuffering thoſe people to trouble Her, the reaſon being, to eſchew thoſe greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which they had, and were more likely to cauſe here than there. I am now going to

condition, as I find expreſſed by your Letter of the eighth of this Month, and
your Declaration, both which I received upon Friday laſt. And the very ſame reaſon which
makes you diſcreetly and generouſly at this time forbear to preſs any thing to Me, hinders
Me likewiſe to make any particular profeſſions unto you, leſt it may be imagined that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Liberty ſhould now be the only Secretary to My thoughts. Yet thus much I cannot
but ſay, that as in all humane reaſon nothing but a free Perſonal Treaty with me can ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the unhappy diſtractions of theſe diſtreſſed Kingdoms; ſo, if that could once be had, I
would not doubt but that (by the grace of God) a happy Peace would ſoon follow: Such
force (I believe) true reaſon has in the hearts of all men, when it may be clearly and calmly
heard; and I am not aſhamed at all times to profeſs that it hath, and ſhall be alwaies want of
Underſtanding, not of will, if I do not yield to reaſon, whenſoever and from whomſoever I
hear it: and it were a ſtrange thing, if reaſon ſhould be leſs eſteemed becauſe it comes
from Me; which (truly) I do not expect from you, your Declaration ſeeming to Me (and
I hope your Actions will prove that I am not deceived) to be ſo well grounded upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ſincere advice; which is, really and conſtantly, without ſeeking private ends, to purſue
the publick profeſſions in your Declaration, as ſincere Chriſtians and good Subjects ought
to do, always remembring, that as the beſt foundation of Loyalty is Chriſtianity, ſo true
Chriſtianity teaches perfect Loyalty; for without this reciprocation neither is truly what

                     <p>BY what hath been ſaid, you may ſee how long We have laboured in the ſearch of
Peace: Do not you be diſcouraged to tread thoſe ways in all worthy means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
your ſelf to your Right, but prefer the way of Peace. Shew the greatneſs of your
Mind, rather to conquer your Enemies by pardoning, than by puniſhing. If you ſaw how
unmanly and unchriſtianly this implacable diſpoſition is in our ill-willers, you would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
that ſpirit. Cenſure Us not for having parted with too much of Our Own Right; the
price was great, the commodity was, Security to Us, Peace to Our People: And We are
confident another Parliament would remember how uſeful a King's Power is to a Peoples
Liberty; of how much We have deveſted Our ſelf, that We and they might meet again in a
due Parliamentary way, to agree the bounds for Prince and People. And in this give belief to
Our experience, never to affect more Greatneſs or Prerogative than what is really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally
for the good of your Subjects, (not ſatisfaction of Favourites.) And if you thus
uſe it, you will never want means to be a Father to all, and a bountiful Prince to any you
would be extraordinarily gracious unto. You may perceive all men truſt their treaſure where
it returns them intereſt: And if Princes, like the Sea, receive and repay all the freſh ſtreams
and rivers truſt them with, they will not grudge, but pride themſelves to make them up
an Ocean. Theſe conſiderations may make you a great Prince, as your Father is now a low
one: and your ſtate may be ſo much the more eſtabliſhed, as Mine hath been ſhaken.
For Subjects have learnt (We dare ſay) that Victories over their Princes are but triumphs
over themſelves, and ſo will be more unwilling to hearken to changes hereafter. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation are a ſober People, however at preſent under ſome infatuation. We know not
but this may be the laſt time We may ſpeak to you or the world publickly: We are
ſenſible into what hand We are fallen; and yet We bleſs God We have thoſe inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
that the malice of Our Enemies cannot perturb. We have learnt to own Our
ſelf by retiring into Our ſelf, and therefore can the better digeſt what befalls Us, not
doubting but God can reſtrain Our Enemies Malice, and turn their fierceneſs unto His
Praiſe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thank God that the buſineſs to be treated on at this time is of
ſuch a nature, that it needs no Eloquence to ſet it forth; for I am
neither able to do it, neither doth it ſtand with My Nature to
ſpend much time in words. It is no new buſineſs, being already
happily begun by My Father of bleſſed memory, who is with
God; therefore it needeth no Narrative: I hope in God you will
go on to maintain it as freely as you adviſed My Father to it.</p>
                     <p>It is true, He may ſeem to ſome to have been ſlack to begin ſo
juſt and ſo glorious a Work; but it was His Wiſdom that made
Him loth to begin a work, until He might find means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it: But after that He ſaw how much He was abuſed in the confidence He had with
other States, and was confirmed by your advice to run the courſe we are in, with your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to maintain it, I need not preſs to prove how willingly He took your Advice;
for the Preparations that are made are better able to declare it than I to ſpeak it: The aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thoſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Fleet that is ready for action, with the reſt of the Preparations
which I have only followed My Father in, do ſufficiently prove that He entred into this
Action.</p>
                     <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope that you do remember that you were pleaſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
Me to adviſe My Father to break off thoſe two Treaties that were on foot; ſo that I
cannot ſay I came hither a free unengaged man. It's true, I came into this buſineſs willingly
and freely, like a young man, and conſequently raſhly; but it was by your intereſt, your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement:
So that though it were done like a young man, yet I cannot repent Me of it; and
I think none can blame Me for it, knowing the love and fidelity you have born to your
King, having My ſelf likewiſe ſome little experience of your affections.</p>
                     <p>I pray you remember that this being My firſt Action, and begun by your advice and
entreaty, what a great diſhonour it were to you and Me, if this Action ſo begun ſhould fail
for that aſſiſtance you are able to give Me. Yet knowing the conſtancy of your love both to
Me and this Buſineſs, I needed not to have ſaid this, but only to ſhew what care and ſenſe I
have of your Honours and Mine own. I muſt entreat you likewiſe to conſider of the Times
we are in, how that I muſt adventure your lives (which I ſhould be loth to do) ſhould I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
you here long; and you muſt venture the Buſineſs, if you be ſlow in your reſolutions.
Wherefore I hope you will take ſuch grave Counſel, as you will expedite what you have
in hand to do; which will do Me and your ſelves an infinite deal of Honour: You, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your love to Me; and Me, that I may perfect that Work which My Father hath ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, becauſe ſome malicious men may, and, as I hear, have given out, that I am not

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60710:86"/>
were then in hand. Well you then foreſaw, that as well for regaining My diſpoſſeſſed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

had let My Father into it, ſo your aſſiſtance in a Parliamentary way to purſue it
ſhould not be wanting. That Aid you gave Him by Advice was for ſuccour of His Allies,
the guarding of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the home part, ſupplie of Munition, preparing and ſetting
forth of His Navy. A Councel you thought of, and appointed for the War, and Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
for iſſuing of the Moneys. And to begin this Work of your Advice, you gave three
Subſidies, and as many Fifteens, which with ſpeed were levied, and by direction of that
Councel of War (in which the preparation of this Navy was not the leaſt) disburſed.</p>
                     <p>It pleaſed God at the entrance of this Preparation (by your Advice begun) to call My
Father to His Mercy, whereby I entred as well to the care of your Deſign as His Crown.
I did not then, as Princes do, of Cuſtom and Formality re-aſſemble you, but that by your
further Advice and Aid I might be able to proceed in that which by your Counſels My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ingaged in. Your love to Me and forwardneſs to further thoſe Affairs you expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by a grant of two Subſidies yet ungathered; although I muſt aſſure you, by My ſelf
and others upon credit taken up, and aforehand disburſed, and far ſhort as yet to ſet forth
that Navy now preparing; as I have lately the eſtimate of thoſe of care, and who are ſtill
employed about it, whoſe particular of all expences about this Preparation ſhall be given

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, You are not ignorant that at your earneſt entreaty, the
twenty third of <hi>March</hi> ſixteen hundred twenty three, My Father (of Happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
firſt took up arms for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> for which purpoſe, by your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
He began to form a conſiderable Army, and to prepare a goodly Armado and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Royal. But Death intervening between Him and the atchievement, the War, with the
Crown, is devolved upon Me. To the proſecution whereof as I am obliged both in Nature
and Honour; ſo I queſtion not but, the ſame neceſſity continuing, you will cheriſh the
Action with the like affection, and further it with a ready Contribution.</p>
                     <p>True it is, You furniſhed My Father with affectionate Supplies; but they held no ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie
or proportion with the charge of ſo great an Enterpriſe: for thoſe your Donatives
are all disburſt to a peny; and I am inforced to ſummon you hither, to tell you, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Army advance nor the Fleet ſet forth without farther Aid.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, I pray you, the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are defixt upon Me; to whom I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ridiculous, as though I were unable to outgo Muſter and Oſtentation, if you now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
Me. Conſider, it is My firſt attempt; wherein if I ſuſtain a foil, it will blemiſh
all My future Honour.</p>
                     <p>If Mine cannot, let your own Reputation move you: Deliver and expedite Me fairly
out of this War wherewith you have incumbred (let it never be ſaid, whereinto you
have betrayed) Me.</p>
                     <p>I deſire therefore your ſpeedy Supplie: Speedy I call it, for elſe it will prove no Supply.
The Sun, you know, is entring into his declining point; ſo it will be ſoon too late to ſet
forth, when it will be rather not too ſoon to return. Again, I muſt mind you of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
now regnant in this City, which ſhould it (as ſo it may, and no breach of Priviledge
neither) arreſt any one Member of either Houſe, it ſoon would put a period both to Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                     <p>In ſumm, Three of the beſt Rhetoricians, Honour, Opportunity, and Safety, are all of a

                     <p>Perhaps it may be expected I ſhould ſay ſomething in way of account of My Religion,
as alſo of the temper and tenor of My future Government: But as I hope I have not been
guilty of any thing which may juſtly ſtart the leaſt queſtion in either; ſo I deſire you
would repoſe in this aſſurance, that I will in neither vary from thoſe Principles wherein I
have been inſtituted at the feet of that eminent <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> My late Father.</p>

take it for a full &amp; ſatisfactory Anſwer, and I thank them for it; and I hope you will
with all expedition take a courſe for performance thereof, the which will turn to your own

but for a Parentheſis in your Speech, and not a Condition; and yet, for anſwer to that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60710:86"/>

                     <p>I muſt let you know, that I will not allow any of My Servants to be queſtioned among

<hi>What ſhall be done to the man whom the King will honour?</hi> but now it hath been the labour of
ſome, to ſeek what may be done againſt him whom the King thinks fit to honour. I ſee
you ſpecially aim at the Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> I wonder what hath ſo altered your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

when he was an Inſtrument to break the Treaties, all of you (and yet I cannot ſay all,
for I know ſome of you are changed, but yet the Houſe of Commons is always the ſame)
did ſo much honour and reſpect him, that all the honour conferred on him was too little:
and what he hath done ſince to alter or change your minds I wote not; but can aſſure
you, he hath not medled or done any thing concerning the Publick or Commonwealth but
by ſpecial directions and appointment, and as My Servant; and is ſo far from gaining or
improving his Eſtate thereby, that I verily think he hath rather impaired the ſame.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, I have called you hither to day, I mean both Houſes of

                     <p>My Lords, you of the Upper Houſe, to give you thanks for your Care of the ſtate of the

Lords, I muſt not only give you thanks, but I muſt alſo avow, that if this Parliament do
not redound to the good of this Kingdom, which I pray God it may, it is not your faults.</p>
                     <p>And you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, I am ſorry that I may not juſtly give
the ſame thanks to you; but I muſt tell you, that I am come here to ſhew you your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and, as I may call it, Unparliamentary Proceedings in this Parliament. But I do not
deſpair, becauſe you ſhall ſee your faults ſo clearly by the Lord Keeper, that you may ſo
amend your Proceeding, that this Parliament ſhall end comfortably and happily, though
at the beginning it hath had ſome rubs.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt withal put you in mind a little of times paſt. You may remember that in the
time of My Bleſſed Father you did with your Counſel and perſwaſion prevail with My
Father and Me to break off the Treaties. I confeſs I was your Inſtrument for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
One was, the fitneſs of the time; the other, becauſe I was ſeconded by ſo great and
worthy a Body as the whole Body of Parliament. Then there was no body in ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with you as this man whom you ſeem now to touch, but indeed, My Father's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Mine. Now that you have all things according to your wiſhes, and that I
am ſo far ingaged that you think there is no retreat, now you begin to ſet the Dice, and
make your own Game. But I pray you be not deceived; it is not a Parliamentary way,
nor is it a way to deal with a King.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Coke</hi> told you, <hi>It was better to dye by a foreign Enemy than to be deſtroyed at home.</hi>
Indeed I think it is more Honour for a King to be invaded and almoſt deſtroyed by a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemy, than to be deſpiſed by His Own Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Remember that Parliaments are altogether in My Power for their Calling, Sitting, and
Diſſolution; therefore as I find the fruits of them good or evil, they are to continue, or
not to be. And remember that if in this time inſtead of mending your Errors, by delay you
perſiſt in your Errors, you make them greater and irreconcileable: whereas, on the other
ſide, if you do go on chearfully to mend them, and look to the diſtreſſed ſtate of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Affairs of the Kingdom as it lyeth now by this great Engagement, you will
do your ſelves honour, you ſhall incourage Me to go on with Parliaments, and I hope all
Chriſtendom ſhall feel the good of it.</p>

                     <p>MAſter Speaker, and you Gentlemen, When I ſent to you My laſt Meſſage, I did not
expect to Reply; for I intended to haſten you, not to find fault with you. I told

                     <p>The Queſtion is not now, What Liberty you have in diſpoſing of matters handled in

                     <p>You make a Proteſtation of your affection and zeal to My Prerogative, grounded upon
ſo good and juſt reaſons, that I muſt believe you: But I look that you uſe Me with the
like charity, to believe what I have declared more than once ſince your meeting, which
is, that I am as forward as you for the preſervation of your true Liberties. Let us not
ſpend ſo much time in this that may hazard both My Prerogative and your Liberties to
our Enemies.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, Go on ſpeedily with your buſineſs, without any fear or more Apologies,
for time calls faſt upon you, which will neither ſtay for you nor Me: Wherefore it is My

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, It may ſeem ſtrange that I come ſo ſuddenly to end this
Seſſion; therefore before I give My Aſſent to the Bills, I will tell you the cauſe;
though I muſt avow, I ow an account of My Actions to none but God alone.</p>
                     <p>It is known to every one, that a while ago the Houſe of Commons gave Me a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,
how acceptable every man may judge; and for the merit of it I will not call
that in queſtion, for I am ſure no wiſe man can juſtifie it.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince I am certainly informed that a ſecond Remonſtrance is preparing for Me, to
take away My profit of Tonnage and Poundage, (one of the chief Maintenances of the
Crown) by alledging, that I have given away My Right thereof by My Anſwer to your
Petition: This is ſo prejudicial unto Me, that I am forced to end this Seſſion ſome few
hours before I meant it; being not willing to receive any more Remonſtrances, to which
I muſt give a harſh Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>And ſince I ſee that even the Houſe of Commons begins already to make falſe conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of what I granted in your Petition, leſt it be worſe interpreted in the Countrey, I
will now make a Declaration concerning the true intent thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Profeſſion of both Houſes in the time of hammering this Petition was, no waies to
trench upon My Prerogative, ſaying, they had neither intention, nor power to hurt it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it muſt needs be conceived that I have granted no New, but only confirmed
the Antient Liberties of My Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Yet to ſhew the clearneſs of My intentions, that I neither repent nor mean to recede
from any thing I have promiſed you, I do here declare that thoſe things which have been
done, whereby men had ſome cauſe to ſuſpect the Liberty of the Subject to be intrench'd
upon (which indeed was the firſt and true ground of the Petition) ſhall not hereafter be
drawn into example to your prejudice: and in time to come, in the word of a King, you
ſhall not have the like cauſe to complain.</p>
                     <p>But as for Tonnage and Poundage, it is a thing I cannot want, and was never intended
by you to ask, never meant (I am ſure) by Me to grant.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I command you all that are here to take notice of what I have ſpoken at
this time, to be the true intent and meaning of what I granted you in your Petition: but
eſpecially you, My Lords the Judges; for to you only, under Me, belongs the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Laws: For none of the Houſes of Parliament, joynt or ſeparate, (what
new Doctrine ſoever may be raiſed) have any power either to make or declare a Law,
without My Conſent.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, The care I have to remove all Obſtacles that may hinder
the good correſpondencie between Me and this Parliament, is the cauſe I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you hither at this time; the particular occaſion being a complaint lately made in the
Lower-Houſe. And for you, My Lords, I am glad to take this and all other occaſions
whereby you may clearly underſtand both My Words and Actions: for as you are neareſt
in degree, ſo are you the fitteſt Witneſſes for Kings.</p>
                     <p>The Complaint I ſpeak of is, for ſtaying mens Goods that denied Tonnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:
And this may have an eaſy and ſhort Concluſion, if My Words and Actions be
rightly underſtood. For by paſſing the Bill, as Mine Anceſtors have had it, My by-paſt
Actions will be included, and My future Actions authorized: Which certainly would not
have been ſtuck upon, if men had not imagined that I had taken this duty as appertaining to
My Hereditary Prerogative: In which they are much deceived; for it ever was, and ſtill is
My meaning, by the gift of My People to enjoy it; and My intent in My Speech at the
end of the laſt Seſſion was, not to challenge Tonnage and Poundage as of Right, but <hi>de
bene eſſe,</hi> ſhewing you the Neceſſity, not the Right, by which I was to take it, until I had
it granted unto Me, aſſuring My ſelf (according to your general profeſſions) that you
wanted time, not will, to grant it unto Me.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore now having opportunity, I expect that without loſs of time you make good
your profeſſions, and ſo by paſſing the Bill, put an end to all Queſtions ariſing from this
ſubject; eſpecially ſince I have cleared all ſcruples that may trouble you in this buſineſs.</p>

                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60710:88"/>
To conclude, Let us not be jealous of one anothers Actions; for if I had been eaſily
moved at every occaſion, the Order made on Wedneſday laſt might have made Me ſtartle,
there being ſome ſhew to ſuſpect that you had given your ſelves the liberty to be Inquirers
after Complaints, the words of your Order being ſomewhat largely penned: but looking
into your Actions, I find you here only Complainers, not ſeeking Complaints; for I am
certain you neither intend nor deſire the liberty to be Inquiſitors after mens Actions before
particular Complaints be made.</p>
                     <p>This I have ſpoken, to ſhew how ſlow I am to believe harſhly of your Proceedings:
likewiſe to aſſure you, that the Houſes Reſolution, not particular mens ſpeeches, ſhall make
Me judge well or ill: Not doubting but, according to mine example, you will be deaf to
ill reports concerning Me, until My Words and Actions ſpeak for themſelves; but, this
Seſſion beginning with Confidence one towards the other, it may end with a perfect
good underſtanding between us; which God grant.</p>

                     <p>YOur Declaration being ſomewhat long, may by reaſon require ſome time to reply

Therefore I ſhall give you ſome ſhort Notes upon it.</p>
                     <p>I cannot think that, whereas you alledge that the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage was
brought in againſt the Priviledge of your Houſe, that you will offer to take ſo much Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
from any one of your Members, as not to allow them the liberty to bring in any
Bill whatſoever; though it be in your power when it is brought in, to do with it what
you think good. And I cannot imagine how, coming hither only by My Power, and to treat
of things I propound unto you, you can deny Me that Prerogative to recommend or offer
any Bill unto you. Though in this particular I muſt profeſs, that this Bill was not to have
been offered you in My Name, as that Member of your Houſe can bear Me witneſs.</p>
                     <p>As for the cauſe of delay of My buſineſs being Religion, there is none of you ſhall have
a greater care for the true preſervation of it than My ſelf; which ſince it is confeſſed by
your Anſwer, ye muſt either think I want Power, (which cannot be) or that I am very
ill-counſelled, if it be in ſuch danger as you affirm. Though I may ſay much of this point,
I will ſay no more, but that for all this I ſhall not ſtop My Ears unto you upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
ſo that in form and matter you tranſgreſs not your limits.</p>
                     <p>As for Tonnage and Poundage, I do not deſire it out of greedineſs (being perſwaded
you will make no ſtop in it when you take it in hand) as out of a deſire to put an end to
all Queſtions that daily ariſe between Me and ſome of My Subjects; thinking it a ſtrange
thing, if you ſhould give ear unto thoſe Complaints, and not take the ſure and ſpeedy
way to decide them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I muſt think it ſtrange, that this buſineſs of Religion ſhould be only a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of My Affairs, whereas I am certainly informed, that all other things go on according
to their ordinary courſe. Therefore I muſt ſtill be inſtant with you, that you proceed
with this buſineſs of Tonnage and Poundage with diligence; not looking to be denied in
ſo juſt a deſire. And you muſt not think it much, if finding you ſlack, I ſhall give you
ſuch further quickening as I find cauſe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, I never came here upon ſo unpleaſing an occaſion, it being the Diſſolution
of a Parliament. Therefore men may have ſome cauſe to wonder, why I ſhould
not rather chuſe to do this by Commiſſion, it being a general Maxime of Kings, to leave
harſh Commands to their Miniſters, Themſelves only executing pleaſing things. Yet
conſidering that Juſtice as well conſiſts in reward and praiſe of Vertue as puniſhing of
Vice, I thought it neceſſary to come here to day, to declare to you, My Lords, and all
the world, that it was merely the undutiful and ſeditious carriage of the Lower Houſe
that hath cauſed the Diſſolution of this Parliament; and that You, My Lords, are ſo far
from being cauſes of it, that I take as much Comfort in your dutiful demeanours as I am
juſtly diſtaſted with their Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Yet to avoid miſtakings, let Me tell you, that it is ſo far from Me to adjudge all that
Houſe guilty, that I know there are many there as dutiful Subjects as any in the world;
it being but ſome few Vipers among them that caſt this Miſt of undutifulneſs over moſt
of their Eyes. Yet to ſay truth, there was a good number there that would not be infected
with this Contagion: inſomuch that ſome did expreſs their duties in ſpeaking, which was
the general fault of the Houſe the laſt day.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, As theſe Vipers muſt look for their reward of puniſhment; ſo you, My
Lords, may juſtly expect from Me that Favour and Protection that a Good King oweth

                     </p>
                     <p>How, contrary to His expectation, the Houſe of Commons having held Conſultation of matter
of Religion, Property of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament, and voted ſome things concerning
thoſe three Heads, had therefore given them the precedence before the matter of His Supply. That
His Neceſſities were ſuch, they could not bear delay. That whatſoever He had by the Lord Keeper
promiſed, He would perform, if the Houſe of Commons would truſt Him.</p>
                     <p>For Religion, that His Heart and Conſcience went together with the Religion eſtabliſhed in the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and He would give Order to His Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, that no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in matter of Religion ſhould creep in.</p>
                     <p>For the Ship-money, that He never made or intended to make any profit to Himſelf of it, but
only to preſerve the Dominion of the Seas; which was ſo neceſſary, that without it the Kingdom
could not ſubſiſt: But for the way and means, by Ship-money, or otherwiſe, He left it to them.</p>
                     <p>For Property of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament, He ever intended His People ſhould injoy

not Property of Goods and Liberty of Perſons, they could be neither rich nor free.</p>
                     <p>That if the Houſe of Commons would not firſt truſt Him, all His Affairs would be diſordered,
and His buſineſs loſt. That though they truſted Him in part at firſt, yet before the Parliament
ended He muſt totally truſt them; and in concluſion, they muſt, for execution of all things, wholly
truſt Him. Therefore ſince the matter was no more than who ſhould be firſt truſted, and that the
truſt of Him firſt was but a trust in part; He deſired the Lords to take into their conſideration
His and their own Honour, the Safety and Welfare of this Kingdom, with the great Danger it
was in, and that they would by their Advice diſpoſe the Houſe of Commons to give His Supply
the precedence before the Grievances.</p>

                     <head>XX. To the Lords and Commons, at the Diſſolving of His Fourth Parliament,
at WESTMINSTER, <date>May 5. MDCXL.</date>
                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, There can no occaſion of My coming to this Houſe be ſo unpleaſing to
Me as this is at this time. The fear of doing that which I am to do at this day
made Me not long agoe come to this Houſe, where I expreſſed as well My fears, as the
remedies I thought neceſſary for the eſchewing of it. Unto which I muſt confeſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that you, My Lords of the Higher Houſe, did give me ſo willing an ear,
and with ſuch affection did ſhew your ſelves thereafter, that certainly I may ſay, if there
had been any means to have given an happy end to this Parliament, you took it: So that
it was neither your Lordſhips fault nor Mine, that it is not ſo. Therefore in the firſt
place I muſt give your Lordſhips thanks for your good endeavours.</p>
                     <p>I hope you remember what My Lord Keeper ſaid to you the firſt day of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in My Name; what likewiſe he ſaid in the Banquetting-Houſe in <hi>White-Hall;</hi>
and what I lately ſaid to you in this place My ſelf. I name all this unto you, not in
doubt that you do not well remember it, but to ſhew, that I never ſaid any thing in way
of favour to My People, but that, by the Grace of God, I will really and punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it.</p>
                     <p>I know that they have inſiſted very much on Grievances, and I will not ſay but that
there may be ſome; though I will confidently affirm, that there are not by many degrees
ſo many as the publick voice doth make them. Wherefore I deſire you to take notice,
now eſpecially at this time, that out of Parliament I ſhall be as ready (if not more willing)
to hear and redreſs any juſt Grievances as in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing which is much ſpoken of, though not ſo much inſiſted on as others,
and that is Religion: Concerning which albeit I expreſſed My ſelf fully the laſt day in
this place to your Lordſhips, yet I think it fit again on this occaſion to tell you, that as I
am moſt concerned, ſo I ſhall be moſt careful to preſerve that purity of Religion which,
I thank God, is ſo well eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that as well out as in
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, I ſhall not trouble you long with words, it being not My faſhion: wherefore
to conclude, What I offered the laſt day to the Houſe of Commons I think is well known
to you all, as likewiſe how they accepted it; which I deſire not to remember, but wiſh that
they had remembred, how at firſt they were told, in My Name, by My Lord Keeper, That
Delay was the worſt kind of Denial. Yet I will not lay this fault on the whole Houſe, for I
will not judge ſo uncharitably of thoſe whom for the moſt part I take to be Loyal and well-affected
Subjects; but that it hath been the malicious cunning of ſome few ſeditiouſly-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
men that hath been the cauſe of this Miſunderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now end as I began, in giving your Lordſhips thanks for your affection ſhewed to
Me at this time; deſiring you to go on to aſſiſt Me in the maintaining of that Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that is truly Mine. And as for the Liberty of the People, that they now ſo much ſeem to
ſtartle at, know, My Lords, that no King in the World ſhall be more careful to maintain
them in the Property of their Goods, Liberty of their Perſons, and true Religion, than I
ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>And now, My Lord Keeper, do what I have commanded you.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords, Upon ſudden Invaſions, where the dangers are near and inſtant, it hath
been the cuſtom of My Predeceſſors to aſſemble the Great Council of the Peers,
by their Advice and Aſſiſtance to give a timely remedy to ſuch evils as cannot admit a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
ſo long as muſt of neceſſity be allowed for the aſſembling the Parliament. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our condition at this time, and an Army of Rebels lodged within the Kingdom, I
thought it moſt fit to conform My ſelf to the practice of My Predeceſſors in like caſes, that
with your advice and aſſiſtance we might joyntly proceed to the chaſtiſement of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies,
and ſecuring of Our good Subjects.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place I muſt let you know, that I deſire nothing more than to be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of My People; and to that end I have of My ſelf reſolved to call a Parliament,
having already given order to My Lord Keeper to iſſue out the Writs inſtantly, ſo that
the Parliament may be aſſembled by the third of <hi>November</hi> next: Whither if My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
bring the like good affections as I do, it ſhall not fail on My part to make it a happy
Meeting.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time there are two points to be conſidered, wherein I ſhall deſire your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which indeed is the chief cauſe of your Meeting.</p>

Firſt, What Anſwer to give to the Petition of the Rebels, and in what manner to
treat with them. Of which that you may give a ſure judgement, I have ordered that
your Lordſhips ſhall be clearly and truly informed of the ſtate of the whole buſineſs; and
upon what reaſons the Advices that My Privy Counſel unanimouſly gave Me were
grounded.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, How My Army ſhall be kept on foot and maintained till the ſupplies of a
Parliament may be had. For ſo long as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army remains in <hi>England,</hi> I think no
man will counſel Me to disband Mine: for that would be an unſpeakable loſs to all this
part of the Kingdom, by ſubjecting them to the greedy appetite of the Rebels; beſide
the unſpeakable diſhonour that would thereby fall upon this Nation.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords, The knowledge that I had of the Deſigns of My <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects was
the cauſe of My calling the laſt Aſſembly of Parliament; wherein had I been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
I ſincerely think that things had not fallen out as now we ſee. But it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that men are ſo ſlow to believe that ſo great a Sedition ſhould be raiſed on ſo little
ground.</p>
                     <p>But now, My Lords and Gentlemen, the Honour and Safety of this Kingdom lying ſo
nearly at ſtake, I am reſolved to put My ſelf freely and clearly on the love and affections
of My <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, as thoſe of My Lords that did wait on Me at <hi>York</hi> very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I there declared. Therefore, My Lords, I ſhall not mention Mine own Intereſt,
or that Support I might juſtly expect from you, till the Common Safety be ſecured:
Though I muſt tell you, I am not aſhamed to ſay, thoſe charges I have been at have been
meerly for the ſecuring and good of this Kingdom, though the ſucceſs hath not been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to My deſires.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I ſhall only deſire you to conſider the beſt way both for the ſafety and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Kingdom; wherein are two things chiefly conſiderable: Firſt, the chaſing
out of the Rebels; and ſecondly, that other in ſatisfying your juſt Grievances; wherein
I ſhall promiſe you to concur ſo heartily and clearly with you, that all the world may ſee,
My intentions have ever been, and ſhall be, to make this a glorious and flouriſhing
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>There are only Two things more that I ſhall mention to you.</p>
                     <p>The one is, to tell you, that the lone of Money which I lately had from the City of
<hi>London,</hi> wherein the Lords that waited on Me at <hi>York</hi> aſſiſted Me, will only maintain
My Army for two months, from the beginning of that time it was granted. Now, My
Lords and Gentlemen, I leave it to your conſiderations, what diſhonour and miſchief it
might be, in caſe for want of Money My Army be disbanded before the Rebels be put out
of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſecuring the Calamities the Northern People endure at this time, and
ſo long as the Treaty is on foot: And in this I may ſay, not only they, but all this
Kingdom will ſuffer the harm. Therefore I leave this alſo to your Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>For the ordering of theſe Great Affairs whereof you are to treat at this time, I am ſo
confident of your love to Me, and that your care is ſuch for the Honour and Safety of the
Kingdom, that I ſhall freely and willingly leave to you where to begin: Only this, that
you may the better know the ſtate of all the Affairs, I have commanded My Lord
Keeper to give you a ſhort and free account of thoſe things that have happened in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim;
with this Proteſtation, that if his account be not ſatisfactory as it ought to be, I
ſhall, whenſoever you deſire it, give you a full and perfect account of every particular.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I deſire of you, as one of the greateſt means to make this an happy
Parliament, That you on your parts, as I on Mine, lay aſide all ſuſpicion one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As I promiſed My Lords at <hi>York,</hi> it ſhall not be My fault, if this be not a happy
and good Parliament.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, I do expect that you will haſtily make Relation to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of thoſe Great Affairs for which I have called you hither at this time, and
of the truſt I have repoſed in them, and how freely I put My ſelf on their love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
at this time: And that you may know the better how to do ſo, I ſhall explain My
ſelf concerning one thing I ſpake the laſt day.</p>
                     <p>I told you, the Rebels muſt be put out of this Kingdom. 'Tis true, I muſt needs call
them ſo, ſo long as they have an Army that does invade us, although I am under Treaty
with them, and under My Great Seal do call them Subjects; and ſo they are too.</p>

But the ſtate of My Affairs in ſhort is this: It's true, I did expect, when I did will My
Lords and Great ones to be at <hi>York,</hi> to have given a gracious Anſwer to all their Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for I was in good hope by their Wiſdoms and Aſſiſtances to have made an end of that
buſineſs: but I muſt tell you that My Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo delay them, that it was not
poſſible to end there. Therefore I can no ways blame My Lords that were at <hi>Rippon,</hi> that
the Treaty was not ended; but muſt thank them for their pains and induſtry. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
had they as much power as affections, I ſhould by this time have brought theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to a happy period. So that now the Treaty is tranſported from <hi>Rippon</hi> to <hi>London;</hi>
where I ſhall conclude nothing without your knowledge, and I doubt not but by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
for I do not deſire to have this great Work done in a corner; for I ſhall lay open
all the ſteps of this Miſunderſtanding, and the cauſes of the great Differences between Me
and My Subjects of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And I doubt not but by your aſſiſtance to make them know
their Duty, and alſo by your aſſiſtance to make them return whether they will or no.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes, The principal cauſe of My
coming here at this time is by reaſon of the ſlow proceedings in Parliament,
touching which is a great deal of inconvenience: Therefore I think it very neceſſary to
lay before you the ſtate of My Affairs as they now ſtand, thereby to haſten, not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
your proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I muſt remember you that there are two Armies in the Kingdom, in a manner
maintained by you; the very naming of which doth more clearly ſhew the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereof than a better tongue than Mine can expreſs. Therefore in the firſt place I
ſhall commend unto you the quick diſpatch of that buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I muſt recommend unto you the ſtate of My Navy and Forts; the
condition of both which is ſo well known unto you, that I need not tell you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
Only thus much, they are the walls and defence of this Kingdom, which if out of
order, all men may eaſily judge what encouragement it will be to our Enemies, and
what diſheartning to our Friends.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, and not the leaſt to be conſidered, I muſt lay before you the Diſtractions
that are at this preſent occaſioned through the connivence of Parliament: for there are
ſome men that, more maliciouſly than ignorantly, will put no difference between Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Alteration of Government. Hence it cometh that Divine Service is irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
interrupted; and Petitions in an ill way given in, neither diſputed nor denied.</p>
                     <p>But I will enter into no more particulars, but ſhew you a way of Remedy, by ſhewing
you My clear intentions, and ſome Rocks that may hinder this Good Work.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall willingly and chearfully concur with you for the Reformation of all Innovations
both in Church and Commonwealth; and conſequently, that all Courts of Juſtice may
be reformed according to Law. For My intention is clearly to reduce all things to the
beſt and pureſt times, as they were in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, whatſoever part of My Revenue ſhall be found illegal or heavy to My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
I ſhall be willing to lay down, truſting in their Affections.</p>
                     <p>Having thus clearly and ſhortly ſet down My intentions, I will ſhew you ſome Rubs;
and muſt needs take notice of ſome very ſtrange (I know not what term to give them)
Petitions, given in in the names of divers Counties againſt the preſent eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, and of the great threatnings againſt the Biſhops, that they will
make them to be but Cyphers, or at leaſt their Voices to be taken away.</p>
                     <p>Now I muſt tell you, that I make a great difference between Reformation and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government: Though I am for the firſt, I cannot give way to the latter.</p>
                     <p>If ſome of them have overſtretched their power, and incroached too much upon the
Temporalty, if it be ſo, I ſhall not be unwilling theſe things ſhould be redreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as all other Abuſes, according to the wiſdom of former times: So far I ſhall go
with you. Nay further, if upon ſerious debate you ſhall ſhew Me that Biſhops have
ſome Temporal Authority inconvenient to the State, and not ſo neceſſary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church and upholding Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, I ſhall not be unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
them to lay it down. But this muſt not be underſtood, that I ſhall any way conſent
that their Voices in Parliament ſhould be taken away: For in all the times of My Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
ſince the Conqueſt and before, they have enjoyed it; and I am bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them in it, as one of the Fundamental Conſtitutions of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>There is another Rock you are on, not in Subſtance, but in Form; yet the Form is ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,
that unleſs it be reformed, it will marr the Subſtance.</p>

they fail, or ſhall return, then they ſhall be proceeded againſt according to the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Roſetti,</hi> I give you to underſtand that the Queen hath always aſſured Me,
that to Her knowledge he hath no Commiſſion, but only to retain a Perſonal Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

is warranted to Her by the Articles of Marriage, which gave Her a full liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

to be this particular Caſe. Yet ſeeing that I am preſſed by both Houſes to give way to
this, becauſe I will avoid the inconvenience of giving ſo great diſcontent to My People as
I conceive this Mercy may produce, therefore I do remit this particular caſe to both the

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons:
You may remember, when both Houſes were with Me at the Banquetting-Houſe
at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> I did declare unto you two Rocks I wiſhed you to eſchew: This is one of
them, and of that conſequence, that I think never Bill paſſed here in this Houſe of more
favour to the Subject than this is. And if the other Rock be as happily paſſed over as this
ſhall be at this time, I do not know what you can ask, for ought I can ſee, at this time,
that I can make any queſtion to yield unto.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I mention this, to ſhew unto you the ſenſe that I have of this Bill, and the
Obligation, as I may ſay, that you have to Me for it. For hitherto, to ſpeak freely, I had
no great incouragement to do it; if I ſhould look to the outward face of your Actions
or Proceedings, and not to the inward Intentions of your hearts, I might make queſtion of
doing it.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto you have gone on in that which concerns your ſelves to amend, and not in
thoſe things that nearly concern the ſtrength of this Kingdom, neither for the State, nor
My Own particular.</p>
                     <p>This I mention, not to reproach you, but to ſhew you the ſtate of things as they are.
You have taken the Government all in pieces, and I may ſay it is almoſt off the Hinges:
A skilful Watch-maker, to make clean his Watch, will take it aſunder, and when it is
put together it will go the better; ſo that he leave not out one pin of it.</p>
                     <p>Now as I have done all this on My part, you know what to do on yours: And I hope
you ſhall ſee clearly, that I have performed really what I expreſſed to you at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Parliament, of the great truſt I have of your affections to Me. And this is
the great expreſſion of truſt, that before you do any thing for Me, I do put ſuch a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, For Anſwer to your Deſires, I ſay,
Firſt, Concerning the removal of Papiſts from Court, I am ſure you all know
what legal truſt the Crown hath in this particular: and therefore I need not ſay any thing
to give you aſſurance that I ſhall uſe it ſo that there ſhall be no juſt cauſe of Scandal.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For diſarming of Papiſts, I am very well content it ſhall be done according
to Law.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, you muſt underſtand, I am already upon Conſultation
how to disband it; but I find many difficulties in it: therefore I hold it not only fit to
wiſh it, but to ſhew the way how it may be conveniently done.</p>
                     <p>This is not all I deſire; but ſince you have mentioned the disbanding of Armies, it is
My Duty to My Country, to wiſh for disbanding of all Armies, and to reſtore the ſame
Peace to all My three Kigndoms that the King My Father did leave them in: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you, as you will anſwer the ſame to God and to your Country, to join with Me hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and ſpeedily for the disbanding of the two Armies in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a very good time to ſpeak of it; and there are but two waies to do it. One is,
to anſwer their Petitions: and the ſecond is, to provide Monies. You are Maſters of the
one, and, with Me, you are Judges of the other. And you ſhall not be readier (nor ſo

                     </head>
                     <p>MY Lords, I had no intention to have ſpoken to you of this buſineſs this day, which
is the great buſineſs concerning My Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> becauſe I would do nothing
that might ſerve to hinder your occaſions. But now it comes ſo to paſs, that ſeeing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
I muſt have part in the Judgment, I think it moſt neceſſary for Me to declare
My Conſcience therein.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure you all know, I have been preſent at the hearing of this great Caſe from the
one end to the other: And I muſt tell you, that in My Conſcience I cannot condemn
him of High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>It is not fit for Me to argue this buſineſs; I am ſure you will not expect that: A Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Doctrine beſt becomes the Mouth of a Prince. Yet I muſt tell you three Truths,
which I am ſure no man can tell ſo well as My ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That I had never any intention of bringing over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army into <hi>England,</hi>
nor ever was adviſed by any body ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That there was never any debate before Me, either in Publick Counſel or
Private Committee, of the diſloyalty of my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, nor ever had I any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That I never was counſelled by any to alter the leaſt of any of the Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> much leſs to alter all the Laws. Nay, I tell you this, I think no body durſt
ever be ſo impudent as to move Me to it: For if they had, I ſhould have made them ſuch
an Example, and put ſuch a mark upon them, that all Poſterity ſhould know My inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by it; for My intention was ever to govern by the Law, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>I deſire to be rightly underſtood: for though I tell you in My Conſcience I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him of High Treaſon, yet I cannot ſay I can clear him of Miſdemeanours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hope you may find out a way to ſatisfie Juſtice and your own fears, and not oppreſs
My Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, I hope you know what a tender thing Conſcience is; and I muſt declare unto
you, that to ſatisfie the People I would do great matters: but in this of Conſcience, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fear nor any other reſpect whatſoever ſhall ever make Me go againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Certainly I have not deſerved ſo ill of this Parliament at this time, that they ſhould preſs
Me in this tender; therefore I cannot ſuſpect you will go about it. Nay, for Miſdeamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
I am ſo clear in them, that, though I will not chalk out the way, yet I will ſhew
you, that I think My Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> is not fit hereafter to ſerve Me or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
in any place of Truſt, no not ſo much as a Conſtable. Therefore I leave it to you,
My Lords, to find out ſome ſuch way as to bring Me out of this Streight, and keep your
ſelves and the Kingdom from ſuch inconveniences.</p>

                     <p>I Do very willingly accept your offer made at this time as a teſtimony of your Love and
beginning of your dutiful affections to Me; and I no waies doubt but that you will
perform that which you have intimated unto Me, and that in due time you will perform
the reſt, when you have leiſure.</p>
                     <p>I do not doubt likewiſe, but that in paſſing this Bill you will ſee a teſtimony of the
truſt and confidence I have in your affections; as alſo that I omit no occaſion whereby I
may ſhew that affection to My People that I deſire My People would ſhew to Me: as in
this Parliament hitherto, no body can ſay but that I have ſought occaſions both to ſhew
My affections unto them, and to remove diſputes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in this particular Bill I hope you will know, that I do freely and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give over the Right that My Predeceſſors have ever challenged unto Them, though, I
confeſs, diſputed, but yet they did never yield in Their times. Therefore you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this but a mark of My confidence, to put My ſelf wholly upon the love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of My People for My Subſiſtence. And therefore I hope that in proſecution of
this you will go on as you have ſaid; and that though you have rumours of jealouſies

extraordinary way, I confeſs I never underſtood it otherwiſe than as having relation to the

                     <p>I Come to do the Office which I forbore to do on Saturday laſt, to give determination
to theſe two Bills. But before I do it, I muſt tell you, that I cannot but be very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of thoſe reports of diſcontent that I hear ſome have taken for not giving My conſent
on Saturday. Me thinks it ſeems ſtrange that any one ſhould think, I could paſs two
Bills of that importance that theſe were without taking ſome fit time to conſider of
them; for it is no leſs than to alter, in a great meaſure, thoſe Fundamental Laws, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
and Civil, which many of My Predeceſſors have eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>If you conſider what I have done this Parliament, diſcontent will not ſit in your hearts:
For I hope you remember that I have granted, That the Judges hereafter ſhall hold their
places <hi>quam diu ſe bene geſſerint;</hi> I have bounded the Foreſts, not according to My
Right, but according to late Cuſtoms; I have eſtabliſhed the Property of the Subjects,
witneſs the free giving, not taking away, the Ship-money; I have eſtabliſhed by Act of
Parliament the Property of the Subject in Tonnage and Poundage, which never was done
in any of My Predeceſſors times; I have granted a Law for Triennial Parliaments, and
given way to an Act for the ſecuring of Moneys advanced for the disbanding of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
I have given free courſe of Juſtice againſt Delinquents; I have put the Law in
execution againſt Papiſts:</p>
                     <p>Nay, I have given way to every thing that you have asked of Me; and therefore Me
thinks you ſhould not wonder if in ſome things I begin to refuſe. But I hope it ſhall not
hinder your progreſs in your great affairs, and I will not ſtick upon trivial matters to
give you content. I hope you are ſenſible of theſe beneficial favours beſtowed on you at
this time.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, You know that by your conſent there is a prefixed time ſet for my going
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there is an abſolute neceſſity for it; I do not know but that things may
ſo fall that it may be ſhortned: Therefore I hope you will haſten the diſpatching of thoſe
great buſineſſes that now are neceſſary to be done, and leave trivial and ſuperficial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to another meeting.</p>
                     <p>For My part, I ſhall omit nothing that may give you juſt contentment, and ſtudy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Me and My People.</p>
                     <p>It is concerning My Nephew the Prince Elector Palatine, who having deſired Me and
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to give way to a Writing concerning the Deit at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> with the
Emperour, I could not but ſend My Ambaſſador to aſſiſt him, though I am afraid I
ſhall not have ſo good an Anſwer as I expect; which My Nephew foreſeeing, hath deſired
Me, for the better countenance of the ſame, to make a Manifeſto in My Name: which
is a thing of great conſequence, and ſhould I do it alone, without the advice of My Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it would rather be a ſcorn than otherwiſe: Therefore I do propoſe it unto you,
that if you will adviſe Me to it, I think it were very fit to be publiſhed in My Name.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, There hath nothing been ſo diſpleaſing to Me as thoſe
unlucky Differences which have happened between Me and My People; and
nothing that I have more deſired than to ſee this day, wherein I hope not only to ſettle
theſe unhappy miſtakings, but rightly to know and to be known of My Native

                     <p>I need not tell you (for I think it is well known to moſt) what difficulties I have
paſſed through and overcome to be here at this preſent: Yet this I will ſay, If Love to
My Native Countrey had not been a chief motive to this journey, other reſpects might
eaſily have found a ſhift to do that by a Commiſſion which I am come to perform My
ſelf. And this conſidered, I cannot doubt of ſuch real teſtimonies of your affections for
the maintenance of that Royal Power which I enjoy after an hundred and eight Deſcents,
and which you have profeſſed to maintain, and to which your own National Oath doth
oblige you, that I ſhall not think any pains ill-beſtowed.</p>
                     <p>Now the end of My coming is ſhortly this, to perfect whatſoever I have promiſed, and
withal to quiet the Diſtractions which have and may fall out amongſt you: And this I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60710:93"/>
mind not ſuperficially, but fully and chearfully to perform. For I aſſure you that I can
do nothing with more chearfulneſs, than to give My People a general ſatisfaction. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not offering to endear My ſelf unto you in words (which indeed is not My way) I
deſire in the firſt place to ſettle that which concerns the Religion and juſt Liberties of this
My Native Countrey, before I proceed to any other Act.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, I think it fit after, ſo long abſence, at this firſt occaſion
to ſpeak a few words unto you: but it is no ways in anſwer to Maſter Speaker's
Learned Speech.</p>
                     <p>Albeit I have ſtayed longer than I expected to have done when I went away; yet in
this I have kept My promiſe with you, that I have made all the haſt back again that the
ſetling of My <hi>Scotch</hi> affairs couldany ways permit. In which I have had ſo good ſucceſs,
that I will confidently affirm to you, that I have left that Nation a moſt peaceable and
contented People: So that although I have a little miſreckoned in Time, yet I was not
deceived in My End.</p>
                     <p>But if I have deceived your expectations a little in the time of My return, yet I am
aſſured that My expectation is as much and more deceived in the condition wherein I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to have found ſome buſineſſes at My return. For ſince that before My going I ſetled
the Liberties of My Subjects, and gave the Law a free and orderly courſe, I expected to
have found My People reaping the fruits of theſe benefits, by living in quietneſs and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of mind: But in ſtead of this, I find them diſturbed with Jealouſies, Frights,
and Alarms of dangerous deſigns and plots; in conſequence of which Guards have been
ſet to defend both Houſes. I ſay not this as in doubt that My Subjects affections are any
way leſſened to Me in this time of My abſence, for I cannot but remember to My great
comfort, the joyful reception I had now at My Entry into <hi>London;</hi> but rather, as I hope
that My preſence will eaſily diſperſe theſe fears. For I bring as perfect and true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to My People as ever Prince did, or as good Subjects can poſſibly deſire. And I am ſo
far from repenting Me of any Act I have done this Seſſion for the good of My People,
that I proteſt if it were to do again, I would do it; and will yet grant what elſe can be
juſtly deſired for ſatisfaction in point of Liberties, or in maintenance of the true Religion
that is here eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Now I have but one particular to recommend unto you at this time, It is <hi>Ireland;</hi> for
which though I doubt not your care, yet Me thinks the preparations for it go but ſlowly
on. The occaſion is the fitter for Me now to mention it, becauſe of the arrival of two Lords
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who come inſtructed from My Council there (who now by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have full power for that purpoſe) to anſwer that Demand which it pleaſed both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to make of Me by way of Petition that met Me at <hi>Barwick,</hi> and which the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
ſent back by My Command to My <hi>Scotch</hi> Council: Therefore My deſire is, that
both Houſes would appoint a ſelect Committee to end this buſineſs with theſe Noblemen.</p>
                     <p>I muſt conclude in telling you, that I ſeek My Peoples Happineſs; for their flouriſhing

His Power, than I ſhall be; yet you muſt know, that in caſes of Treaſon no perſon hath
a Priviledge. And therefore I am come to know if any of thoſe perſons that were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are here. For I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, that ſo long as thoſe perſons that I have
accuſed (for no ſlight crime, but for Treaſon) are here, I cannot expect that this Houſe
can be in the right way that I do heartily wiſh it. Therefore I am come to tell you, that
I muſt have them whereſoever I find them.</p>
                     <p>Well, ſithence I ſee all the Birds are flown, I do expect from you, that you ſhall ſend them
unto Me as ſoon as they return hither. But I aſſure you in the word of a King, I never did
intend any force, but ſhall proceed againſt them in a legal and fair way, for I never meant
any other.</p>
                     <p>And now ſithence I ſee I cannot do what I came for, I think this no unfit occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
what I have ſaid formerly, That whatſoever I have done in favour and to the good
of My Subjects, I do mean to maintain it.</p>
                     <p>I will trouble you no more, but tell you, I do expect, as ſoon as they do come to the
Houſe, you will ſend them to Me; otherwiſe I muſt take My Own courſe to find them.</p>

                     <p>I Am confident that you expect not I ſhould give you a ſpeedy Anſwer to this ſtrange

                     <p>As concerning the grounds of your Fears and Jealouſies, I will take time to anſwer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
and doubt not but I ſhall do it to the ſatisfaction of all the world. God in his

then I ſhall ſtand right in the eyes of all My People. In the mean time I muſt tell you,
that I rather expected a vindication from the imputation laid on Me in Maſter <hi>Pym</hi>'s

                     <p>For My Fears and Doubts, I did not think they ſhould have been thought ſo groundleſs
or trivial, while ſo many ſeditious Pamphlets and Sermons are looked upon, and ſo great
Tumults remembred, unpuniſhed, uninquired into. I ſtill confeſs My Fears, and call
God to witneſs, that they are greater for the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, My People and
Laws, than for My own Rights or Safety; though I muſt tell you, I conceive that none
of theſe are free from danger.</p>
                     <p>What would you have? Have I violated your Laws? Have I denied to paſs any one
Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of My Subjects? I do not ask you what you have done for Me.</p>
                     <p>Have any of My People been tranſported with Fears and Apprehenſions? I have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as free and general a Pardon as your ſelves can deviſe. All this conſidered, There is a

<date>April 5. MDCXLII.</date>
                     </head>
                     <p>MAſter Sheriff, and Gentlemen, I believe you expect not a preſent and particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to your Petition, becauſe it is new to Me. Only in general I muſt tell you, that
I ſee by it that I am not deceived in the Confidence I have in the affections of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to my Perſon and State: And I aſſure you, that I will not deceive your Confidence,
which at this time you have declared in your Petition to have in Me, and I am glad to ſee
that it is not upon miſtaken grounds, as other Petitions have been to Me ſince I came to
this place. Concerning which let Me obſerve unto you, that my Anſwers were to clear
thoſe miſtakings: for I never did go about to puniſh or diſcourage them from Petitioning
to Me in an humble way, though the ſubject did not agree with My ſenſe; albeit within
the memory of man people have been diſcouraged and threatned to be puniſhed for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve that your Petition is ſo modeſt, that it doth not mention any particular for
your own good; which indeed I expected, as knowing that in ſome particulars you have
great reaſon to do it. And therefore that you may not fare the worſe for your Modeſty,
I will put you in mind of three particulars which I conceive to be for the good of this
Country.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is concerning your trained Bands, to reduce them to a leſſer number; for
which I confeſs to ſtand ingaged by promiſe to you, which I had performed long ſince;
if I had been put in mind of it. And now I tell you, ſhew Me but the way, and, when
you ſhall think fit, I ſhall inſtantly reduce them to that number which I promiſed you
two years ago.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that which is owing to this Countrey for Billet-money. The truth is,
that for the preſent I cannot repay it: Only I will ſay this, that if all the water had gone
to the right Mill, upon My word you had been long ago ſatisfied in this particular. And
ſo I leave to your diſcretions, which way you will adviſe and aſſiſt Me to comply
with the engagements to you in this point.</p>
                     <p>The third is, that for which I was petitioned as I came up the laſt year both by the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen of this City, and likewiſe by divers others of this County as I went
Southward, and that is concerning the Court of <hi>York.</hi> And firſt let me tell you, that as yet
I know no legal Diſſolution of it, for hitherto formally there is nothing come to me, either
directly or indirectly, for the taking of it away: therefore I may ſay, it is rather ſhaken in
pieces than diſſolved. Now my deſire is, in compliance to what I anſwered the laſt year
unto the ſeveral Petitions delivered to me upon this ſubject, that you would conſult and
agree among your ſelves, in what manner you would have the Court eſtabliſhed moſt to
your own contentments, and to the good of all theſe Northern parts, in ſuch a Legal way
as that it may not juſtly be excepted againſt; and I aſſure you in the word of an honeſt
man, that you ſhall not blame me if you have not full ſatisfaction in it.</p>
                     <p>Within a day or two ye ſhall have a particular Anſwer to your Petition, which ſhall
be ſuch an one as I am confident will give you good ſatisfaction, and put you into ſuch
away as, I hope, may produce good effects to the good of all this Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>GEntlemen, I have cauſe of adding, not altering what I meant to ſay, when I gave

                     </p>
                     <p>I will make no Paraphraſes upon what ye have heard; it is more befitting a Lawyer
than a King. Only this obſervation, Since Treaſon is countenanced ſo near me, it is
time to look to my Safety. I avow, it was part of my wonder, that men whom I
thought heretofore diſcreet and moderate ſhould have undertaken this imployment;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60710:95"/>
and that, ſince they came, I having delivered them the Anſwer you have heard, and
commanded them to return perſonally with it to the Parliament, they ſhould have
flatly diſobeyed Me, upon pretence of the Parliament's Command. My end in telling
you this is, to warn you of them; for ſince theſe men have brought me ſuch a Meſſage,
and diſobeyed ſo lawful a Command, I will not ſay what their intent of ſtaying here is:
Only I bid you take heed, not knowing what Doctrine of Diſobedience they may
preach to you, under colour of obeying the Parliament. Hitherto I have found and
kept you quiet, the enjoying of which was a chief cauſe of My coming hither, Tumults
and Diſorders having made Me leave the South; and not to make this a ſeat of War,
as Malice would (but, I hope, in vain) make you believe. Now if Diſturbances come,
I know whom I have reaſon to ſuſpect.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, You ſee that my Magazine is going to be taken from me, being my
Own proper Goods, directly againſt my will; the <hi>Militia,</hi> againſt Law and my Conſent,
is going to be put in execution; and laſtly, Sir <hi>J. Hotham</hi>'s Treaſon is countenanced.
All this conſidered, none can blame me to apprehend Dangers. Therefore I have
thought fit upon theſe real grounds to tell you, that I am reſolved to have a Guard
(the Parliament having had one all this while upon imaginary Jealouſies) only to ſecure
my Perſon. In which I deſire your concurrence and aſſiſtance, and that I may be able to
protect you, the Laws, and the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, from any affront or injury that
may be offered; which I mean to maintain my ſelf, without charge to the Countrey;
intending not longer to keep them on foot than I ſhall be ſecured of my juſt apprehenſions,
by having ſatisfaction in the particulars before mentioned.</p>

which being raiſed by a Malignant party, may, by their cunning and induſtry, get

I hear hath mis-led many of you, that the pretended Ordinance of the <hi>Militia</hi> is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted

Declarations and Meſſages, that the ſame is againſt the known Law, and an invaſion of
my unqueſtionable Right, and of your Liberty and Property; ſo I do now declare unto
you, that the ſame is impoſed upon you againſt my expreſs Conſent, and in contempt
of my Regal Authority: And therefore whoſoever ſhall henceforth preſume to execute
or obey the ſame, I ſhall proceed againſt them as againſt ſuch who promote Rebellion,
and actually levy War againſt Me.</p>
                     <p>And I doubt not but you will ſadly conſider, that if any Authority without and againſt
my Conſent may lawfully impoſe ſuch burthens upon you, it may likewiſe take away
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60710:95"/>
all that you have from you, and ſubject you to their lawleſs Arbitrary Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And how far they are like to exerciſe that juriſdiction towards you, you may
gueſs by the inſolence of Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> at <hi>Hull,</hi> who, being a Subject, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes

impriſons them, burns their houſes, drowns their land, takes them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and commits ſuch Outrages and acts of Hoſtility, as the moſt unequal and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Enemies practiſe in any Country: That you may ſee how impoſſible it is for your
Liberties and Properties to be preſerved, when your King is oppreſſed, and His juſt
Rights taken from Him. Who hath brought theſe Calamities upon your Neighbours
at <hi>Hull</hi> every man ſees; and they only can bring the ſame upon you.</p>
                     <p>I will not believe you to be ſo inſenſible of the benefits you have received from Me,
that I need put you in mind of the Gracious Acts paſſed by Me this Parliament on your

                     <p>Be not frighted with apprehenſions that this Country is like to be the ſeat of War.
The ſeat of a War will be only where perſons riſe in Rebellion againſt Me: that will not,

                     <p>GEntlemen, Since I have found My Preſence ſo very acceptable amongſt My Good
Subjects in theſe Northern parts, and that the Errors and Miſtakes among them
have wholly proceeded from miſinformation, and are removed with more ſatisfaction
and eaſe to them than they were received; I hold it a piece of My Duty, to take the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
pains I can fully to inform and undeceive My People, and rather to prevent Crimes
than to puniſh them.</p>
                     <p>In this Errand I am come to you, amongſt whom there hath not been the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding,
to ſhew you that I do not ſuſpect any malice in the Place or in the
People, though perſons of as ill diſpoſitions have been buſie in it and amongſt you as in
any County in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch who have taken as great pains to do miſchief and to
bring confuſion, as good men ſhould for Peace and happineſs: Though 'tis as true, that
very many worthier Perſons amongſt you have appeared of contrary affections, which
I ſhall always acknowledge.</p>
                     <p>I am come to you in a time too when nothing could invite Me to ſuch a journey but
My affection to and good eſteem of you; having ſent ſuch Propoſitions of Peace and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
to My two Houſes of Parliament, that I hope to have no other uſe of your
affections but in your Prayers; being ſure they will ſubmit to them with alacrity, if the
unexcuſable enemies of the Peace of the Kingdom be not ſtrong enough to prevail. And
then you will find your ſelves ſo much concerned (for I have required nothing that with
more juſtice can be denied Me, if it be duly weighed, than My Crown or My Life may be
taken from Me) that I ſhall not need to ask your aſſiſtance, I know you will bring
Horſe, Men, Money, and Hearts worthy ſuch a Cauſe. Your Religion, your Liberties,
your Laws, which I will defend with My Life, (I mean the good known Laws of the
Land; not Ordinances without My Conſent, which till within theſe twelve months
were never heard of from the Foundation of this Kingdom) will be the Quarrel: and in
ſuch a Cauſe the taking away My Towns, Ships, Arms and Money from Me ſhall not
diſhearten Me. The concurrence and affection of My People, with God's bleſſing, will
ſupply and recover all.</p>

                     <p>GEntlemen, when I directed that Summons ſhould be ſent out for your meeting here
this day, My principal end was, That I might give you thanks for the great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
and expreſſions you have made of your affections to Me ſince I came into this
Country; and to aſſure you, that as the whole Kingdom hath great reaſon to value you
exceedingly for it, ſo I ſhal be ever unſatisfied with My ſelf till I have found ſome way to
fix a mark of favour and eſtimation upon this County and this People, which may tell
Poſterity how good Subjects you have been, and how much Gentlemen; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
the memory of it will grow up with My Sons too in a juſt acknowledgment. This
was the moſt I intended to ſay to you. But there is an unquiet ſpirit abroad, which every
day throws in new accidents to diſturb and confound the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>How I was driven from <hi>London</hi> when I choſe this place for My Safety, is ſo notorious,
that all men know it who know any thing. With what ſtrange violence and indignities I
have been purſued ſince I came hither, needs no other evidence than Sir <hi>J. Hotham</hi>'s beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
at <hi>Hull,</hi> who is now arrived to that inſolence, that he will not ſuffer his Treaſon to be
longer confined within thoſe walls, but makes Sallies out of the Town upon his fellow-Subjects,
drowns their land, burns and plunders their Houſes, murthers and (with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of cruelty) torments their perſons: and this with ſo much delight, that he would not
have the patience to wait what Anſwer ſhould be ſent to My juſt Demands, though in that
reſpect I engaged My ſelf to forbear to uſe any force, and kept My word; but choſe the
night before that came, as if he knew well what Anſwer I was to receive, to act thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
                     <p>Ye ſee the ſad effects of Fears and Jealouſies, the miſeries they have produced: no man
can tell you the leaſt good they have brought forth, or the leaſt evil they have prevented.
What inconvenience and burthen My Preſence hath been here, what diſturbance it hath
brought upon the Publick, or grievance upon any private perſon, your ſelves are beſt
judges. And whatever ſcandal ſome men have pleaſed to caſt upon the Cavaliers, (which
they intend ſhould reach all My Retinue, and by degrees ſhall involve all Gentlemen) I
am confident there hath not been any eminent diſorder or damage befallen any man by
any perſon of My Train or under My protection. I am ſure My directions have been very
ſtrict in that point; and if they had not been obſerved, I think I ſhould have heard of it
by nearer complaints than from <hi>London.</hi> I pray God the ſame care may be taken there:
I am ſure it hath not been.</p>
                     <p>And to give you the fulleſt teſtimony of My affection to you and to the Peace of this
County, and to ſhew you that no provocation ſhall provoke Me to make this place to be
the ſeat of the War, I have for your ſakes paſſed over the conſiderations of Honor, and
notwithſtanding the reproaches every day laid on Me, laid no ſiege to that place, that
they may not have the leaſt pretence of doing you miſchief, but reſolve by God's help
to recover <hi>Hull</hi> ſome other way; for that I will ever ſit down under ſo bold and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
a Treaſon no honeſt man can imagine.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems other men are not of My mind, but reſolve to make a War at your own
doors, whatſoever you do or I ſuffer. To what purpoſe elſe is their new General armed
with an Authority to kill and deſtroy all My good Subjects; their levies of Horſe and Foot,
ſome whereof are upon their march towards you with Canon mounted; and the ſending
ſo many new Soldiers into <hi>Hull,</hi> when there is no approach made towards it, but to ſally
out, and to commit rapine, and by degrees to pour out an Army upon you? In this I muſt
ask you advice, what you would do for your ſelves, and what you would have Me do for
you. You ſee how I am ſtript of my Navy at Sea, which is employed againſt Me; of My
Forts and Towns at Land, which are filled with armed men to deſtroy Me; My Money
and Proviſions of My Houſe taken from Me, and all My Subjects forbid and threatned if
they come near Me, that I may be Famine or Solitarineſs be compelled to yield to the moſt
diſhonourable Propoſitions, and to put My ſelf and Children into the hands of a few Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
perſons, who have entred into a Combination to deſtroy Us. And all this done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of a Truſt repoſed by the People. How far you are from committing any ſuch
Truſt, moſt of the perſons truſted by you and your own expreſſions of Duty to Me have
manifeſted to all the world; and how far the whole Kingdom is from avowing ſuch a
Truſt, hath already in a great meaſure, and I doubt not will more every day appear by
the profeſſions of every County: For I am wholly caſt upon the affections of My People,
and have no hope but in the bleſſing and aſſiſtance of God, the juſtneſs of My Cauſe, and
the Love of My Subjects, to recover what is taken from Me and them, for I may juſtly
ſay they are equal loſers with Me.</p>

Gentlemen, I deſire you to conſider what courſe is to be taken for your own ſecurity
from the excurſions from <hi>Hull,</hi> and the violence which threatens you from thence: I
will aſſiſt you any way you propoſe.</p>
                     <p>Next, I deſire you, out of the publick proviſion or your private ſtore, to furniſh Me with

I do promiſe to ſee fully repay'd to you. Theſe Arms I deſire may be ſpeedily delivered
to the cuſtody of My Lord Mayor of <hi>York</hi> for my uſe, principally for thoſe parts which, by
reaſon of their diſtance from <hi>Hull,</hi> are leaſt ſubject to the fear of violence from thence.
And whoſoever ſhall ſo furniſh Me, ſhall be excuſed from their attendance and ſervice at
Muſters, till their Arms ſhall be reſtored; which may well be ſooner than I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
or you expect.</p>
                     <p>I deſire nothing of you, but what is neceſſary to be done for the preſervation of
God's true Religion, the Laws of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the very
Being of this Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> for 'tis too evident all theſe are at ſtake.</p>
                     <p>For the compleating of My Son's Regiment for the Guard of His Perſon under the

                     <p>GEntlemen, You have heard theſe Orders read; it is your part in your ſeveral places
to obſerve them exactly. The time cannot be long before we come to Action,
therefore you have the more reaſon to be careful: And I muſt tell you, I ſhall be very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in the puniſhing of thoſe, of what condition ſoever, who tranſgreſs theſe Inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſuſpect your Courage and Reſolution. Your Conſcience and your Loyalty
hath brought you hither to fight for your Religion, your King, and the Laws of the
Land: You ſhall meet with no enemies but Traitors, moſt of them Browniſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
and Atheiſts, ſuch who deſire to deſtroy both Church and State, and who have
already condemned you to ruine for being Loyal to Us.</p>
                     <p>That you may ſee what uſe I mean to make of your Valour, if it pleaſe God to bleſs it
with ſucceſs, I have thought fit to publiſh My Reſolution to you in a Proteſtation, which
when you have heard Me make, you will believe you cannot fight in a better Quarrel;
in which I promiſe to live and die with you.</p>
                     <p>I do promiſe in the preſence of Almighty God, and as I hope for His Bleſſing and
Protection, that I will to the utmoſt of My Power defend and maintain the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and, by the Grace
of God, in the ſame will live and die.</p>
                     <p>I deſire to govern by the known Laws of the Land; and that the Liberty and Property
of the Subject may be by them preſerved with the ſame care as My own juſt Rights. And
if it pleaſe God, by his bleſſing upon this Army raiſed for My neceſſary Defence, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Me from this Rebellion, I do ſolemnly and faithfully promiſe in the ſight of God,
to maintain the juſt Privileges and Freedom of Parliament, and to govern by the known
Laws of the Land to My utmoſt power, and particularly to obſerve inviolably the Laws
conſented to by Me this Parliament. In the mean while, if this time of War, and the
great neceſſity and ſtreights I am now driven to, beget any violation of thoſe, I hope it
ſhall be imputed by God and Man to the Authors of this War, and not to Me, who have
ſo earneſtly laboured for the preſervation of the Peace of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>When I willingly fail in theſe particulars, I will expect no aid or relief from any

                     <p>GEntlemen, I am willing to take all occaſions to viſit all My good Subjects, in which
number I have cauſe to reckon you of theſe two Counties, having lately had a
good expreſſion of your Loyalty and Affections to Me, by thoſe Levies which at your
charge have been ſent Me from your parts; which forwardneſs of yours I ſhall alwayes
remember to your advantage; and to let you know how I have been dealt with by a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60710:97"/>
powerful Malignant party in this Kingdom, whoſe deſigns are no leſs than to deſtroy
my Perſon and Crown, the Laws of the Land, and the preſent Government both of
Church and State.</p>
                     <p>The Leaders of theſe men, by their ſubtilty and cunning practices, have ſo prevailed
upon the meaner ſort of people about <hi>London,</hi> that they have called them up into frequent
and dangerous tumults, and thereby have chaſed from thence My ſelf and the greateſt
part of the Members of both Houſes of Parliament. Their power and ſecret Plots have
had ſuch influence upon the ſmall remaining part of both Houſes, that under colour of
Orders and Ordinances made without the Royal Aſſent, a thing never heard of before
this Parliament, I am robb'd and ſpoiled of my Towns, Forts, Caſtles and Goods, my
Navy forcibly taken from me, and imployed againſt me, all my Revenues ſtopt and
ſeiſed upon; and at this time a powerful Army is marching againſt me.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh this were all: They have yet further laboured to alienate the affections of my
good People, they have moſt injuriouſly vented many falſe reproaches againſt my Perſon
and Government, they have diſperſed in print many notorious falſe ſcandals upon my
actions and intentions, and in particular have laboured to caſt upon me ſome aſperſions
concerning the horrid, bloody and impious Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi> They tell the People
that I have recalled two Ships appointed for the Guard of theſe Seas. 'Tis true: but they
conceal that at the ſame time I ſent my Warrants to the Downs, commanding four as
good Ships to attend that ſervice inſtead of thoſe ſhould be recalled; which Warrant by
their means could not find obedience. They forget that they then imployed forty Ships
(many of them my Own, and all of them ſet forth at the publick charge of this and that
Kingdom) to rob and pillage me of my Goods, to chaſe my good Subjects, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my own Town of <hi>Hull</hi> againſt me; and that by the abſence of thoſe Ships from the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, the Rebells have had opportunity to bring ſtore of Arms, Ammunition and
Supplies to their ſuccours, to which we may juſtly impute the Calamities which have
over whelmed my poor Proteſtant Subjects there. They cry out upon a few ſuits of
cloaths appointed, as they ſay, for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſome of my Forces took; but conceal
that they were taken as entring into <hi>Coventry,</hi> then in open Rebellion againſt me, where
I had reaſon to believe they would have been diſpoſed of amongſt their Soldiers who
then bore Arms againſt me. They talk of a few horſes which I have made uſe of for
my Carriages; concealing that they were certified to be uſeleſs for the ſervice of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
when they themſelves have ſeiſed an hundred thouſand pounds particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Act of Parliament for the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where my Army is ready to
periſh for want of it, and imployed it, together with ſuch part of the four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pound Subſidie as they have received, to maintain an unnatural Civil War at home.</p>
                     <p>Neither have they uſed their fellow-Subjects better than they have done me their King.
By their Power the Law of the Land, your birth-right, is trampled upon, and in ſtead
thereof they govern my People by Votes and Arbitrary Orders. Such as will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their unlimited power are impriſoned, plundered, and deſtroyed: ſuch as will
not pay ſuch exactions as they require toward this Rebellion, are threatned to be put
out of Protection, as they call it of the Parliament: ſuch as conſcientiouſly remember
their Duty and Loyalty to me their Soveraign, are reviled, perſecuted, and declared
Traitors: ſuch as do deſire to maintain the true Proteſtant Religion as it is eſtabliſhed
by the Laws of the Land, are traduced and called Popiſh and Superſtitious, and on the
contrary, ſuch as are known <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and publick depravers of the Book
of Common Prayer, are countenanced and incouraged. They exact and receive Tonnage
and Poundage and other great duties upon Merchandiſes, not only without Law, but in
the face of an Act of Parliament to the contrary, paſt this preſent Parliament, which puts
all men into the condition of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> that ſhall preſume ſo to oppreſs the People.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire to know who are the Contrivers of theſe wicked deſigns, you ſhall find
ſome of their names in particular, and their actions at large, in my Declaration of the

ſuch, that few of thoſe Copies can come to the view of my good People. Since that time
theſe men ſo thirſt after the deſtruction of this Kingdom, that they have prevailed to
make all my offers of Treaty (which might bring Peace to this Kingdom, and beget a
good underſtanding between Me and my Parliament) fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>In this diſtreſs into which theſe men have brought Me and this Kingdom, my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

men increaſed, and their purpoſes were detected; but alſo the great inconveniences
my beſt Subjects would ſuffer even by my own Army, raiſed and kept for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and protection. For I was not ſo ill a Souldier, as not to foreſee how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
it was to keep a ſtrict diſcipline, I being to ſtruggle with ſo many defects and
neceſſities: and I aſſure you, the ſenſe I have of their ſufferings who deſerve well of Me
by my Forces, hath been a greater grief to me than any thing to my own particular.
My hope was, that either by Succeſs on my part, or Repentance on theirs, God would
have put a ſhort end to this great ſtorm. But guilt and deſpair have made theſe men more
wicked than I imagine they at firſt intended to be: for inſtead of removing and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
theſe bloudy Diſtractions, and reſtoring Peace to this languiſhing Countrey, they
have invited a Forein power to invade this Kingdom, and that in your names, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
this Invaſion from them as a debt to the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>You, My Lords, have, like your ſelves, as good Patriots, expreſſed your diſſent, and
vindicated your ſelves from that imputation: and I doubt not but you, Gentlemen,
will let your Countreys know how far you are from deſiring ſuch aſſiſtance; and how
abſolute and peremptory a breach this raiſing of Arms of my <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects is of that
Pacification which was ſo lately and ſolemnly made by you, and can intend nothing but
a conqueſt of you and your Laws. I ſhall ſend you all the advertiſements I have of that
buſineſs which is threatned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and what is already acted from thence; and
ſhall deſire your ſpeedy advice and aſſiſtance, what is to be ſaid or done both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to this and that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Our ends being the ſame, I am ſure there will be no other difference in the way than
what upon debate and right underſtanding will be eaſily adjuſted. Let our Religion,
in which we are all moſt nearly concerned, and without care of which we muſt not
look for God's bleſſing, be vindicated and preſerved; let my Honor and Rights, which
you find to have an inſeparable relation with your own Intereſts, be vindicated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored;
let your Liberties, Properties, Priviledges, without which I would not be your
King, be ſecured and confirmed; there is nothing you can adviſe Me to I will not
meet you in. And I doubt not but we ſhall together inform Poſterity, how much our
truſt and confidence in each other is a better expedient for the Peace and preſervation
of the Kingdom, than Fears and Jealouſies.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall keep you no longer from conſulting together, than in telling you that I have
prepared fit places for your Meetings, to which I deſire you to repair this night; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
you that I ſhall be always ready to receive any thing from you, admitting you to
Me, or coming to you My ſelf, whenſoever you ſhall deſire.</p>

                     <p>And firſt I thank you for your inclination to Peace; to which as My willingneſs of
complying ſhewed the conſtancy of My endeavours in the beſt way for the publick good;
ſo the Rebels, by their ſcornfully rejecting your Overtures, as they have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mine, have ſhewed their conſtancy in their way.</p>
                     <p>Next, I muſt thank every one of you for ſo chearfully applying your ſelves to the

theſe enemies of Peace ſhall have their due reward. And truly, My Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
this alacrity of yours in providing for My Army doth pleaſe Me in no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo much, as that it is the beſt way for Peace; for certainly this ſtrange arrogance of
refuſing to treat with you can proceed from nothing but their contempt of our Forces.
But it is your preſent Honor, and will be more to poſterity, that God hath made you

                     <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, I am now brought to you by your ſelves; for I ſhould

Likewiſe that you uſe your beſt diligence for the preſſing of men, and incouragement

<date>July 23. MDCXLIV.</date>
                     </head>
                     <p>GEntlemen, I have often deſired before theſe Troubles to viſit theſe Weſtern parts,
that I might with joy have been an eye-witneſs of the bleſsings of Peace which
you then enjoyed, and have been welcom'd with the hearty and unanimous affections of
My good People here: But the malicious deſigns of the Authors of this moſt unnatural
War have made thoſe My intentions impoſsible; yet My coming to you in this poſture
may ſufficiently expreſs what value I ſet upon theſe Aſſociated Counties. I am now
come to relieve you from the violence of a Rebellious Army ſent hither by thoſe that
have plunged this whole Kingdom into theſe deſperate Diſtractions. They have got
footing in your Country, and under the falſe pretences they carry with them (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they have abuſed too many of My People) are ready to devour you, and bring
deſtruction to your Religion, Property and Liberty. Theſe I am come to defend; and
ſhall refuſe no danger that may conduce to your deliverance from this Slavery attempted
on you by thoſe men.</p>
                     <p>All that I ask of you is, that you will not be wanting to your ſelves, but will heartily
joyn with Me in this good work, by contributing your chearful aſsiſtance to My Army,
and by performing your Duty in bearing Arms with Me in this good Cauſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
whoever ſhall fall carrieth this comfort with him, that he falleth in defence of the
true Proteſtant Religion, his King, his Countrey, and the Law of the Land. And he
that will not venture his life for theſe, I had rather have his room than his company.
Upon theſe grounds I ſhall lead you on: Follow Me with courage, and the God of
Power give us his Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall further remember you of this, that if by your aſſiſtance it ſhall pleaſe God to
inable Me to reduce this Army now in the bowels of your Country, you will not only
thereby free theſe Aſſociated Counties from thoſe Miſeries which threaten you; but it
may pleaſe God in mercy ſo to look upon this poor Kingdom, that the fruits of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
may be a means to reſtore Peace to us all, that bleſſed Peace which I have ſo often
and ſo importunately ſought for from them at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and which they have ſo
ſcornfully rejected, as if the blood of their fellow-Subjects were their delight. God turn
their hearts: neither ſhall I deſpair of it, if the ſucceſs of that Army, the chiefeſt ſtrength
on which they rely, ſhall fail their expectation; for then it may have ſuch an influence
upon them, that I hope they may be prevailed with to give you leave to be happy again;
and, which I have ſo often deſired, to have all that is in queſtion between them and Me
determined in a full and free convention of Parliament. Then I ſhall not fear but the
united power of this Kingdom will eaſily free us from that Northern Invaſion, which
making uſe of our Diviſions, threatneth no leſs than the Conqueſt of this whole
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60710:99"/>
Nation. This I aſſure you, that no ſucceſs ſhall make Me leſs zealouſly ſeek for Peace,
well knowing whoſe blood is to be ſpilt in this unhappy quarrel; but rather I ſhall
more fervently encreaſe My deſires, by how much I may have better grounded hopes to
attain what I ſo earneſtly deſire.</p>
                     <p>When I mention Peace, I would be underſtood to intend that Peace which is built
upon ſuch foundations as are moſt likely to render it firm and ſtable, wherein God's true
Religion may be beſt ſecured from the danger of Popery, Sectaries and Innovations;
the Crown may poſſeſs thoſe juſt Prerogatives which may inable Me to protect and
govern My People according to Law; and the Subject be confirmed in thoſe Rights
which they have derived from their Forefathers, and which I have granted to them in
Parliament, to which I ſhall always be ready to add ſuch new Graces as I ſhall find moſt
to conduce to their Happineſs. This is the Peace which I labour for, wherein I may
juſtly expect your beſt aſſiſtance, with your hearts, and hands, and purſes.</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhall I be more burthenſome to you with My Army than of neceſſity I muſt
for its ſupport (ſo far I muſt deſire your help, being violently robb'd of all My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.)
I have and ſhall uſe all poſſible means to ſuppreſs the diſorders of the Souldiers.
The beſt way to do it is, by taking order that they be not provoked with want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Proviſions. That being done by you, Maſter Sheriff and the Commiſſioners of
this County, which I moſt earneſtly commend to your care, you ſhall find Me very
ſtrict in ſuch diſcipline as may beſt ſecure you.</p>
                     <p>This night I hope to have joyned to Me other conſiderable Forces, which are upon
their march towards Me; and tomorrow morning we ſhall humbly ask God's bleſſing
on us, and begin the Work.</p>
                     <p>This care I ſhall further take for you, that as ſoon as poſſibly I can, other men to be
levied by Impreſs ſhall ſupply the place of ſuch of you, as I ſhall then give liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to your Harveſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude with this promiſe to you, that I ſhall look upon your chearfulneſs in
this Service as the greateſt expreſſion of your Loyalty and Affections that you can make
or I receive; which I ſhall require if it be in My power. If I live not to do it, I hope
this young man, My Son, your fellow-Souldier in this Expedition, will; to Whom I
ſhall particularly give it in charge.</p>

                        <p>Sir, you have now heard your Charge read, containing ſuch matters as appear in it:
you find that in the cloſe of it, it is prayed to the Court, in the behalf of the Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> that you anſwer to your Charge: The Court expects your Anſwer.</p>

                           <p>I would know by what Power I am called hither. I was not long ago in
the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> how I came there, is a longer ſtory than I think is fit at this time for
Me to ſpeak of: but there I entred into a Treaty with both Houſes of Parliament, with
as much publick Faith as it's poſſible to be had of any People in the World. I treated
there with a number of Honourable Lords and Gentlemen, and treated honeſtly and
uprightly; I cannot ſay but they did very nobly with Me: we were upon a concluſion
of the Treaty. Now I would know by what Authority (I mean, <hi>lawful;</hi> there are many
<hi>unlawful</hi> Authorities in the world, Thieves and Robbers by the high-ways; but I would
know, by what Authority) I was brought from thence, and carried from place to place,
and I know not what. And when I know by what lawful Authority, I ſhall anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Remember, I am your <hi>King,</hi> your <hi>lawful King,</hi> and what ſins you bring upon your
heads, and the Judgment of God upon this Land: Think well upon it, I ſay, think
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60710:102"/>
well upon it, before you go further from one ſin to a greater. Therefore let Me know
by what <hi>lawful</hi> Authority I am ſeated here, and I ſhall not be unwilling to anſwer. In
the mean time I ſhall not betray My Truſt: I have a Truſt committed to Me by God,
by old and lawful Deſcent; I will not betray it, to anſwer to a new unlawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Therefore reſolve Me that, and you ſhall hear more of Me.</p>

I am called hither. I do ſtand more for the Liberty of My People than any

                           <p>I will ſtand as much for the Privilege of the Houſe of Commons, rightly underſtood,
as any man here whatſoever: I ſee no Houſe of Lords here, that may conſtitute a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and the King too ſhould have been.</p>
                           <p>Is this the bringing of the King to His Parliament? Is this the bringing an end to the
Treaty in the Publick Faith of the World?</p>
                           <p>Let Me ſee a Legal Authority, warranted by the Word of God, the Scriptures, or
warranted by the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, and I will anſwer.</p>

                           <p>Sir, you have propounded a Queſtion, and have been anſwered. Seeing
you will not anſwer, the Court will conſider how to proceed. In the mean time, thoſe
that brought you hither are to take charge of you back again.</p>
                           <p>The Court deſires to know whether this be all the Anſwer you will give, or no.</p>

                           <p>Sir, I deſire that you would give Me and all the World ſatisfaction in this.
Let Me tell you, It is not a ſlight thing you are about, I am ſworn to keep the Peace,
by that Duty I owe to God and My Countrey; and I will do it to the laſt breath of
My body: And therefore you ſhall do well to ſatisfie, firſt God, and then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by what Authority you do it. If you do it by an uſurped Authority, you cannot
anſwer it: There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you Power,
to account. Satisfie Me in that, and I will anſwer; otherwiſe I betray My Truſt, and
the Liberties of the People: and therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be willing.
For I do avow, That it is as great a Sin to withſtand Lawful Authority, as it is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to a Tyrannical, or any otherways unlawful Authority. And therefore ſatisfie God,
and Me, and all the World in that, and you ſhall receive My Anſwer. I am not afraid
of the Bill.</p>

                           <p>The Court expects you ſhould give them a final Anſwer. Their purpoſe
is to adjourn till Monday next: If you do not ſatisfie your ſelf, though we do tell you
our Authority, we are ſatisfied with our Authority, and it is upon God's Authority and
the Kingdoms; and that Peace you ſpeak of will be kept in the doing of Juſtice, and
that's our preſent Work.</p>

Treaſon and other high Crimes againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, whereof I do accuſe him
in the name of the People of <hi>England;</hi> and the Charge was read unto him, and his
Anſwer required. My Lord, he was not then pleaſed to give an Anſwer; but in ſtead
of anſwering, did there diſpute the Authority of this High Court. My humble motion
to this High Court, in behalf of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> is, That the Priſoner may
be directed to make a Poſitive Anſwer, either by way of Confeſſion, or Negation;
which if he ſhall refuſe to do, that the matter of Charge may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and
the Court may proceed according to Juſtice.</p>

                           <p>Sir, you may remember, at the laſt Court you were told the occaſion of your
being brought hither, and you heard a Charge read againſt you, containing a Charge
of High Treaſon and other high Crimes againſt this Realm of <hi>England;</hi> you heard like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an Anſwer to
that Charge, that thereupon ſuch proceedings might be had as ſhould be agreeable to
Juſtice: you were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concerning the Authority of this
Court, and knew not by what Authority you were brought hither: you did divers time
propound your Queſtions, and were as often anſwer'd, That it was by the Authority of
the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament, that did think fit to call you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for thoſe high and capital Miſdemeanours wherewith you were then charged.</p>
                           <p>Since that, the Court hath taken into conſideration what you then ſaid: they are
fully ſatisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould ſtand ſatisfied
with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a poſitive and particular Anſwer to
this Charge that is exhibited againſt you. They do expect you ſhould either confeſs, or
deny it: If you deny, it is offered, in the behalf of the Kingdom, to be made good againſt
you. Their Authority they do avow to the whole World, that the whole Kingdom are
to reſt ſatisfied in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied with it; and therefore you are to loſe no
more time, but to give a poſitive Anſwer thereunto.</p>

                           <p>When I was here laſt, 'tis very true, I made that Queſtion; and if it
were only My own particular Caſe, I would have ſatisfied My ſelf with the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I made the laſt time I was here againſt the Legality of this Court, and that a King
cannot be tried by any ſuperior Juriſdiction on Earth: But it is not My Caſe alone, it
is the Freedom and the Liberty of the People of <hi>England;</hi> and do you pretend what
you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if Power without Law may make Laws,
may alter the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what Subject he is
in <hi>England</hi> that can be ſure of his Life, or any thing that he calls his own. Therefore,
when that I came here, I did expect particular Reaſons, to know by what Law, what
Authority you did proceed againſt Me here; and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to
ſay to you in this particular, becauſe the Affirmative is to be proved, the Negative of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

diſpute the Authority of the Court, we may not do it, nor will any Court give way

                           <p>Sir, you ought not to interrupt while the Court is ſpeaking to you. This
point is not to be debated by you, neither will the Court permit you to do it. If you
offer it by way of Demurrer to the Juriſdiction of the Court, they have conſidered of
their Juriſdiction, they do affirm their own Juriſdiction.</p>

                           <p>I ſay, Sir, by your favour, that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> was never a Court
of Judicature; I would know how they came to be ſo.</p>

                           <p>Sir, you are not to have liberty to uſe this language. How great a Friend
you have been to the Laws and Liberties of the People, let all <hi>England</hi> and the World
judge.</p>
                        </sp>

                           <p>Sir, under favour, it was the Liberty, Freedom, and Laws of the Subject
that ever I took—defended My ſelf with Arms: I never took up Armes againſt the

                        </sp>

                           <p>The Command of the Court muſt be obeyed. No Anſwer will be given

                           <p>Well, Sir.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <p>Then <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ordered the Default to be recorded, and the Contempt of the Court, and that
no Anſwer would be given to the Charge.</p>
                        <p>The King was guarded forth to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> houſe.</p>
                        <p>The Court adjourned to the Painted Chamber on Tueſday at twelve of Clock, and from
thence they intend to adjourn to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> at which time all perſons concerned are to
give their attendance.</p>
                        <p>His Majeſty not being ſuffered to deliver His Reaſons againſt the Jurisdiction of their
pretended Court by word of mouth, thought fit to leave them in writing to the more impartial
judgment of Poſterity, as followeth;</p>
                        <p>HAving already made My Proteſtations, not only againſt the Illegality of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Court, but alſo That no Earthly Power can juſtly call Me (who am your
King) in queſtion as a Delinquent; I would not any more open My mouth upon this
occaſion, more than to referr My ſelf to what I have ſpoken, were I in this Caſe alone
concerned. But the Duty I owe to God in the preſervation of the true Liberty of My
People will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent. For, how can any free-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>England</hi> call Life, or any thing he poſſeſſeth his own, if Power without Right
daily make new, and abrogate the old Fundamental Law of the Land? which I now
take to be the preſent Caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would
have endeavoured to have ſatisfied Me concerning theſe grounds which hinder Me to
anſwer to your pretended Impeachment: But ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will
move you to it, (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet
I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot Judge Me, nor indeed the
meaneſt man in <hi>England:</hi> For I will not, (like you) without ſhewing a Reaſon, ſeek
to impoſe a belief upon My Subjects.</p>
                        <p>There is no proceeding juſt againſt any man,<note place="margin">Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about I was ſtopt, and not ſuffered to ſpeak any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reaſons.</note>
 but what is warranted either by God's
Laws or the Municipal Laws of the Countrey where he lives. Now I am moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
this dayes proceeding cannot be warranted by God's Law; for, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the authority of Obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted and ſtrictly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both in the Old and new Teſtament; which if denyed, I am ready inſtantly to
prove. And for the queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the Word of a
King is, there is Power; and who may ſay unto him, What doſt thou? Eccl.</hi> 8. 4. Then for
the Law of this Land, I am no leſs confident that no learned Lawyer will affirm that an
Impeachment can lye againſt the King, they all going in His Name; and one of their
Maxims is, That <hi>the King can do no wrong.</hi> Beſides, the Law upon which you ground
your proceedings muſt either be old or new: if old, ſhew it; if new, tell what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
warranted by the Fundamental Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But
how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judicature, which was never one it
ſelf (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the world to judge: And it
were full as ſtrange, that they ſhould pretend to make Laws without King or Lords
Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the People of <hi>England</hi>'s Commiſſion could
grant your pretended Power, I ſee nothing you can ſhew for that; for certainly you
never asked the queſtion of the tenth man in the Kingdom; and in this way you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
wrong even the pooreſt Plough-man, if you demand not his free conſent: nor
can you pretend any colour for this your pretended Commiſſion without the conſent at
leaſt of the major part of every man in <hi>England,</hi> of whatſoever quality or condition,
which I am ſure you never went about to ſeek; ſo far are you from having it. Thus you
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60710:104"/>
ſee that I ſpeak not for My own Right alone, as I am your King, but alſo for the true
Liberty of all My Subjects, which conſiſts not in the power of Government, but in living
under ſuch Laws, ſuch a Government, as may give themſelves the beſt aſſurance of
their Lives and propriety of their Goods. Nor in this muſt or do I forget the Privileges
of both Houſes of Parliament, which this days Proceedings do not only violate, but
likewiſe occaſion the greateſt breach of their publick Faith that (I believe) ever was
heard of: with which I am far from charging the two Houſes; for all pretended Crimes
laid againſt Me bear Date long before this late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which I having
concluded as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expecting the Houſes agreement thereunto;
I was ſuddenly ſurprized, and hurried from thence as a Priſoner, upon which account I
am againſt My will brought hither; where ſince I am come, I cannot but to My power
defend the ancient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, together with My own juſt
Right. Then, for any thing I can ſee, the Higher Houſe is totally excluded. And for
the Houſe of Commons, it is too well known that the major part of them are detained
or deterred from ſitting; ſo as, if I had no other, this were ſufficient for Me to proteſt
againſt the Lawfulneſs of your pretended Court. Beſides all this, the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not the leaſt in My thoughts; and what hopes of Settlement is there, ſo long as
Power reigns without Rule or Law, changing the whole frame of that Government
under which this Kingdom hath flouriſhed for many hundred years? (nor will I ſay
what will fall out, in caſe this Lawleſs unjuſt proceeding againſt Me do go on.) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this Change, for they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how happy they have been of late years under the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
the King My Father, and My ſelf, until the beginning of theſe unhappy Troubles, and
will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo happy under any new. And by this
time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Arms I took up were only to defend the
Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed My Power hath
totally changed the ancient Government.</p>
                        <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons why I cannot ſubmit to your pretended
Authority, without violating the Truſt which I have from God for the Welfare and
Liberty of My People; I expect from you either clear Reaſons to convince My Judgment,
ſhewing Me that I am in an Error (and then truly I will anſwer) or that you will
withdraw your proceedings.</p>
                        <p>This I intended to ſpeak in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall on Monday

                        <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Lord Preſident, this is now the third time that, by
the great grace and favour of this High Court, the Priſoner hath been brought to the
Bar, before any Iſſue joyned in the Cauſe. My Lord, I did at the firſt Court exhibite
a Charge againſt him, containing the Higheſt Treaſon that ever was wrought upon
the Theatre of <hi>England,</hi> That a King of <hi>England,</hi> truſted to keep the Law, that had
taken an Oath ſo to do, that had Tribute pay'd him for that end, ſhould be guilty of a
wicked Deſign to ſubvert and deſtroy our Laws, and introduce an Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Government, in the<note n="*" place="margin">defiance.</note>
 defence of the Parliament and their Authority, ſet up
his Standard for War againſt the Parliament and People: and I did humbly pray, in
the behalf of the People of <hi>England,</hi> that he might ſpeedily be required to make an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Charge.</p>
                        <p>But, My Lord, in ſtead of making any Anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this
High Court. Your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give him a further day to conſider, and to put
in his Anſwer; which day being yeſterday, I did humbly move, that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer, either by denying or confeſſion of it: But,
my Lord, he was then pleaſed for to demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court, which
the Court did then over-rule, and command him to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer.</p>

                           <pb n="198" facs="tcp:60710:105"/>
My Lord, beſides this great delay of Juſtice, I ſhall now humbly move your Lordſhip
for ſpeedy Judgment againſt him. My Lord, I might preſs your Lordſhip upon the
whole, that according to the known rules of the Law of the Land, That if a Priſoner
ſhall ſtand as contumacious in contempt, and ſhall not put in an iſſuable Plea, guilty or
not guilty of the Charge given againſt him, whereby he may come to a fair Tryal, that as
by an implicite confeſſion it may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> as it hath been done to thoſe who
have deſerved more favour than the Priſoner at the Bar has done. But beſides, my Lord,
I ſhall humbly preſs your Lordſhip upon the whole fact. The Houſe of Commons, the
Supreme Authority and Juriſdiction of the Kingdom, they have declared, That it is
notorious that the matter of the Charge is true; as it is in truth, my Lord, as clear as
Cryſtal, and as the Sun that ſhines at noon day: which if your Lordſhip and the Court
be not ſatisfied in, I have notwithſtanding, on the People of <hi>England</hi>'s behalf, ſeveral
Witneſſes to produce. And therefore I do humbly pray, (and yet I muſt confeſs it is not
ſo much I, as the innocent blood that hath been ſhed, the Cry whereof is very great
for Juſtice and Judgment, and therefore I do humbly pray) that ſpeedy Judgment be
pronounced againſt the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
                        <p>Bradſhaw went on in the ſame ſtrain,</p>
                        <sp>
                           <p>Sir, you have heard what is moved by the Counſel on the behalf of the Kingdom againſt
you. Sir, you may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
dealings the Court hath found at your hands. You were pleaſed to propound
ſome Queſtions; you have had your Reſolution upon them. You were told over and over
again, that the Court did affirm their own Juriſdiction; That it was not for you nor any
other man to diſpute the Juriſdiction of the ſupreme and higheſt Authority of <hi>England,</hi>
from which there is no Appeal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute: yet you did
perſiſt in ſuch carriage, as you gave no manner of Obedience, nor did you acknowledge
any authority in them, nor the High Court that conſtituted this Court of Juſtice.</p>
                           <p>Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, that they are very ſenſible of theſe delays
of yours, and that they ought not, being thus authorized by the ſupreme Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to be thus trifled withal, and that they might in Juſtice, if they pleaſed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of Juſtice, take advantage of theſe delays, and proceed to pronounce
Judgment againſt you: yet nevertheleſs they are pleaſed to give direction, and on their
behalfs I do require you, that you make a poſitive Anſwer unto this Charge that is
againſt you. Sir, in plain terms, (for Juſtice knows no reſpect of Perſons) you are to
give your poſitive and final Anſwer in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether you be guilty or not guilty
of theſe Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>

                           <p>Sir, you have had the Reſolution of the Court upon the like Queſtion the
laſt day, and you were told, That having ſuch a Charge of ſo high a nature againſt you,
your work was, that you ought to acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the Court, and to
anſwer to your Charge. Sir, if you anſwer to your Charge, which the Court gives you
leave now to do, though they might have taken the advantage of your Contempt, yet
if you be able to anſwer to your Charge, when you have once anſwered, you ſhall be
heard at large, make the beſt Defence you can. But, Sir, I muſt let you know from the
Court, as their Commands, that you are not to be permitted to iſſue out into any other
diſcourſes, till ſuch time as you have given a poſitive Anſwer concerning the matter
that is charged upon you.</p>

                           <p>For the Charge, I value it not a ruſh. It is the Liberty of the People of

before, I that am your King, that ſhould be an Example to all the People of <hi>England</hi>
for to uphold Juſtice, to maintain the old Laws; indeed I do not know how to do it.</p>
                           <p>You ſpoke very well the firſt day that I came here, on Saturday, of the Obligations
that I had laid upon Me by God to the maintenance of the Liberties of My People; the
ſame Obligation you ſpake of I do acknowledge to God, that I owe to Him and to My
People to defend, as much as in Me lies, the ancient Laws of the Kingdom: therefore
until that I may know that this is not againſt the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom,
by your favour, I can put in no particular<note n="*" place="margin">Anſwer.</note>

ſhew you My Reaſons why I cannot do it, and this—</p>

I was in a Treaty upon the Publick Faith of the Kingdom, that was the known—
two Houſes of Parliament that was the Repreſentative of the Kingdom; and when
that I had almoſt made an end of the Treaty, then I was hurried away, and brought
hither; and therefore—</p>

but to ſatisfie them that I have done nothing againſt that Truſt that hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

to alter the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, Sir, you muſt excuſe Me.</p>

                           <p>Sir, this is the third time that you have publickly diſown'd this Court,
and put an Affront upon it. How far you have preſerv'd the Privileges of the People,
your Actions have ſpoke it; but truly, Sir, mens Intentions ought to be known by their
Actions: you have written your meaning in bloody Characters throughout the whole
Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>But, Sir, you underſtand the pleaſure of the Court.</p>
                           <p>Clerk, record the Default.</p>
                           <p>And, Gentlemen, you that took charge of the Priſoner, take him back again.</p>

                           <p>Gentlemen, it is well known to all or moſt of you here preſent, that the
Priſoner at the Bar hath been ſeveral times convented and brought before this Court,
to make Anſwer to a Charge of Treaſon and other high Crimes exhibited againſt him
in the name of the People of <hi>England.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Here a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                                 <hi>Not half the People;</hi> but was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced with threats.</note>
 To which Charge being required to anſwer, he
hath been ſo far from obeying the Commands of the Court, by ſubmitting to their Juſtice,
as he began to take upon him to offer Reaſoning and Debate unto the Authority of the
Court, and to the higheſt Court, that appointed them to try and judge him: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-ruled in that, and required to make his Anſwer, he was ſtill pleaſed to continue
Contumacious, and to refuſe to ſubmit to Anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Hereupon the Court, that they might not be wanting to themſelves nor the Truſt
repoſed in them, nor that any man's wilfulneſs prevent Juſtice, they have thought fit
to take the matter into their conſideration; they have conſidered of the Charge, they
have conſidered of the Contumacy, and of that Confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Contumacy; they have likewiſe conſidered of the Notoriety of the Fact charged
upon this Priſoner: and, upon the whole matter, they are reſolved and are agreed upon
a Sentence to be pronounced againſt this Priſoner. But in reſpect he doth deſire to be
heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath reſolved that they
will hear him.</p>
                           <p>Yet, Sir, thus much I muſt tell you beforehand, which you have been minded of at
other Courts, That if that which you have to ſay be to offer any debate concerning the
Juriſdiction, you are not to be heard in it. You have offered it formerly, and you have
ſtruck at the Root, that is, the Power and Supreme Authority of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which this Court will not admit a debate of, and which indeed it is an irrational
thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority derived from them. But,
Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf concerning the matter charged,
the Court hath given me in command to let you know they will hear you.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>Since I ſee that you will not hear any thing of Debate concerning that which
I confeſs I though moſt material for the Peace of the Kingdom and for the Liberty of
the Subject, I ſhall wave it, I ſhall ſpeak nothing to it. But only I muſt tell you, that
this many-a day all things have been taken away from Me, but that that I call dearer
to Me than My Life, which is, My Conſcience and My Honor: And if I had a reſpect
to My Life more than the Peace of the Kingdom and the Liberty of the Subject, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
I ſhould have made a particular Defence for My Self; for by that at leaſtwiſe I
might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will paſs upon Me. Therefore
certainly, Sir, as a man that hath ſome underſtanding, ſome knowledge of the World,
if that My true Zeal to My Countrey had not overborn the care that I have for My own
Preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work than that I have done. Now,
Sir, I conceive that an haſty Sentence once paſt may ſooner be repented of than recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and truly the ſelf-ſame deſire that I have for the Peace of the Kingdom and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject, more than my own particular Ends, makes Me now at laſt deſire,
That I having ſomething to ſay that concerns both, I deſire, before Sentence be given,
that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Commons. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
cannot be prejudicial unto you, whatſoever I ſay. If that I ſay no Reaſon, thoſe that
hear Me muſt be Judges: I cannot be Judge of that that I * have. If it be Reaſon,
and really for the welfare of the Kingdom and the Liberty of the Subject, I am ſure on
it, it is very well worth the hearing. Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that that you
pretend, (I hope it is real) the Liberty of the Subject, the Peace of the Kingdom, that
you will grant me this hearing before any Sentence be paſt. I only deſire this, That
you will take this into your Conſideration: it may be you have not heard of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.
If you will, I will retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
I do proteſt, That theſe fair ſhews of Liberty and Peace are pure ſhews, and that
you will not hear your <hi>King.</hi>

do not decline it; though I cannot acknowledge the Juriſdiction of the Court, yet,
Sir, in this, give Me leave to ſay, I would do it, though I did not acknowledge it;
in this, I do proteſt, it is not the declining of it, ſince, I ſay, if that I do ſay any thing
but that that is for the Peace of the Kingdom and the Liberty of the Subject, then the
ſhame is Mine. Now I deſire that you will take this into your Conſideration; if you

new to us, though the firſt time in perſon you have offered it to the Court. Sir,
you ſay you do not decline the Juriſdiction of the Court.</p>

ſeems to be contrary to that ſaying of yours; for the Court are ready to give a Sentence.
It is not as you ſay, <hi>That they will not hear their King;</hi> for they have been ready to hear
you, they have patiently waited your pleaſure for three Courts together, to hear what
you would ſay to the Peoples Charge againſt you: to which you have not vouchſafed to
give any Anſwer at all. Sir, this tends to a further Delay. Truly, Sir, ſuch Delays as
theſe neither may the Kingdom nor Juſtice well bear. You have had three ſeveral days
to have offered in this kind what you would have pleaſed. This Court is founded upon
that Authority of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> in whom reſts the Supreme Juriſdiction.
That which you now tender is to have another Juriſdiction, and a co-ordinate Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
I know very well you expreſs your ſelf, Sir, That notwithſtanding that you
would offer to the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, yet nevertheleſs you
would proceed on here; I did hear you ſay ſo. But, Sir, that you would offer there, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, muſt needs be in delay of the Juſtice here; ſo as if this Court be reſolved and
prepared for the Sentence, this that you offer they are not bound to grant. But, Sir, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that you ſeem to deſire, and becauſe you ſhall know the further pleaſure of the
Court upon that which you have moved, the Court will withdraw for a time.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <p>This he did to prevent the diſturbance of their Scene by one of their own Members Colonel

                        <p>Which done, they return; and being ſate, <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> commanded,</p>

                        <sp>
                           <p>Sir, you were pleaſed to make a motion here to the Court, to offer a deſire of yours
touching the propounding of ſomewhat to the Lords and Commons in the Painted
Chamber for the Peace of the Kingdom. Sir, you did in effect receive an Anſwer before
the Court adjourned: truly, Sir, their withdrawing and adjournment was <hi>pro forma tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm,</hi>
for it did not ſeem to them that there was any difficulty in the thing. They have
conſidered of what you have moved, and have conſidered of their own Authority, which
is founded, as hath been often ſaid, upon the ſupreme Authority of the Commons of
<hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament: the Court acts accordingly to their Commiſſion. Sir,
the return I have to you from the Court is this, That they have been too much delayed
by you already, and this that you now offer hath occaſioned ſome little further Delay,
and they are Judges appointed by the higheſt Authority, and Judges are no more to
<hi>delay</hi> than they are to <hi>deny</hi> Juſtice: they are good words in the <hi>Great</hi> old <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, &amp; nulli deferemus Juſtitiam;</hi> there muſt be no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</hi>
But the truth is, Sir, and ſo every man here obſerves it, that you have much delayed
them in your Contempt and Default, for which they might long ſince have proceeded
to Judgment againſt you; and notwithſtanding what you have offered, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to proceed to Sentence and to Judgment, and that is their unanimous Reſolution.</p>
                        </sp>

                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>Sir, I know it is in vain for Me to diſpute; I am no Sceptick for to deny
the Power that you have; I know that you have Power enough. Sir, I muſt confeſs,
I think it would have been for the Kingdoms Peace, if you would have taken the pains
for to have ſhewn the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of your Power.</p>
                           <p>For this Delay that I have deſired, I confeſs it is a Delay, but it is a Delay very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
for the Peace of the Kingdom; for it is not My Perſon that I look at alone, it
is the Kingdoms Welfare, and the Kingdoms Peace.</p>
                           <p>It is an old Sentence, <hi>That we ſhould think on long before we reſolve of great matters
ſuddenly.</hi> Therefore, Sir, I do ſay again, that I do put at your doors all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a haſty Sentence. I confeſs I have been here now, I think, this Week, this day
eight dayes was the day I came here firſt; but a little Delay of a day or two further may
give Peace, whereas a haſty Judgment may bring on that Trouble and perpetual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency
to the Kingdom, that the Child that is unborn may repent it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
again, out of the Duty I owe to God and to My Country, I do deſire that I may
be heard by the Lords and Commons in the Painted Chamber, or any other Chamber
that you will appoint Me.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                           <p>You have been already anſwered to what you even now moved, being the
ſame you moved before, ſince the Reſolution and the Judgment of the Court in it: And
the Court now requires to know whether you have any more to ſay for your ſelf than
you have ſaid, before they proceed to Sentence.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>I ſay this, Sir, That if you hear Me, if you will give Me but this Delay,
I doubt not but I ſhall give ſome ſatisfaction to you all here, and to My People after that;
and therefore I do require you, as you will anſwer it at the dreadful Day of Judgment,
that you will conſider it once again.</p>

                           <p>Sir, I have received direction from the Court.</p>

                        <sp>

                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                           <p>If this muſt be re-inforced, or any thing of this nature, your Anſwer
muſt be the ſame; and they will proceed to Sentence, if you have nothing more to ſay.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>I have nothing more to ſay; but I ſhall deſire that this may be entred
what I have ſaid.</p>

                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                           <p>The Court then, Sir, hath ſomething to ſay unto you, which although I
know it will be very unacceptable, yet notwithſtanding they are willing and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to diſcharge their Duty.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <p>Then <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> went on in a long Harangue, endeavouring to juſtifie their proceedings,
miſapplying Law and Hiſtory, and raking up and wreſting whatſoever he thought fit for his
purpoſe, alleging the Examples of former Treaſons and Rebellions, both at home and abroad,
as authentick proofs; and concluding that the King was a <hi>Tyrant, Traitor, Murtherer,</hi> and
publick <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Commonwealth of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His Majeſty having with His wonted Patience heard all theſe Reproaches, anſwered,</p>
                        <sp>
                           <p>I would deſire only one word before you give Sentence, and that is, That you
would hear Me concerning thoſe great Imputations that you have laid to My charge.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                           <p>Sir, you muſt give me now leave to go on, for I am not far from your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and your time is now paſt.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>But I ſhall deſire you will hear Me a few words to you; for, truly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Sentence you will, put upon Me, in reſpect of thoſe heavy Imputations that I ſee
by your ſpeech you have put upon Me. Sir, it is very true that—</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Bradſhaw.</speaker>
                           <p>Sir, I muſt put you in mind: truly, Sir, I would not willingly, at this
time eſpecially, interrupt you in any thing you have to ſay that is proper for us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of; but, Sir, you have not owned us as a Court, and you look upon as a ſort of
people met together, and we know what Language we receive from your Party.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                           <p>I know nothing of that.</p>

                           <p>You diſavow us as a Court, and therefore for you to addreſs your ſelf to us,
not to acknowledge us as a Court to judge of what you ſay, it is not to be permitted.
And the truth is, all along from the firſt time you were pleaſed to diſavow and diſown
us, the Court needed not to have heard you one word; for unleſs they be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a Court, and engaged, it is not proper for you to ſpeak. Sir, we have given you
too much Liberty already, and admitted of too much Delay, and we may not admit
of any further. Were it proper for us to do, we ſhould hear you freely, and we ſhould
not have declined to have heard you at large, what you could have ſaid or proved on
your behalf, whether for totally excuſing, or for in part excuſing, thoſe great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Charges that in whole or in part are laid upon you. But, Sir, I ſhall trouble you
no longer; your Sins are of ſo large a dimenſion, that if you do but ſeriouſly think of
them, they will drive you to a ſad conſideration, and they may improve in you a ſad
and ſerious repentance. And that the Court doth heartily wiſh, that you may be ſo
penitent for what you have done amiſs, that God may have mercy at leaſt-wiſe upon
your better part. Truly Sir, for the other, it is our parts and duties to do that that
the Law preſcribes. We are not here <hi>Jus dare,</hi> but <hi>Jus dicere:</hi> we cannot be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of what the Scripture tells us, <hi>For to acquit the guilty is of equal abomination as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent;</hi> we may not <hi>acquit the guilty.</hi> What ſentence the Law affirms to a
<hi>Traitor, Tyrant,</hi> a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and a publick <hi>enemy</hi> to the Countrey, that Sentence you
are now to hear read unto you, and that is the Sentence of the Court.</p>
                           <p>Make an <hi>O yes,</hi> and command Silence while the Sentence is read.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Which done, their Clerk,</hi> Broughton, <hi>read the Sentence, drawn up in Parchment.</hi>

                        <p>WHereas the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament had appointed them an High
Court of Juſtice for the Trial of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> before

no more notice of ſo ſtrange and barbarous an indignity, than to wipe it off with His Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief.</p>

ſhould love one another, and forgive their Fathers Enemies. <hi>Then ſaid the King to
Her,</hi> Sweet Heart, you will forget this. No, <hi>ſaid She,</hi> I ſhall never forget it whilſt
I live: <hi>and pouring forth abundance of tears, promiſed Him to write down the particulars.</hi>

they will cut off thy Fathers Head (<hi>upon which words the Child looked very ſtedfaſtly on
Him</hi>) Mark, Child, what I ſay; They will cut off My Head, and perhaps make
thee a King: But mark what I ſay, You muſt not be a King ſo long as your Brothers
<hi>CHARLES</hi> and <hi>JAMES</hi> do live; for they will cut off your Brothers Heads (when
they can catch them) and cut off thy Head too at laſt: and therefore I charge you do
not be made a King by them. <hi>At which the Child ſighing, ſaid,</hi> I will be torn in pieces
firſt. <hi>Which falling ſo unexpectedly from one ſo young, it made the King rejoyce exceedingly.</hi>

to ſee Him. He told me,</hi> He was glad I was come; and although He had
not time to ſay much, yet ſomewhat He had to ſay to Me which He had not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or leave in writing, becauſe He feared their Cruelty was ſuch as that they would
not have permitted Him to write to me. <hi>He wiſhed me</hi> not to grieve and torment my
ſelf for Him, for that would be a glorious Death that He ſhould die, it being for the
Laws and Liberties of this Land, and for maintaining the true Proteſtant Religion.
<hi>He bid me</hi> read Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> Sermons, <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Polity, and Biſhop
<hi>Laud</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which would ground me againſt Popery. <hi>He told me,</hi> He
had forgiven all his Enemies, and hoped God would forgive them alſo; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us, and all the reſt of my Brothers and Siſters, to forgive them. <hi>He bid me</hi>
tell my Mother, that His thoughts had never ſtrayed from Her, and that His Love
ſhould be the ſame to the laſt. <hi>Withal He commanded me and my Brother</hi> to be obedient
to Her, <hi>and bid me</hi> ſend His Bleſſing to the reſt of my Brothers and Siſters, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to all His Friends. <hi>So after He had given me his Bleſſing, I took my leave.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Further, He commanded</hi> us all to forgive thoſe People, but never to truſt them, for
they had been moſt falſe to Him, and to thoſe that gave them Power; and He feared
alſo to their own Souls: <hi>And deſired me</hi> not to grieve for Him, for He ſhould die a
Martyr; and that He doubted not but the Lord would ſettle His Throne upon His
Son, and that we ſhould be all happier than we could have expected to have been if
he had lived. <hi>With many other things which at preſent I cannot remember.</hi>

                     <p>Tueſday the thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> the Fatal Day being come, the Commiſſioners met, and
ordered four or five of their Miniſters to attend upon the King at <hi>S. James</hi>'s, where they
then kept Him: but his Majeſty well knowing what miſerable comforters they were like to prove,
refuſed to have conference with them.</p>
                     <p>That Morning, before his Majeſty was brought thence, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (who with
much ado was permitted to wait upon Him a day or two before, and to aſſiſt Him in that ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant)
read Divine Service in his preſence, in which the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> (the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of our Saviour's Crucifixion) proved the ſecond Leſſon. The King ſuppoſing it to have
been ſelected on purpoſe, thank'd him afterwards for his ſeaſonable choice. But the Biſhop
modeſtly declining that undue thanks, told him that it was the Leſſon appointed by the Calendar
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60710:110"/>
for that day. He alſo then and there received of the Biſhop the holy Sacrament, and performed
all His Devotions in preparation to His Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Which ended, about ten of the clock His Majeſty was brought from Saint <hi>James</hi>'s to
<hi>White-Hall</hi> by a Regiment of Foot, with Colours flying and Drums beating, part marching
before and part behind, with a private guard of Partiſans about Him, the Biſhop on the
the one hand, and Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> (who had the charge of Him) on the other, both bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.
His Majeſty walking very faſt, and bidding them go faſter, added,</p>
                     <p>That He now went before them to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown with leſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
than He had often incouraged His Souldiers to fight for an Earthly Diadem.</p>
                     <p>Being come to the end of the Park, He went up the Stairs leading to the long Gallery in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hall,</hi>
and ſo into the Cabinet Chamber, where He uſed formerly to lodge. There, finding an
unexpected delay in being brought upon the Scaffold, which they had not as then fitted, He paſt
the time, at convenient diſtances, in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>About twelve of the clock, His Majeſty refuſing to dine, only eat a bit of Bread and drank
a Glaſs of Claret: and about an hour after Colonel <hi>Hacker</hi> with other Officers and Souldiers
brought Him, with the Biſhop and Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon,</hi> through the Banqueting-houſe, to the
Scaffold, to which the paſſage was made through a Window. Divers Companies of Foot and
Troups of Horſe were placed on each ſide of the Street, which hindred the approach of the very
numerous Spectators, and the King from ſpeaking what He had premeditated and prepared for
them to hear. Whereupon His Majeſty finding Himſelf diſappointed, omitted much of His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
matter, and for what He meant to ſpeak directed Himſelf chiefly to Colonel <hi>Tomlinſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Shall be very little heard of any body here; I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word unto
you here.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I could hold My peace very well, if I did not think that holding My peace
would make ſome men think that I did ſubmit to the Guilt as well as to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But I think it is My Duty, to God firſt, and to My Country, for to clear My
ſelf both as an honeſt Man, and a good King, and a good Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin firſt with My <hi>Innocency.</hi> In troth, I think it not very needful for Me
to inſiſt long upon this, for all the World knows that I never did begin a War firſt
with the two Houſes of Parliament; and I call God to witneſs, to whom I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make an account, that I never did intend for to incroach upon their Privileges:
they began upon Me; it is the <hi>Militia</hi> they began upon: they confeſt that the <hi>Militia</hi>
was Mine; but they thought it fit for to have it from Me. And to be ſhort, if any
body will look to the Dates of Commiſſions, of their Commiſſions and Mine, and
likewiſe to the Declarations, they will ſee clearly that they began theſe unhappy
Troubles, not I. So that as to the guilt of theſe enormous Crimes that are laid againſt
Me, I hope in God that God will clear Me of it. I will not, (I am in Charity)
God forbid that I ſhould lay it on the two Houſes of Parliament; there is no neceſſity
of either: I hope they are free of this Guilt. For I do believe that ill Inſtruments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and Me have been the chief cauſe of all this blood-ſhed. So that by way
of ſpeaking, as I find my ſelf clear of this, I hope, and pray God, that they may too.
Yet for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian as not to ſay that God's
Judgments are juſt upon Me; many times he does pay Juſtice by an unjuſt Sentence;
that is ordinary.<note place="margin">Upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
                        </note>
 I will only ſay this, That an unjuſt Sentence that I ſuffered for to take
effect is puniſhed now by an unjuſt Sentence upon Me. That is—So far I have ſaid,
to ſhew you that I am an innocent man.</p>
                     <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pointing to the Biſhop.</note>
 I hope there is a good man that
will bear Me witneſs that I have forgiven all the World, and even thoſe in particular
that have been the chief cauſers of My Death: Who they are, God knows, I do not
deſire to know; I pray God forgive them. But this is not all. My Charity muſt go
further; I wiſh that they may repent; for indeed they have committed a great Sin in
that particular: I pray God, with Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their charge.
Nay, not only ſo, but that they may take the right way to the Peace of the Kingdom:
For My Charity commands me not only to forgive particular men,<note place="margin">Turning to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that wrote.</note>
 but My Charity
commands Me to endeavour to the laſt gaſp the Peace of the Kingdom. So, Sirs, I do
wiſh with all My Soul, (and I do hope there is ſome here will carry it further) that
they may endeavour the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:60710:110"/>
Now, Sirs, I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in
a way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you are out of the way. For certainly all the way you ever have had yet, as
I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conqueſt. Certainly this is an ill way:
For Conqueſt, Sir, in My opinion, is never juſt, except there be a good juſt Cauſe,
either for matter of Wrong, or juſt Title; and then if you go beyond it, the firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
that you have to it, that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at the firſt. But if
it be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that He was the great Robber, he was but a petty Robber. And ſo, Sir, I do think
the way that you are in is much out of the way.</p>
                     <p>Now, Sir, for to put you in the way; believe it, you will never do right, nor God
will never proſper you, until you give God his Due, the King his Due, (that is, My
Succeſſors) and the People their Due: I am as much for them as any of you.</p>
                     <p>You muſt give <hi>God</hi> his due, by regulating rightly his Church according to his Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which is now out of order. For to ſet you in a way particularly, now I cannot;
but only this, A National Synod, freely called, freely debating among themſelves;
muſt ſettle this, when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>King,</hi> indeed I will not,—</p>
                     <p>(Then turning to a Gentleman that touched the Axe, He ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Hurt not the Axe, that may hurt Me.) For the King, the Laws of the Land will
clearly inſtruct you for that; therefore, becauſe it concerns My Own particular, I
only give you a touch of it.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>People;</hi> And truly I deſire their Liberty and Freedom as much as any body
whomſoever: but I muſt tell you, that their Liberty and Freedom conſiſts in having
of Government, thoſe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be moſt their
own. It is not for having ſhare in Government, Sir; that is nothing pertaining
to them; a Subject and a Soveraign are clear different things. And therefore until
they do that, I mean, that you do put the People in that Liberty as I ſay, certainly
they will never enjoy themſelves. Sirs, It was for this that now I am come here: If
I would have given way to an Arbitrary way, for to have all Laws changed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I
tell you, (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that I am the <hi>Martyr of the
People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In troth, Sirs, I ſhall not hold you much longer; for I will only ſay this to you,
That in truth I could have deſired ſome little time longer, becauſe that I would have
put this that I have ſaid in a little more order, and a little better digeſted than I have
done; and therefore I hope you will excuſe Me.</p>
                     <p>I have delivered My Conſcience: I pray God that you do take thoſe courſes that
are beſt for the good of the Kingdom and your own Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Then the Biſhop ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Though it be very well known what Your Majeſty's affections are to the Proteſtant
<hi>Religion,</hi> yet it may be expected that You ſhould ſay ſomewhat for the Worlds ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in that particular.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon the King replied,</p>
                     <p>I thank you very heartily, My Lord, for that; I had almoſt forgotten it.</p>
                     <p>In troth, Sirs, My Conſcience in <hi>Religion,</hi> I think, is very well known to all the
World; and therefore I declare before you all, That I die a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> according to
the Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I found it left Me by My Father: and
this honeſt man,<note place="margin">Pointing to the Biſhop.</note>
 I think, will witneſs it.</p>
                     <p>Then turning to the Officers he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Sirs, Excuſe Me for this ſame. I have a good Cauſe, and I have a gracious God.
I will ſay no more.</p>
                     <p>Then to Colonel <hi>Hacker</hi> He ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Take care that they do not put Me to pain. And, Sir, this, and it pleaſe you—</p>
                     <p>But a Gentleman coming near the Axe, the King ſaid,</p>
                     <p>Take heed of the Axe; pray take heed of the Axe.</p>
                     <p>And to the Executioner, He ſaid,</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſay but very ſhort Prayers, and when I thruſt out My hands—</p>
                     <p>Then He called to the Biſhop for His Cap, and having put it on, asked the Executioner,</p>
                     <p>Does My Hair trouble you?</p>
                     <p>Who deſired Him to put it all under His Cap; which as he was doing by the help of the Biſhop
and the Executioner, He turned to the Biſhop, and ſaid,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60710:111"/>
I have a good Cauſe, and a gracious God on My ſide.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop ſaid,</p>
                     <p>There is but one Stage more;<note place="margin">Theſe words were ſpoken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between His Majeſty and the Biſhop concerning the ſeveral Stages of man's life, and his courſe through them, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to Poſts and Stages in a Race.</note>
 which though turbulent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
yet is a very ſhort one. You may conſider it will ſoon carry You
a very great way; it will carry You from Earth to Heaven; and there
You ſhall find, to Your great joy, the prize You haſten to, a Crown of
Glory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>King</hi> adjoyns,</p>
                     <p>I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown; where no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
can be, no diſturbance in the world.</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Biſhop.</speaker>
                        <p>You are exchanged from a Temporal to an Eternal Crown: A good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Then the King asked the Executioner,</p>
                     <sp>
                        <p>Is My Hair well?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>And taking off His Cloak and <hi>George,</hi> He delivered His <hi>George</hi> to the Biſhop, ſaying,
<hi>Remember.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then putting off His Doublet, and being in His Waſt-coat, He put on His Cloak again,
and looking upon the Block, ſaid to the Executioner,</p>
                     <sp>
                        <p>You muſt ſet it faſt.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Execut.</speaker>
                        <p> It is faſt, Sir.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                        <p>It might have been a little higher.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Execut.</speaker>
                        <p> It can be no higher, Sir.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                        <p>When I put out My hands this way, then—</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Then having ſaid a few words to Himſelf, as He ſtood, with hands and eyes lift up,
immediately ſtooping down He laid His Neck upon the Block; and the Executioner again
putting His Hair under His Cap, His Majeſty thinking he had been going to ſtrike, bad
him</p>
                     <sp>
                        <p>Stay for the Sign.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Execut.</speaker>
                        <p> Yes, I will, and it pleaſe Your Majeſty.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>After a very ſhort pauſe, His Majeſty ſtretching forth his hands, the Executioner at
one blow ſevered His Head from His Body: Which being held up and ſhewed to the People,
was with His Body put into a Coffin covered with black Velvet, and carried into His Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>His Blood was taken up by divers perſons for different ends; by ſome as Trophies of their
Villany, by others as Reliques of a Martyr; and in ſome hath had the ſame effect, by the
bleſſing of God, which was often found in His Sacred Touch when living.</p>
                     <p>The Malice of His Enemies ended not with His Life; For when His Body was carried to
Saint <hi>James</hi>'s to be opened, they directed their Empericks to ſearch for ſuch Symptomes as
might diſgrace His Perſon or His Poſterity. But herein they were prevented by an honeſt
Intruder, who gave a true account of His ſound and excellent Temperament.</p>
                     <p>Being imbalmed, and laid in a Coffin of Lead to be ſeen, for ſome days, by the People, at
length, upon Wedneſday the ſeventh of <hi>February,</hi> it was delivered to four of His Servants,
<hi>Herbert, Mildmay, Preſton</hi> and <hi>Joyner,</hi> who, with ſome others, in mourning equipage
attended the Herſe that night to <hi>Windſore,</hi> and placed it in the Room which was formerly
the Kings Bed-chamber.</p>
                     <p>Next day it was removed into the Deans Hall, which was hung with black and made
dark, and Lights were ſet burning round the Herſe. About three afternoon, the Duke of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Harford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> (others that were ſent to refuſing that laſt Service to the beſt of Princes)
came thither with two Votes paſſed that Morning, whereby the ordering of the King's Burial
was committed to the Duke, provided that the Expences thereof exceeded not five hundred
pounds. This Order they ſheved to Colonel <hi>Whichcot</hi> the Governor of the Caſtle, deſiring
that the Interrment might be in Saint <hi>George's</hi> Chappel, and according to the form of the
<hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> The latter Requeſt the Governour denied, ſaying, <hi>That it was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the Parliament would permit the uſe of what they had ſo ſolemnly aboliſhed, and
therein deſtroy their own Act.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lords replied,</p>
                     <p>That there was a difference betwixt deſtroying their own Act, and diſpenſing with
it; and that no Power ſo binds its own hands, as to diſable it ſelf in ſome caſes.</p>

The Governour had cauſed an ordinary Grave to be digged in the body of the Church of
<hi>Windſore</hi> for the Interment of the Corps; which the Lords diſdaining, found means by the
direction of an honeſt man, one of the old Knights, to uſe an artifice to diſcover a Vault in
the middle of the Quire, by the hollow ſound they might perceive in knocking with a Staff
upon that place; that ſo it might ſeem to be their own accidental finding out, and no perſon
receive blame for the diſcovery. This place they cauſed to be opened, and entring ſaw one
large Coffin of Lead in the middle of the Vanlt covered with a Velvet Pall, and a leſſer on
one ſide (ſuppoſed to be <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and His beloved Queen <hi>Jane Saint-Maure</hi>) on
the other ſide was room left for another (probably intended for Queen <hi>Katherine Parre,</hi> who
ſurvived Him) where they thought fit to lay the King.</p>
                     <p>Hither the Herſe was born by the Officers of the Garriſon, the four Lords bearing up the
Corners of the Velvet Pall, and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> following. And in this manner was
this Great King, upon Friday the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> about three afternoon, ſilently, and
without other Solemnity than of Sighs and Tears, committed to the Earth, the Velvet Pall
being thrown into the Vault over the Coffin; to which was faſtened an Inſcription in Lead of
theſe words,</p>
                     <q>KING CHARLES 1648.</q>

                  </l>
                  <l>Melt into Showts, and weep your ſelves away.</l>
                  <l>O that each private head could yield a Floud</l>
                  <l>Of Tears, whil'ſt <hi>Britain</hi>'s <hi>Head</hi> ſtreams out His Bloud!</l>
                  <l>Could we pay what His <hi>Sacred Drops</hi> might claim,</l>
                  <l>The World muſt needs be drowned once again.</l>
                  <l>Hands cannot write for Trembling; let our Eye</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Tongues cannot ſpeak; this Grief knows no ſuch vent:</l>
                  <l>Nothing but Silence can be Eloquent.</l>
                  <l>Worlds are not here ſignificant; in This</l>

                  <l>Rebell'd, Thou mad'ſt Thy Paſſions to obey.</l>
                  <l>Hadſt Thou regain'd Thy Throne of State by Power,</l>

                  <l>

                  <l>What Guards are ſet? what Watches do they keep?</l>
                  <l>They do not think Thee ſafe though lock'd in <hi>Sleep.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Would they confine Thy Dreams within to dwell,</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>Are Thy <hi>Devotions</hi> dangerous? Or do</l>

                  <l>Varlets, 'twas only when they ſpake for You.</l>
                  <l>But lo a Charge is Drawn, a Day is ſet,</l>
                  <l>The ſilent LAMB is brought, the <hi>Wolves</hi> are met.</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>And where's the Slaughter-Houſe? <hi>White-hall</hi> muſt be,</l>
                  <l>Lately His <hi>Palace,</hi> now His <hi>Calvary.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Great CHARLES, is this Thy dying-place? And where</l>
                  <l>Thou wer't our KING, art Thou our MARTYR there?</l>
                  <l>Thence, thence Thy Soul took flight; and there will we</l>
                  <l>Not ceaſe to <hi>Mourn,</hi> where Thou didſt ceaſe to <hi>Be.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And thus, bleſt Soul, He's gone: a <hi>Star,</hi> whoſe fall,</l>

OF
ENGLAND.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Might call this Collection, A Complete <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Politicks,</hi>
as comprehending both the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of all true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>-men;
and thoſe largely ſet forth in ſome of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Diſcourſes that were ever written in this kind: Which, for their
own ſakes, might claim ſome better reſpect from the preſent Age,
than to be caſt aſide as out-dated Pamphlets, or, at the beſt, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
ſcattered like the Leaves of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> without any care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
and tranſmitting them to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>The ſad Experience of ſo many years hath taught this Nation to
their coſt, how miſerable even the greateſt Subjects make themſelves,
by incroaching upon that <hi>Soveraignty</hi> which alone can protect them
from the Injuries and the Scorn of their Inferiours. Here you will
diſcover the <hi>Arts,</hi> the <hi>Means,</hi> and the <hi>Degrees,</hi> by which thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
were attempted and atchieved; Which whenſoever you ſee
repeated, you will know, the Plot is as well againſt your Privilege, and
the Liberty of your Countrey, as the Prerogative of your Prince.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, If it were as eaſie to root out the remembrance of the ill
Examples, as it is to remit the puniſhment of the Crimes, by Acts of
Grace, and Pardon, and Oblivion; it were perhaps no Imprudence
to let thoſe Miſchiefs ſleep with their Authors, and leave their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
buried in the Ruines they have made. But ſince many that are
content to take the utmoſt advantage of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> are yet too good to
acknowledge they ever ſtood in need of any; ſince moſt will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
only <hi>What</hi> hath been done, and few trouble themſelves to inquire
<hi>How,</hi> or <hi>Why:</hi> it cannot be thought impertinent, together with the
<hi>Actions,</hi> to repreſent alſo the true <hi>Cauſes</hi> that have produced ſuch Effects,
and the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that attended them; which may remain as Marks
to warn Poſterity of thoſe Errors which have coſt the preſent Age ſo
dear.</p>
                  <p>This is here done, not from the private phancies or obſervations of
any one Perſon or Party, but from the <hi>Publick</hi> and Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Both, digeſted in ſuch order, that the Reader may compare
what both ſides had to ſay for themſelves, and thereby diſcern, whoſe
Deſigns and what Counſels tended moſt to the Peace and Welfare of
<pb facs="tcp:60710:114"/>
the Nation: A ſtudy moſt proper for thoſe Ranks of men whom the
Favour of Princes hath raiſed above the Common Multitude, to this
one End, that they may aſſiſt Them in the adminiſtration of Their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and in keeping Peace and good order in their Countries.</p>
                  <p>To have Collected all that paſſed in theſe great Conteſts, would
have been the Work of many Volumes: But the moſt material, and
moſt neceſſary to carry on the Series of Times and Things (which, in
a manner, comprehend the Sum, or at leaſt ſhew the Reſult of all
the reſt) are here diſpoſed according to their moſt natural order of
time, under theſe few heads.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE King's moſt Excellent Majeſty, ſince His happy acceſs to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown of this Realm, having by His Royal Authority ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
and aſſembled two ſeveral Parliaments, the firſt whereof was in
<hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt by adjournment held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there diſſolved, and
the other begun in <hi>February</hi> laſt, and continued until the fifteenth day
of this preſent month of <hi>June,</hi> and then to the unſpeakable grief of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and (as He believeth) of all His good and well-affected Subjects, diſſolved alſo;
although He well knoweth the the calling, adjourning, proroguing and diſſolving
of Parliaments, being His Great Council of the Kingdom, do peculiarly belong unto
Himſelf by an undoubted Prerogative inſeparably united to His Imperial Crown, of
which, as of His other Regal Actions, He is not bound to give an account to any but
to God only, whoſe immediate Lieutenant and Vicegerent He is in theſe His Realms
and Dominions, by the Divine Providence committed to His Charge and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yet foraſmuch as, by the aſſiſtance of the Almighty, His purpoſe is ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Himſelf and all His Actions, eſpecially the great and publick Actions of State
concerning the weal of His People, as may juſtifie themſelves not only to His own
Conſcience and to His own People, but to the whole World; His Majeſty hath
thought it fit and neceſſary, as the Affairs now ſtand both at home and abroad, to
make a true, plain and clear Declaration of the cauſes which moved His Majeſty to
aſſemble, and after inforced Him to diſſolve theſe Parliaments; that ſo the mouth
of Malice it ſelf may be ſtopped, and the doubts and fears of His own good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
at home, and of His Friends and Allies abroad, may be ſatisfied, and the
deſerved blame of ſo unhappy accidents may juſtly light upon the Authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>When His Majeſty, by the death of His dear and Royal Father of ever-bleſſed
memory, firſt came to the Crown, He found himſelf ingaged in a War with a potent
Enemy, not undertaken raſhly, nor without juſt and honourable grounds, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
for the neceſſary defence of Himſelf and His Dominions, for the ſupport of
His Friends and Allies, for the redeeming of the ancient honour of this Nation, for
the recovering of the Patrimony of His dear Siſter, her Conſort and their Children,
injuriouſly and under colour of Treaties and Friendſhip taken from them, and for the
maintenance of the true Religion; and invited thereunto and incouraged therein by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60710:115"/>
the humble advice of both the Houſes of Parliament, and by their large promiſes and
proteſtations to His late majeſty, to give Him full and real aſſiſtance in thoſe Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which were of ſo great importance of this Realm, and to the general Peace and
Safety of all His Friends and Allies. But when His majeſty entred into a view of His
Treaſure, He found how ill provided He was to proceed effectually with ſo great an
Action, unleſs He might be aſſured to receive ſuch Supplies from His loving Subjects
as might inable Him to manage the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon His majeſty being willing to tread in the ſteps of His Royal Progenitors,
for the making of good and wholſome Laws for the better government of His people,
for the right underſtanding of their true Grievances, and for the ſupply of moneys to
be imployed for thoſe publick ſervices, He did reſolve to ſummon a Parliament with
all convenient ſpeed He might; and finding a former Parliament already called in
the life of His Father, He was deſirous, for the ſpeedier diſpatch of His weighty
affairs and gaining of time, to have continued the ſame without any alteration of the
members thereof, had He not been adviſed to the contrary by His Judges and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
at Law, for that it had been ſubject to queſtion in Law, which He deſired to
avoid. But as ſoon as poſſibly He could, He ſummoned a new Parliament, which
He did with much confidence and aſſurance of the love of His People, that thoſe who
not long before had with ſome importunity won his Father to break off his former
Treaties with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to effect it had uſed the mediation of his now majeſty, being
then Prince and a member of the Parliament, and had promiſed in Parliament their
uttermoſt aſſiſtance for the inabling of his late majeſty to undergo the War which they
then foreſaw might follow, would aſſuredly have performed it to his now majeſty, and
would not have ſuffered him in his firſt Enterpriſe of ſo great an expectation to have run
the leaſt hazard through their defaults.</p>
                     <p>This Parliament (after ſome adjournment by reaſon of his majeſtie's unavoidable
occaſions interpoſing) being aſſembled on the eighteenth day of <hi>June,</hi> it is true that
his Commons in Parliament, taking into their due and ſerious conſideration the
manifold occaſions which at his firſt entry did preſs his majeſty, and his moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
affairs which both at home and abroad were then in action, did with great
readineſs and alacrity, as a pledge of their moſt bounden Duty and Thankfulneſs,
and as the firſt-fruits of the moſt dutiful affections of his loving and loyal Subjects
devoted to his ſervice, preſent his majeſty with the free and chearful gift of two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Subſidies; which their gift, and much more the freeneſs and heartineſs expreſſed
in the giving thereof, his majeſty did thankfully and lovingly accept. But when he
had more narrowly entred into the conſideration of his great affairs wherein he was
imbarked, and from which he could not without much diſhonour and diſadvantage
withdraw his hand, He ſound that this ſumme of money was much ſhort of that
which of neceſſity muſt be preſently expended for the ſetting forward of thoſe great
actions which by advice of his Council he had undertaken, and were that Summer to
be purſued. This his majeſty imparted to his Commons Houſe of Parliament: but
before the ſame could receive that debate and due conſideration which was fit, the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
viſitation of the Plague in and about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where
the Lords and the principal Gentlemen of quality of his whole Kingdom were for the
time of this their ſervice lodged and abiding, did ſo much increaſe, that his majeſty,
without extream peril to the lives of His good Subjects, which were dear unto him,
could not continue the Parliament any longer in that place.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty therefore on the eleventh day of <hi>July</hi> then following adjourned the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> until the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> then following, to the City of
<hi>Oxford;</hi> and his Highneſs was ſo careful to accommodate his Lords and Commons
there, that, as He made choice of that place, being then the freeſt of all others from
the danger of that grievous Sickneſs, ſo He there fitted the Parliament-men with all
things convenient for their entertainment: and his Majeſty himſelf being in his own
heart ſincere and free from all ends upon his people (which the Searcher of hearts beſt
knoweth) He little expected that any miſconſtruction of His Actions would have been
made, as He there found. But when the Parliament had been a while there aſſembled,
and His Majeſtie's Affairs opened unto them, and a further ſupply deſired, as neceſſity
required, He found them ſo ſlow and ſo full of delays and diverſions in their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that before any thing could be determined, the fearful Contagion daily increaſed,
and was diſperſed into all the parts of this Kingdom, and came home even their
doors where they were aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60710:115"/>
His Majeſty therefore rather preferred the ſafety of His People from that
preſent and viſible danger, than the providing for that which was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
but no leſs dangerous to the ſtate of this Kingdom, and of the affairs of
that part of Chriſtendom which then were and yet are in friendſhip and alliance
with His Majeſty; and thereupon His Majeſty, not being then able to diſcern
when it might pleaſe God to ſtay His hand of Viſitation, nor what place might be more
ſecure than other at a time convenient for their re-aſſembling, His Majeſty diſſolved
that Parliament.</p>
                     <p>That Parliament being now ended, His Majeſty did not therewith caſt off His
Royal care of His great and important affairs; but by the advice of His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
and of His Council of War, He continued His preparations and former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and therein not only expended thoſe moneys which by the two Subſidies
aforeſaid were given unto Him for His own private uſe, whereof He had too
much occaſion, as He found the ſtate of His Exchequer at His firſt entrance;
but added much more of His own, as by His credit and the credit of ſome of His
Servants He was able to compaſs the ſame. At laſt, by much diſadvantage by the
retarding of proviſions and uncertainty of the means, His Navy was prepared and
ſet to Sea, and the deſigns unto which they were ſent and ſpecially directed were ſo
probable and ſo well adviſed, that had they not miſcarried in the execution, His
Majeſty is well aſſured they would have given good ſatisfaction not only to His
own people, but to all the world, that they were not lightly or unadviſedly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
and purſued. But it pleaſed God, who is the Lord of Hoſts, and unto
whoſe Providence and good pleaſure His Majeſty doth and ſhall ever ſubmit Himſelf
and all His endeavours, not to give that ſucceſs which was deſired. And yet were
thoſe attempts not altogether ſo fruitleſs as the envy of the Times hath apprehended,
the Enemy receiving thereby no ſmall loſs, and our party no little advantage; and it
would much avail to further His Majeſtie's great affairs and the Peace of Chriſtendom,
which ought to be the true end of all hoſtility, were theſe firſt beginnings, which are
moſt ſubject to miſcarry, well ſeconded and purſued, as His Majeſty intended, and as,
in the judgment of all men converſant in actions of this nature, were fit not to have
been neglected.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus acted, and God of his infinite Goodneſs, beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
aſſwaging the rage of the Peſtilence, and in a manner of a ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
health and ſafety to the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which are the
fitteſt places for the reſort of His Majeſty, His Lords and Commons, to meet in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
His Majeſty in the depth of Winter, no ſooner deſcried the probability of
a ſafe aſſembling of His people, and in His Princely Wiſdom and Providence fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,
that if the opportunity of ſeaſons ſhould be omitted, preparations both defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and offenſive could not be made in ſuch ſort as was requiſite for their common
ſafety, but He adviſed and reſolved of the ſummoning of a new Parliament, where
He might freely communicate the neceſſities of the State, and by the counſel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, who are the repreſentative body of
the whole Kingdom, and the great Counſel of the Realm, He might proceed in theſe
enterpriſes, and be inabled thereunto, which concern the common good, ſafety and
honour both of Prince and People; and accordingly the ſixth of <hi>February</hi> laſt a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was begun.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt meeting His Majeſty did forbear to preſs them with any thing which
might have the leaſt appearance of His own Intereſt, but recommended unto them
the care of making of good Laws, which are the ordinary ſubject for a Parliament:
His Majeſty believing that they could not have ſuffered many days, much leſs many
weeks, to have paſſed by, before the apprehenſion and care of the common ſafety of
this Kingdom, and of the true Religion proſeſſed and maintained therein, and of Our
Friends and Allies, who muſt proſper or ſuffer with us, would have led them to a due
and a timely conſideration of all the means which might beſt conduce to thoſe ends:
which the Lords of the higher Houſe by a Committee of that Houſe did timely and
ſeaſonably conſider of, and invited the Commons to a Conference concerning that
great buſineſs; at which Conference there were opened unto them the great occaſions
which preſſed His Majeſty: which making no impreſſion with them, His majeſty
did, firſt by meſſage, and after by Letters, put the Houſe of Commons in mind of
that which was moſt neceſſary, the defence of the Kingdom, and due and timely prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60710:116"/>
The Commons Houſe after this, upon the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> laſt, with
one unanimous conſent at firſt agreed to give unto His Majeſty three intire Subſidies
and three Fiteens for a preſent ſupply unto Him; and upon the ſix and twentieth of
<hi>April</hi> after, upon ſecond cogitations they added a fourth Subſidy, and ordered the days
of payment for them all; whereof the firſt ſhould have been on the laſt day of this
preſent month of <hi>June.</hi> Upon this, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and other Princes and States
being ingaged with His Majeſty in this Common Cauſe, His Majeſty fitted His occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
according to the times which were appointed for the payment of thoſe Subſidies
and Fifteens, and haſtned on the Lords Committees and His Council at War to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their reſolutions for the ordering and ſetting of His deſigns: which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did, and brought them to that maturity, that they found no impediment to a
final concluſion of their Counſels, but want of money to put things into Action. His
Majeſty hereupon, who had with much patience expected the real performance of that
which the Commons had promiſed, finding the time of the year poſting away, and
having intelligence, not only from His own Miniſters and Subjects in forein parts, but
from all parts of Chriſtendom, of the great and powerful preparations of the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and that His deſign was upon this Kingdom, or the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or
both, (and it is hard to determine which of them would be of worſt conſequence)
He acquainted the Houſe of Commons therewith, and laid open unto them truly and
clearly how the ſtate of things then ſtood, and yet ſtand, and at ſeveral times and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeveral occaſions re-iterated the ſame. But that Houſe being abuſed by the violent
and ill-adviſed Paſſions of a few members of the Houſe, for private and perſonal ends,
ill beſeeming publick perſons truſted by their Country, as then they were, not only
neglected, but wilfully refuſed to hearken to all the gentle admonitions which His
Majeſty could give them, and neither did nor would intend any thing but the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one of the Peers of this Realm; and that in ſuch a diſordered manner, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſet at their own inſtance into a Legal way, wherein the proofs on either part would
have ruled the cauſe, which His Majeſty allowed, they were not therewith content,
but in their intemperate paſſions and deſires to ſeek for errors in another, fell into a
greater error themſelves, and not only neglected to give juſt ſatisfaction to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in ſeveral caſes which happened concerning His Regality, but wholly forgot their
ingagements to His Majeſty for the publick defence of the Realm: whereupon His
Majeſty wrote a Letter to the Speaker, dated the ninth day of <hi>June,</hi> 1626. in theſe
words.</p>
                     <p>TRuſty and well-beloved, We greet you well. Our Houſe of Commons cannot forget how
often and how earneſtly We have called upon them for the ſpeeding of that aid which they
intend unto Vs for Our great and weighty Affairs, concerning the ſafety and honour of Vs
and Our Kingdoms; and now the time being ſo far ſpent, that unleſs it be preſently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it can neither bring Vs money nor credit by the time which themſelves have prefixed,
which is the laſt of this month, and being further deferred would be of little uſe, We being
daily advertiſed from all parts of the great preparation of the Enemy ready to aſſail us, We
hold it neceſſary by theſe Our Letters to give them Our laſt and final admonition, and to let
them know, that We ſhall account all further delays and excuſes to be expreſs denials: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
We will and require you to ſignifie unto them, that We do expect that they forthwith bring
forth their Bill of Subſidy to be paſſed without delay or condition, ſo as it may fully paſs that
Houſe by the end of the next week at the furtheſt; which if they do not, it will force Vs to take
other reſolutions. But let them know, that if they finiſh this according to Our deſire, that We
are reſolved to let them ſit together for the diſpatch of their other affairs, and after their receſs
to bring them together again the next Winter. And if by their denial or delay any thing of
ill conſequence ſhall fall out either at home or abroad, We may call God and man to witneſs, that
We have done Our part to prevent it, by calling Our people together to adviſe with Vs, by
opening the weight of Our occaſions unto them, and by requiring their timely help and aſſiſtance
in thoſe Actions wherein We ſtand ingaged by their own Counſels. And We will and command
you, that this Letter be publickly read in the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding which Letter read in the Houſe, being a clear and gracious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
of His Majeſty's reſolutions, they never ſo much as admitted one reading to the
Bill of Subſidies; but in ſtead thereof they prepared and voted a Remonſtrance or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
which they intended to prefer to His Majeſty, containing (though pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with gloſing terms) as well many diſhonourable aſperſions upon His Majeſty, and
upon the Sacred memory of His deceaſed Father, as alſo dilatory excuſes for their not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60710:116"/>
proceeding with the Subſidies, adding thereto alſo coloured conditions, croſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
His Majeſtie's direction, which His Majeſty underſtanding, and eſteeming (as He
had cauſe) to be a denial of the promiſed Supply, and finding that no admonitions
could move, no reaſons or perſwaſions could prevail, when the time was ſo far ſpent,
that they had put an impoſſibility upon themſelves to perform their promiſes, when
they eſteemed all gracious Meſſages unto them to be but interruptions; His Majeſty
upon mature adviſement diſcerning that all further patience would prove fruitleſs, on
the fifteenth day of this preſent month He hath diſſolved this unhappy Parliament: the
acting whereof as it was to his Majeſty an unexpreſſible grief; ſo the memory thereof
doth renew the hearty ſorrow which all His good and well-affected Subjects will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
with Him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe paſſages his Majeſty hath at the more length and with the true Circumſtances
thereof expreſſed, and publiſhed to the world, leſt that which hath been unfortunate
in it ſelf, through the Malice of the authors of ſo great a miſchief, and the malevolent
Report of ſuch as are ill-affected to this State or the true Religion here profeſſed, or the
fears or jealouſies of Friends and dutiful Subjects, might be made more unfortunate in
the Conſequences of it, which may be of worſe effect than at the firſt can be well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
And his Majeſty, being beſt privy to the integrity of His own heart, for the
conſtant maintaining of the ſincerity and unity of the true Religion profeſſed in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to free it from the open contagion of Popery and ſecret infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Schiſm, of both which by His publick Acts and Actions He hath given good
teſtimony, and with a ſingle heart, as in the preſence of God, who can beſt judge
thereof, purpoſeth reſolutely and conſtantly to proceed in the due execution of either;
and obſerving the ſubtilty of the adverſe party, He cannot but believe that the hand of

beyond the intentions of the Actors) have cauſed theſe diverſions and diſtractions: and

Subjects, in whoſe loves He doth repoſe Himſelf with confidence, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it as his greateſt riches; for the aſſuring of his Friends and Allies, with whom, by
God's aſſiſtance, He will not break in the ſubſtance of what he hath undertaken; for
the diſcouraging of his Adverſaries, and the adverſaries of his Cauſe, and of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Religion, hath put on this reſolution, which He doth hereby publiſh to
all the world; That as God hath made him King of this great People and large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
famous in former Ages both by Land and Sea, and truſted him to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Protector both of their perſons and fortunes, and a Defender of the Faith and
true Religion: ſo He will go on chearfully and conſtantly in the defence thereof, and
(notwithſtanding ſo many difficulties and diſcouragements) will take his Scepter and
Sword into his hand, and not expoſe the perſons of the people committed to his charge
to the unſatiable deſires of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who hath long thirſted after an univerſal
Monarchy, nor their Conſciences to the yoke of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that at home
he will take care to redreſs the juſt Grievances of his good Subjects as ſhall be every

laſt paſt, ſithence which time the ſame hath been continued: and although in this time,
by the malevolent diſpoſitions of ſome ill-affected perſons of the Houſe of Commons,
We have had ſundry juſt cauſes of offence and diſlike of their proceedings; yet We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
with patience to try the uttermoſt, which We the rather did, for that We found
in that Houſe a great number of ſober and grave perſons, well affected to Religion and
Government, and deſirous to preſerve Unity and Peace in all parts of Our Kingdom;
and therefore having on the five and twentieth day of <hi>February</hi> laſt, by the uniform Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Our Privy Council, cauſed both Houſes to be adjourned until this preſent day,
hoping in the mean time that a better and more right underſtanding might be begotten
between Us and the Members of that Houſe, whereby this Parliament might have an
happy end and iſſue; and for the ſame intent, We did again this day command the like
Adjournment to be made until the tenth day of this month: It hath ſo happened by the
diſobedient and ſeditious carriage of thoſe ſaid ill-affected perſons of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that We and Our Regal authority and Commandment have been ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
as Our Kingly Office cannot bear, nor any former Age can parallel. And
therefore it is Our full and abſolute reſolution to diſſolve the ſame Parliament; whereof
We thought good to give notice unto all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and to the
Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of this preſent Parliament, and to all others whom
it may concern, that they may depart about their needful affairs, without attending
any longer here. Nevertheleſs We will that they and all others ſhould take notice,
that We do and ever will diſtinguiſh between thoſe who have ſhewed good affection to
Religion and Government, and thoſe that have given themſelves over to Faction, and
to work diſturbance to the Peace and good order of our Kingdom.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Never came here upon ſo unpleaſant an occaſion, it being the Diſſolution of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore men may have ſome cauſe to wonder why I ſhould not rather
chuſe to do this by Commiſſion, it being a general Maxim of Kings, to leave harſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to their Miniſters, Themſelves only executing pleaſing things. Yet conſidering
that Juſtice as well conſiſts in reward and praiſe of Vertue as puniſhing of Vice; I
thought it neceſſary to come here to day, to declare to you and all the world, that it was
meerly the undutiful and ſeditious carriage in the lower Houſe that hath made the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Parliament. And you, my Lords, are ſo far from being cauſes of it, that I
take as much comfort in your dutiful demeanors, as I am juſtly diſtaſted with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
Yet to avoid miſtakings, let me tell you, that it is ſo far from me to adjudge
all the Houſe alike guilty, that I know that there are many there as dutiful Subjects as
any in the world; it being but ſome few Vipers amongſt them that did caſt this miſt of
undutifulneſs over moſt of their eyes: yet to ſay truth, there was a good number there
that could not be infected with this contagion; inſomuch that ſome did expreſs their
duties in ſpeaking; which was the general fault of the Houſe the laſt day. To conclude,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60710:117"/>
as theſe Vipers muſt look for their reward of puniſhment; ſo you, my Lords, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect from Me that favour and protection that a good King oweth to His loving and
dutiful Nobility.</p>
                     <p>And now, my Lord Keeper, do what I have commanded you.</p>

                     <head>His MAJESTIE's Declaration to all His loving Subjects, of the Cauſes
which moved Him to Diſſolve the Parliament.</head>
                     <p>HOwſoever Princes are not bound to give account of their Actions but to God alone;
yet for the ſatisfaction of the minds and affections of Our loving Subjects, We have
thought good to ſet down thus much by way of Declaration, that We may appear to
the world in the truth and ſincerity of Our own Actions, and not in thoſe colours in
which We know ſome turbulent and ill-affected Spirits (to maſque and diſguiſe their
own wicked intentions, dangerous to the State) would repreſent Us to the publick view.</p>
                     <p>We aſſembled Our Parliament the ſeventeenth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the third year of Our
Reign, for the ſafety of Religion, for ſecuring Our Kingdoms and Subjects at home,
and Our Friends and Allies abroad: and therefore at the firſt ſitting down of it We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the miſerable afflicted eſtate of thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Germany, France</hi>
and other parts of Chriſtendom; the diſtreſſed extremities of Our deareſt Uncle the
King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> chaſed out of a great part of his Dominions; the ſtrength of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which was united againſt Us; that (beſides the <hi>Pope</hi> and houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and their
ancient Confederates) the <hi>French</hi> King profeſſed the rooting out of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
that of the Princes and States on Our party ſome were over run, others diverted,
and ſome diſabled to give aſſiſtance. For which and other important motives We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
a ſpeedy ſupply of Treaſure, anſwerable to the neceſſities of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things in the beginning were well reſented by the Houſe of Commons, and
with much alacrity and readineſs they agreed to grant a liberal aid: But before it was
brought to any perfection they were diverted by a multitude of queſtions raiſed amongſt
them concerning their Liberties and Priviledges, and by other long diſputes, that the
Bill did not paſs in a long time; and by that delay Our affairs were put into far worſe
caſe than at the firſt, Our forein actions then in hand being thereby diſgraced and ruined
for want of timely help.</p>
                     <p>In this, as We are not willing to derogate from the merit and good intentions of
thoſe wiſe and moderate men of that Houſe (to whoſe forwardneſs We attribute it that
it was propounded and reſolved ſo ſoon,) ſo We muſt needs ſay, that the delay of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it when it was reſolved, occaſioned by cauſleſs jealouſies ſtirred up by men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temper, did much leſſen both the reputation and reality of that ſupply: and their
ſpirit infuſed into many of the Commiſſioners and Aſſeſſors in the Country, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
up the Subſidies in ſuch a ſcanty proportion as is infinitely ſhort, not only of Our
great Occaſions, but of the precedents of former Subſidies, and of the intentions of all
well-affected men in that Houſe.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe large diſputes, as We permitted many of Our high Prerogatives to be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which in the beſt times of Our Predeceſſors had never been queſtioned without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
or ſharp reproof; ſo We did endeavour to have ſhortned thoſe debates, for
winning of time, which would have much advantaged Our great Affairs both at home
and abroad: And therefore both by Speeches and Meſſages We did often declare Our
gracious and clear reſolution to maintain, not only the Parliament, but all Our People,
in their ancient and juſt liberties, without either violation or diminution; and in the
end, for their full ſatisfaction and ſecurity, did by an anſwer, framed in the from by
themſelves deſired, to their Parliamentary Petition, confirm their ancient and juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Rights; which We reſolve with all Conſtancy and Juſtice to maintain.</p>
                     <p>This Parliament, howſoever, beſides the ſetling Our neceſſary Supply and their own
Liberties, they waſted much time in ſuch proceedings (blaſting Our Government) as
We are unwilling to remember, yet We ſuffered to ſit until themſelves deſired us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a time for their receſs, not naming either Adjournment or Prorogation.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, by advice of Our Council, We reſolved to Prorogue, and make a Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and to that end prefixed a day, by which they might (as was meet in ſo long a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
finiſh ſome profitable and good Laws; and withal gave order for a gracious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to all Our Subjects: which, according to the uſe of former Parliaments, paſſed the
higher Houſe, and was ſent down to the Commons. All which being graciouſly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Us, was ill entertained by ſome diſaffected perſons of that Houſe, who by their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60710:118"/>
artifices in a ſhort time raiſed ſo much heat and diſtemper in the Houſe, for no other
viſible cauſe, but becauſe We had declared Our reſolution to prorogue, as Our Counſel
adviſed, and not to adjourn, as ſome of that Houſe (after Our reſolution declared, and
not before) did manifeſt themſelves to affect; that ſeldom hath greater paſſion been
ſeen in that Houſe upon the greateſt occaſions. And then ſome glances in the Houſe, but
open rumors abroad, were ſpread, that by the Anſwer to the Petition We had given
away not only Our Impoſitions upon goods exported and imported, but the Tonnage
and Poundage: whereas in the debate and hammering of that Petition there was no
ſpeech or mention in either Houſe concerning thoſe Impoſitions, but concerning Taxes
and other charges within the Land; much leſs was there any thought thereby to debar
Us of Tonnage and Poundage, which both before and after the Anſwer to that Petition,
the Houſe of Commons, in all their Speeches and Treaties, did profeſs they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to grant. And at the ſame time many other miſinterpretationss were raiſed of that
Petition and Anſwer, by men not well diſtinguiſhing between well-ordered liberty and
licentiouſneſs; as if by Our Anſwer to that Petition We had let looſe the Reins of Our
Government. And in this diſtemper, the Houſe of Commons laying aſide the pardon
(a thing never done in any former Parliament) and other buſineſſes fit to have been
concluded that Seſſion, ſome of them went about to frame and contrive a Remonſtrance
againſt Our receiving of Tonnage and Poundage; which was ſo far proceeded in, the
night before the prefixed time for concluding the Seſſion, and ſo haſtened by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
thereof, that they meant to have put it to the Vote of the Houſe the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before We ſhould prorogue the Seſſion. And therefore finding Our gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaours
in that Seſſion afforded to Our people ſo ill requited, and ſuch ſiniſter ſtrains made
upon Our Anſwer to that Petition, to the diminution of Our Profit, and (which was
more) to the danger of Our Government; We reſolved to prevent the finiſhing of that
Remonſtrance, and other dangerous intentions of ſome ill-affected perſons, by ending
the Seſſion the next morning ſome few hours ſooner than was expected, and by Our
own mouth to declare to both Houſes the cauſes thereof; and, for hindring the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe ſiniſter interpretations of that Petition and Anſwer, to give ſome neceſſary
directions for ſetling and quieting Our Government until another meeting, which We
performed accordingly the ſix and twentieth of <hi>June</hi> laſt.</p>
                     <p>The Seſſion thus ended and the Parliament riſen, that intended Remonſtrance gave
Us occaſion to look into that buſineſs of Tonnage and Poundage. And therefore, though
Our neceſſities pleaded ſtrongly for Us, yet We were not apt to ſtrain that point too
far, but reſolved to guide Our ſelf by the practice of former Ages, and examples of Our
moſt Noble Predeceſſors; thinking thoſe Counſels beſt warranted, which the wiſdom
of former Ages concurring with the preſent occaſions did approve: And therefore gave
order for a diligent ſearch of Records; upon which it was found, that although in the
Parliament holden in the firſt year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, the Subſidy
of Tonnage and Poundage was not granted unto that King, but was firſt granted unto
him by Parliament in the third year of his Reign; yet the ſame was accounted and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to that King from the firſt day of his Reign, all the firſt and ſecond years of his
Reign, and until it was granted by Parliament: and that in the ſucceeding times of
King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Subſidy of Tonnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
was not only enjoyed by every of thoſe Kings and Queens, from the death of each
of them deceaſing, until it was granted by Parliament unto the Succeſſor; but in all
thoſe times, (being for the moſt part peaceable, and not burthen'd with like charges and
neceſſities as theſe modern times) the Parliament did moſt readily and chearfully, in the
beginning of every of thoſe Reigns, grant the ſame, as a thing moſt neceſſary for the
guarding of the Seas, ſafety and defence of the Realm, and ſupportation of the Royal
Dignity. And in the time of Our Royal Father, of bleſſed memory, He enjoyed the
ſame a full year, wanting very few days, before his Parliament began, and above a year
before the Act of Parliament for the grant of it was paſſed: and yet when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was aſſembled, it was granted without difficulty. And in Our own time, We
quietly received the ſame three years and more, expecting with patience in ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
the like grant thereof as had been made to ſo many of Our Predeceſſors; the
Houſe of Commons ſtill profeſſing, that multitude of other buſineſs, and not want of
willingneſs on their part, had cauſed the ſetling thereof to be ſo long deferred. And
therefore finding ſo much reaſon and neceſſity for the receiving of the ordinary duties in
the Cuſtom-Houſe to concur with the practice of ſuch a Succeſſion of Kings and Queens,
famous for Wiſdom, Juſtice and Government, and nothing to the contrary, but that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60710:118"/>
intended Remonſtrance hatched out of the paſſionate brains of a few particular perſons;
We thought it ſo far from the wiſdom and duty of a Houſe of Parliament, as We could
not think that any moderate and diſcreet man (upon compoſed thoughts, ſetting aſide
paſſion and diſtemper) could be againſt receiving of Tonnage and Poundage; eſpecially
ſince We do and ſtill muſt purſue thoſe ends, and undergo that Charge, for which it
was firſt granted to the Crown; it having been ſo long and conſtantly continued to Our
Predeceſſors, as that in four ſeveral Acts of Parliament for the granting thereof to King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Our bleſſed Father, it is in expreſs
terms mentioned to have been had and enjoyed by the ſeveral Kings named in thoſe Acts,
time out of mind, by authority of Parliament. And therefore, upon theſe reaſons, We
held it agreeable to Our Kingly Honour, and neceſſary for the ſafety and good of Our
Kingdom, to continue the receipt thereof, as ſo many of Our Predeceſſors had done.
Wherefore when a few Merchants (being at firſt but one or two) fomented, as it is
well known, by thoſe evil Spirits that would have hatched that undutiful Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
began to oppoſe the payment of Our accuſtomed duties in the Cuſtom-houſe,
We gave order to the Officers of Our Cuſtoms to go on; notwithſtanding that oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the receiving of the uſual duties; and cauſed thoſe that refuſed to be warned to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
at the Council-board, that by the wiſdom and authority of Our Council they
might be reduced to obedience and duty: where ſome of them, without reverence or
reſpect to the honour and dignity of that preſence, behaved themſelves with ſuch bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and inſolency of ſpeech, as was not to be endured by a far meaner Aſſembly; much
leſs to be countenanced by a Houſe of Parliament, againſt the body of Our Privy Council.</p>
                     <p>And as in this We did what in honour and reaſon was fit for the preſent; ſo Our
thoughts were daily intentive upon the re-aſſembling of Our Parliament, with full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
on Our part to take away all ill underſtanding between Us and Our people,
whoſe loves as We deſired to continue and preſerve, ſo We uſed Our beſt endeavours to
prepare and facilitate the way to it. And to this end, having taken a ſtrict and exact ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of Our Government both in the Church and Commonwealth, and what things
were moſt fit and neceſſary to be reformed, We found in the firſt place, that much excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been taken at a book intituled <hi>Appello Caeſarem,</hi> or An Appeal to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in the year 1625. by <hi>Richard Mountague,</hi> then Batchelour of Divinity, and now
Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter:</hi> and becauſe it did open the way to thoſe Schiſms and Diviſions
which have ſince enſued in the Church, We did, for remedy and redreſs thereof, and for
ſatisfaction of the Conſciences of Our good people, not only by Our publick Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
call in that Book, which miniſtred matter of offence; but, to prevent the like danger
for hereafter, reprinted the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
of famous memory; and, by a Declaration before thoſe Articles, We did tie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
all Opinions to the ſenſe of thoſe Articles, that nothing might be left for private
fancies and innovation. For We call God to record, before whom We ſtand, that it is,
and always hath been, Our hearts deſire to be found worthy of that Title which We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
the moſt glorious in all Our Crown, <hi>Defender of the Faith:</hi> neither ſhall We ever
give way to the authorizing of any thing whereby any Innovation may ſteal or creep into
the Church, but preſerve that unity of Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the time of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ſtood and flouriſhed ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>And as We were careful to make up all breaches and rents in Religion at home; ſo
did We, by Our Proclamation and Commandment for the execution of Laws againſt
Prieſts and Popiſh Recuſants, fortifie all ways and approaches againſt that foreign Enemy:
which if it have not ſucceeded according to Our intention, We muſt lay the fault where
it is, in the ſubordinate Officers and Miniſters in the Country, by whoſe remiſsneſs Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
and Prieſts eſcape without apprehenſion, and Recuſants from thoſe convictions and
penalties which the Laws and Our Commandment would have inflicted on them. For
We do profeſs that, as it is Our duty, ſo it ſhall be our care, to command and direct well;
but it is the part of others to perform the Miniſterial Office. And when We have done
Our Office, We ſhall account Our Self, and all charitable men will accompt Us, innocent
both to God and Men: and thoſe that are negligent, We will eſteem as culpable both to
God and Us; and therefore will expect that hereafter they give Us a better accompt.</p>
                     <p>And as We have been careful for the ſetling of Religion and quieting the Church, ſo
were We not unmindful of the preſervation of the juſt and ancient Liberties of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which We ſecured to them by Our gracious Anſwer to the Petition in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having not ſince that time done any Act whereby to infringe them; but Our care
is, and hereafter ſhall be, to keep them intire and inviolable, as We would do Our own
Right and Sovereignty; having for that purpoſe enrolled the Petition and Anſwer in
Our Courts of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60710:119"/>
Next to the care of Religion and of Our Subjects Rights, We did Our beſt for the
provident and well ordering of that aid and ſupply which was granted Us the laſt Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whereof no part hath been waſtfully ſpent, nor put to any other uſe than thoſe for
which it was deſired and granted, as upon payment of Our Fleet and Army: wherein
Our care hath been ſuch, as We choſe rather to diſcontent Our deareſt Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and Our neareſt Servants, than to leave Our Souldiers and Mariners unſatisfied,
whereby any vexation or diſquiet might ariſe to Our people. We have alſo with part
of thoſe Moneys begun to ſupply Our Magazines and ſtores of Munition, and to put Our
Navy into a conſtant form and order. Our Fleet likewiſe is fitting, and almoſt in a
readineſs; whereby the Narrow Seas may be guarded, Commerce maintained, and
Our Kingdom ſecured from all forein attempts. Theſe Acts of Ours might have made
this impreſſion in all good minds, that We were careful to direct Our counſels and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Our actions ſo as might moſt conduce to the maintenance of Religion, honour of
Our Government, and ſafety of Our People. But with miſchievous men once ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<hi>Seu bene, ſeu malè facta premunt:</hi> and whatſoever once ſeemed amiſs, is ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
but good endeavours are never regarded.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe things, that were the chief complaints the laſt Seſſion, being by Our
Princely care ſo ſeriouſly reformed, the Parliament re aſſembled the twentieth of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
laſt: We expecting, according to the candor and ſincerity of Our own thoughts,
that men would have framed themſelves for the effecting a right underſtanding between
Us and Our people. But ſome few malevolent perſons, like Empiricks and lewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
did ſtrive to make new work, and to have ſome Diſeaſe on foot to keep themſelves
in requeſt, and to be imployed and entertained in the Cure. And yet, to manifeſt how
much offences have been diminiſhed, the Committees for Grievances, Committees for
Courts of Juſtice, and Committees for Trade have ſince the ſitting down of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
received few complaints; and thoſe ſuch, as they themſelves have not thought
to be of that moment or importance with which Our ears ſhould be acquainted.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner therefore was the Parliament ſet down, but theſe ill-affected men began to
ſow and diſperſe their Jealouſies, by caſting out ſome glances and doubtful ſpeeches, as
if the Subject had not been ſo clearly and well dealt with touching their Liberties, and
touching the Petition anſwered the laſt Parliament. This being a plauſible Theme,
thought on for an ill purpoſe, eaſily took hold on the minds of many that knew not the
practice: And thereupon the ſecond day of the Parliament a Committee was appointed
to ſearch, whether the Petition and Our Anſwer thereunto were enrolled in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Roll and in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in what manner the ſame was done.
And a day was then alſo appointed on which the Houſe, being reſolved into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
ſhould take into conſideration thoſe things wherein the Liberty of the Subject
had been invaded, againſt that Petition. This, though it produced no other effect of
moment or importance, yet was ſufficient to raiſe a jealouſie againſt Our Proceedings in
ſuch as were not well acquainted with the ſincerity and clearneſs of them. There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
another of no leſs skill: for although Our proceeding before the Parliament about
matters of Religion might have ſatisfied any moderate men of Our zealous care thereof
(as We are ſure it did the moſt;) yet, as bad ſtomachs turn the beſt things into their
own nature for want of good digeſtion, ſo thoſe diſtempered perſons have done the like
of Our good intents, by a bad and ſiniſter interpretation. For when they did obſerve that
many honeſt and Religious minds in that Houſe did complain of thoſe dangers that did
threaten the Church; they likewiſe took the ſame word in their mouth, and their cry
likewiſe was <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini,</hi> when the true care of the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came into their hearts: and what the one did out of zeal unto Religion, the other
took up as a plauſible Theme to deprave Our Government; as if We, Our Clergy and
Council, were either ſenſeleſs or careleſs of Religion. And this wicked practice hath
been to make Us ſeem to walk before Our people as if We halted before God.</p>
                     <p>Having by theſe Artifices made a jealous impreſſion in the hearts of many, and a day
being appointed to treat of the Grant of Tonnage and Poundage; at the time prefixed all
expreſs great willingneſs to grant it: but a new ſtrain is found out, that it could not be
done without great peril to the Right of the Subject, unleſs We ſhould diſclaim any
right therein but by Grant in Parliament; and ſhould cauſe all thoſe goods to be reſtored
which upon Commandment from Us or Our Council were ſtayed by Our Officers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
thoſe duties were payed; and conſequently ſhould put Our ſelf out of poſſeſſion of the
Tonnage and Poundage before they were granted: for elſe it was pretended the Subject
ſtood not in fit caſe to grant it. A fancy and cavil raiſed of purpoſe to trouble the buſineſs;
it being evident that all the Kings before named did receive that duty, and were in actual
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60710:119"/>
poſſeſſion of it, before, and at the very time when it was granted to them by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And although We, to remove all difficulties, did from Our own mouth, in
thoſe clear and open terms that might have ſatisfied any moderate and well-diſpoſed
minds, declare, that it was Our meaning by the gift of Our people to enjoy it, and that
We did not challenge it of right, but took it <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> ſhewing thereby not the right,
but the neceſſity by which We were to take it; wherein We deſcended for their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
ſo far beneath Our ſelf, as We are confident never any of Our Predeceſſors did
the like, nor was the like ever required or expected from them: yet for all this the Bill
of Tonnage and Poundage was laid aſide, upon pretence they muſt firſt clear the right
of the Subject therein; under colour whereof they entertain the complaints not only of
<hi>John Rolls,</hi> a member of their Houſe, but alſo of <hi>Richard Chambers, John Fowkes</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew
Gilman,</hi> againſt the Officers of Our Cuſtoms, for detaining their goods upon
refuſal to pay the ordinary duty accuſtomed to be paid for the ſame. And upon theſe
complaints they ſend for the Officers of the Cuſtoms, enforcing them to attend day after
day by the ſpace of a month together; they cauſe them to produce their Letters Patents
under Our great Seal, and the Warrants made by Our Privy Council for levying of
thoſe duties; they examine the Officers upon what queſtions they pleaſe, thereby to
entrap them for doing Our Service and Commandment. In theſe and other their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
becauſe We would not give the leaſt ſhew of interruption, We endured long
with much patience both theſe and ſundry other ſtrange and exorbitant incroachments
and uſurpations, ſuch as were never before attempted in that Houſe.</p>
                     <p>We are not ignorant how much that Houſe hath of late years endeavoured to extend
their Priviledges, by ſetting up general Committees for Religion, for Courts of Juſtice,
for Trade, and the like; a courſe never heard of until of late: ſo as where in former
times the Knights and Burgeſſes were wont to communicate to the Houſe ſuch buſineſs
as they brought from their Countries, now there are ſo many Charis erected to make
enquiry upon all ſorts of men, where complaints of all ſorts are entertained, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
diſturbance and ſcandal of Juſtice and Government; which having been tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
a while by Our Father and Our ſelf, hath daily grown to more and more height;
inſomuch as young Lawyers ſitting there take on them to decry the Opinions of the
Judges, and ſome have not doubted to maintain that the reſolutions of that Houſe muſt
bind the Judges; a thing never heard of in Ages paſt. But in this laſt Aſſembly of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
they have taken on them much more than ever before.</p>
                     <p>They ſent Meſſengers to examine Our Attorney General, who is an Officer of truſt
and ſecrecy, touching the execution of ſome Commandments of Ours; of which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Our leave firſt obtained, he was not to give account to any but to Our ſelf. They
ſent a captious and directory meſſage to the Lord Treaſurer, Chancellor, and Barons of
the Exchequer, touching ſome judicial proceedings of theirs in Our Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
                     <p>They ſent Meſſengers to examine upon ſundry queſtions Our two chief Juſtices, and
three other of Our Judges, touching their judicial proceedings at the Gaol-Delivery at
<hi>Newgate;</hi> of which they are not accomptable to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Suits were commenced in Our Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> againſt <hi>Richard
Chambers, John Fowkes, Bartholomew Gilman</hi> and <hi>Richard Philips,</hi> by Our Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for great miſdemeanors, they reſolved that they were to have Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
againſt Us for their perſons, for no other cauſe, but becauſe they had Petitions
depending in that Houſe; and (which is more ſtrange) they reſolved that a Signification
ſhould be made from that Houſe, by a Letter to iſſue under the hand of their Speaker,
unto the Lord Keeper of Our Great Seal, that no Attachments ſhould be granted out
againſt the ſaid <hi>Chambers, Fowkes, Gilman,</hi> or <hi>Philips,</hi> during their ſaid Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
whereas it is far above the power of that Houſe, to give direction to any of Our
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to ſtop Attachments againſt any man, though never ſo ſtrongly
priviledged; the breach of priviledge being not in the Court that grants, but in the party
or Miniſter that puts in execution ſuch Attachments. And therefore if any ſuch Letter
had come to the Lord Keeper, as it did not, he ſhould have highly offended Us if he had
obeyed it. Nay, they went ſo far, as they ſpared not the Honour of Our Council-board,
but examined their proceedings in the caſe of Our Cuſtomers, interrogating what this
or that man of Our Council ſaid in direction of them in the buſineſs committed to their
charge. And when one of the members of that Houſe, ſpeaking of Our Counſellers,
ſaid, We had wicked Counſel, and another ſaid, That the Council and Judges
ſought to trample under feet the Liberty of the Subject, and a third traduced Our
high Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for the ſentence given againſt <hi>Savage;</hi> they paſſed without
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60710:120"/>
check or cenſure by the Houſe. By which may appear how far the members of that
Houſe have of late ſwollen beyond the rules of moderation, and the modeſty of former
times; and this under pretence of priviledge and freedom of ſpeech, whereby they take
liberty to declare againſt all authority of Council and Courts at their pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>They ſent for Our Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> to examine him in a cauſe whereof they had no
juriſdiction; their true and ancient juriſdiction extending only to their own Members,
and to the conſervation of their Priviledges, and not to the cenſure of forein perſons
and cauſes, which have no relation to their Priviledges; the ſame being but a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.
And yet, upon an enforced ſtrain of a contempt, for not anſwering to their
ſatisfaction, they committed him to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> uſing that outward pretext
for a cauſe of their committing him; the true and inward cauſe being, for that he had
ſhewed himſelf dutiful to Us and Our Commandments in the matter concerning Our
Cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Innovations (which We will never permit again) they pretended, indeed,
Our ſervice; but their drift was to break by this means through all reſpects and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Government, and to erect an univerſal overſwaying power to themſelves,
which belongs only to Us, and not to them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in their proceedings againſt Our Cuſtomers, they went about to cenſure
them as Delinquents, and to puniſh them for ſtaying ſome goods of ſome factious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in Our Store-houſe, for not paying thoſe duties which themſelves had formerly
payed, and which the Cuſtomers without interruption had received of all other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
many years before, and to which they were authorized both by Our great Seal,
and by ſeveral directions and commandments from Us and Our Privy Council.</p>
                     <p>To give ſome colour to their proceedings herein, they went about to create a new
Priviledge, which We will never admit; That a Parliament-man hath priviledge for
his goods againſt the King: the conſequence whereof would be, that he may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to pay any duties to the King during the time of Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>It is true, they would have made this caſe to have been between the Merchant and Our
Farmers of Our Cuſtom, and have ſevered them from Our Intereſt and Commandment,
thereby the rather to make them liable to the cenſure and puniſhment of that Houſe.
But on the other ſide We, holding it both unjuſt and diſhonourable to withdraw Our
ſelf from Our Officers in any thing they did by Our Commandment, or to diſavow any
thing that We had enjoyned to be done, upon Monday, the three and twentieth day of
<hi>February,</hi> ſent a Meſſage unto them by Secretary <hi>Coke,</hi> thanking them for the reſpect
they had ſhewed in ſevering the Intereſt of Our Farmers from Our own Intereſt and
Commandment: nevertheleſs We were bound in Honour to acknowledge as truth,
that what was done by them was done by Our expreſs direction and commandment;
and if for doing thereof Our Farmers ſhould ſuffer, it would highly concern Us in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Which Meſſage was no ſooner delivered unto them, but in a tumultuous and
diſcontented manner they called, <hi>Adjourn, Adjourn;</hi> and thereupon, without any
cauſe given on Our part, in a very unuſual manner adjourned themſelves until the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday
following: on which day, by the uniform advice of Our Privy Council, We
cauſed both Houſes to be adjourned until the ſecond day of <hi>March;</hi> hoping that in the
mean time a better and more right underſtanding might be begotten between Us and
the members of that Houſe, whereby the Parliament might come to an happy iſſue.</p>
                     <p>But underſtanding by good advertiſement that their diſcontent did not in that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
and paſs away, We reſolved to make a ſecond Adjournment until the tenth of
<hi>March;</hi> which was done as well to take time to Our ſelf to think of ſome means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
thoſe difficulties, as to give them time to adviſe better: and accordingly
We gave commandment for a ſecond Adjournment in both Houſes, and for ceſſation of
all buſineſſes till the day appointed. Which was very dutifully obeyed in the Higher
Houſe, no man contradicting or queſtioning it. But when the ſame commandment
was delivered in the Houſe of Commons by their Speaker, it was ſtraightways contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted:
and although the Speaker declared unto them, it was an abſolute Right and
power in Us to adjourn, as well as to prorogue or diſſolve, and declared and read unto
them divers precedents of that Houſe to warrant the ſame, yet Our commandment was
moſt contemptuouſly diſobeyed; and ſome riſing up to ſpeak, ſaying they had buſineſs
to do before the Houſe ſhould be adjourned, the Speaker again declared Our expreſs
and peremptory command to adjourn, and that himſelf ſhould preſently leave the Houſe,
and come unto Us: which he offered to do, but was withſtood by two that had of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
placed themſelves, one on either ſide of the Speaker's Chair, and by force held him
in for a time: yet the Speaker finding means to get out of the Chair, and purpoſing to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60710:120"/>
come to Us, as We had commanded, thoſe two and divers others caught hold of
him, and by ſtrong hand brought him back, and ſet him in the Chair againſt his
will; and then a member of that Houſe caſt out a moſt ſeditious paper, framed by
himſelf and his Adherents, without any warrant from the Houſe, and containing a
proſcription of ſuch as in duty and obedience to Us ſhould adviſe or aſſiſt Us in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of Tonnage and Poundage, or ſhould pay that duty, as Enemies to the State;
and required it to be read. A moſt audacious inſolency, for any to preſume to do
that of their own heads, which if the whole Houſe had done in that manner, had
been above their power, and had deſerved the higheſt cenſure. But the Speaker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to read it, the Author of it took on him moſt ſeditiouſly and factiouſly to declare
the contents of it, and he and other his Adherents required it ſhould be put to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
Which being miſliked by many grave and wiſe men in the Houſe, and refuſed
by the Speaker (as We doubt not but all good men will believe he had cauſe, and even
abhor the memory of that inſolent and ſeditious Act) yet many bitter taunts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
were uttered againſt the Speaker by thoſe factious perſons, and the doors being
faſt locked, ſuch as were well-affected to Our ſervice were, againſt their wills, kept
in the Houſe all the time of this tumult and diſorder. And when ſome Advertiſement
came to Us that the Houſe was in great diſtemper, We firſt ſent for the Serjeant of the
Houſe; whom they, after they knew Our pleaſure therein, preſumptuouſly detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And after We ſent a Meſſage unto them by the Gentleman-uſher of the Higher
Houſe: but he coming to the door, and declaring that he had a Meſſage from Us,
was refuſed to be admitted; and being kept at the door a long time, at laſt the Houſe
adjourned themſelves without receiving Our Meſſage. A proceeding ſo irregular as
no Parliament can parallel; when Our abſolute Commands, warranted by Law and
precedents of former times, were diſobeyed, the Speaker violated, Our Meſſenger
and meſſage excluded, which ought to have been admitted if they were a Houſe; and
if they were not a Houſe, they ought not at all to have diſputed, much leſs to blaſt,
the honour of Our Servants, to proſcribe Our beſt Subjects, and give Law to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
ſtriking at the very eſſence of Monarchy. By all which it appears, that
there wanted not men in that Houſe that would get themſelves a name by ſetting <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Temple on fire, and make themſelves popular by putting all the Kingdom in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion.
For what other end could there be in that malicious ſpeech, whereby a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Shimei</hi> at that time would make Us odious in the eyes of all Our people, as if it were
meant to transfer all Trade, and give the fatneſs of the Land to Strangers? A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
(We call God to witneſs) which never entred into Our Soul, and, We think,
never harboured in any heart but that ſeditious heart which firſt broached it. For God
forbid We ſhould love any ends ſo well, as by any neceſſity to be driven to forget that
indiſſoluble bond between Us and Our people.</p>
                     <p>We could and would have expected longer, had We conceived any hope of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their duty. Whileſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> lived, He was intituled to
all the diſtempers and ill events of former Parliaments; and therefore much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
was uſed to demoliſh him, as the only wall of ſeparation between us and Our
people. But now he is dead, no alteration was found amongſt thoſe envenomed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which troubled then the bleſſed harmony between Us and Our Subjects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill to trouble it. For now, under the pretence of publick care of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
they ſuggeſt new and cauſeleſs fears, which in their own hearts they know to
be falſe; and deviſe new engines of miſchief, ſo to caſt a blindneſs upon the good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Our people, that they may not ſee the truth and largeneſs of Our heart towards
them: ſo that now it is manifeſt the Duke was not alone the mark that thoſe men ſhot
at, but was only, as a near Miniſter of Ours, taken upon the by, and in their paſſage
to their more ſecret deſigns; which only were to caſt Our Affairs into a deſperate
condition, to abate the powers of Our Crown, and to bring Our Government
into obloquy, that in the end all things may be overwhelmed with anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>We do not impute theſe diſaſters to the whole Houſe of Commons, knowing that
there were amongſt them many religious, grave, and well-minded men; but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
and better part of the Houſe being over-born by the practices and clamors of the
other, who, careleſs of their duties, and taking advantage of the Times and Our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
have forced Us to break off this meeting, which had it been anſwered with
like duty on their parts as it was invited and begun with love on Ours, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
happy and glorious both to Us and this whole Nation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:60710:121"/>
We have thus declared the manifold cauſes We had to diſſolve this Parliament:
whereby all the world may ſee how much they have forgotten their former ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at the entry into the War, themſelves being perſwaders to it, promiſing to
make us feared by Our Enemies, and eſteemed by Our Friends; and how they
turned the neceſſities grown by that War, to enforce Us to yield conditions incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible
with Monarchy. And now, that Our people may diſcern that theſe provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of evil men (whoſe puniſhment We reſerve to a due time) have not changed
Our good intentions to Our Subjects, We do here profeſs to maintain the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Doctrine eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without admitting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving
at any backſliding either to Popery or Schiſm. We do alſo declare, that We
will maintain the ancient and juſt Rights and Liberties of Our Subjects with ſo much
conſtancy and juſtice, that they ſhall have cauſe to acknowledge, that under Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and gracious protection they live in a more happy and free eſtate than
any Subjects in the Chriſtian world. Yet let no man hereby take the boldneſs to abuſe
that Liberty, turning it to licentiouſneſs, nor miſinterpret the Petition, by perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to a lawleſs liberty, wantonly or frowardly under that or any other colour to
reſiſt lawful and neceſſary Authority. For as We will maintain Our Subjects in their
juſt Liberties; ſo We do and will expect that they yield as much ſubmiſſion and duty
to Our Royal Prerogatives, and as ready obedience to Our Authority and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as hath been performed to the greateſt of Our Predeceſſors.</p>
                     <p>And for Our Miniſters, We will not that they be terrified by thoſe harſh proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that have been ſtrained againſt ſome of them. For as We will not command any
thing unjuſt or diſhonourable, but ſhall uſe Our Authority and Prerogatives for the
good of Our People; ſo We will expect that Our Miniſters obey Us, and they ſhall
aſſure themſelves We will protect them.</p>
                     <p>As for Our Merchants, We let them know, We ſhall always endeavour to cheriſh
and enlarge the trade of ſuch as be dutiful, without burthening them beyond that
which is fitting; but the duty of five in the hundred for the guarding of the Seas and
defence of the Realm (to which We hold Our ſelves ſtill obliged, and which duty
hath continued without interruption ſo many ſucceſſions of Ages,) We hold no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
or good Subject will deny it, being ſo neceſſary for the good of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And if any factious Merchant will affront Us in a thing ſo reaſonable, and
wherein We require no more nor in no other manner than ſo many of our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
have done, and have been dutifully obeyed; let them not deceive themſelves,
but be aſſured that We ſhall find Honourable and juſt means to ſupport Our
Eſtate, vindicate Our Sovereignty, and preſerve that Authority which God hath put
into Our hands.</p>
                     <p>And now, having laid down the truth and clearneſs of Our proceedings, all wiſe
and diſcreet men may eaſily judge of thoſe rumors and jealous fears that are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and wickedly bruited abroad; and may diſcern by examination of their own
hearts, whether in reſpect of the free paſſage of the Goſpel, indifferent and equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Juſtice, freedom from Oppreſſion, and the great Peace and quietneſs
which every man enjoyeth under his own vine and fig-tree, the Happineſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be parallel'd by any other of Our neighbour Countries: and if not, then to
acknowledge their own bleſſedneſs, and for the ſame be thankful to God, the Author of
all goodneſs.</p>

                        <p>TRuſty and Well-beloved, We greet you well. Taking into Our Princely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that the Honour and Safety of this Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof is only entruſted to Our care, was and is more nearly concerned in late
than former times, as well by divers counſels and attempts to take from us the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Seas, of which We are ſole Lord and rightful Owner, or Proprietor, and
the loſs whereof would be of greateſt danger and peril to this Kingdom, and other Our
Dominions, as many other ways; We, for the avoiding of theſe and the like dangers,
well weighing with Our ſelf, that where the good and ſafety of the Kingdom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in danger, there the charge and defence
ought to be born by all the Realm in general, did, for the preventing ſo publick a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
reſolve with Our ſelf to have a Royal Navy prepared, that might be of force and
power (with Almighty God's bleſſing and aſſiſtance) to protect and defend this Our
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60710:122"/>
Realm and Our Subjects therein from all ſuch perils and dangers: and for that purpoſe
We iſſued forth Writs under Our Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> directed to all Our Sheriffs of
Our ſeveral Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> commanding thereby all Our ſaid Subjects
in every City, Town and Village, to provide ſuch a number of Ships, well furniſht, as
might ſerve for this Royal purpoſe, and which might be done with the greateſt equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that could be. In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this Our Realm We have found in Our Subjects great chearfulneſs and alacrity,
which We graciouſly interpret as a teſtimony as well of their dutiful affection to Us and
Our ſervice, as of the reſpect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every
good Subject: nevertheleſs finding that ſome few, haply out of ignorance what the
Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm are, or out of a deſire to be eaſed in their particulars,
how general ſoever the charge be or ought to be, have not yet paid and contributed to
the ſeveral Rates and Aſſeſsments that were ſet upon them; and foreſeeing in Our
Princely Wiſdom, that from thence divers Suits and Actions are not unlikely to be
commenced and proſecuted in Our ſeveral Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> We, deſirous to avoid
ſuch inconveniences, and out of Our Princely love and affection to all Our People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing to prevent ſuch errors as any of Our loving Subjects may happen to run into,
have thought fit, in a caſe of this nature, to adviſe with you Our Judges, who We
doubt not are well ſtudied and informed in the Rights of Our Sovereignty: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Trials in Our ſeveral Courts by the formalities in pleading will require a long
protraction, We have thought fit by this Letter directed to you all, to require your
Judgment in the Caſe, as it is ſet down in the incloſed Paper; which will not only gain
time, but alſo be of more authority to over-rule any prejudicate opinions of others in the

                     <head>His MAJESTIE's Declaration to all His loving Subjects of the Cauſes
which moved Him to diſſolve His Fourth Parliament.</head>
                     <p>THE King's moſt Excellent Majeſty well knoweth that the Calling, Adjourning,
Proroguing and Diſſolving of Parliaments, are undoubted Prerogatives inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
annexed to His Imperial Crown, of which He is not bound to render any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
but to God alone, no more than of His other Regal actions.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs His Majeſty, whoſe Piety and Goodneſs have made Him ever ſo order
and govern all things, that the clearneſs and Candor of His Royal heart may appear
to all His Subjects, eſpecially in thoſe great and publick matters of State that have
relation to the weal and ſafety of His People, and the Honour of His Royal Perſon
and Government, hath thought fit, for avoiding and preventing all ſiniſter conſtructions
and miſinter pretations, which the Malice of ſome perſons ill-affected to His Crown and
Soveraignty hath or may practiſe to infuſe into the minds an ears of His good and
faithful Subjects, to ſet down by way of Declaration the true Cauſes as well of His
Aſſembling, as of His Diſſolving the late Parliament.</p>
                     <p>IT is not unknown to moſt of His Majeſtie's loving Subjects, what diſcouragements
He hath formerly had by the undutiful and ſeditious carriage of divers of the lower
Houſe in preceding Aſſemblies of Parliament, enough to have made Him averſe to thoſe
ancient and accuſtomed ways of calling His People together, when in ſtead of dutiful
expreſſions towards His Perſon and Government, they vented their own Malice and
diſaffections to the State, and by their ſubtle and malignant courſes endeavoured nothing
more than to bring into contempt and diſorder all Government and Magiſtracy.</p>
                     <p>Yet His Majeſty well conſidering that but few were guilty of that ſeditious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful
behaviour, and hoping that time and experience had made His loving Subjects
ſenſible of the diſtemper the whole Kingdom was in danger to be put into by the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd
actions of thoſe men, and His Majeſty being ever deſirous to tread in the ſteps
of His moſt noble Progenitors, was pleaſed to iſſue forth His Writs under the great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> for a Parliament to be holden on the thirteenth day of <hi>April</hi> laſt.</p>
                     <p>At which day His Majeſty by the Lord Keeper of His great Seal was graciouſly pleaſed
to let both Houſes of Parliament know, how deſirous He was that all His people
would unite their hearts and affections in the execution of thoſe Counſels that might
tend to the Honour of His Majeſty, the Safety of His Kingdoms, and the good and
preſervation of all His people; and withal how confident He was that they would not
be failing in their duties and affections to Him and to the publick.</p>
                     <p>He laid open to them the manifeſt and apparent miſchiefs threatned to this and all
His other Kingdoms by the mutinous and rebellious behaviour of divers of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
nation, who had by their examples drawn many of His Subjects there into a courſe of
diſloyalty and diſobedience, not fit for His Majeſty in Honour, Safety, or Wiſdom to
endure.</p>
                     <p>How, to ſtrengthen themſelves in their diſloyal courſes, they had addreſt themſelves
to forein States, and treated with them to deliver themſelves up to their protection and
defence, as was made apparent under the proper hands of the prime Ring-leaders of that
Rebellious Faction.</p>
                     <p>Theſe courſes of theirs, tending ſo much to the ruine and overthrow of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Monarchy, united by the deſcent of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and his Father of bleſſed Memory, His Majeſty (in His great Wiſdom, and in
diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in Him by God, and by the Fundamental Laws of both
Kingdoms, for the protection and government of them) reſolved to ſuppreſs, and
thereby to vindicate that Sovereign power entruſted to Him. He had by the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
trial found that his Grace and Goodneſs was abuſed, and that, contrary to his
expectation and their faithful promiſes, they had, ſince his being at <hi>Berwick</hi> and the
Pacification there made, purſued their former rebellious deſigns; and therefore it was
neceſſary now for his Majeſty by power to reduce them to the juſt and modeſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Obedience and ſubjection, which whenever they ſhould be brought unto,
or ſeeing their own Errors ſhould put themſelves into a way of Humility and
Obedience becoming them, his Majeſty ſhould need no other Mediatours for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60710:123"/>
Clemency and Mercy to them than his own Piety and Goodneſs, and the tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he hath ever born to that his native Countrey.</p>
                     <p>This being of ſo great weight and conſequence to the whole Kingdo, and the charge
of an Army, fit to maſter ſuch a buſineſs, amounting to ſo great a ſum as his Majeſty
had no means to raiſe, having not only emptied his own coffers, but iſſued between three
and four hundred thouſand pounds, which he borrowed of his ſervants upon ſecurity
out of his own eſtate, to provide ſuch things as were neceſſary to begin ſuch an action
with; his Majeſty, after the example of his Predeceſſors, reſorted to his People in
their repreſentative Body the Parliament, whom he deſired (with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Grace and Goodneſs which could poſſibly come from him) that taking
into ſerious and dutiful conſideration the nature of theſe bleeding evils, and how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it was to loſe the leaſt minute of time, leſt thereby thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould
gain opportunity to frame their parties with forein States, that they would for a while
lay aſide all other debates, and paſs an Act for the ſpeedy payment of ſo many Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
as might enable his Majeſty to put in readineſs for this Summer thoſe things which
were to be prepared before ſo great an Army could be brought into the field.</p>
                     <p>For further ſupply neceſſary for ſo great an undertaking, his Majeſty declared that
He expected it not till there might be a happy concluſion of that Seſſion, and till their
juſt Grievances might be firſt graciouſly heard and relieved.</p>
                     <p>Wherein as His Majeſty would moſt willingly have given them the precedence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
matter of Supply, if the great neceſſity of his occaſions could have permitted; ſo
he was graciouſly pleaſed, for their full aſſurance and ſatisfaction therein to give them
His Royal word, That without determining the Seſſion upon granting of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies,
He would give them before they parted as much time as the ſeaſon of the year
and the great affairs in hand would permit, for conſidering all ſuch Petitions as they
ſhould conceive to be good for the Commonwealth; and what they could not now
finiſh, they ſhould have full time to perfect towards Winter: His Majeſty graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
aſſuring them, that He would go along with them for their advantage through
all the expreſſions of a gracious and pious King, to the end there might be ſuch a happy
concluſion of that as might be the cauſe of many more meetings with them in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>From their firſt aſſembling until the 21 of <hi>April,</hi> the Houſe of Commons did nothing
that could give His Majeſty any content or confidence in their ſpeedy ſupplying of
Him: whereupon He commanded both the Houſes to attend Him in the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Houſe at <hi>White-Hall</hi> in the afternoon of that 21 day of <hi>April.</hi> Where by the
Lord Keeper His Majeſty put them in mind of the end for which they were aſſembled,
which was for His Majeſtie's Supply; that if it were not ſpeedy, it would be of no
uſe unto Him, part of the Army then marching at the charge of above a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds a month, which would all be loſt if His Majeſty were not preſently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
ſo as it was not poſſible to be longer forborn. Yet His Majeſtie then expreſt,
that the Supply He for the preſent deſired was only to enable Him to go on with His
deſigns for three or four months, and that He expected no further Supply till all their
juſt Grievances were relieved.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe His Majeſty had taken notice of ſome miſapprehenſions about the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Shipping-money, His Majeſty commanded the Lord Keeper to let them
know, That He never had any intention to make any Revenue of it, nor had ever
made any; but that all the money collected had been paid to the Treaſurer of the Navy,
and by Him expended, beſides great ſums of money every year out of His Majeſtie's
own purſe.</p>
                     <p>That His Majeſty had once reſolved this year to have levied none; but that He was
forced to alter His reſolution, in regard He was of neceſſity to ſend an Army for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> during which time it was requiſite the Seas ſhould be well
guarded: And beſides, His Majeſty had knowledge of the great Fleets prepared by all
neighbouring Princes this year, and of the inſolencies committed by thoſe of <hi>Algiers,</hi>
with the ſtore of Ships which they had in readineſs.</p>
                     <p>And therefore though His Majeſty for this preſent year could not forbear it, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
their concurrence in the levying of it; yet for the future to give all His Subjects aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
how juſt and Royal His intentions were, and that all His aim was but to live like
their King, able to defend Himſelf and them, to be uſeful to His friends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to His enemies, to maintain the Soveraignty of the Seas, and ſo make the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
flouriſh in trade and commerce, He was graciouſly pleaſed to let them know that the
ordinary Revenue now taken by the Crown could not ſerve the turn, and therefore that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60710:123"/>
it muſt be by Shipping-money or ſome other way, wherein He was willing to leave it
to their conſiderations what better courſe to find out, and to ſettle it how they would,
ſo the thing were done, which ſo much imported the honour and ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and His Majeſty for His part would moſt readily and chearfully grant any thing
they could deſire for ſecuring them in the propriety of their Goods and Eſtates, and in
the Liberty of their Perſons.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty telling them it was in their power to make this as happy a Parliament as
ever was, and to be the cauſe of the King's delighting to meet with His people, and
His People with Him.</p>
                     <p>That there was no ſuch way to effect this as by putting obligations of truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
upon Him: which as it was the way of good manners with a King, ſo it was
a ſurer and ſafer courſe for themſelves than any that their own jealouſies and fears could
invent; His Majeſty being a Prince that deſerved their truſt, and would not loſe the
honour of it, and a Prince of ſuch a gracious nature that diſdained His People ſhould
overcome Him by kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>He had made this good to ſome other Subjects of His; and if they followed His
counſel, they ſhould be ſure not to repent it, being the people that were neareſt and
deareſt to Him, and Subjects whom He did and had reaſon to value more than the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of any His other Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having thus graciouſly expreſſed Himſelf unto them, He expected the
Houſe of Commons would have the next day taken into conſideration the matter of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and laid aſide all other debates till that were reſolved of according to His deſire.</p>
                     <p>But in ſtead of giving an Anſwer therein, ſuch as the preſſing and urgent occaſions
required, they fell into diſcourſes and debates about their pretended Grievances and raiſed
up ſo many, and of ſo ſeveral natures, that in a Parliamentary way they could not but
ſpend more time than His Majeſtie's great and weighty Affairs could poſſibly afford.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty foreſeeing in His great Wiſdom that they were not in the way to make
this an happy Parliament, which He ſo much deſired and hoped; that nothing might
be wanting on His part to bring them into the right way for His Honour, the ſafety
of the Kingdom, and their own good, He reſolved to deſire the aſſiſtance of the
Lords of the higher Houſe, as perſons in rank and degree neareſt to the Royal Throne,
and who having received Honour from Him and His Royal Progenitors, He doubted
not would for thoſe and many other reaſons be moved in honour and dutiful affection
to His Perſon and Crown, to diſpoſe the Houſe of Commons to expreſs their duties
to His Majeſty, in expediting the matter of Supply, for which they were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and which required ſo preſent a diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe, His Majeſty in His Royal Perſon came again to the Lords Houſe
on Wedneſday the 24. day of <hi>April,</hi> where Himſelf declared to the Lords the cauſe
of His coming, which was, to put them in mind of what had been by the Lord
Keeper in His name delivered unto both Houſes the firſt day of the Parliament, and
after at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> how contrary to His expectation the Houſe of Commons, having
held conſultation of matter of Religion, Property of Goods, and Liberty of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and voted ſome things concerning thoſe three heads, had thereby given them
the precedence before the matter of His Supply; that His neceſſities were ſuch they
could not bear delay; that whatever He had by the Lord Keeper promiſed He would
perform, if the Houſe of Commons would truſt Him. For Religion, that His Heart
and Conſcience went together with the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and He would give order to His Archbiſhops and Biſhops, that no Innovation
in matter of Religion ſhould creep in. For the Ship-money, that He never made or
intended to make any profit to Himſelf of it, but only to preſerve the Dominion of the
Seas, which was ſo neceſſary, that without it the Kingdom could not ſubſiſt; but for
the way and means, by Ship-money or otherwiſe, He left it to them. For Property of
Goods and Liberty of Parliament, He ever intended His People ſhould enjoy them,
holding no King ſo great as He that was King of a rich and free people; and if they
had not Property of Goods and Liberty of Perſons, they could be neither rich nor
free. That if the Houſe of Commons would not firſt truſt Him, all His affairs would
be diſordered, and His buſineſs loſt. That though they truſted Him in part at firſt, yet
before the Parliament ended He muſt totally truſt them, and in concluſion they
muſt for execution of all things wholly truſt Him. Therefore ſince the matter was
no more than who ſhould be firſt truſted, and that the truſt of Him firſt was but a
truſt in part, His Majeſty deſired the Lords to take into their conſiderations His and
their own Honour, the Safety and welfare of this Kingdom, with the great danger it was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60710:124"/>
in, and that they would by their advice diſpoſe the Houſe of Commons to give His
Supply the precedence before the Grievances.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being departed, the Lords took into ſerious conſideration what His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had commended to their care; and forthwith laying aſide all other debates
(ſuch was their Lordſhips dutiful and affectionate carriage) they remembring well what
had been formerly declared in His Majeſtie's name to both Houſes, His Majeſtie's
gracious promiſes and expreſſions then and at this time, with the preſſing and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occaſions which ſo much imported the Honour of His Majeſty and the good of
this Kingdom, their Lordſhip's delivered their votes in theſe words, <hi>We are of opinion
that the matter of His Majeſtie's Supply ſhould have precedence, and be reſolved of before any
other matter whatſoever; and we think fit there ſhall be a Conference deſired with the Houſe of
Commons to diſpoſe them thereunto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Accordingly the next day, being Saturday the 25. day of <hi>April,</hi> a Conference was
had in the Painted Chamber by a Committee of both Houſes, where the Lord Keeper,
by the Lords command, told the Houſe of Commons of His Majeſtie's being the day
before in perſon in the higher Houſe, how graciouſly he had expreſſed Himſelf in
matter of Religion, Property of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament, and that He
would therein graciouſly hear and relieve them, and give them what in reaſon could be
deſired, with the effect of what elſe had been graciouſly delivered unto them by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as well touching His conſtant Zeal and affection to the Religion eſtabliſhed in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as touching the Ship-money, and the neceſſity of His affairs, which
was ſuch, that delay was as prejudicial as denial, and that if time were loſt, both Houſes
could not recover it: and therefore their Lordſhip's, though they would move no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor give any advice concerning Subſidies, but decline it, as that which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
was to begin with the Houſe of Commons; yet being alike intereſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Honour and Safety of the Kingdom, they held it fit to let them know
their opinions and deſires, which was, That they ſhould go firſt on with the matter of
his Majeſtie's Supply, as that which was moſt neceſſary and fit to have precedence;
and that being done, they would chearfully joyn with them in the preſenting of their
Grievances.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Commons having heard their Lordſhips opinion and deſire, in ſtead
of concurring with their Lordſhips in preferring the conſideration of his Majeſtie's
Supply before their Grievances, they ſpent the whole day on Monday following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 27 of <hi>April,</hi> in taking cauſleſs exceptions to what had been at the Conference
related to them: and the next day, being Tueſday the 28. of <hi>April,</hi> they deſired a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with the Lords: and their Lordſhips meeting them preſently in the Painted
Chamber, they were ſo far from their expreſſing of any willingneſs to joyn with their
Lordſhips in what had been upon ſo weighty reaſons recommended unto them, that on
the contrary they challenged the Lords for invading the Privileges of the Houſe of
Commons; alledging, That the Lords having in the former Conference acknowledged
that the matter of Subſidie and Supply ought to begin in the Houſe of Commons, had
in their voting that it was fit and moſt neceſſary that matter of Supply ſhould have
precedence before all other buſineſs, not only been tranſported beyond the bounds
which their Lordſhips had formerly ſet to themſelves, but by medling with matter of
Supply had, as far as in them lay, concluded both the matter and order of proceeding,
which the Houſe of Commons took to be a breach of their Privilege, and for it deſired
reparation of their Lordſhips.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Lords had in the firſt Conference enumerated thoſe three particulars,
of Religion, Propriety of Goods, and Privilege of Parliament, the Houſe of Commons
collected they had taken notice of ſome proceedings in their Houſe concerning thoſe
particulars, and thereby broken another great Privilege of the Houſe of Commons
eſtabliſhed in Parliament, and called the Indempnity of the Commons.</p>
                     <p>This, how ſtrange and unexpected ſoever, the Lords heard with patience; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to remove all impediments, and clear any miſtakings that might retard or
avert the reſolutions of ſupplying his Majeſty, they ſeriouſly debated in the higher
Houſe what had been objected by the Houſe of Commons, and reſolved, firſt, <hi>That their
Lordſhips former voting, That in their opinions His Majeſtie's Supply ſhould have precedence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other matters, was no breach of the Privileges of the Houſe of Commons;</hi> and ſecondly,
<hi>That it was no breach of the Privileges of the Houſe of Commons for their Lordſhips to hear what
His Majeſty declared to them, and thereupon to report the ſame to the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to the end the Houſe of Commons might have a right underſtanding of their
Lordſhips proceedings, their Lordſhips deſired another Conference with them, which
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60710:124"/>
was accordingly had on Friday the firſt of <hi>May</hi> in the Painted Chamber; where, by
the Command of the Lords, the Lord Keeper declared to the Houſe of Commons, That
the Lords of the higher Houſe had, as in duty and affection to his Majeſtie's Crown and
Government they were bound, taken into ſerious conſideration the great and weighty
motives of his Majeſtie's calling this Parliament, the great evils and calamities that
hung over their heads, and the apparent danger the Kingdom was like to run into,
if by ſpeedy and fitting ſupply his Majeſty were not enabled to prevent it; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
delay and protraction was, and how impoſſible for both Houſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the loſs of time in a matter of ſo preſſing and urgent neceſſity; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had both in the higher Houſe and in the banqueting houſe at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his gracious and Princely deſire to do all that from a juſt and gracious King might
be expected, whereby this Parliament might have a happy concluſion; how his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had promiſed all their juſt Grievances ſhould be graciouſly heard and relieved,
that their Lordſhips were witneſſes His Majeſty had given His Royal word herein,
which their Lordſhips for their parts did as much truſt and confide in as ever Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
did.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo then further declared unto them, That His Majeſty had lately honoured
their Houſe with His preſence again, and had there renewed the remembrance of what
had before been delivered to both Houſes, with the impoſſibility of admitting delay,
and the clearneſs of His Majeſtie's intentions and reſolutions, to give all juſt ſatisfaction
to what with reaſon could be deſired of Him.</p>
                     <p>That His Majeſty had taken notice of ſomewhat voted in the Houſe of Commons
concerning Religion, Propriety of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament, by which His
Majeſty conceived the matter of His Supply ſet aſide, which He had ſo often and with
ſuch weight of reaſon deſired might have precedence.</p>
                     <p>That His Majeſty after very gracious aſſurances of His conſtant affection and zeal
for true Religion, and for preventing all Innovations therein, relterating His often
promiſes for relieving all their juſt Grievances, with His Royal intentions in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of Ship-money which he found much ſtood upon, was pleaſed to deſire
their Lordſhips (as perſons in rank and degree neareſt Him, in Honour as much or
more concern'd than others, and in the ſafety and proſperity of the Kingdom at leaſt
equally intereſſed with others) that in a caſe of this great and important weight,
their Lordſhips would by their counſel and perſwaſion encline the Houſe of Commons
to give His Majeſty a ſpeedy anſwer and reſolution in the matter of Supply. That their
Lordſhips had taken His Majeſtie's deſire into ſerious and dutiful conſideration, and
upon great and ſolemn debate had only voted in theſe words, <hi>We are of opinion that the
matter of His Majeſtie's Supply ſhould have precedence, and be reſolved of before any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whatſoever;</hi> and <hi>that they did think fit there ſhould be a Conference d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſired with the Houſe of
Commons to diſpoſe them thereunto:</hi> which as it was juſt and honourable for their Lordſhips
to do, ſo it was no breach of any Privilege of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>For though their Lordſhips did admit, that the Bill of Subſidies ought to begin in the
Houſe of Commons, and when it is agreed unto by the Lords, muſt be returned back,
and be by their Speaker preſented, and therefore their Lordſhips diſclaimed to meddle
with Subſidy or Supply by ſuch beginning in the higher Houſe, or by naming the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Subſidies, times of payment, or any ſuch circumſtances incident to a Bill: yet
their Lordſhips might confer and talk about Supplies in general, and give their advice
therein, that being no whit derogatory to the Privileges of the Houſe of Commons,
their Lordſhips in all reaſon being likelier to communicate in the Counſels and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of State, as thoſe that were nearer to the Royal Throne, and having juſt cauſe
therein to impart their fears and foreſight of dangers to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>That ſuch proceedings of their Lordſhips, as they were grounded upon juſt and
weighty reaſon, ſo they were agreeable to ancient uſage and cuſtom, and were fully
juſtified by that eſtabliſhment in Parliament mentioned by the Houſe of Commons at
the laſt Conference, being made at <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and
ſtyled, not The Indempnity of the Commons (as had been ſaid) but The Indempnity
of Lords and Commons.</p>
                     <p>And for the other breach of Privilege which had been objected, their Lordſhips de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That His Majeſty had told them the Houſe of Commons had reſolved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning thoſe three heads, of Religion, Propriety of Goods, and Privilege of
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>How His Majeſty knew of this reſolution, belonged not to their Lordſhips to enquire
into, their Lordſhips not medling with any thing that others ſaid to the King, but what
the King ſaid to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:60710:125"/>
And that their Lordſhips were ſo far from holding it any violation of the Privileges
of the Houſe of Commons for their Lordſhips to hear what the King declared to them,
and for them thereupon to report the ſame to the Houſe of Commons, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in duty to His Majeſty their Lordſhips could do no other; and the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it was an argument of affection and deſire of good correſpondence with the Houſe
of Commons, and merited no ſuch miſconſtruction as had been made of it: neither did
that eſtabliſhment in Parliament 9 H. 4. contain any words that could be conſtrued to
make their Lordſhips proceedings in this behalf any breach of the Privileges of the
Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>Their Lordſhips proceedings and intentions being thus cleared, the Lord Keeper by
their Lordſhips command added further, That their Lordſhips could not but return
to their firſt grounds and reſolutions, which were in all fair and affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to ſtir up in thoſe of the Houſe of Commons the juſt conſideration of thoſe great
and imminent Dangers that threatned the Kingdom at this time, and how dangerous
and irrecoverable delay was, and withal to diſpoſe them to take into their firſt and
beſt thoughts the matter of His Majeſtie's Supply, and give Him a ſpeedy anſwer
therein.</p>
                     <p>Which their Lordſhips were confident would be the means to make this a happy
Parliament, and to avert the publick Calamities that menaced the ruine and overthrow
of this famous Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>This having been delivered at that Conference in their Lordſhips names, was by His
Majeſty moſt gratiouſly interpreted as the noble teſtimony of their Lordſhips affections
to His Perſon and Government; for which His Majeſty by the Lord Keeper the
next day gave their Lordſhips hearty thanks.</p>
                     <p>And withal, that nothing on His part might be left undone, His Majeſty that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo, being Saturday the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons,
which was delivered to them in theſe words;</p>
                     <p>That His Majeſty hath divers times and by ſundry ways acquainted this Houſe with the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
neceſſity of Supply, and with the great danger inevitably to fall upon the whole State, upon
His own Honour, and the Honour of this Nation, if more time ſhall be loſt therein. That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
His Majeſty hither to hath received no anſwer at all. And therefore conſidering that
as heretofore His Majeſty hath told this Houſe, that a delay of His Supply is as deſtructive as a
denial, His Majeſty doth again deſire them to give Him a preſent anſwer concerning His Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
His Majeſty being ſtill reſolved on His part to make good whatſoever He hath promiſed
by Himſelf or the Lord Keeper.</p>
                     <p>After which Meſſage delivered unto them, they ſpent from nine in the morning till
ſix a clock at night in many diſcourſes and debates touching their pretended Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but never came to any reſolution what Supply they would give His Majeſty, or
whether they would give Him any at all, but adjourned the farther debate till Monday
following.</p>
                     <p>At which time, becauſe His Majeſty had underſtood the matter of Shipping-money
was that which was moſt inſiſted upon, and that the taking away of that not only for
the preſent but for the future would be pleaſing and acceptable unto them, His Majeſty
ſent another Meſſage unto them, which was before they entred into any debate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
unto them in theſe words;</p>
                     <p>Whereas upon Saturday laſt His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſend a Meſſage to this Houſe, deſiring
you to give a preſent anſwer concerning His Supply, to which as yet His Majeſty hath had no other
anſwer, but that upon this day you will take it into further conſideration; therefore His Majeſty,
the better to facilitate your reſolutions this day, hath thought fit to let you know, That of His
grace and favour He is pleaſed, upon your granting of twelve Subſidies to be preſently paſſed,
and to be paid in three years, with a Proviſo that it ſhall not determine the Seſſion, His Majeſty
will not only for the preſent forbear the levying of any Shipping-money, but will give way to the
utter aboliſhing of it by any courſe that your ſelves ſhall like beſt. And for your Grievances,
His Majeſty will, according to His Royal Promiſe, give you as much time as may be now, and
the reſt at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next. And His Majeſty expects a preſent and poſitive anſwer upon
which He may rely, His affairs being in ſuch condition as can endure no longer delay.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this gracious Meſſage, and all other His Majeſtie's former Deſires
and Promiſes, and the Lords earneſt perſwaſions, the Houſe of Commons ſpent eight
or nine hours more in debating the matter of Supply, without coming to any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all; and ſo mixed the conſideration of that with other matters impertinent,
and trenching highly to the diminution of His Majeſtie's Royal Prerogative, that His
Majeſty plainly diſcerned they went about to weary and tire Him with delays: And
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60710:125"/>
though in words ſome did not deny to ſupply Him, yet in that alſo moſt moved to
clog the Bill of Subſidies in ſuch ſort, that His Majeſty could not have accepted it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great prejudice to His Prerogative; and they were ſo far from declaring what they
would do, that they entertained themſelves with diſcourſes tending to render odious to
His people that gracious Government of His, under which all his People have during
his happy Reign lived in ſuch Peace and Felicity, when all the neighbouring Kingdoms
and States were in Troubles and Combuſtions.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty was hereupon enforced by the advice of his Privy Council to reſolve to
break up and diſſolve the Parliament, from which he could hope for no other fruit than
the hindring of his great Affairs, and diſordering his happy Government.</p>
                     <p>And therefore on Tueſday the fifth of <hi>May</hi> his Majeſty came again in perſon to the
Lords Houſe, and ſending for the Speaker and the Houſe of Commons, when they
were come up, ſaid thus;</p>
                     <sp>
                        <p>My LORDS,</p>
                        <p>THere can no occaſion of My coming to this Houſe be ſo unpleaſing to Me as this is at this
time. The fear of doing that which I am to do this day made Me not long ago come to this
Houſe, where I expreſſed as well My Fears, as the Remedies I thought neceſſary for the eſchewing
of it: Vnto which I muſt confeſs and acknowledge that you (My Lords of the Higher Houſe)
did give Me ſo willing an ear, and with ſuch affection did ſhew your ſelves thereafter, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
I may ſay, if there had been any means to have given an happy end to this Parliament,
you took it; ſo that it was neither your Lordſhips fault, nor Mine, that it is not ſo. Therefore
in the firſt place, I muſt give your Lordſhips thanks for your good Endeavours.</p>
                        <p>I hope you remember what My Lord Keeper ſaid to you the firſt day of the Parliament in My
Name; what likewiſe he ſaid in the Banqueting-Houſe in <hi>White Hall,</hi> and what I lately ſaid
to you in this place My ſelf. I name all this unto you, not in doubt that you do not well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it, but to ſhew you, that I never ſaid any thing in way of favour to My people, but that by
the grace of God I will punctually and really perform it.</p>
                        <p>I know that they have inſiſted very much on Grievances, and I will not ſay but that there may
be ſome, (though I will confidently affirm, that there are not by many degrees ſo many as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
voice doth make them.) Wherefore I deſire you to take notice, now eſpecially at this time, that
out of Parliament I ſhall be as ready (if not more willing) to hear and redreſs any juſt Grievances,
as in Parliament. There is one thing that is much ſpoken of, though not ſo much inſiſted on as
others, and that is Religion; concerning which, albeit I expreſſed My ſelf fully the laſt day in
this place to your Lordſhips, yet I think it fit again, on this occaſion, to tell you, that (as I am
moſt concerned, ſo) I ſhall be moſt careful to preſerve that purity of Religion which, I thank God,
is ſo well eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that as well out of as in Parliament.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, I ſhall not trouble you long with words, it being not My faſhion: wherefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
what I offered the laſt day to the Houſe of Commons, I think is well known to you all, as
likewiſe how they accepted it; which I deſire not to remember, but wiſh that they had remembred
how at firſt they were told in My Name by my Lord Keeper, That delay was the worſt kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.
Yet I will not lay this fault on the whole Houſe (for I will not judge ſo uncharitably of
thoſe whom, for the moſt part, I take to be Loyal and well-affected Subjects) but that it hath
been the malicious cunning of ſome few ſeditiouſly-affected men that hath been the cauſe of this
Miſunderſtanding.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now end as I began, in giving your Lordſhips thanks for your affection ſhewn to Me at
this time; deſiring you to go on to aſſiſt me in the maintaining of that Regal power that is truly
Mine: and as for the Liberty of the People, that they now ſo much ſeem to ſtartle at, know,
(My Lords) that no King in the world ſhall be more careful to maintain them in the Property
of their Goods, Liberty of their Perſons, and true Religion, than I ſhall be.</p>
                        <p>And now, My Lord Keeper, do what I have commanded you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Then the Lord Keeper added,</p>
                     <sp>
                        <p>My Lords, and you Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, The King's Majeſty doth diſſolve
this Parliament.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>BY all the proceedings herein declared, it is evident to all men how willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
his Majeſty hath been to make uſe of the ancient and noble way of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
uſed and inſtituted by his Royal Predeceſſors, for the preſervation and honour
of this famous Monarchy; and that on his Majeſtie's part nothing was wanting that
could be expected from a King, whereby this Parliament might have had an happy
concluſion, for the comfort and content of all his Majeſties Subjects, and for the good
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60710:126"/>
and ſafety of this Kingdom. On the contrary, it is apparent how thoſe of the Houſe
of Commons (whoſe ſiniſter and malitious courſes enforced his Majeſty to diſſolve this
Parliament) have vitiated and abuſed that ancient and noble way of Parliament, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the ſame to their own unworthy ends, and forgetting the true uſe and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Parliaments. For whereas theſe meetings and aſſemblies of his Majeſty with
the Peers and Commons of this Realm were in their firſt original, and in the practice
of all ſucceeding ages, ordained and held as pledges and teſtimonies of Affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and his People, the King for his part graciouſly hearing and redreſſing
ſuch Grievances as his People in humble and dutiful manner ſhould repreſent unto
Him, and the Subjects on their part, as Teſtimonies of their Duty, ſupplying His
Majeſty upon all extraordinary occaſions, for the ſupport of his Honour and Soveraignty,
and for preſerving the Kingdom in glory and ſafety; thoſe ill-affected Members of the
Houſe of Commons, inſtead of an humble and dutiful way of preſenting their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
to his Majeſty, have taken upon them to be the Guiders and Directors in all
matters that concern his Majeſtie's Government, both Temporal and Eccleſiaſtical,
and (as if Kings were bound to give an account of their Regal Actions and of their
manner of Government to their Subjects aſſembled in Parliament) they have in a very
audacious and inſolent way entred into examination and cenſuring of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
traduced his Majeſtie's adminiſtration of Juſtice, rendred (as much as in
them lay) odious to the reſt of his Majeſtie's Subjects not only the Officers and Miniſters
of State, but even his Majeſtie's very Government; which hath been ſo juſt and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that never did this or any other Nation enjoy more Bleſſings and Happineſs than
hath been by all his Majeſtie's Subjects enjoyed ever ſince his Majeſtie's acceſs to the
Crown, nor did this Kingdom ever ſo flouriſh in Trade and Commerce as at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or partake of more Peace and Plenty in all kinds whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the ordinary Revenues of the Crown not ſufficing to defray extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
charges, it hath ever been the uſage in all Parliaments to aid and aſſiſt the Kings
of this Realm with free and fitting ſupply towards the maintenance of their Wars, and
for making good their Royal undertakings, whereby the Kingdom intruſted to their
protection might be held up in ſplendor and greatneſs; thoſe ill-affected perſons of the
Houſe of Commons have been ſo far from treading in the ſteps of their Anceſtors by
their dutiful expreſſions in this kind, that contrarily they have introduced a way of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
and contracting with the King, as if nothing ought to be given Him by them
but what He ſhould buy and purchaſe of them, either by quitting ſomewhat of His
Royal Prerogative, or by diminiſhing and leſſening His Revenues. Which courſes of
theirs how repugnant they are to the duty of Subjects, how unfit for His Majeſty in
Honour to permit and ſuffer, and what hazard and diſhonour they ſubject this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to, all men may eaſily judge that will but equally and impartially weigh them.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty hath been by this means reduced to ſuch ſtreights and extremities, that
were not His care of the Publick good and ſafety the greater, theſe men (as much as
in them lies) would quickly bring ruine and confuſion to the State, and render con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
this glorious Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>But this frowardneſs and undutiful behaviour of theirs cannot leſſen His Majeſtie's
care of preſerving the Kingdoms intruſted to His Protection and Government, nor
His gracious and tender affection to His people; for whoſe good and comfort His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by God's gracious aſſiſtance will ſo provide, that all His loving Subjects may
ſtill enjoy the happineſs of living under the bleſſed ſhade and protection of His Royal
Scepter.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, to the end all His Majeſtie's loving Subjects may know how
graciouſly His Majeſty is enclined to hear and redreſs all the juſt Grievances of His
People, as well out of Parliament as in Parliament, His Majeſty doth hereby further
declare His Royal will and pleaſure, that all His loving Subjects, who have any juſt
cauſe to preſent or complain of any Grievances or Oppreſſions, may freely addreſs
themſelves by their humble Petitions to His Sacred Majeſty, who will graciouſly hear
their complaints, and give ſuch fitting redreſs therein, that all His people ſhall have
juſt cauſe to acknowledge His Grace and Goodneſs towards them, and to be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that no perſons or aſſemblies can more prevail with His Majeſty than the Piety
and Juſtice of His own Royal nature, and the tender affection He doth and ſhall ever
bear to all His people and loving Subjects.</p>

                     <p>YOUR Majeſties moſt humble and faithful Subjects, the Commoners in this
preſent Parliament aſſembled, do with much thankfulneſs and joy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the great mercy and favour of God, in giving Your Majeſty a ſafe
and peaceable return out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into Your Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>
where the preſſing Dangers and Diſtempers of the State have cauſed us
with much earneſtneſs to deſire the comfort of Your gracious preſence, and likewiſe the
Unity and Juſtice of your Royal Authority to give more life and power to the dutiful and
loyal Counſels and Endeavours of Your Parliament, for the prevention of that immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Ruine and Deſtruction wherein Your Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are
threatned. The duty which we owe to Your Majeſty and our Country cannot but
make us very ſenſible and apprehenſive, that the multiplicity, ſharpneſs and malignity
of thoſe evils under which we have now many years ſuffered, are fomented and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a corrupt and ill-affected party, who amongſt other their miſchievous devices for the
alteration of Religion and Government, have ſought by many falſe ſcandals and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
cunningly inſinuated, and diſperſed among the People, to blemiſh and diſgrace
our proceedings in this Parliament, and to get themſelves a party and faction amongſt
Your Subjects, for the better ſtrengthening of themſelves in their wicked courſes, and
hindering thoſe proviſions and remedies which might by the Wiſdom of Your Majeſty
and Counſel of Your Parliament be oppoſed againſt them.</p>
                     <p>For preventing whereof, and the better information of Your Majeſty, Your Peers, and
all other Your loyal Subjects, we have been neceſſitated to make a Declaration of the
ſtate of the Kingdom, both before and ſince the Aſſembly of this Parliament unto this
time; which we do humbly preſent to Your Majeſty without the leaſt intention to lay
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60710:129"/>
any blemiſh upon Your Royal Perſon, but only to repreſent how Your Royal Authority
and truſt have been abuſed, to the great prejudice and danger of Your Majeſty and of all
Your good Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe we have reaſon to believe that thoſe malignant parties, whoſe proceedings
evidently appear to be mainly for the advantage and increaſe of Popery, are compoſed,
ſet up, and acted by the ſubtile practice of the Jeſuites and other Engineers and Factors
for <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the great danger of this Kingdom, and moſt grievous affliction of Your
loyal Subjects, have ſo far prevailed, as to corrupt divers of Your Biſhops, and others in
prime places of the Church, and alſo to bring divers of theſe Inſtruments to be of Your
Privy Council and other employments of truſt and nearneſs about your Majeſty, the
Prince and the reſt of Your Royal Children;</p>
                     <p>And by this means have had ſuch an operation in Your Council, and the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
affairs and proceedings of Your Government, that a moſt dangerous diviſion and
chargeable preparation for War betwixt your Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Jealouſies betwixt Your Majeſty and Your moſt obedient Subjects, the violent
diſtraction and interruption of this Parliament, the Inſurrection of the Papiſts in Your
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bloody Maſſacre of Your People, have been not only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and attempted, but in a great meaſure compaſſed and effected:</p>
                     <p>For preventing the final accompliſhment hereof, Your poor Subjects are enforced to
ingage their Perſons and Eſtates to the maintaining of a very expenceful and dangerous
War, notwithſtanding they have already, ſince the beginning of this Parliament under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
the charge of 150000. pounds ſterling, or thereabouts, for the neceſſary ſupport
and ſupply of Your Majeſty in theſe preſent and perillous Deſigns. And becauſe all our
moſt faithful endeavours and engagements will be ineffectual for the peace, ſafety, and
preſervation of Your Majeſty and Your People, if ſome preſent, real, and effectual
courſe be not taken for ſuppreſſing this wicked and malignant party, We Your moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and obedient Subjects do with all faithfulneſs and humility beſeech Your Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>1. That You will be graciouſly pleaſed to concurre with the humble deſires of Your
People in a Parliamentary way, for the preſerving the peace and ſafety of the Kingdom
from the malicious deſigns of the Popiſh party.</p>
                     <p>For depriving the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament, and abridging their immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
power uſurped over the Clergy and other Your good Subjects, which they have
moſt perniciouſly abuſed to the hazard of Religion, and great prejudice and oppreſſion of
the Laws of the Kingdom, and juſt Liberty of Your People.</p>
                     <p>For the taking away ſuch oppreſſions in Religion, Church-Government and Diſcipline,
as have been brought in and fomented by them.</p>
                     <p>For uniting all ſuch Your loyal Subjects together, as joyn in the ſame Fundamental Truths
againſt the Papiſts, by removing ſome oppreſſions and unneceſſary Ceremonies, by which
divers weak Conſciences have been ſcrupled, and ſeem to be divided from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>For the due execution of thoſe good Laws which have been made for ſecuring the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Your Subjects.</p>
                     <p>2. That Your Majeſty will likewiſe be pleaſed to remove from Your Council all ſuch
as perſiſt to favour and promote any of thoſe Preſſures and Corruptions wherewith Your
People have been grieved; and that for the future Your Majeſty will vouchſafe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſuch perſons in Your great and publick Affairs, and to take ſuch to be near You in
places of truſt, as Your Parliament may have cauſe to confide in; that in Your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goodneſs to Your People, You will reject and refuſe all mediation and ſolicitation to
the contrary, how powerful and near ſoever.</p>
                     <p>3. That You will be pleaſed to forbear to alienate any of the forfeited and eſcheated
Lands in <hi>Ireland</hi> which ſhall accrue to Your Crown by reaſon of this Rebellion, that out
of them the Crown may be the better ſupported, and ſome ſatisfaction made to Your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Kingdom for the great expences they are like to undergo this War.</p>
                     <p>Which humble deſires of ours being graciouſly fulfilled by Your Majeſty, we will by
the bleſſing and favour of God, moſt chearfully undergo the hazard and expences of this
War, and apply our ſelves to ſuch other courſes and counſels as may ſupport Your Royal
Eſtate with Honour and Plenty at home, with Power and Reputation abroad, and by
our Loyal Affections, Obedience and Service, lay a ſure and laſting foundation of the
Greatneſs and Proſperity of Your Majeſty, and Your Royal Poſterity in future times.</p>

                     <head>A REMONSTRANCE of the State of the Kingdom.</head>
                     <p>THE Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled having with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and faithfulneſs of affection and zeal to the publick good of this Kingdom,
and His Majeſties Honour and Service, for the ſpace of twelve months wraſtled
with the great Dangers and Fears, the preſſing Miſeries and Calamities, the various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
and Diſorders which had not only aſſaulted, but even overwhelmed and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
the Liberty, Peace and Proſperity of this Kingdom, the comfort and hopes of all
His Majeſties good Subjects, and exceedingly weakned and undermined the foundation
and ſtrength of His own Royal Throne; do yet find an abounding malignity and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
in thoſe Parties and Factions who have been the cauſe of thoſe evils, and do ſtill
labour to caſt aſperſions upon that which hath been done, and to raiſe many difficulties
for the hinderance of that which remains yet undone, and to foment Jealouſies betwixt
the King and the Parliament, that ſo they may deprive Him and His People of the fruit
of his own gracious intentions, and their humble deſires of procuring the publick Peace,
Safety, and Happineſs of this Realm. For the preventing of thoſe miſerable effects which
ſuch malicious endeavours may produce, We have thought good to declare,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Root and the growth of theſe miſchievous Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Maturity and ripeneſs to which they have attained before the beginning of the
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The effectual Means which have been uſed for the extirpation of thoſe dangerous
evils, and the Progreſs which hath therein been made by His Majeſties Goodneſs and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The ways of Obſtruction and Oppoſition, by which that progreſs hath been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The courſes to be taken for the removing thoſe Obſtacles, and for the accompliſhing
of our moſt dutiful and faithful intentions and endeavours of reſtoring and eſtabliſhing the ancient
Honour, Greatneſs, and Security of this Crown and Nation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Root of all this miſchief we find to be</hi> a malignant and pernicious deſign of ſubverting
the Fundamental Laws and Principles of Government, upon which the Religion and Juſtice of
this Kingdom are firmly eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                     <p>The Actors and Promoters hereof have been,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Jeſuited Papiſts, who hate the Laws as the obſtacles of that Change and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Religion which they ſo much long for.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Biſhops and the corrupt part of the Clergy, who cheriſh Formality and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
as the natural effects and more probable ſupports of their own Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny
and Vſurpation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Such Counſellors and Courtiers as for private ends have engaged themſelves to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the intereſts of ſome foreign Princes or States, to the prejudice of His Majeſty and the
State at home.</p>
                     <p>The Common Principles by which they moulded and governed all their particular
Counſels and Actions were theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To maintain continual Differences and Diſcontents betwixt the King and the People,
upon queſtions of Prerogative and Liberty, that ſo they might have the advantage of ſiding
with Him, and under the notions of men addicted to His Service, gain to themſelves and their
parties the places of greateſt truſt and power in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>A Second, To ſuppreſs the purity and power of Religion, and ſuch perſons as were beſt affected
to it; as being contrary to their own ends, and the greateſt impediment to that Change which
they thought to introduce.</p>
                     <p>A Third, to conjoyn thoſe parties of the Kingdom which were moſt propitious to their own
ends, and to divide thoſe who were moſt oppoſite, which conſiſted in many particular obſervations;
to cheriſh the <hi>Arminian</hi> part in thoſe Points wherein they agreè with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to multiply
and enlarge the Differences betwixt the common <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and thoſe whom they call <hi>Puritans,</hi>
to introduce and countenance ſuch Opinions and Ceremonies as are fitteſt for accommodation with
Popery, to encreaſe and maintain ignorance, looſeneſs and prophaneneſs in the People; that of
thoſe three parties, <hi>Papiſts, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> they might compoſe a body fit to act
ſuch Counſels and reſolutions as were moſt conducible to their own ends.</p>
                     <p>A Fourth, To diſaffect the King to Parliaments by Slanders and falſe Imputations, and by
putting Him upon other waies of ſupply, which in ſhew and appearance were fuller of advantage
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60710:130"/>
then the ordinary courſe of Subſidies, though in truth they brought more loſs than gain both to
the King and People, and have cauſed the great Diſtractions under which we both ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>As in all compounded bodies the Operations are qualified according to the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Element; ſo in this mixt party the Jeſuited Counſels being moſt active and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
may eaſily be diſcovered to have had the greateſt ſway in all their determinations,
and if they be not prevented, are likely to devour the reſt, or to turn them into their own
nature.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of His Majeſties Reign the party begun to revive and flouriſh again,
having been ſomewhat dampt by the breach with <hi>Spain</hi> in the laſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> and
by His Majeſties Marriage with <hi>France;</hi> the Intereſts and Counſels of that State being not
ſo contrary to the good of Religion and the proſperity of this Kingdom as thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> having been evermore addicted to <hi>Spain</hi> then <hi>France:</hi> yet they
ſtill retained a purpoſe and reſolution to weaken the Proteſtant parties in all parts, and even
in <hi>France,</hi> whereby to make way for the Change of Religion which they intended at home.</p>
                     <p>The firſt effect and evidence of their recovery and ſtrength was, the diſſolution of the
Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> after there had been given two Subſidies to His Majeſty, and before
they received relief in any one Grievance: many other more miſerable effects followed.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of the <hi>Rochel</hi> Fleet, by the help of our Shipping, ſet forth and delivered over
to the <hi>French,</hi> in oppoſition to the advice of Parliament; which left that Town without
defence by Sea, and made way not only to the loſs of that important place, but likewiſe
to the loſs of all the ſtrength and ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The diverting of His Majeſties courſe of Wars from the Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> which was the
moſt facile and hopeful way for this Kingdom to prevail againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceful
and ſucceſleſs attempt upon <hi>Cales;</hi> which was ſo ordered, as if it had rather
been intended to make us weary of War, then to proſper in it.</p>
                     <p>The precipitate breach with <hi>France,</hi> by taking their Ships to a great value, without
making recompence to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe goods were thereupon imbarg'd and confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> without conſent of Parliament, contrary to the promiſe of
King <hi>James</hi> to both Houſes; whereby the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe was deſerted, and left to charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and hopeleſs Treaties, which, for the moſt part, were managed by thoſe who might
juſtly be ſuſpected to be no friends to that Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The charging of the Kingdom with billetted Souldiers in all parts of it, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
deſign of <hi>Germane</hi> horſe; that the Land might either ſubmit with fear, or
be enforced with rigour to ſuch Arbitrary Contributions as ſhould be required of them.</p>
                     <p>The diſſolving of the Parliament in the ſecond year of His Majeſties reign, after a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of their intent to grant five Subſidies.</p>
                     <p>The exacting of the like proportion of five Subſidies after the Parliament diſſolved, by
Commiſſion of Loan; and divers Gentlemen and others impriſoned for not yielding to
pay that Loan, whereby many of them contracted ſuch Sickneſſes as coſt them their
lives. Great ſums of Money required and raiſed by privy Seals. An unjuſt and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attempt to extort great payments from the Subject by way of Exciſe, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
iſſued under Seal to that purpoſe. The Petition of Right, which was granted
in full Parliament, blaſted with an illegal Declaration, to make it deſtructive to it ſelf,
to the power of Parliament, to the Liberty of the Subject, and to that purpoſe printed
with it; and the Petition made of no uſe, but to ſhew the bold and preſumptuous inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of ſuch Miniſters as durſt break the Laws, and ſuppreſs the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
after they had been ſo ſolemnly and evidently declared.</p>
                     <p>Another Parliament diſſolved 4 <hi>Car.</hi> the Priviledge of Parliament broken by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
divers Members of the Houſe, detaining them cloſe Priſoners for many months
together, without the liberty of uſing Books, Pen, Ink or Paper, denying them all the
comforts of life, all means of preſervation of health, not permitting their Wives to come
unto them, even in time of their Sickneſs; and for the compleating of that Cruelty,
after years ſpent in ſuch miſerable durance, depriving them of the neceſſary means of
Spiritual conſolation, not ſuffering them to go abroad to enjoy God's Ordinances in
God's Houſe, or God's Miniſters to come to them, to adminiſter comfort unto them in
their private Chambers: and to keep them ſtill in this oppreſſed condition, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to be bailed according to Law, yet vexing them with Informations in inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Courts, ſentencing and fining ſome of them for matters done in Parliament, and
extorting the payments of thoſe Fines from them; enforcing others to put in Security
of good behaviour, before they could be releaſed.</p>
                     <p>The impriſonment of the reſt which refuſed to be bound ſtill continued; which might
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60710:130"/>
have been perpetual, if neceſſity had not the laſt year brought another Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve-them;
of whom one died by the cruelty and harſhneſs of his Impriſonment, which
would admit of no relaxation, notwithſtanding the imminent danger of his life did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appear by the declaration of his Phyſician, and his releaſe, or at leaſt his refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was ſought by many humble Petitions. And his blood ſtill cries either for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
or repentance of thoſe Miniſters of State, who have at once obſtructed the
courſe both of His Majeſties Juſtice and Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Upon the diſſolution of both theſe Parliaments, untrue and ſcandalous Declarations
were publiſhed, to aſperſe their proceedings and ſome of their Members, unjuſtly to make
them odious, and colour the violence which was uſed againſt them; Proclamations ſet
out to the ſame purpoſe, and to the great dejecting of the hearts of the people, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them even to ſpeak of Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>After the breach of the Parliament, in the fourth year of His Majeſty, Injuſtice, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Violence broke in upon us without any reſtraint or moderation: and yet
the firſt project was the great ſums exacted through the whole Kingdom for default of
Knighthood, which ſeemed to have ſome colour and ſhadow of a Law; yet if it be rightly
examined by that obſolete Law which was pretended for it, it would be found to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the rules of Juſtice, both in reſpect of the perſons charged, the proportion of
the Fines demanded, and the abſurd and unreaſonable manner of their proceedings. Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and Poundage hath been received without colour or pretence of Law; many other
heavy Impoſitions continued againſt Law; and ſome ſo unreaſonable, that the ſum of
the charge exceeds the value of the Goods. The Book of Rates lately inhanced to a high
proportion; and ſuch Merchants as would not ſubmit to their illegal and unreaſonable
payments, were vexed and oppreſſed above meaſure, and the ordinary courſe of Juſtice,
the common Birth-right of the Subject of <hi>England,</hi> wholly obſtructed unto them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all this was taken upon pretence of guarding the Sea, yet a new and unheard-of
Tax of Ship-money was deviſed upon the ſame pretence. By both which there was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon the Subject near 700000 <hi>l.</hi> ſome years; and yet the Merchants have been left
ſo naked to the violence of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirats, that many great Ships of value and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of His Majeſties Subjects have been taken by them, and do ſtill remain in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſlavery.</p>
                     <p>The enlargement of Foreſts, contrary to <hi>Charta de Foreſta</hi> and the compoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
The exactions of Coat and Conduct-Money, and divers other Military charges.
The taking away the Arms of the Trained Bands of divers Counties. The deſperate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of engroſſing all the Gun-powder into one hand, keeping it in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi>
and ſetting ſo high a rate upon it that the poorer ſort were not able to buy it, nor could
any have it without Licence; thereby to leave the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom deſtitute
of their neceſſary defence, and by ſelling ſo dear that which was ſold, to make an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
advantage of it, to the great charge and detriment of the Subject. The general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Kings Timber, eſpecially that in the Foreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> ſold to Papiſts, which
was the beſt Store-houſe of this Kingdom for the maintenance of our Shipping. The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of mens Right, under colour of the Kings title to Land between high and low
water-Marks. The Monopolies of Sope, Salt, Wine, Leather, Sea-coal, and in a manner,
of all things of moſt common and neceſſary uſe. The reſtraint of the Liberties of the
Subjects in their Habitation, Trades, and other Intereſt. Their vexation and oppreſſion
by Purveyors, Clarks of the Market, and Salt-Peter-men. The ſale of pretended Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanzes,
as Buildings in and about <hi>London,</hi> converſion of Arable into Paſture, continuance
of Paſture under the name of depopulation, have drawn many Millions out of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Purſes, without any conſiderable profit to His Majeſty. Large quantities of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ſeveral Grounds have been taken from the Subject by colour of the Statute of
Improvement, and by abuſe of the Commiſſion of Sewers, without their conſent and
againſt it. And not only private Intereſt, but alſo publick Faith have been broken, in ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the Money and Bullion in the Mint; and the whole Kingdom like to be robb'd
at once in that abominable project of Braſs Money. Great numbers of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
for refuſing thoſe unlawful charges, have been vext with long and expenſive ſuits;
ſome fined and cenſured, others committed to long and hard impriſonments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements,
to the loſs of health in many, of life in ſome; and others have had their Houſes
broken up, their Goods ſeized; ſome have been reſtrained from their lawful Callings:
Ships have been interrupted in their Voyages, ſurprized at Sea in an hoſtile manner by
Projectors, as by a common Enemy; Merchants prohibited to unlade their goods in
ſuch Ports as were for their own advantage, and forced to bring them to thoſe places
which were moſt for the advantages of the Monopolizers and Projectors. The Court
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60710:131"/>
of Star-Chamber hath abounded in extravagant Cenſures, not only for the maintenance
and improvement of Monopolies and other unlawful Taxes, but for divers other Cauſes,
where there hath been no offence, or very ſmall; whereby His Majeſties Subjects have
been oppreſſed by grievous Fines, Impriſonments, Stigmatizings, Mutilations, Whippings,
Pillories, Gags, Confinements, Baniſhments, after ſo rigid a manner, as hath not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
men of the ſociety of their Friends, exerciſe of their Profeſſions, comfort of Books,
uſe of Paper or Ink, but even violated that near Union which God hath eſtabliſht betwixt
Men and their Wives, by forced and conſtrained ſeparation; whereby they have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of the comfort and converſation one of another for many years together, without
hope of relief, if God had not by his over-ruling Providence given ſome interruption to
the prevailing power and counſel of thoſe who were the Authors and Promoters of ſuch
peremptory and heady courſes.</p>
                     <p>Judges have been put out of their places for refuſing to do againſt their Oaths and
Conſciences: Others have been ſo awed, that they durſt not do their duties; and the
better to hold a rod over them, the Clauſe <hi>Quamdiu ſe bene geſſerit</hi> was left out of their
Patents, and a new Clauſe <hi>Durante beneplacito</hi> inſerted. Lawyers have been checkt for
being faithful to their Clients; Solicitors and Attorneys have been threatned, and ſome
puniſhed, for following lawful Suites: And by this means all the approaches to Juſtice
were interrupted and fore-cluded. New Oathes have been forced upon the Subject againſt
Law; new Judicatories erected without Law. The Council-Table have by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
offered to bind the Subjects in their Free-holds, Eſtates, Suites and Actions. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Court of the Earl-Marſhal was Arbitrary and Illegal in its being and proceedings.
The Chancery, Exchequer-Chamber, Court of Wards, and other Engliſh Courts have
been grievous in exceeding their Juriſdiction: The eſtate of many Families weakned,
and ſome ruined, by exceſſive Fines exacted from them for Compoſitions of Wardſhips:
All Leaſes of above a hundred years made to draw on Wardſhip contrary to Law. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
proceedings uſed in the finding of Offices, to make the Jury find for the King. The
Common-Law Courts, ſeeing all men more inclined to ſeek Juſtice there where it may
be fitted to their own deſire, are known frequently to forſake the Rules of the Common-Law,
and ſtraining beyond their bounds, under pretence of Equity to do Injuſtice. Titles
of Honour, Judicial places, Serjeantſhips at Law and other Offices, have been ſold for
great ſums of money, whereby the common Juſtice of the Kingdom hath been much
endangered; not only by opening a way of employment in places of great Truſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to men of weak parts, but alſo by giving occaſion to Bribery, Extortion, Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality;
it ſeldom hapning that places ill gotten are well uſed. Commiſſions have been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for examining the exceſs of Fees: and when great Exactions have been diſcovered,
Compoſitions have been made with Delinquents, not only for the time paſt, but likewiſe
for immunity and ſecurity in offending for the time to come; which under colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
hath but confirmed and encreaſed the Grievance to the Subject. The uſual courſe
of pricking Sheriffs not obſerved, but many times Sheriffs made in an extraordinary
way: ſometimes as a puniſhment and charge unto them; ſometimes ſuch were pricked
out as would be Inſtruments to execute whatſoever they would have to be done.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhops and the reſt of the Clergy did triumph in the Suſpenſions, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
Deprivations and Degradations of divers painful, learned and pious Miniſters, in
the vexation and grievous oppreſſion of great numbers of His Majeſties good Subjects.
The High-Commiſſion grew to ſuch exceſs of ſharpneſs and ſeverity, as was not much
leſs then the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inquiſition; and yet in many caſes by the Arch-biſhops power was made
much more heavy, being aſſiſted and ſtrengthened by authority of the Council-Table.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhops and their Courts were as eager in the Country; and although their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
could not reach ſo high in rigor and extremity of puniſhment, yet were they no
leſs grievous in reſpect of the generality and multiplicity of vexations, which lighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the meaner ſort of Trades-men and Artificers, did impoveriſh many thouſands, and
ſo afflict and trouble others, that great numbers, to avoid their miſeries, departed out of
the Kingdom, ſome into <hi>New-England</hi> and other parts of <hi>America,</hi> others into <hi>Holland,</hi>
where they have tranſported their Manufactures of Cloth; which is not only a loſs, by
diminiſhing the preſent ſtock of the Kingdom, but a great miſchief, by impairing and
endangering the loſs of that peculiar Trade of Cloathing, which hath been a plentiful
fountain of Wealth and Honour to this Nation. Thoſe were fitteſt for Eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and ſooneſt obtained it, who were moſt officious in promoting Superſtition,
moſt virulent in railing againſt Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
                     <p>The moſt publick and ſolemn Sermons before His Majeſty were either to advance Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
above Law, and decry the Property of the Subject; or full of ſuch kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60710:131"/>
whereby they might make thoſe odious who ſought to maintain the Religion,
Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom: and ſuch men were ſure to be weeded out of the
Commiſſion of the Peace, and out of all other imployments of power in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Countrey. Many noble Perſonnages were Councellors in name, but the
power and authority remained in a few of ſuch as were moſt addicted to this party; whoſe
reſolutions and determinations were brought to the Table for countenance and execution,
and not for debate and deliberation; and no man could offer to oppoſe them without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and hazard to himſelf. Nay all thoſe that did not wholly concur and actively
contribute to the furtherance of their deſigns, though otherwiſe perſons of never ſo great
Honour and Abilities, were ſo far from being employed in any place of truſt and power,
that they were neglected, diſcountenanced, and upon all occaſions injured and oppreſſed.
This Faction was grown to that height and entireneſs of power, that now they began
to think of finiſhing their Work, which conſiſted of theſe three parts.</p>
                     <p>1. The Government muſt be ſet free from all reſtraint of Laws concerning our Perſons and
States.</p>
                     <p>2. There muſt be a Conjunction betwixt Papiſts and Proteſtants in Doctrine, Diſcipline and
Ceremonies; only it muſt not yet be called Popery.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Puritans,</hi> (under which name they include all thoſe that deſire to preſerve the Laws
and Liberties of the Kingdom, and to maintain Religion in the power of it) muſt be either
rooted out of the Kingdom with force, or driven out with fear. For the effecting of this, it
was thought neceſſary to reduce <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſuch Popiſh Superſtitions and Innovations as might
make them apt to joyn with <hi>England</hi> in that great Change which was intended. Whereupon
new Canons and a new Liturgy were preſt upon them; and when they refuſed to admit of them,
an Army was raiſed to force them to it, towards which the Clergy and the Papiſts were very
forward in their Contribution. The <hi>Scots</hi> likewiſe raiſed an Army for their defence: and
when both Armies were come together, and ready for a bloody encounter, His Majeſties own
Gracious Diſpoſition, and the Counſel of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, and Dutiful ſubmiſſion of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> did ſo far prevail againſt the evil Counſel of others, that a Pacification was made, and His
Majeſty returned with Peace and much Honour to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unexpected Reconciliation was moſt acceptable to all the Kingdom, except to the
malignant party; whereof the Archbiſhop and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> being heads, they and
their faction begun to inveigh againſt the Peace, and to aggravate the proceeding of the
States, which ſo incenſed His Majeſty, that He forthwith prepared again for War. And
ſuch was their confidence, that having corrupted and diſtempered the whole frame and
Government of the Kingdom, they did now hope to corrupt that which was the only
means to reſtore all to a right frame and temper again. To which end they perſwaded
His Majeſty to call a Parliament, not to ſeek counſel and advice of them, but to draw
countenance and Supply from them, and engage the whole Kingdom in their Quarrel:
and in the mean time continued all their unjuſt Levies of Money, reſolving either to make
the Parliament pliant to their Will, and to eſtabliſh miſchief by a Law, or elſe to brake it;
and with more colour to go on by violence, to take what they could not obtain by conſent.</p>
                     <p>The ground alledged for the juſtification of this War was this, That the undutiful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Parliaments of <hi>Scotland</hi> was a ſufficient reaſon for His Majeſty to take Arms
againſt them, without hearing the Reaſon of thoſe Demands. And thereupon a new Army
was prepared againſt them, their Ships were ſeized in all Ports both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and at Sea, their Petitions rejected, their Commiſſioners refuſed Audience, this whole
Kingdom moſt miſerably diſtempered with Levies of Men and Money, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thoſe who denied to ſubmit to thoſe Levies. The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> paſt into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> cauſed the Parliament there to declare againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> to give four Subſidies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that War, and to ingage themſelves, their Lives and Fortunes for the proſecution
of it; and gave directions for an Army of eight thouſand foot and one thouſand horſe to
be levied there, which were for the moſt part Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>The Parliament met upon the thirteenth of <hi>April</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred and forty.
The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with their Party ſo prevailed with
His Majeſty, that the Houſe of Commons was preſt to yield to a Supply for maintenance
of the War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> before they had provided any relief for the great and preſſing
Grievances of the people: which being againſt the fundamental Privilege and proceeding
of Parliament, was yet in humble reſpect to His Majeſty ſo far admitted, as that they
agreed to take the matter of Supply into conſideration, and two ſeveral days it was
debated. Twelve Subſidies were demanded for the releaſe of Ship-money alone. A third
day was appointed for concluſion: when the Heads of that Party begun to fear the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might cloſe with the King in ſatisfying his deſire of money; but that withal they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60710:132"/>
were like to blaſt their malicious deſigns againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> finding them very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed
to give any countenance to that War. Thereupon they wickedly adviſed the
King to break off the Parliament, and to return to the ways of Confuſion, in which
their own evil intentions were moſt like to proſper and ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>After the Parliament ended the fifth of <hi>May</hi> 1640. this Party grew ſo bold, as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
the King to ſupply Himſelf out of his Subjects ſtates by His own Power, at His own
will, without their conſent. The very next day ſome Members of both Houſes had their
ſtudies and cabinets, yea their pockets, ſearched: another of them not long after was
committed cloſe priſoner, for not delivering ſome Petitions which he received by authority
of that Houſe. And if harſher courſes were intended (as was reported) it is very
probable that the ſickneſs of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the tumultuous riſing in <hi>Southwark</hi>
and about <hi>Lambeth,</hi> were the cauſes that ſuch violent intentions were not brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
A falſe and ſcandalous Declaration againſt the Houſe of Commons was publiſhed
in his Majeſties Name; which yet wrought little effect with the people, but only to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
the impudence of thoſe who were Authors of it.</p>
                     <p>A forced Loan of money was attempted in the City of <hi>London.</hi> The Lord Mayor and
Aldermen in their ſeveral Wards enjoyned to bring in a liſt of the names of ſuch perſons
as they judged fit to lend, and of the ſumm they ſhould lend. And ſuch Aldermen as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
ſo to do, were committed to priſon.</p>
                     <p>The Archbiſhop and the other Biſhops and Clergy continued the Convocation, and by
a new Commiſſion turned it to a Provincial Synod, in which, by an unheard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
they made Canons that contain in them many matters contrary to the Kings
Prerogative, to the fundamental Laws and Statutes of the Realm, to the Right of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
to the Property and Liberty of the Subject, and matters tending to Sedition
and of dangerous conſequence, thereby eſtabliſhing their own Uſurpations, juſtifying
their Altar-worſhip, and thoſe other ſuperſtitious Innovations which they formerly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
without warrant of Law.</p>
                     <p>They impoſed a new Oath upon divers of his Majeſties Subjects, both Eccleſiaſtical
and Lay, for maintenance of their own Tyranny, and laid a great tax upon the Clergy for
ſupply of his Majeſty; and generally they ſhewed themſelves very affectionate to the
War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was by ſome of them ſtyled <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> and a Prayer
compoſed, and enjoyned to be read in all Churches, calling the <hi>Scots</hi> Rebels, to put the
two Nations into blood, and make them irreconcilable. All thoſe pretended Canons and
Conſtitutions were armed with the ſeveral Cenſures of Suſpenſion, Excommunication,
Deprivation, by which they would have thruſt out all the good Miniſters, and moſt of
the well affected people of the Kingdom, and left an eaſie paſſage to their own deſign
of reconciliation with <hi>Rome.</hi> The Popiſh party enjoyned ſuch exemptions from the
Penal Laws as amounted to a Toleration, beſides many other encouragements and Court-favours:
They had a Secretary of State, Sir <hi>Francis Windebank,</hi> a powerful Agent for the
ſpeeding of all their deſires; a <hi>Pope's Nuntio</hi> reſiding here to act and govern them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſuch influences as he received from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to intercede for them with the moſt
powerful concurrence of the foreign Princes of that Religion. By his authority the Papiſts
of all ſorts, Nobility, Gentry and Clergy were convocated after the manner of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
new Juriſdictions were erected of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Archbiſhops, Taxes levied, another
State moulded within this State independent in Government, contrary in Intereſt and
affection, ſecretly corrupting the ignorant or negligent Profeſſours of our Religion, and
cloſely uniting and combining themſelves againſt ſuch as were ſound, in this poſture wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for an opportunity by force to deſtroy thoſe whom they could not hope to ſeduce.
For the effecting whereof they were ſtrengthened with Arms and Munition, encouraged
by ſuperſtitious Prayers enjoyned by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to be weekly made for the proſperity of
ſome great Deſign. And ſuch power had they at Court, that ſecretly a Commiſſion was
iſſued out, intended to be iſſued to ſome Great men of that profeſſion, for the levying of
Souldiers, and to command and employ them according to private inſtructions, which we
doubt were framed for the advantage of thoſe who were the contrivers of them. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Treaſure was conſumed, His Revenue anticipated, His Servants and Officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to lend great ſums of mony; Multitudes were called to the Council-Table, who
were tired with long attendances there, for refuſing illegal payments. The Priſons were
filled with their Commitments; many of the Sheriffs ſummoned into the Star-Chamber,
and ſome impriſoned for not being quick enough in levying the Ship-money; the people
languiſhed under grief and fear, no viſible hope being left but in deſperation. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
began to be weary of their ſilence and patience, and ſenſible of the duty and truſt
which belongs to them: and thereupon ſome of the moſt eminent of them did petition
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60710:132"/>
His Majeſty, at ſuch a time when evil Counſels were ſo ſtrong that they had reaſon to
expect more hazard to themſelves then redreſs of thoſe publick evils for which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded.
Whileſt the Kingdom was in this agitation and diſtemper, the <hi>Scots,</hi> reſtrained in
their Trades, impoveriſhed by the loſs of many of their Ships, bereaved of all poſſibility
of ſatisfying His Majeſty by any naked Supplication, entred with a powerful Army into
the Kingdom, and without any hoſtile Act or ſpoil in the Countrey as they paſſed, more
then forcing a paſſage over the <hi>Tyne</hi> at <hi>Newborne</hi> near <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and had a fair opportunity to preſs on further upon the Kings Army: but
duty and reverence to His Majeſty, and brotherly love to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, made them
ſtay there, whereby the King had leiſure to entertain better Counſels; wherein God ſo
bleſſed and directed Him, that He ſummoned the great Council of Peers to meet at <hi>York</hi>
upon the twenty fourth of <hi>September,</hi> and there declared a Parliament to begin the third
of <hi>November</hi> then following. The <hi>Scots</hi> the firſt day of the great Council preſented an
humble Petition to His Majeſty; whereupon the Treaty was appointed at <hi>Rippon,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Ceſſation of arms agreed upon, and the full concluſion of all Differences referred to
the wiſdom and care of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>At our firſt meeting all Oppoſitions ſeemed to vaniſh; the miſchiefs were ſo evident
which thoſe evil Counſellors produced, that no man durſt ſtand up to defend them. Yet
the work it ſelf afforded difficulty enough. The multiplied evils and corruption of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, ſtrengthned by Cuſtome and Authority, and the concurrent intereſt of many
powerful Delinquents, were now to be brought to judgment and Reformation. The Kings
Houſhold was to be provided for; they had brought Him to that want, that He could
not ſupply His ordinary and neceſſary Expences without the aſſiſtance of His People.
Two Armies were to be payed, which amounted very near to thirty thouſand pounds a
month; the people were to be tenderly charged, having been formerly exhauſted with
many burthenſome Projects. The Difficulties ſeemed to be inſuperable, which by the
Divine Providence we have overcome; the Contrarieties incompatible, which yet in a
great meaſure we have reconciled. Six Subſidies have been granted, and a Bill of Poll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
which, if it be duly levied, may equal ſix Subſidies more, in all ſix hundred
thouſand pounds. Beſides, we have contracted a debt to the <hi>Scots</hi> of two hundred and twenty
thouſand pounds; and yet God hath ſo bleſſed the endeavours of this Parliament,
that the Kingdom is a great gainer by all theſe charges. The Ship-money is aboliſhed
which coſt the Kingdom above 200000 pounds a year. The Coat and Conduct-money
and other military charges are taken away, which in many Countries amounted to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
leſs then the Ship-money. The Monopolies are all ſuppreſt, whereof ſome few did preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the Subject above a Million yearly: the Soap an hundred thouſand pounds, the Wine
three hundred thouſand pounds, the Leather muſt needs exceed both, and Salt could not
be leſs then that; beſides the inferiour Monopolies, which, if they could be exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
would make up a great ſum. That which is more beneficial then all this is, that
the root of theſe evils is taken away, which was the arbitrary power pretended to be in
His Majeſty, of taxing the Subject, or charging their eſtates without conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is now declared to be againſt Law by the judgment of both Houſes, and
likewiſe by an Act of Parliament. Another ſtep of great advantage is this, the living
Grievances, the evil Counſellors and actors of theſe miſchiefs have been ſo quelled by
the Juſtice done upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the flight of the Lord <hi>Finch</hi> and Secretary
<hi>Windebank,</hi> the accuſation and impriſonment of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of Judge
<hi>Bartlet,</hi> and the impeachment of divers other Biſhops and Judges, that it is like not only
to be an eaſe to the preſent times, but a preſervation to the future. The diſcontinuance
of Parliaments is prevented by the Bill for a Triennial Parliament, and the abrupt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Parliament by another Bill; by which it is provided it ſhall not be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or adjourned without the conſent of both Houſes. Which two Laws well conſidered
may be thought more advantageous then all the former, becauſe they ſecure a full ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the preſent remedy, and afford a perpetual Spring of remedies for the future.
The Star-chamber, the High-Commiſſion, the Courts of the Preſident and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in the North, were ſo many forges of Miſery, Oppreſſion, and Violence, and
are all taken away; whereby men are more ſecured in their Perſons, Liberties and
Eſtates, then they could be by any Law or Example for the regulation of thoſe Courts,
or Terror of the Judges. The immoderate power of the Council-Table and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
abuſe of that power is ſo ordered and reſtrained, that we may well hope that no
ſuch things as were frequently done by them, to the prejudice of the publick Liberty, will
appear in future times, but only in Stories, to give us and our poſterity more occaſion
to praiſe God for his Majeſties Goodneſs, and the faithful endeavours of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60710:133"/>
The Canons and the power of Canon-making, are blaſted by the Vote of both
Houſes. The exorbitant power of Biſhops and their Courts are much abated, by ſome
Proviſions in the Bill againſt the High-Commiſſion Court. The Authors of the
many Innovations in Doctrine and Ceremonies, the Miniſters that have been ſcandalous
in their lives, have been ſo terrified in juſt Complaints and Accuſations, that we may
well hope they will be more modeſt for the time to come; either inwardly convicted
by the ſight of their own folly, or outwardly reſtrained by the fear of puniſhment. The
Foreſts are by a good Law reduced to their right bounds; the encroachments and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Stannary Courts, the Extortions of the Clark of the Market, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of the Subject to receive the Order of Knight-hood againſt his will, paying of
Fines for not receiving it, and the vexatious proceedings thereupon for levying of thoſe
Fines, are by other beneficial Laws reformed and prevented. Many excellent Laws and
proviſions are in preparation for removing the inordinate power, vexation and uſurpation
of Biſhops, for reforming the pride and idleneſs of many of the Clergy, for eaſing the
people of unneceſſary Ceremonies in Religion, for cenſuring and removing unworthy and
unprofitable Miniſters, and for maintaining godly and diligent Preachers through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Other things of main importance for the good of this Kingdom are in propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
though little could hitherto be done, in regard of the many other more preſſing bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes,
which yet before the end of this Seſſion we hope may receive ſome progreſs
and perfection. The eſtabliſhing and ordering the Kings Revenue, that ſo the abuſe of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and ſuperfluity of expences may be cut off, and the neceſſary disburſements for His
Majeſties Honour, the defence and government of the Kingdom, may be more certainly
provided for: The regulating of Courts of Juſtice, and abridging both the delaies and
charges of Law-ſuits: The ſetling of ſome good courſes for preventing the exportation
of Gold and Silver, and the inequality of exchanges betwixt us and other Nations; for the
advancing of native Commodities, increaſe of our Manufactures, and well-balancing of
Trade, whereby the ſtock of the Kingdom may be increaſed, or at leaſt kept from impairing,
as through neglect hereof it hath done for many years laſt paſt; for improving the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-fiſhing
upon our own Coaſts, which will be of mighty uſe in the imployment of the
poor, and a plentiful Nurſery of Mariners for inabling the Kingdom in any great action.</p>
                     <p>The Oppoſitions, Obſtructions, and other Difficulties wherewith we have been encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and which ſtill lye in our way with ſome ſtrength and much obſtinacy, are theſe: The
malignant party, whom we have formerly deſcribed to be the Actors and Promoters of all
our Miſery, they have taken heart again: They have been able to prefer ſome of their own
Factors and Agents to degrees of Honour, to places of Truſt and imployment, even during
the Parliament: They have indeavoured to work in His Majeſty ill impreſſions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our proceedings, as if we had altogether done our own work, and not his, and had
obtained from Him many things very prejudicial to the Crown, both in reſpect of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Profit.</p>
                     <p>To wipe out this Slander, We think good ouly to ſay thus much, That all that we have
done is for His Majeſty, His Greatneſs, Honour and Support. When we yielded to
give twenty five thouſand pounds a month for the relief of the Northern Countries, this
was given to the King, for he was bound to protect His Subjects; they were His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
evil Counſellors and their ill inſtruments that were actors in theſe Grievances which
brought in the <hi>Scots:</hi> and if His Majeſty pleaſe to force thoſe who were the Authors of
this War to make ſatisfaction, as He might juſtly and eaſily do, it ſeems very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that the people might well be excuſed from taking upon them this burthen, being
altogether innocent, and free from being any cauſes of it.</p>
                     <p>When we undertook the charge of the Army, which coſt above 50000 pound a month,
was not this given to the King? was it not His Majeſties Army? were not all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
under contract with His Majeſty at higher rates and greater wages then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary?
And have not we taken upon us to diſcharge all the brotherly aſſiſtance of three
hundred thouſand pounds which we gave the <hi>Scots?</hi> was it not toward repair of thoſe
damages and loſſes which they received from the Kings Ships and from His Miniſters?
Theſe three particulars amount to above eleven hundred thouſand pounds; beſides His
Majeſty hath received by Impoſitions upon Merchandiſe at leaſt four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds: ſo that his Majeſty hath had out of the Subjects purſe ſince the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began one million and an half, and yet theſe men can be ſo impudent as to tell His
Majeſty that we have done nothing for Him.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond branch of this Slander, we acknowledge with much thankfulneſs that
his Majeſty hath paſſed more good Bills to the advantage of the Subjects then have been
in many Ages: but withall we cannot forget that theſe venomous counſels did
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60710:133"/>
manifeſt themſelves in ſome endeavours to hinder theſe good Acts. And for both Houſes
of Parliament we may with truth and modeſty ſay thus much, That we have ever been
careful not to deſire any thing that ſhould weaken the Crown, either in juſt Profit or
uſeful Power. The Triennial Parliament, for the matter of it, doth not extend to ſo
much as by Law we ought to have required, there being two Statutes ſtill in force for a
Parliament to be once a year; and for the manner of it, it is in the Kings power that it
ſhall never take effect, if he by a timely ſummons ſhall prevent any other way of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
In the Bill for continuance of this preſent Parliament, there ſeems to be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of the Royal power in diſſolving of Parliaments; not to take it out of the Crown,
but to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time and occaſion onely; which was ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the Kings own ſecurity and the publick Peace, that without it we could not have
undertaken any of theſe great charges, but muſt have left both the Armies to diſorder
and confuſion, and the whole Kingdom to blood and rapine. The Star-chamber was
much more fruitful in oppreſſion then in profit, the great Fines being for the moſt part
given away, and the reſt ſtalled at long times. The Fines of the High-Commiſſion were
in themſelves unjuſt, and ſeldom or never came into the Kings purſe. Theſe four Bills
are particularly and more ſpecially inſtanced, in the reſt there will not be found ſo much
as a ſhadow of prejudice to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>They have ſought to diminiſh our reputation with the people, and to bring them out
of love with Parliaments: the aſperſions which they have attempted this way have been
ſuch as theſe: That we have ſpent much time and done little, eſpecially in thoſe Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
which concern Religion. That the Parliament is a burthen to the Kingdom by the
abundance of Protections, which hinder Juſtice and Trade; and by many Subſidies gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
much more heavy then any they formerly endured. To which there is a ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
If the time ſpent in this Parliament be conſidered in relation backward to the long
growth and deep root of thoſe Grievances which we have removed, to the powerful
ſupports of thoſe Delinquents which we have purſued, to the great neceſſities and other
charges of the Commonwealth for which we have provided; or if it be conſidered in
relation forward to many advantages which not only the preſent but future ages are
like to reap by the good Laws and other proceedings in this Parliament; we doubt not
but it will be thought by all indifferent judgments, that our time hath been much better
imployed then in a far greater proportion of time in many former Parliaments put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the charges which have been laid upon the Subjects, and the other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which they have born, will ſeem very light in reſpect of the benefit they have
and may receive. And for the matter of Protections, the Parliament is ſo ſenſible of it,
that therein they intend to give them whatſoever eaſe may ſtand with Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
and are in a way of paſſing a Bill to give them ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>They have ſought by many ſubtle practices to cauſe jealouſies and diviſions betwixt
us and our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſlandering their proceedings and intentions towards
us, and by ſecret endeavours to inſtigate and incenſe them and us one againſt another.
They have had ſuch a party of Biſhops and Popiſh Lords in the Houſe of Peers as hath
cauſed much oppoſition and delay in the proſecution of Delinquents, hindered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of divers good Bills paſſed in the Commons Houſe concerning the reformation
of ſundry great abuſes and corruptions both in Church and State. They have laboured
to ſeduce and corrupt ſome of the Commons Houſe, to draw them into Conſpiracies
and Combinations againſt the Liberty of the Parliament: and by their Inſtruments and
agents they have attempted to diſaffect and diſcontent His Majeſties Army, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it for the maintenance of their wicked and traiterous deſigns, the keeping up of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in their Votes and Functions, and by force to compel the Parliament to order, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and diſpoſe their proceedings in ſuch manner as might beſt concur with the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this dangerous and potent faction. And when one miſchievous deſign and attempt
of theirs to bring on the Army againſt the Parliament and the City of <hi>London</hi> had been
diſcovered and prevented, they preſently undertook another of the ſame damnable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with this addition to it, to endeavour to make the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army neutral, whilſt the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which they had laboured to corrupt and invenome againſt us by their
falſe and ſlanderous ſuggeſtions, ſhould execute their malice to the ſubverſion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the diſſolution of our Government.</p>
                     <p>Thus they have been continually practiſing to diſturb the Peace, and plotting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
even of all the Kings dominions, and have employed their Emiſſaries and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
in them all for the promoting of their deviliſh deſigns, which the vigilancy of thoſe
who were well-affected hath ſtill diſcovered and defeated before they were ripe for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> only in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was farther off, they have had
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60710:134"/>
time and opportunity to mould and prepare their work, and had brought it to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that they had poſſeſſed themſelves of that whole Kingdom, totally ſubverted the
Government of it, rooted out Religion, and deſtroyed all the Proteſtants, whom the
conſcience of their duty to God, their King and Countrey, would not have permitted to
joyn with them, if by God's wonderful providence their main enterpriſe upon the City
and Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> had not been detected and prevented upon the very Eve before it
ſhould have been executed. Notwithſtanding they have in other parts of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
broken out into open Rebellion, ſurprized Towns and Caſtles, committed murders,
rapes and other villanies, and ſhaken off all bonds of Obedience to His Majeſty and the
Laws of the Realm; and in general have kindled ſuch a fire, as nothing but God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
bleſſing upon the wiſdom and endeavours of this State will be able to quench it.
And certainly, had not God in his great mercy unto this Land diſcovered and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their former deſigns, we had been the Prologue to this Tragedy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had
by this time been made the lamentable ſpectacle of miſery and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>And now what hope have we but in God, when as the only means of our ſubſiſtence
and power of Reformation is under Him in the Parliament? But what can we the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
without the conjunction of the Houſe of Lords? and what conjunction can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
there, when the Biſhops and Recuſant Lords are ſo numerous and prevalent, that
they are able to croſs and interrupt our beſt endeavours for Reformation, and by that
means give advantage to this malignant party to traduce our proceedings?</p>
                     <p>They infuſe into the People, that we mean to aboliſh all Church-government, and
leave every man to his own fancy for the Service and Worſhip of God, abſolving him of
that Obedience which he owes under God unto His Majeſty, whom we know to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Eccleſiaſtical Law as well as with the Temporal, to regulate all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by ſuch rules of order and diſcipline as are eſtabliſhed by
Parliament, which is his great Council in all affairs both of Church and State. We confeſs
our intention is, and our endeavours have been, to reduce within bounds that exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
power which the Prelates have aſſumed unto themſelves ſo contrary both to the
Word of God and to the Laws of the Land: to which end we paſt the Bill for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them from their Temporal power and employments, that ſo the better they might
with meekneſs apply themſelves to the diſcharge of their functions: Which Bill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
oppoſed, and were the principal inſtruments of croſſing it. And we do here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that it is far from our purpoſe or deſire to let looſe the golden reins of Diſcipline and
Government in the Church, to leave private perſons or particular Congregations to take
up what form of Divine Service they pleaſe: for we hold it requiſite that there ſhould be
throughout the whole Realm a Conformity to that Order which the Laws enjoyn, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Word of God; and we deſire to unburthen the Conſciences of men of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, ſuppreſs innovations, and take away the monuments
of Idolatry. And the better to effect the intended Reformation, we deſire there may be a
general Synod of the moſt grave, pious, learned and judicious Divines of this Iſland, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſome from foreign parts, profeſſing the ſame Religion with us, who may conſider
of all things neceſſary for the peace and good Government of the Church, and repreſent
the reſults of their conſultations unto the Parliament, to be there allowed of and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and receive the ſtamp of Authority, thereby to find paſſage and obedience through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>They have malitiouſly charged us that we intend to deſtroy and diſcourage Learning,
whereas it is our chiefeſt care and deſire to advance it, and to provide a competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for conſcionable and preaching Miniſters throughout the Kingdom, which will
be a great encouragement to Scholars, and a certain means whereby the want, meanneſs
and ignorance to which a great part of the Clergy is now ſubject will be prevented. And
we intend likewiſe to reform and purge the fountains of Learning, the two Univerſities,
that the ſtreams flowing from thence may be clear and pure, and an honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the whole Land.</p>
                     <p>They have ſtrained to blaſt our proceedings in Parliament, by wreſting the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Orders from their genuine intention. They tell the people, that our med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the power of Epiſcopacy hath cauſed Sectaries and Conventicles, when Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Popiſh Ceremonies introduced in the Church by the command of the Biſhops
have not only debarred the people from thence, but expelled them from the Kingdom.
Thus with <hi>El ah</hi> we are called by this malignant party the Troublers of the State; and
ſtill while we endeavour to reform their abuſes, they make us the Authors of thoſe
miſchiefs we ſtudy to prevent.</p>
                     <p>For the perfecting of the Work begun, and removing all future impediments, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60710:134"/>
theſe courſes will be very effectual: ſeeing the Religion of the Papiſts hath ſuch
Principles as do certainly tend to the deſtruction and extirpation of all Proteſtants, when
they ſhall have opportunity to effect it.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary in the firſt place to keep them in ſuch a condition as that they may not
be able to do us any hurt. And for avoiding of ſuch connivence and favour as hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been ſhewed unto them, that His Majeſty be pleaſed to grant a ſtanding Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſome choice men named in Parliament, who may take notice of their encreaſe,
their counſels and proceedings, and uſe all due means by execution of the Laws to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all miſchievous deſigns againſt the Peace and Safety of this Kingdom. That ſome
good courſe be taken to diſcover the counterfeit and falſe conformity of Papiſts to the
Church; by colour whereof perſons very much diſaffected to the true Religion have
been admitted into place of greateſt authority and truſt in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>For the better preſervation of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, that all illegal
Grievances and Exactions be preſented and puniſhed at the Seſſions and Aſſizes: and that
Judges and Juſtices be very careful to give this in charge to the Grand-Jury, and both
the Sheriff and Juſtices to be ſworn to the due execution of the Petition of Right and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laws. That His Majeſty be humbly petitioned by both Houſes, to employ ſuch
Counſellours, Ambaſſadours and other Miniſters in managing His buſineſs at home and
abroad, as the Parliament may have cauſe to confide in; without which we cannot give
His Majeſty ſuch Supplies for ſupport of His own eſtate, nor ſuch aſſiſtance to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
party beyond the Sea as is deſired. It may often fall out that the Commons may
have juſt cauſe to take exceptions at ſome men for being Counſellors, and yet not charge
thoſe men with crimes: for there be grounds of diffidence which lye not in proof; there
are others which, though they may be proved, yet are not legally criminal. To be a
known favourer of Papiſts, or to have been very forward in defending or countenancing
ſome great Offendors queſtioned in Parliament, or to ſpeak contemptuouſly of either
Houſe of Parliament or Parliamentary proceedings, or ſuch as are Factours or Agents
for any foreign Prince of another Religion, ſuch are juſtly ſuſpect to get Counſellours pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or any other of truſt concerning publick employment, for money. For all theſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others we may have great reaſon to be earneſt with His Majeſty, not to put His great
affairs into ſuch hands, though we may be unwilling to proceed againſt them in any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
way of charge or impeachment. That all Counſellours of State may be ſworn to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
thoſe Laws which concern the Subject in his Liberty. That they may likewiſe
take an Oath, not to receive or give reward or penſion from any foreign Prince, but ſuch as
they ſhall within ſome reaſonable time diſcover to the Lords of His Majeſties Council:
And although they ſhould wickedly forſwear themſelves, yet it may herein do good, to
make them known to be falſe and perjured to thoſe who employ them, and thereby bring
them into as little credit with them as with us. That His Majeſty may have cauſe to be
in love with good counſel and good men, by ſhewing Him in an humble and dutiful
manner how full of advantage it would be to Himſelf, to ſee His own eſtate ſettled in
a plentiful condition to ſupport His Honour; to ſee His people united in ways of Duty
to Him and endeavours of the publick good; to ſee Happineſs, Wealth, Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
derived to His own Kingdom, and procured to His Allies, by the Influence of His
own Power and Government. That all good courſes may be taken to unite the two
Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be mutually aiding and aſſiſting of one another for
the common good of the Iſland, and honour of both. To take away all differences amongſt
our ſelves for matters indifferent in their own nature concerning Religion; and to unite
our ſelves againſt the common enemies, which are the better enabled by our Diviſions to
deſtroy us all, as they hope, and have often endeavoured. To labour by all offices of
friendſhip to unite the foreign Churches with us in the ſame Cauſe, and to ſeek their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſafety and proſperity, as bound thereunto both by charity to them and by wiſdom for
our own good. For by this means our own ſtrength ſhall be encreaſed, and by a mutual
concurrence to the ſame common End we ſhall be enabled to procure the good of the
whole body of the Proteſtant profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>If theſe things may be obſerved, we doubt not but God will crown this Parliament with
ſuch ſucceſs as ſhall be the beginning and foundation of more Honour and Happineſs to
His Majeſty then ever yet was enjoyed by any of His Royal Predeceſſours.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WE having received from you, ſoon after Our return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a
long Petition, conſiſting of many deſires of great moment, together with
a Declaration of a very unuſual nature annexed thereunto, We had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſome time to conſider of it, as befitted Us in a matter of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
being confident that your own reaſon and regard to Us, as well as Our expreſs
intimation by Our Comptroller to that purpoſe, would have reſtrained you from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of it, till ſuch time as you ſhould have received Our Anſwer to it: But much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our expectation, finding the contrary, that the ſaid Declaration is already abroad in
Print by directions from your Houſe, as appears by the printed Copy, We are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the diſreſpect. Notwithſtanding, it is Our Intention that no failing on your part
ſhall make Us fail in Ours, of giving all due ſatisfaction to the deſires of Our People, in
a Parliamenatry way; and therefore We ſend you this Anſwer to your Petition, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Our ſelf in point of the Declaration, which We think unparliamentary, and ſhall
take a courſe to do that which We ſhall think fit in Prudence and Honour.</p>
                     <p>To the Petition We ſay, That although there are divers things in the Preamble of it
which We are ſo far from admitting, that We profeſs We cannot at all underſtand them,
as, <hi>Of a wicked and malignant party prevalent in the Government; of ſome of that party ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Our Privy Council, and to other Imployments of truſt, and neareſt to Vs and Our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
of endeavours to ſow among the People falſe Scandals and Imputations, to blemiſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the Proceedings of the Parliament;</hi> all or any of which did We know of, We ſhould
be as ready to remedy and puniſh as you to complain of: that the Prayers of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
are grounded upon ſuch Premiſes as we muſt in no wiſe admit: Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
We are pleaſed to give this Anſwer to you.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt, concerning Religion, conſiſting of ſeveral branches, We ſay, That for the
preſerving the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom from the deſigns of the Popiſh party,
We have, and will ſtill concur with all the juſt deſires of Our People in a Parliamentary
way. That for the depriving of the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament, We would have
you conſider, that their Right is grounded upon the Fundamental Law of the Kingdom
and conſtitution of Parliament. This We would have you conſider: but ſince you deſire Our
concurrence herein in a Parliamentary way, We will give no farther anſwer at this time.</p>
                     <p>As for the abridging of the inordinate power of the Clergy, We conceive that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the High-Commiſſion Court hath well moderated that: but if there continue
any Uſurpations or Exceſſes in their Juriſdictions, We therein neither have nor will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them.</p>
                     <p>Unto that Clauſe which concerneth Corruptions (as you ſtyle them) in Religion, in
Church-Government and in Diſcipline, and the removing of ſuch unneceſſary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as weak Conſciences might check at; That for any illegal Innovations which may
have crept in, We ſhall willingly concurr in the removal of them. That if Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall adviſe Us to call a National Synod, which may duely examin ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as give juſt cauſe of offence to any, We ſhall take it into conſideration, and apply
Our ſelf to give due ſatisfaction therein. But We are very ſorry to hear in ſuch general
terms Corruption in Religion objected, ſince We are perſwaded in Our Conſcience, that
no Church can be found upon the earth that profeſſeth the true Religion with more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Doctrine than the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, nor where the Government and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
are jointly more beautified and free from Superſtition then as they are here eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Law; which (by the grace of God) We will with Conſtancy maintain (while
We live) in their Purity and Glory, not only againſt all invaſions of Popery, but alſo
from the irreverence of thoſe many Schiſmaticks and Separatiſts wherewith of late this
Kingdom and this City abounds, to the great diſhonour and hazard both of Church and
State; for the ſuppreſſing of whom We require your timely and active aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond prayer of the Petition, concerning the removal and choice of Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
We know not any of Our Council to whom the Character ſet forth in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
can belong. That by thoſe whom We had expoſed to Trial, We have already given
you ſufficient teſtimony, that there is no man ſo near unto Us in place or affection whom
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60710:135"/>
We will not leave to the Juſtice of the Law, if you ſhall bring a particular charge and
ſufficient proofs againſt him; and of this We do again aſſure you: but in the mean time
We wiſh you to forbear ſuch general aſperſions as may reflect upon all Our Council,
ſince you name none in particular.</p>
                     <p>That for the choice of Our Counſellours and Miniſters of State, it were to debarr
Us that natural liberty all Free-men have: and as it is the undoubted right of the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> to call ſuch perſons to Our ſecret Counſels, to publick employment, and Our
particular ſervice, as We ſhall think fit; ſo We are and ever ſhall be very careful to make
election of ſuch perſons in thoſe places of truſt, as ſhall have given good teſtimonies of
their abilities and integrity, and againſt whom there can be no juſt cauſe of exception
whereon reaſonably to ground a diffidence: and to choices of this nature We aſſure you
that the mediation of the neareſt unto Us hath always concurred.</p>
                     <p>To the third prayer of your Petition, concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> We underſtand your deſire
of not alienating the forfeited lands thereof to proceed from your much care and love,
and likewiſe that it may be a Reſolution very fit for Us to take: but whether it be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to declare Reſolutions of that nature before the Events of a War be ſeen, that
We much doubt of. Howſoever, We cannot but thank you for this care, and your chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ingagement for the ſuppreſſion of that Rebellion; upon the ſpeedy effecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Glory of God in the Proteſtant Profeſſion, the ſafety of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> there, Our
Honour and that of the Nation, ſo much depends. All the Intereſts of this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo involved in that buſineſs, We cannot but quicken your affections therein, and ſhall
deſire you to frame your Counſels, and to give ſuch expedition to the Work, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thereof and the preſſures in point of Time require, and whereof you are put in mind
by the daily inſolence and increaſe of thoſe Rebels.</p>
                     <p>For Concluſion, your promiſe to apply your ſelves to ſuch courſes as may ſupport
Our Royal Eſtate with Honour and Plenty at home, and with Power and Reputation
abroad, is that which We have ever promiſed Our ſelf both from your Loyalties and
Affections, and alſo for what We have already done, and ſhall daily goe adding unto,
for the comfort and happineſs of Our People.</p>

it ſo very neceſſary (upon their obſervation of the preſent Diſtemper) to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the ſame, for the ſatisfaction of all Our loving Subjects, We have thought it very
ſutable to the duty of Our place, (with which God hath truſted Us) to do Our part to
ſo good a Work: in which we ſhall not think it below Our Kingly Dignity to deſcend
to any particular which may compoſe and ſettle the affections of Our meaneſt Subjects,
ſince We are ſo conſcious to Our Self of ſuch upright Intentions and Endeavours, and
only of ſuch, (for which We give God thanks) for the Peace and Happineſs of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in which the Proſperity of Our Subjects muſt be included, that We wiſh from Our
heart that even Our moſt ſecret Thoughts were publiſhed to their view and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Though We muſt confeſs We cannot but be very ſorry in this conjuncture of time
(when the unhappineſs of this Kingdom is ſo generally underſtood abroad) there ſhould
be ſuch a neceſſity of publiſhing ſo many Particulars, from which We pray no Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
may inſue that were not intended.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall in few words paſs over that part of the Narrative, wherein the Misfortunes
of this Kingdom from Our firſt entring to the Crown to the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are remembred in ſo ſenſible expreſſions: and that other which acknowledgeth
the many good Laws paſſed by Our Grace and Favour this Parliament, for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Our People; of which we ſhall only ſay thus much, That as We have not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to paſs any Bill preſented to Us by Our Parliament for redreſs of thoſe Grievances
mentioned in the Remonſtrance, ſo We have not had a greater Motive for the paſſing
thoſe Laws then Our own reſolution (grounded upon Our Obſervation and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſtate of Our Kingdom) to have freed Our Subjects for the future from thoſe
Preſſures which were grievous to them, if thoſe Laws had not been propounded, which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60710:136"/>
therefore We ſhall as inviolably maintain as We look to have Our own Rights preſerved,
not doubting but all Our loving Subjects will look on thoſe Remedies with that full
gratitude and affection, that even the memory of what they have formerly undergone by
the Accidents and neceſſities of thoſe times will not be unpleaſant to them: and poſſibly
in a pious ſenſe of God's bleſſing upon this Nation (how little ſhare ſoever We ſhall have
of the acknowledgment) they will confeſs they have enjoyed a great meaſure of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(even theſe laſt ſixteen years) both in Peace and Plenty, not only comparatively
in reſpect of their Neighbours, but even of thoſe times which were juſtly accounted
Fortunate.</p>
                     <p>The Fears and Jealouſies which may make ſome impreſſion in the minds of Our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
We will ſuppoſe may be of two ſorts; either for Religion, or Liberty and their Civil
Intereſts. The Fears for Religion may haply be, not only as Ours here eſtabliſhed may
be invaded by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party, but as it is accompanied with ſome Ceremonies, at
which ſome tender Conſciences really are or pretend to be ſcandalized; for of any other,
which have been uſed without any legal Warrant or Injunction, and already are or ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
may be aboliſhed, We ſhall not ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Religion, as there may be any ſuſpicion of favour or inclination to the
Papiſts, We are willing to declare to all the world, That as We have been from Our
Childhood brought up in, and practiſed the Religion now eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom,
ſo it is well known, We have (not contented ſimply with the Principles of Our Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
given a good proportion of Our time and pains to the examination of the grounds
of this Religion, as it is different from that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and are from Our Soul ſo fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
and aſſured that it is the moſt pure and agreeable to the Sacred Word of God of
any Religion now practiſed in the Chriſtian world, that as We believe We can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ſame by unanſwerable reaſons, ſo We hope We ſhould readily ſeal to it by the
effuſion of Our Blood, if it pleaſed God to call Us to that ſacrifice. And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be ſo acceptable unto Us as any propoſition which may contribute to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of it here, or the propogation of it abroad, being the only means to draw
down a Bleſſing from God upon Our ſelves and this Nation. And We have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unfortunate, if this profeſſion of Ours be wanting to Our People; Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
practice in Our own Perſon having always been (without oſtentation) as much
to the evidence of Our Care and Duty herein, as We could poſſibly tell how to expreſs.</p>
                     <p>For differences amongſt our ſelves for matters indifferent in their own nature concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Religion, We ſhall, in tenderneſs to any number of Our loving Subjects, very
willingly comply with the advice of Our Parliament, that ſome Law may be made for
the exemption of Tender Conſciences from puniſhment or proſecution for ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and in ſuch caſes which by the judgment of moſt men are held to be matters indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and of ſome to be abſolutely unlawful. Provided that this eaſe be attempted
and purſued with that modeſty, temper and ſubmiſſion, that in the mean time the
Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom be not diſturbed, the Decency and comelineſs of Gods
Service diſcountenanced, nor the pious, ſober and devout actions of thoſe Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who were the firſt labourers in the bleſſed Reformation, or of that time, be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal'd
and defamed. For We cannot without grief of heart, and without ſome Tax upon
Our Self and Our Miniſters for the not execution of Our Laws, look upon the bold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of ſome men, in printing of Pamphlets, in preaching and printing of Sermons, ſo
full of bitterneſs and malice againſt the preſent Government, againſt the Laws eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo full of Sedition againſt Our Self and the Peace of the Kingdom, that We are
many times amazed to conſider by what Eyes theſe things are ſeen, and by what Ears
they are heard. And therefore We have good cauſe to command, as We have done,
and hereby do, all Our Judges and Miniſters of Juſtice, Our Attorney and Sollicitor
General, and the reſt of Our learned Counſel, to proceed with all ſpeed againſt ſuch and
their Abettors, who either by writing or words have ſo boldly and maliciouſly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Laws, diſturbed the peace of the Commonwealth, and as much as in them lies,
ſhaken the very foundation upon which that Peace and Happineſs is founded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.
And We doubt not but all Our loving Subjects will be very ſenſible that this
buſie virulent demeanour, is a fit Prologue to nothing but Confuſion; and if not very
ſeaſonably puniſhed and prevented, will not only be a blemiſh to that wholſome Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
We intend, but an unſpeakable ſcandal and imputation even upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Religion of this Our Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Civil Liberties and Intereſt of Our Subjects We ſhall need to ſay the
leſs, having erected ſo many laſting Monuments of Our Princely and Fatherly care of
Our People in thoſe many excellent Laws paſſed by Us this Parliament, which in truth
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60710:136"/>
(with very much content to Our ſelf) We conceive to be ſo large and ample, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many ſober men have very little left to wiſh for.</p>
                     <p>We underſtood well the Right and pretences of Right We departed from in the
conſenting to the Bills of the Triennial Parliament, for the Continuance of this
preſent Parliament, and in the Preamble to the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage;
the matter of which having begot ſo many diſturbances in late Parliaments, We
were willing to remove, that no Intereſt of Ours might hereafter break that
correſpondence, abundantly contenting Our ſelf with an Aſſurance (which we ſtill
have) that We ſhould be repaired and ſupplyed by a juſt proportion of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Bounty, and Obedience of Our People. In the Bills for the taking away
the High-Commiſſion and Star-chamber Courts We believed We had given that
real ſatisfaction, that all jealouſies and apprehenſions of arbitrary preſſures under
the Civil or Eccleſiaſtical State would eaſily have been abandoned, eſpecially when
they ſaw all poſſible doubts ſecured by the viſitation of a Triennial Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and others of no mean conſideration, We had rather ſhould be valued
in the hearts and affections of Our People, then in any mention of Our own; not
doubting but as We have taken all theſe occaſions to render their condition moſt
comfortable and happy, ſo they will always, in a grateful and dutiful relation, be ready
with equal tenderneſs and alacrity to advance Our Rights and preſerve Our Honour,
upon which their own Security and ſubſiſtence ſo much depends. And We will beſo careful,
that no particular ſhall be preſented unto Us for the compleating and eſtabliſhing that
Security, to which We will not with the ſame readineſs contribute Our beſt aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Reſolutions be the effects of Our preſent Councils, (and We take God to
witneſs that they are ſuch, and that all Our loving Subjects may confidently expect
the benefit of them from Us) certainly no ill deſign upon the Publick can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſuch Reſolutions, neither will there be great cauſe of ſuſpicion of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
preferred by Us to degrees of Honour and places of Truſt and imployment
ſince this Parliament. And We muſt confeſs, that amongſt Our misfortunes We
reckon it not the leaſt, That having not retained in Our Service, nor protected any
one perſon againſt whom Our Parliament hath excepted during the whole ſitting of
it, and having in all that time ſcarce vouchſafed to any man an inſtance of Our
Grace and Favour, but to ſuch who were under ſome eminent character of Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongſt Our People, there ſhould ſo ſoon be any miſunderſtanding or jealouſie of
their Fidelity and uprightneſs, eſpecially in a time when We take all occaſions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that We conceive Our ſelf only capable of being ſerved by honeſt men and
in honeſt ways. However, if in truth We have been miſtaken in ſuch Our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the particular ſhall be no ſooner diſcovered to Us, either by Our own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
or other certain information, then We will leave them to publick Juſtice
under the marks of Our Diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>If notwithſtanding this any Malignant Party ſhall take heart, and be willing
to ſacrifice the Peace and Happineſs of their Country to their own ſiniſter ends
and ambitions, under what pretence of Religion and Conſcience ſoever; if they ſhall
endeavour to leſſen Our Reputation and Intereſt, and to weaken Our lawful Power
and Authority with Our good Subjects; if they ſhall go about, by diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the preſent Laws, to looſen the Bonds of Government, that all Diſorder and
Confuſion may break in upon Us; We doubt not but God in his good time will
diſcover them unto Us, and the wiſdom and courage of Our High Court of Parliament
joyn with Us in their ſuppreſſion and puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſaid all that We can to expreſs the clearneſs and uprightneſs of Our
Intenſions to Our People, and done all We can to manifeſt thoſe Intentions, We
cannot but confidently believe all Our good Subjects will acknowledge Our part to
be fully performed, both in Deeds paſt and preſent Reſolutions, to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
with Juſtice may be required of Us, and that their quiet and proſperity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
now wholly upon themſelves, and is in their own power, by yielding all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and due reverence to the Law, which is the inheritance of every Subject, and
the only ſecurity he can have for his Life, Liberty or Eſtate, and the which being
neglected or diſeſteemed (under what ſpecious ſhews ſoever) a great meaſure of
Infelicity, if not an irreparable Confuſion, muſt without doubt fall upon them. And We
doubt not it will be the moſt acceptable Declaration a King can make to His Subjects, that
for Our part We are reſolved not only duely to obſerve the Laws Our Self, but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them againſt what oppoſition ſoever, though with the hazard of Our Being.</p>
                     <p>And Our hope is, that not only the Loyalty and good Affections of all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60710:137"/>
Our loving Subjects will concur with Us in the conſtant preſerving a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between Us and and Our People, but at this time their own and Our Intereſt, and
compaſſion of the lamentable condition of Our poor Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> will
invite them to a fair Intelligence and Unity amongſt themſelves; that ſo We may
with one heart intend the relieving and recovering that unhappy Kingdom, where
thoſe barbarous Rebels practiſe ſuch inhumane and unheard-of Outrages upon Our
miſerable people, that no Chriſtian ear can hear without horrour, nor Story pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.
And as We look upon this as the greateſt affliction it hath pleaſed God to
lay upon Us; ſo Our unhappineſs is increaſed, in that by the Diſtempers at home
ſo early remedies have not been applyed to thoſe growing evils as the expectation
and neceſſity there requires: though for Our part, as We did upon the firſt notice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
Our Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> (where We then were) with that Rebellion, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their aid and aſſiſtance, and gave like ſpeedy intimation and recommendation
to our Parliament here; ſo ſince Our return hither, We have been forward to all
things which have been propoſed to Us towards that Work, and have lately Our Self of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
(by a Meſſage to Our Houſe of Peers, and communicated to Our Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons)
to take upon Us the care to raiſe ſpeedily ten thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Voluntiers for
that Service, if the Houſe of Commons ſhall declare that they will pay them.
Which particulars (We are in a manner) neceſſitated to publiſh, ſince We are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the Malice of ſome perſons hath whiſpered it abroad, That the no ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
advancing of this buſineſs hath proceeded from ſome want of alacrity in Us
to this great Work; whereas we acknowledge it a high crime againſt Almighty
God, and inexcuſable to Our good Subjects of Our three Kingdoms, if We did
not to the utmoſt imploy all Our powers and faculties to the ſpeedieſt and moſt
effectual aſſiſtance and protection of that diſtreſſed People.</p>
                     <p>And we ſhall now conjure all Our good Subjects (of what degree ſoever) by all
the Bonds of Love, Duty or Obedience, that are precious to good men, to joyn
with Us for the recovery of the Peace of that Kingdom, and the preſervation of the Peace
of this; to remove all their Doubts and Fears, which may interrupt their Affection to
Us, and all their Jealouſies and apprehenſions, which may leſſen their Charity to
each other: and then (if the Sins of this Nation have not prepared an inevitable
Judgment for us all) God will yet make Us a Great and a Glorious King over a Free
and Happy People.</p>

by the Ancient Cuſtomes, Laws and Statutes of this Realme, and ought to be
protected by Your Majeſty, quietly to attend and proſecute that great Service:</p>
                     <p>They humbly remonſtrate and proteſt before God, Your Majeſty, and the Noble Lords

                     <p>YOUR Majeſties moſt humble and faithful Subjects, the Lords and Commons in
Parliament, having nothing in their thoughts and deſires more pretious and of
higher eſteem (next to the Honour and immediate Service of God) then the juſt

very ſenſible of the great Diſtractions and Diſtempers, and of the imminent Dangers and
Calamities which thoſe Diſtractions and Diſtempers are like to bring upon Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and Your Subjects, all which have proceeded from the ſubtle Inſinuations, miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Practices, and evil Counſels of men diſaffected to God's true Religion, Your Majeſties
Honour and Safety, and the publick Peace and Proſperity of Your People; after a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obſervation of the Cauſes of thoſe Miſchiefs, do in all humility and ſincerity preſent
to Your Majeſty their moſt dutiful Petition and Advice, That out of your Princely Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for the eſtabliſhing Your own Honour and Safety, and gracious tenderneſs of the
welfare and ſecurity of Your Subjects and Dominioins, You will be pleaſed to grant and
accept theſe their humble Deſires and Propoſitions, as the moſt neceſſary effectual means,
through God's bleſſing, of removing thoſe Jealouſies and Differences which have unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
fallen betwixt You and Your People, and procuring both Your Majeſty and them
a conſtant courſe of Honour, Peace and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>I. That the Lords and others of Your Majeſties Privy Council, and ſuch great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Miniſters of State, either at home or beyond the ſeas, may be put from Your

                     <p>XII. That all the Judges and all Officers placed by approbation of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

former grants of the Subjects of this Kingdom to Your Majeſties Royal Predeceſſors. We
ſhall likewiſe put the Town of <hi>Hull</hi> into ſuch hands as Your Majeſty ſhall appoint with
the conſent and approbation of Parliament, and deliver up a juſt account of all the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine;
and chearfully imploy the uttermoſt of our power and endeavour in the real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

maintaining the Royal Honour, Greatneſs and Safety of Your Majeſty and Your Poſterity.</p>

                     <head>His MAJESTIES Anſwer to the Nineteen Propoſitions of both
Houſes of Parliament.</head>
                     <p>BEfore We ſhall give you Our Anſwer to your Petition and Propoſitions, We ſhall tell
you, that We are now clearly ſatisfied why the Method which We traced out to
you by Our Meſſage of the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and have ſince ſo often preſſed upon you as
the proper way to compoſe the Diſtractions of this Kingdom, and render it truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
hath been hitherto declined, and is at length thought fit to be looked upon; We now
ſee plainly (and deſire that you and all other Our good Subjects ſhould do ſo too) that the
Cabaliſts of this buſineſs have with great Prudence reſerved themſelves, until due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſhould be made for their Deſign.</p>
                     <p>If they had unſeaſonably vented ſuch Propoſitions as the Wiſdom and Modeſty of your
Predeceſſours never thought fit to offer to any of Our Progenitours, nor We in honour or
regard to our Regal Authority (which God hath entruſted Us with for the good of Our
People) could receive without juſt indignation, (and ſuch many of your preſent Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are) their hopes would ſoon have been blaſted, and thoſe Perſons to whom Offices,
Honours, Power and Commands were deſigned, by ſuch ill timing of their buſineſs would
have failed of their expectation, not without a brand upon the attempt. Therefore before
any of this nature ſhould appear, they have (certainly with great wiſdom in the conduct
of it) thought fit to remove a troubleſome Rub in their way, <hi>the Law:</hi> To this end (that
they might undermine the very foundations of it) a new Power hath been aſſumed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
and declare Laws without Us by extemporary Votes, without any Caſe judicially
before either Houſe, (which is in effect the ſame thing as to make Laws without Us;
Orders and Ordinances made only by both Houſes (tending to a pure Arbitrary power)
were preſſed upon the people as Laws, and their obedience required to them.</p>
                     <p>Their next ſtep was, to erect an upſtart Authority without Us, (in whom, and only in
whom, the Laws of this Realm have placed that Power) to command the <hi>Militia,</hi> (very
conſiderable to this their Deſign.) In further order to it they have wreſted from Us Our
Magazin and Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> and beſtrid Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> in his bold-faced Treaſon: they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60710:139"/>
have prepared and directed to the People unprecedented Invectives againſt Our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thereby (as much as lay in their power) to weaken Our juſt Authority and due
eſteem among them: they have as injuriouſly as preſumptuouſly (though We conceive by
this time Impudence it ſelf is aſhamed of it) attempted to caſt upon Us aſperſions of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of
nature, as if We had <hi>favoured a Rebellion in Our own Bowels:</hi> they have likewiſe
broached new Doctrine, <hi>That We are obliged to paſs all Laws that ſhall be offered to Vs by
both Houſes</hi> (howſoever Our own Judgment and Conſcience ſhall be unſatisfied with
them) a point of Policy as proper for their preſent buſineſs, as deſtructive to all Our
Rights of Parliament; and ſo with ſtrange ſhameleſneſs will forget a Clauſe in a Law ſtill
in force, made in the ſecond year of King <hi>H.</hi> 5. wherein both Houſes of Parliament do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<hi>That it is of the Kings Regality to grant or deny ſuch of their Petitions as pleaſeth
himſelf:</hi> they have interpreted Our neceſſary Guard, legally aſſembled for the Defence
of Us and our Childrens Perſons againſt a Traitour in open Rebellion againſt Us, to be <hi>with
intent to levie War againſt Our Parliament,</hi> (the thought whereof Our very Soul abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
thereby to render Us odious to Our People.</p>
                     <p>They have ſo awed Our good Subjects with Purſivants, long chargeable Attendance,
heavy Cenſures and illegal Impriſonments, that few of them durſt offer to preſent their
tenderneſs of Our Sufferings, their own juſt Grievances, and their ſenſe of thoſe violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Law, (the Birthright of every Subject of this Kingdom) though in an humble
Petition directed to both Houſes; and if any did, it was ſtifled in the Birth, called <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and burnt by the common Hangman.</p>
                     <p>They have reſtrained the Attendance of Our ordinary and neceſſary Houſhould-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and ſeized upon thoſe ſmall ſums of Money which Our Credit hath provided to buy
Us Bread, with Injunctions that none ſhall be ſuffered to be conveyed or retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Us to <hi>York,</hi> or any of Our Peers or Servants with us; ſo that (in effect) they have
blocked Us up in that County.</p>
                     <p>They have filled the ears of the People with the noiſe of Fears and Jealouſies, (though
taken up upon truſt) tales of Skippers, Salt-Fleets, and ſuch like; by which Alarms they
might prepare them to receive ſuch impreſſions as might beſt advance this Deſign when
it ſhould be ripe. And now it ſeems they think We are ſufficiently prepared for theſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pills, We are in a handſome Poſture to receive theſe <hi>Humble Deſires,</hi> (which probably
are intended to make way for a Superfoetation of a (yet) higher nature, (if We had not
made this diſcovery to you) for they do not tell Us this is all.) In them We muſt obſerve
that theſe Contrivers (the better to advance their true ends) diſguiſed as much as they
could their intents with a mixture of ſome things really to be approved by every honeſt
man, others ſpecious and popular, and ſome which are already granted by Us: All which
are cunningly twiſted and mixed with thoſe other things of their main Deſign of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and private Intereſt; in hope that at the firſt view every eye may not ſo clearly
diſcern them in their proper colours.</p>
                     <p>We would not be underſtood, that We intend to fix this Deſign upon both or either
Houſe of Parliament; We utterly profeſs againſt it, being moſt confident of the Loyalty,
good Affections and Integrity of the intentions of that great Body, and knowing well that
very many of both Houſes were abſent, and many diſſented from all thoſe particulars We
complain of. But we do believe, and accordingly profeſs to all the world, that the Malignity
of this Deſign (as dangerous to the Laws of this Kingdom, the Peace of the ſame, and the
Liberties of all Our good Subjects, as to Our Self and Our juſt Prerogative) hath procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the ſubtle Informations, miſchievous Practices and evil Counſels of ambitious
turbulent Spirits, diſaffected to God's true Religion and the Unity of the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
Our Honour and Safety, and the publick Peace and Proſperity of Our People, not
without a ſtrong influence upon the very actions of both Houſes. But how faulty ſoever
others are, We ſhall (with God's aſſiſtance) endeavour to diſcharge Our Duty with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs
of heart: and therefore ſince theſe Propoſitions come to Us in the name of both
Houſes of Parliament, We ſhall take a more particular notice of every of them.</p>
                     <p>If the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19. Demands had been writ and printed in a tongue unknown
to Us and Our People, it might have been poſſible We and they might have charitably
believed the Propoſitions to be ſuch as might have been in order to the ends pretended in
the Petition, (to wit) <hi>the eſtabliſhing of Our Honour and Safety, the Welfare and Security of Our
Subjects and Dominions, and the removing thoſe Jealouſies and Differences which are ſaid to have
unhappily fallen betwixt Vs and Our People, and procuring both Vs and them a conſtant courſe of
Honour, Peace and Happinſs.</hi> But being read and underſtood by all, We cannot but aſſure
Our Self that this Profeſſion joyned to theſe Propoſitions will rather appear a Mockery and
a Scorn; the Demands being ſuch, as We were unworthy of the Truſt repoſed in Us by the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60710:140"/>
Law, and of Our Deſcent from ſo many great and famous Anceſtours, if We could be
brought to abandon that Power which only can inable Us to perform what We are ſworn to,
in protecting Our People and the Laws, and ſo aſſume others into it, as to deveſt Our Self
of it; although not only Our preſent Condition (which it can hardly be) were more
neceſſitous then it is, and We were both vanquiſh'd and a Priſoner, and in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then ever the moſt unfortunate of Our Predeceſſours have been reduced to by the
moſt criminal of their Subjects; and though the Bait laid to draw Us to it, and to keep
Our Subjects from indignation at the mention of it, the promiſes <hi>of a plentiful and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
Revenue,</hi> were reduced from generals (which ſignifie nothing) to clear and certain
particulars: ſince ſuch a Bargain would have but too great a reſemblance of that of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s,
if We ſhould part with ſuch Flowers of Our Crown as are worth all the reſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and have been tranſmitted to us from ſo many Anceſtours, and have been found ſo
uſeful and neceſſary for the Welfare and Security of Our Subjects, for any preſent Neceſſity,
or for any low and ſordid conſiderations of Wealth and Gain. And therefore all men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that thoſe Accommodations are moſt eaſily made and moſt exactly obſerved that are
grounded upon reaſonable and equal Conditions, We have great cauſe to believe that the
Contrivers of theſe had no intention of ſetling any firm Accommodation, but to increaſe
thoſe Jealouſies, and widen that Diviſion which (not by Our fault) is now unhappily
fallen between Us and both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>It is asked, <hi>That all the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, and ſuch</hi> (We know now what
you mean by <hi>ſuch,</hi> but We have cauſe to think you mean <hi>all) great Officers and Miniſters
of State, either at home or beyond the Seas,</hi> (For care is taken to leave out no Perſon or Place,
that Our Diſhonour may be ſure not to be bounded within this Kingdom, though no
ſubtle Inſinuations at ſuch a diſtance can probably be believed to have been the cauſe of
our Diſtractions and Dangers) <hi>ſhould be put from our Privy Council, and from thoſe Offices
and imployments, unleſs they be approved by both Houſes of Parliament,</hi> how faithful ſoever
We have found them to Us and the publick, and how far ſoever they have been from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
againſt any Law, the only rule they had, or any others ought to have, to walk by.
We therefore to this part of this Demand return you this Anſwer, That We are willing to
grant that they ſhall take a larger Oath then you your ſelves deſire in your Eleventh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for maintaining not of any part, but of the whole Law; and We have, and do aſſure
you, That We will be careful to make election of ſuch Perſons in thoſe places of truſt, as
ſhall have given good teſtimonies of their abilities and integrities, and againſt whom there
can be no juſt cauſe of exception, whereon reaſonably to ground a diffidence: That if We
have or ſhall be miſtaken in Our election, We have and do aſſure you, that there is no
man ſo near to Us in place or affection, whom we will not leave to the Juſtice of the Law,
if you ſhall bring a particular charge and ſufficient proofs againſt him; and that We
have given you (the beſt pledge of the effects of ſuch a promiſe on Our part, and
the beſt ſecurity for the performance of their duty on theirs) <hi>a Triennial Parliament,</hi>
the apprehenſion of whoſe Juſtice will in all probability make them wary how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
it, and Us wary how We chuſe ſuch as by the diſcovery of their faults may in any
degree ſeem to diſcredit Our Election. But that without any ſhadow of a Fault objected,
only perhaps becauſe they follow their Conſcience, and preſerve the eſtabliſhed Laws, and
agree not in ſuch Votes, or aſſent not to ſuch Bills, as ſome perſons, who have now too
great an Influence even upon both Houſes, judge, or ſeem to judge, to be for the publick
good, and as are agreeable to that new <hi>Vtopia</hi> of Religion and Government into which they
endeavour to transform this Kingdom; (for We remember what names, and for what
Reaſons, you left out in the Bill offered Us concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> which you had your
ſelves recommended in the Ordinance) We will never conſent to the diſplacing of any
whom for their former Merits from, and Affection to Us and the publick, We have intruſted,
ſince We conceive that to do ſo, would take away both from the affection of Our Servants,
the care of Our Service, and the Honour of Our Juſtice. And We the more wonder
that it ſhould be ask'd by you of Us, ſince it appears by the Twelfth Demand, That your
ſelves count it reaſonable, after the preſent turn is ſerved, <hi>that the Judges and Officers who
are then placed may hold their places, quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> And We are reſolved to be as
careful of thoſe We have choſen, as you are of thoſe you would chuſe, and to remove
none, till they appear to Us to have otherwiſe behaved themſelves, or ſhall be evicted
by Legal proceedings to have done ſo.</p>
                     <p>But this Demand (as unreaſonable as it is) is but one link of a great Chain, and but
the firſt round of that Ladder by which Our Juſt, Ancient, Regal Power is endeavoured
to be fetched down to the ground. For it appears plainly, that it is not with the Perſons
now choſen, but with Our chuſing, that you are diſpleaſed: For you demand, <hi>That the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60710:140"/>
perſons put in the places and imployments of thoſe who ſhall be removed may be approved by both
Houſes;</hi> which is ſo far (as to ſome it may at the firſt ſight appear) from being leſs then the
power of nomination, that of two things (of which We will never grant either) We would
ſooner be content that you ſhould nominate and We approve, than you approve and we
nominate; the meer nomination being ſo far from being any thing, that if We could do no
more, We would never take the pains to do that, when We ſhould only hazard thoſe whom
We eſteemed to the ſcorn of a refuſal, if they happened not to be agreeable not only to the
Judgment, but to the Paſſion, Intereſt or Humour of the preſent major part of either Houſe.
Not to ſpeak now of the great factions, animoſities and diviſions which this power would
introduce in both Houſes, between both Houſes, and in the ſeveral Countries, for the choice
of perſons to be ſent to that place where that power was, and between the perſons that were
ſo choſen. Neither is this ſtrange Potion preſcribed to Us only for once, for the cure of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
preſſing, deſperate diſeaſe, but for a Diet to Us and Our Poſtetity: It is demanded,
<hi>That Our Counſellors, all Chief Officers both of Law and State, Commanders of Forts and Caſtles,
and all Peers hereafter made</hi> (as to voting, without which how little is the reſt?) <hi>be approved
of</hi> (that is, choſen) <hi>by them from time to time;</hi> and rather then it ſhould ever be left to the
Crown (to whom it onely doth and ſhall belong) <hi>if any place fall void in the intermiſſion of
Parliament, the major part of the approved Council is to approve them.</hi> Neither is it only deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that We ſhould quit the Power and Right our Predeceſſors have had of appointing
Perſons in theſe places, but for Counſellors We are to be reſtrained as well in the Number
as in the Perſons, and a power muſt be annext to theſe places which their Predeceſſors had
not: And indeed if this power were paſt to them, it were not fit We ſhould be truſted to
chuſe thoſe who were to be truſted as much as We.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is demanded,</hi> That ſuch matters as concern the publick, and are proper for the High Court of
Parliament, (<hi>Which is Our Great and Supreme Council</hi>) may be debated, reſolved and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted
only in Parliament, and not elſewhere; and ſuch as preſume to do any thing to the contrary
ſhall be reſerved to the Cenſure and Judgment of the Parliament: and ſuch other matters of State
as are proper for Our Privy Council, ſhall be debated and concluded by ſuch of Our Nobility (<hi>though
indeed, if being made by Us they may not vote without the Conſent of both Houſes, We are
rather to call them</hi> your <hi>Nobility</hi>) and others, as ſhall be from time to time choſen for that place
by approbation of both Houſes of Parliament: and that no publick Act concerning the affairs of the
Kingdom which are proper for Our Privy Council, may be eſteemed of any validity as proceeding
from the Royal Authority, unleſs it be done by the Advice and Conſent of the major part of Our
Council, atteſted under their hands. <hi>Which Demands are of that nature, that to grant them
were in effect at once to depoſe both Our Self and Our Poſterity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe being paſt, We may be waited on bare-headed; We may have our hand kiſt, the
ſtyle of Majeſty continued to Us, and the Kings Authority, declared by both Houſes of
Parliament, may be ſtill the ſtyle of your Commands; We may have Swords and Maces
carried before Us, and pleaſe Our Self with the ſight of a Crown and Scepter, (and yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
theſe Twigs would not long flouriſh, when the Stock upon which they grew were
dead:) but as to true and real Power We ſhould remain but the outſide, but the Picture,
but the Sign of a King. We were ever willing that Our Parliament ſhould debate, reſolve,
and tranſact ſuch matters as are proper for them, as far as they are proper for them:
and We heartily wiſh, that they would be as careful not to extend their Debates and
Reſolutions beyond what is proper to them, that multitudes of things puniſhable and
Cauſes determinable by the ordinary Judicatures may not be entertained in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo cauſe a long, chargeable, fruitleſs attendance of Our People, and (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees)
draw to you as well all the Cauſes as all the faults of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and divert your
proper Buſineſs: That the courſe of Law be no ways diverted, much leſs diſturbed, as was
actually done by the ſtop of the proceedings againſt a Riot in <hi>Southwark</hi> by Order of
the Houſe of Commons, in a time ſo riotous and tumultuous, as much increaſed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Popular Inſolencies by ſuch a countenance to Riots and diſcountenance of Law:
That you deſcend not to the leiſure of recommending Lecturers to Churches, nor aſcend
to the Legiſlative Power by commanding (the Law not having yet commanded it) that
they whom you recommend be received, although neither the Parſon nor Biſhop do
approve of them; and that the Refuſers (according to the courſe ſo much formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of to have been uſed at the Council Table) be not ſent for to attend to ſhew cauſe;
at leaſt that you would conſider Conveniency, if not Law, and recommend none but who
are well known to you to be Orthodox, Learned and Moderate, or at leaſt ſuch as have
taken Orders, and are not notorious depravers of the Book of Common-Prayer; a care
which appeareth by the Diſcourſes, Sermons and Perſons of ſome recommended by you,
not to have been hitherto taken, and it highly concerns both you in duty, and the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60710:141"/>
Commonwealth in the conſequences, that it ſhould have been taken: That neither one
Eſtate tranſact what is proper for two, nor two what is proper for three; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that (contrary to Our declared will) Our Forts may not be ſeized, Our Arms
may not be removed, Our Moneys may not be ſtop'd, Our legal Directions may not
be countermanded by you, nor We deſired to countermand them Our Self, nor ſuch
entrances made upon a real War againſt Us upon pretence of an imaginary War againſt
you, and a <hi>Chimoera</hi> of Neceſſity. So far do you paſs beyond your limits, whilſt you ſeem
by your Demand to be ſtrangely ſtreightned within them. At leaſt we could have wiſh'd
you would have expreſſed what matters you meant as <hi>fit to be tranſacted only in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and what you meant by <hi>only in Parliament.</hi> You have (of late) been perſwaded
by the new doctrines of ſome few, to think that proper for your debates which hath not
uſed to be at all debated within thoſe walls, but been truſted wholly with Our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
and Us, and to tranſact thoſe things which without the Regal Authority, ſince
there were Kings of this Kingdom, were never tranſacted: It therefore concerns us the
more that you ſpeak out, and that both We and Our People may either know the bottom
of your Demands, or know them to be bottomleſs. What concerns more the Publick, and
is more (indeed) proper for the high Court of Parliament, then the making of Laws?
which not only ought there to be tranſacted, but can be tranſacted no where elſe: but
then you muſt admit Us to be a part of the Parliament, you muſt not (as the ſenſe is
of this part of this Demand, if it have any) deny the freedom of Our Anſwer, when We
have as much right to reject what We think unreaſonable, as you have to propoſe what
you think convenient or neceſſary; nor is it poſſible Our Anſwers either to Bills or any
other Propoſitions ſhould be wholly free, if We may not uſe the Liberty of every one
of you, and of every Subject, and receive advice (without their danger who ſhall
give it) from any perſon known or unknown, ſworn or unſworn, in theſe matters in
which the manage of Our Vote is truſted by the Law to Our own judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
which how beſt to inform is (and ever ſhall be) left likewiſe to Us: and moſt
unreaſonable it were that two Eſtates propoſing ſomething to the third, that third ſhould
be bound to take no advice whether it were fit to paſs, but from thoſe two that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it. We ſhall ever in theſe things which are truſted wholly to Us by the Law, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to hearken to the Advice of Our great Council, and ſhall uſe to hear willingly the
free debates of Our Privy Council (whenſoever We may be ſuffered to have them for
ſending for, and they ſhall not be terrified from that freedom by Votes and Brands of
Malignants and Enemies to the State, for adviſing what no Law forbids to adviſe:) but
We will retain Our power of admitting no more to any Counſel then the nature of the
buſineſs requires, and of diſcourſing with whom We pleaſe, of what We pleaſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Our Underſtanding by debate with any Perſons, who may be well able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and adviſe Us in ſome particular, though their Qualities, Education or other Abilities
may not make them ſo fit to be of Our ſworn Council, and not tye Our Self up not to
hear any more then twenty five (and thoſe not choſen abſolutely by Us) out of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſo repleniſhed with Judicious and experienced Perſons in ſeveral kinds. And though
We ſhall (with the proportionable Conſideration due to them) always weigh the Advices
both of Our Great and Privy Council, yet We ſhall alſo look upon their Advices as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
not as Commands or Impoſitions; upon them as Our Counſellours, not as Our Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Guardians: and upon Our ſelf as their King, not as their Pupil or Ward. For
whatſoever of Regality were by the Modeſty of interpretation left in Us in the firſt part
of the Second Demand, as to the Parliament, is taken from Us in the ſecond part of the
ſame, and placed in this new-fangled kind of Counſellours, whoſe power is ſuch and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by it, that in all publick Acts concerning the Affairs of this Kingdom which are
proper for Our Privy Council (for whoſe Advice all publick Acts are ſometimes proper,
though never neceſſary) they are deſired to be admitted joynt-Patentees with Us in the
Regality, and it is not plainly expreſſed whether they mean Us ſo much as a ſingle Vote in
theſe Affairs: but it is plain they mean Us no more at moſt then a ſingle Vote in them, and
no more power then every one of the reſt of Our Fellow Counſellours; only leave to Us,
out of their reſpect and duty, (and that only is left of all Our ancient Power) a Choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe that are thus to be joyned with (or rather ſet over) Us ſhall be fifteen or twenty
five; and great care is taken that the Oath which theſe men ſhall take ſhall be ſuch, in the
framing the form of which (though ſure We are not wholy unconcerned in it) We may be
wholy excluded, and that wholy reſerved to be agreed upon by both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew that no more care is taken of Our Safety then of Our Power, after ſo
great Indignities offered to Us, and countenanced by thoſe who were moſt obliged to
reſent them, after Our Town and Fort kept from Us (from which, if it were no otherwiſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60710:141"/>
Ours then the whole Kingdom is, We can no more legally be kept out then out of Our
whole Kingdom, which ſure your ſelves will not deny to be Treaſon) Our Arms, Our
Goods ſent away, and our Money ſtopt from Us, Our Guards (in which We have no other
Intention then to hinder the End of theſe things from being proportionable to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings)
are not only deſired to be diſmiſſed before ſatisfaction for the Injury, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Injurers, and care taken for Our future Security from the like; but it is
likewiſe deſired, (and for this Law is pretended, and might as well have been for the
reſt, which yet with ſome ingenuity are it ſeems acknowledged to be but Deſires of Grace)
that We ſhall not for the future raiſe any Guards or extraordinary Forces but in caſe of
actual Rebellion or Invaſion: which if it had been Law, and ſo obſerved in the time of Our
famous Predeceſſours, few of thoſe Victories which have made this Nation famous in other
Parts could have been legally atchieved, nor could Our bleſſed Predeceſſour Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
have ſo defended Her ſelf in 88. And if no forces muſt be levied till Rebellions and Invaſions
(which will not ſtay for the calling of Parliaments, and their conſent for raiſing Forces) be
actual, they muſt undoubtedly (at leaſt moſt probably) be effectual and prevalent.</p>
                     <p>And as neither care is taken for Our Rights, Honour, nor Safety as a Prince, ſo Our Rights
as a Private perſon are endeavoured to be had from Us; it being asked, that it may be
unlawful and puniſhable, not only to <hi>conclude,</hi> but even to <hi>treat of any Marriage with any
Perſon for Our own Children, or to place Governours about them, without conſent of Parliament,
and in the intermiſſion of thoſe, without the conſent of Our good Lords of the Council;</hi> that We
may not only be in a more deſpicable ſtate then any of Our Predeceſſours, but in a meaner
and viler condition then the loweſt of Our Subjects, who value no Liberty they have
more then that of the free Education and Marriage of their Children; from which We
are asked to debar Our Self, and have the more reaſon to take it ill that We are ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
for Our choice of a Governour for Our Son, and of a Husband for Our Daughter,
(in which the Proteſtant Religion was Our principal Conſideration) We conceived We had
reaſon to expect your preſent thanks, and the increaſe of your future truſts.</p>
                     <p>We ſuppoſe theſe Demands by this time to appear ſuch, as the Demanders cannot be
ſuppoſed to have any ſuch real fear of Us as hath been long pretended, they are too much
in the ſtyle not only of Equals, but of Conquerours, and as little to be intended for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of Jealouſies (for which end they are ſaid to be asked, and that is not as Merchants
ask at firſt, much more then they will take, but as moſt neceſſary to effect it; which if
they be, God help this poor Kingdom, and thoſe who are in the hands of ſuch perſons
whoſe Jealouſies nothing elſe will remove:) which indeed is ſuch a way, as if there being
differences and ſuits between two perſons, whereof one would have from the other ſeveral
parcels of his ancient Land, he ſhould propoſe to him by way of Accommodation, that
he would quit to him all thoſe in queſtion, with the reſt of his Eſtate, as the moſt neceſſary
and effectual means to remove all thoſe ſuits and differences. But We call God to witneſs,
that as for our Subjects ſake theſe Rights are veſted in Us; ſo for their ſakes, as well
as for Our own, We are reſolved not to quit them, nor to ſubvert (though in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
way) the ancient, equal, happy, well-poiſed and never-enough-commended
Conſtitution of the Government of this Kingdom, nor to make Our Self of a King of
<hi>England</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and this of a Kingdom a Republick.</p>
                     <p>There being three kinds of Government amongſt men, abſolute Monarchy, Ariſtocracy
and Democracy, and all theſe having their particular conveniences and inconveniences,
the experience and wiſdom of your Anceſtors hath ſo moulded this out of a mixture of
theſe, as to give to this Kingdom (as far as humane Prudence can provide) the conveniences
of all three without the inconveniences of any one, as long as the Balance hangs even
between the three Eſtates, and they run joyntly on in their proper Chanel (begetting Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
and Fertility in the Meadows on both ſides) and the overflowing of either on either
ſide raiſes no Deluge or Inundation. The ill of abſolute Monarchy is Tyranny, the ill of
Ariſtocracy is Faction and Diviſion, the ills of Democracy are Tumults, Violence and
Licentiouſneſs. The good of Monarchy is the uniting a Nation under one Head to reſiſt
Invaſion from abroad, and Inſurrection at home: the good of Ariſtocracy is the
Conjunction of Counſel in the ableſt Perſons of a State for the publick benefit: the good
of Democracy is Liberty, and the Courage and Induſtry which Liberty begets.</p>
                     <p>In this Kingdom the Laws are joyntly made by a King, by a Houſe of Peers, and by
a Houſe of Commons choſen by the People, all having free Votes and particular Privileges.
The Government according to theſe Laws is truſted to the King; power of Treaties of
War and Peace, of making Peers, of chuſing Officers and Counſellours for State, Judges
for Law, Commanders for Forts and Caſtles, giving Commiſſions for raiſing men to make
War abroad, or to prevent or provide againſt Invaſions or Inſurrections at home, benefit
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60710:142"/>
of Confiſcations, power of Pardoning, and ſome more of the like kind are placed in the King.
And this kind of regulated Monarchy having this power to preſerve that Authority,
without which it would be diſabled to preſerve the Laws in their force, and the Subjects in
their Liberties and Proprieties, is intended to draw to Him ſuch a Reſpect and Relation
from the Great ones as may hinder the ills of Diviſion and Faction, and ſuch a Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
from the People as may hinder Tumults, Violence and Licentiouſneſs. Again, that
the Prince may not make uſe of this high and perpetual Pow'r to the hurt of thoſe for whoſe
good He hath it, and make uſe of the name of publick Neceſſity for the gain of His private
Favourites and Followers, to the detriment of His People, the Houſe of Commons (an
excellent Conſerver of Liberty, but <hi>never intended for any</hi> SHARE <hi>in</hi> GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT,
<hi>or the chuſing of them that ſhould</hi> GOVERN) is ſolely
intruſted with the firſt Propoſitions concerning the Levies of Monies (which is
the ſinews as well of Peace as War) and the impeaching of thoſe who for their own
ends, though countenanced by any ſurreptitiouſly-gotten Command of the King,
have violated that Law which He is bound (when He knows it) to protect, and to the
protection of which they were bound to adviſe Him, at leaſt not to ſerve Him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And the Lords being truſted with a Judicatory power, are an excellent Screen and
Bank between the Prince and People, to aſſiſt each againſt any Incroachments of the
other, and by juſt Judgments to preſerve that Law which ought to be the Rule of every
one of the Three. For the better enabling them in this, beyond the Examples of any of Our
Anceſtors, We were willingly contented to oblige Our Self bouth to call a Parliament eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
three years, and not to diſſolve it in fifty days, and for the preſent Exigent, the better
to raiſe Money, and avoid the preſſure (no leſs grievous to Us then them) Our People
muſt have ſuffered by a longer continuance of ſo vaſt a Charge as two great Armies,
and for their greater certainty of having ſufficient time to remedy the inconveniences
ariſen during ſo long an abſence of Parliaments, and for the puniſhment of the Cauſers
and Miniſters of them, We yielded up Our Right of diſſolving this Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
an extraordinary moderation from it in gratitude for ſo unexampled a Grace, and
little looking that any Malignant Party ſhould have been encouraged or enabled to have
perſwaded them, firſt to countenance the Injuſtices and Indignities We have endured,
and then by a new way of Satisfaction for what was taken from Us, to demand of Us
at once to confirm what was ſo taken, and to give up almoſt all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore the Power Legally placed in both Houſes is more then ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and reſtrain the power of Tyranny, and without the Power which is now asked from
Us We ſhall not be able to diſcharge that Truſt which is the End of Monarchy; ſince this
would be a total Subverſion of the Fundamental Laws, and that excellent Conſtitution
of this Kingdom which hath made this Nation ſo many years both Famous and Happy to
a great degree of Envy; ſince to the power of Puniſhing (which is already in your
hands according to Law) if the power of Preferring be added, We ſhall have nothing left
for Us but to look on; ſince the incroaching of one of theſe Eſtates upon the power of the
other is unhappy in the effects both to them and all the reſt; ſince this power of at moſt a
joynt-Government in Us with Our Counſellors, (or rather Our Guardians) will return Us
to the worſt kind of Minority, and make Us deſpicable both at home and abroad, and
beget eternal Factions and Diſſentions (as deſtructive to publick Happineſs as War) both
in the choſen, and the Houſes that chuſe them, and the People who chuſe the Chuſers; ſince
ſo new a Power will undoubtedly intoxicate perſons who were not born to it, and beget
not only Diviſions among them as Equals, but in them contempt of Us as become an
Equal to them, and Inſolence and Injuſtice towards Our People, as now ſo much their
Inferiors, which will be the more grievous unto them, as ſuffering from thoſe who were ſo
lately of a nearer degree to themſelves, and being to have redreſs only from thoſe that placed
them, and fearing they may be inclined to preſerve what they have made both out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and policy; ſince all great Changes are extremely inconvenient, and almoſt infallibly
beget yet greater Changes, which beget yet greater Inconveniences; ſince as great an one
in the Church muſt follow this of the Kingdom; ſince the Second Eſtate would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
follow the Fate of the Frſt, and by ſome of the ſame turbulent ſpirits Jealouſies would
be ſoon raiſed againſt them, and the like Propoſitions for reconciliation of Differences would
be then ſent to them as they now have joyned to ſend to Us, till (all Power being veſted in
the Houſe of Commons, and their number making them incapable of tranſacting Affairs of
State with the neceſſary Secrecy and Expedition, thoſe being re-truſted to ſome cloſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee)
at laſt the Common people (who in the mean time muſt be flattered, and to whom
Licence muſt be given in all their wilde humours, how contrary ſoever to eſtabliſhed
Law or their own real Good) diſcovering this <hi>Arcanum Imperii,</hi> That all this was done by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60710:142"/>
them, but not for them, grow weary of Journey-work, and ſet up for themſelves, call Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Independence Liberty, devour that Eſtate which had devoured the reſt, deſtroy all
Rights and Proprieties, all diſtinctions of Families and Merit, and by this means this
ſplendid and excellently diſtinguiſhed form of Government end in a dark equal <hi>Chaos</hi> of
Confuſion, and the long Line of Our many noble Anceſtors in a <hi>Jack Cade</hi> or a <hi>Wat Tyler:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For all theſe Reaſons to all theſe Demands Our Anſwer is, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari.</hi>
But this We promiſe, that We will be as careful of preſerving the Laws in what is
ſuppoſed to concern wholly Our Subjects, as in what moſt concerns Our Self. For
indeed We profeſs to believe that the preſervation of every Law concerns Us, thoſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
being not ſecure when thoſe of Protection are violated; and We being moſt of any
injured in the leaſt violation of that by which We enjoy the higheſt Rights and greateſt
Benefits, and are therefore obliged to defend no leſs by Our Intereſt then by Our Duty, and
hope that no Jealouſies to the contrary ſhall be any longer nouriſhed in any of Our good
People by the ſubtle inſinuations and ſecret practices of men, who for private ends are
diſaffected to Our Honour and Safety, and the Peace and Proſperity of Our People. And
to ſhew you that no juſt indignation at ſo reproachful offers ſhall make Us refuſe to grant
what is probable to conduce to the good of Our good People, becauſe of the ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it comes in, We will ſearch carefully in this heap of unreaſonable Demands for
ſo much as We may (complying with Our Conſcience and the Duty of Our Truſt)
aſſent unto, and ſhall accordingly agree to it.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of which Search, in the Fourth Propoſition, under a Demand which would
take from Us that Truſt which God, Nature, and the Laws of the Land have placed in
Us, and of which none of you could endure to be deprived, We find ſomething to
which We give this Anſwer; That We have committed the principal places about Our
Children to perſons of Quality, Integrity and Piety, with ſpecial regard that their tender
years might be ſo ſeaſoned with the Principles of the true Proteſtant Religion, as (by the
bleſſing of God upon this Our Care) this whole Kingdom may in due time reap the fruit
thereof. And as We have likewiſe been very careful in the choice of Servants about them that
none of them may be ſuch as by ill Principles or by ill Examples to croſs Our endeavours
for their Pious and Vertuous Education; ſo if there ſhall be found (for all Our care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it) any perſon about Our Children (or about Us, which is more then you ask) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom both Houſes</hi> ſhall make appear to Us <hi>any juſt exception,</hi> We ſhall not only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi>
them, but thank you for the Information: Only We ſhall expect, that you ſhall be
likewiſe careful that there be no under-hand dealing by any to ſeek faults, to make
room for others to Succeed in their places.</p>
                     <p>For the Fifth Demand, As We will not ſuffer any to ſhare with Us in our power of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are moſt improper for Parliaments, and leaſt in thoſe Treaties in which We
are nearlieſt concerned, not only as a King, but as a Father; yet We do (ſuch is Our
deſire to give all reaſonable ſatisfaction) aſſure you by the word of a King, that We
ſhall never propoſe or entertain any Treaty whatſoever for the Marriage of any of Our
Children, without due regard to the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, the good of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the Honour of Our Family.</p>
                     <p>For the Sixth Demand, concerning <hi>the Laws in force againſt Jeſuits, Prieſts and Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,</hi>
We have by many of Our Meſſages to you, by Our voluntary promiſe to you, ſo
ſolemnly made, never to pardon any Popiſh Prieſt, by Our ſtrict Proclamations lately publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in this point, and by the Publick Examples which We have made in that caſe ſince
Our Reſidence at <hi>York,</hi> and before at <hi>London,</hi> ſufficiently expreſſed Our zeal herein. Why do
you then ask that in which Our own Inclination hath prevented you? And if you can yet
find any more effectual Courſe to diſable them from diſturbing the State, or eluding the
Law by truſts or otherwiſe, We ſhall willingly give Our Conſent to it.</p>
                     <p>For the Seventh, concerning <hi>the Votes of popiſh Lords,</hi> We underſtand that they in diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have withdrawn themſelves from the Service of the Houſe of Peers, (and had done ſo
when uſe was publickly made of their Names to aſperſe the Votes of that Houſe, which was
then counted as Malignant as thoſe who are called <hi>Our unknown and Vnſworn Counſellors</hi> are
now.) Neither do We conceive that ſuch a Poſitive Law againſt the Votes of any whoſe
blood gives them that Right is ſo proper in regard of the Privilege of Parliament; but are
content, that ſo long as they ſhall not be conformable to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> they ſhall not be admitted to ſit in the Houſe of Peers, but only to give
their Proxies to ſuch Proteſtant Lords as they ſhall chuſe, who are to diſpoſe of them as
they themſelves ſhall think fit, without any reference at all to the giver.</p>
                     <p>As to the deſires for <hi>a Bill for the Education of the Children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in
the Proteſtant Profeſſion,</hi> many about Us can witneſs with Us, that we have often deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60710:143"/>
Our Opinion, that ſuch a courſe (with God's bleſſing upon it) would be the moſt
effectual for the rooting out of Popery out of this Kingdom; We ſhall therefore thank
you for it, and encourage you in it, and when it comes unto Us, do Our Duty: And
We heartily wiſh, for the publick good, that the time you have ſpent in making Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
without Us, had been imployed in preparing this and other good Bills for Us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the Eighth, touching</hi> the Reformation to be made of the Church-Government and Liturgy.
<hi>We had hoped, that what We had formerly declared concerning the ſame had been ſo
ſufficiently underſtood by you and all good Subjects, that We ſhould not need to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Our Self further in it. We told you in Our Anſwers to your Petition preſented to Us
at</hi> Hampton-Court <hi>the firſt of</hi> December, That for any illegal Innovations which may have crept
in, We ſhould willingly concurre in the removal of them; that if Our Parliament ſhould adviſe Vs
to call a National Synod, which may duely examine ſuch Ceremonies as give juſt cauſe of Offence
to any, We ſhould take it into Conſideration, and apply Our Self to give due ſatisfaction therein;
that We were perſwaded in Our Conſcience, that no Church could be found upon the Earth, that
profeſſeth the true Religion with more Purity of Doctrine then the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, nor
where the Government and Diſcipline are jointly more beautified, and free from Superſtition,
then as they are here eſtabliſhed by Law; which (by the Grace of God) We will with Conſtancy
maintain (while We live) in their Purity and Glory, not only againſt all Invaſions of Popery, but
alſo from the Irreverence of thoſe many Schiſmaticks and Separatiſts wherewith of late this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Our City of <hi>London</hi> abounds, to the great diſhonour and hazard both of Church and State;
for the ſuppreſſion of whom We required your timely and active aſſiſtance. <hi>We told you in Our firſt
Declaration, printed by the Advice of Our Privy Council,</hi> That for differences amongſt our
ſelves for matters indifferent in their own nature concerning Religion, We ſhould in tenderneſs to
any number of Our loving Subjects very willingly comply with the Advice of Our Parliament,
that ſome Law might be made for the exemption of tender Conſciences from puniſhment or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
for ſuch Ceremonies, and in ſuch Caſes, which by the judgment of moſt men
are held to be matters indifferent, and of ſome to be abſolutely unlawful: Provided, that
this eaſe ſhould be attempted and purſued with that modeſty, temper and ſubmiſſion, that
in the mean time the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom be not diſturbed, the Decency and Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of God's Service diſcountenanced, nor the Pious, Sober, Devout actions of thoſe Reverend
Perſons who were the firſt Labourers in the bleſſed Reformation, or of that time, be ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defamed. <hi>And we heartily wiſh, that others whom it concerned had been as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as their Duty bound them, (though they had not received it from Us) to have purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Caution as We were, and ſtill are willing and ready to make good every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of that Promiſe. Nor did we onely appear willing to joyn in ſo good a Work when
it ſhould be brought Us, but preſt and urged you to it by Our Meſſage of the fourteenth of</hi>
February <hi>in theſe words;</hi> And becauſe His Majeſty obſerves great and different troubles to
ariſe in the hearts of His People concerning the Government and Liturgy of the Church, His
Majeſty is willing to declare, That He will refer the whole conſideration to the wiſdom of His
Parliament, which he deſires them to enter into ſpeedily, that the preſent Diſtractions about the
ſame may be compoſed: but deſires not to be preſſed to any ſingle Act on His part, till the whole
be ſo digeſted and ſettled by both Houſes, that His Majeſty may clearly ſee what is fit to be left,
as well as what is fit to be taken away. <hi>Of which We the more hoped of a good ſucceſs to the
general ſatisfaction of Our People, becauſe you ſeem in this Propoſition to deſire but</hi> a
Reformation, <hi>and not (as is daily preached for as neceſſary in thoſe many Conventicles
which have within theſe nineteen months begun to ſwarm, and which, though their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
differ from you in this opinion, yet appear to many as countenanced by you, by not
being puniſhed by you; few elſe, by reaſon of the Order of the Houſe of Commons of
the</hi> 9th <hi>of</hi> September, <hi>daring to do it) a deſtruction of the preſent Diſcipline and Liturgy.
And We ſhall moſt chearfully</hi> give Our beſt aſſiſtance for raiſing a ſufficient maintenance for
Preaching Miniſters, <hi>in ſuch courſe as ſhall be moſt for the encouragement and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Piety and Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Bills you mention, and the Conſultation you intimate, knowing nothing of the
particular matters of the one (though We like the Titles well) nor of the manner of the
other, but from an Informer (to whom We give little credit, and We wiſh no man did
more) common Fame, We can ſay nothing till We ſee them.</p>
                     <p>For the Eleventh, We would not have the <hi>Oath of all Privy Counſellors and Judges</hi>
ſtreightned to particular Statutes of one or two particular Parliaments, but extend to
all Statutes of all Parliaments, and the whole Law of the Land; and ſhall willingly
conſent <hi>that an enquiry of all the breaches and violations of the Law may be given in charge
by the Juſtices of the Kings Bench every Term, and by the Judges of Aſſize in their Circuits,
and Juſtices of Peace at the Seſſions, to be preſented and puniſhed according to Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:60710:143"/>
For the Seventeenth, We ſhall ever be moſt ready, (and We are ſorry it ſhould be thought
needful to move Us to it) not only to join with any (particularly <hi>with the States of the
United Provinces,</hi> of which We have given a late proof in the Match of Our Daughter) <hi>for
the defence and maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion, againſt all deſigns and attempts of the
Pope and his Adherents;</hi> but ſingly (if need were) to oppoſe with Our Life and Fortune <hi>all
ſuch Deſigns</hi> in all other Nations, were they joyned: And that for Conſiderations of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
far more then any temporal end <hi>of obtaining acceſs of Strength and Reputation,</hi> or any
natural end <hi>of reſtoring Our Royal Siſter and her Princely Iſſue to their Dignities and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
though theſe be likewiſe much conſidered by Us.</p>
                     <p>For the Eighteenth, It was not Our fault that an Act was not paſſed <hi>to clear the Lord</hi>
Kimbolton <hi>and the Five Members of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> but yours, who inſerted ſuch
Clauſes into both the Preamble and Act (perhaps perſwaded to it by ſome who wiſh not
that you ſhould in any thing receive ſatisfaction from Us) as by paſſing the Preamble We
muſt have wounded Our Honour againſt Our Conſcience, and by another Clauſe have
admitted a Conſequence from which We could never have been ſecured, by declaring,
<hi>That no Member of either Houſe, upon any Accuſation of Treaſon, could have his Perſon ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
without the Conſent of that Houſe of which he is a Member;</hi> though the known Law be,
<hi>That Privilege of Parliament extends not to Treaſon,</hi> and if it did, any Member the Houſe
being for a ſhort time adjourned, and ſo their Conſent not being ſo had) how treaſonable
ſoever his Intentions were, how clearly ſoever known, and how ſuddenly ſoever to be
executed, muſt have fair leave given him to go on and purſue them, no way, how Legal
ſoever, after the paſſing ſuch a Clauſe, being left to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, We conjure you and all men to reſt ſatisfied with the Truth of Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
and the Reality of Our Intentions; not to ask ſuch things as deny themſelves;
that you declare againſt Tumults, and puniſh the Authors; that you allow Us Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in Our Towns, Arms and Goods, and Our ſhare in the Legiſlative Power, which
would be counted in Us not only breach of Privilege, but Tyranny and Subverſion of
Parliaments to deny to you: And when you ſhall have given Us ſatisfaction upon thoſe
Perſons who have taken away the one, and recalled thoſe Declarations (particularly that
of the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> and thoſe in the point of the <hi>Militia,</hi> Our juſt Rights wherein We will
no more part with then with Our Crown, leſt We enable others by them to take that
from Us) which would take away the other, and declined the beginnings of a War againſt
Us under pretence of Our Intention of making one againſt you; as We have never oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the firſt part of the Thirteenth Demand, ſo We ſhall be ready to concurre with you
in the latter.</p>
                     <p>And being then confident that the Credit of thoſe men who deſire a general Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will be ſo weakned with you, that they will not be able to do this Kingdom any more
harm, We ſhall be willing to grant Our general Pardon, with ſuch Exceptions as ſhall be
thought fit, and ſhall receive much more joy in the hope of a full and conſtant Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Our People in the True Religion, and under the Protection of the Law, by a
bleſſed Union between Us and Our Parliament (ſo much deſired by Us) then in any ſuch
increaſe of Our own Revenue (how much ſoever beyond former Grants) as (when Our
Subjects were wealthieſt) Our Parliament could have ſettled upon Us.</p>

Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, they will no longer be captivated by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
Reverence to the name of both Houſes of Parliament, but will carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and conſider what number of perſons are preſent, and what perſons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
in thoſe Conſultations, and how the Debates are probably managed from whence
ſuch horrid and monſtrous Concluſions do reſult; and will, at leaſt, weigh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
Wiſdom and Affection of thoſe who are notoriouſly known, out of the very
horrour of their Proceedings, to have withdrawn themſelves, or by their skill and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to be driven from them and their Counſels.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt their Fears and Jealouſies did ariſe, or were infuſed into the people from
Diſcourſes of the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Skippers at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> of Forces from <hi>Denmark,
France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> (how improbable and ridiculous ſoever that bundle of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
appeared to all wiſe and knowing men) it is no wonder if the eaſineſs to deceive,
and the willingneſs to be deceived did prevail over many of Our weak Subjects, to
believe that the Dangers which they did not ſee might proceed from Cauſes which
they did not underſtand: But for them to declare to all the world, That We intend
to make War againſt Our Parliament, (whileſt We ſit ſtill, complaining to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
of the Injury offered to Us and to the very Being of Parliaments) and that We
have already begun actually to levy Forces both of Horſe and Foot (whileſt We have
only, in a Legal way, provided a ſmaller Guard for the ſecurity of Our own Perſon
ſo near a Rebellion at <hi>Hull,</hi> than they have had, without lawful Authority, above theſe
eight Months upon imaginary and impoſſible Dangers) to impoſe upon Our peoples
Senſe as well as Underſtanding, by telling them We are doing that which they ſee
We are not doing, and intending that they all know (as much as Intentions can
be known) We are not intending, is a boldneſs agreeable to no power, but the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence
of thoſe Votes whoſe abſolute Supremacy hath almoſt brought Confuſion
upon King and People, and againſt which no Knowledge in matter of Fact, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and Authority in matter of Law, they will endure ſhall be oppoſed.</p>
                     <p>We have upon all occaſions with all poſſible Expreſſions profeſſed Our faſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken
Reſolutions for Peace. And We do again (in the preſence of Almighty
God, Our Maker and Redeemer) aſſure the World, that We have no more thought
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60710:145"/>
of making a War againſt Our Parliament than againſt Our own Children; that We
will maintain and obſerve the Acts aſſented to by Us this Parliament without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
(of which that for the frequent aſſembling of Parliaments is one;) and that
We have not, or ſhall not have any thought of uſing any force, unleſs We ſhall be
driven to it for the ſecurity of Our Perſon, and for the defence of the Religion, Laws
and Liberty of the Kingdom, and the juſt Rights and Privileges of Parliament. And
therefore We hope the Malignant Party, who have ſo much deſpiſed Our Perſon
and uſurped Our Office, ſhall not by their ſpecious fraudulent inſinuations prevail
with Our good Subjects to give credit to their wicked Aſſertions, and ſo to contribute
their Power and Aſſiſtance for the ruine and deſtruction of Us and themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For Our Guard about Our Perſon, (which not ſo much their Example as their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
inforced Us to take) 'tis known, it conſiſts of the prime Gentry (in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and Reputation) of this County, and of one Regiment of Our Trained Bands,
who have been ſo far from offering any Affronts, Injuries or Diſturbance to any of
Our good Subjects, that their principal end is to prevent ſuch; and ſo may be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
can be no Grievance to our People. That ſome ill affected perſons, or any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
have been employed in other parts to raiſe Troops under colour of Our Service,
or have made large (or any) offers of Reward and Preferment to ſuch as will come in, is,
for ought We know, and as We believe, an Untruth deviſed by the Contrivers of this
falſe Rumour; We diſavow it, and are confident there will be no need of ſuch Art or
Induſtry to induce Our loving Subjects, when they ſhall ſee Us oppreſſed, and their
Liberties and Laws confounded (and till then We ſhall not call on them) to come in
to Us and to aſſiſt Us.</p>
                     <p>For the Delinquents whom We are ſaid with a high and forcible hand to protect,
let them be named, and their Delinquency, and if We give not ſatisfaction to Juſtice,
when We ſhall have received ſatisfaction concerning Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> by his legal
Trial, then let Us be blamed. But if the Deſign be (as it is well known to be)
after We have been driven by force from Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and kept by force from
Our Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> to protect all thoſe who are Delinquents againſt Us, and to make
all thoſe Delinquents who attend on Us or execute Our lawful Commands, We
have great reaſon to be ſatisfied in the Truth and Juſtice of ſuch Accuſation, leſt to
be Our Servant and to be a Delinquent grow to be terms ſo convertible, that in a
ſhort time We be left as naked in Attendance as they would have Us in Power, and
ſo compel Us to be waited on only by ſuch whom they ſhall appoint and allow, and in
whoſe preſence We ſhould be more miſerably alone than in Deſolation it ſelf. And if
the ſeditious Contrivers and Fomenters of this Scandal upon Us ſhall have (as they
have had) the power to miſ-lead the major part preſent of either or both Houſes, to
make ſuch Orders and ſend ſuch Meſſages and Meſſengers as they have lately done,
for the apprehenſion of the great Earls and Barons of <hi>England,</hi> as if they were Rogues
or Felons, and whereby Perſons of Honour and Quality are made Delinquents merely
for attending upon Us and upon Our Summons, whilſt other men are forbid to come
near Us (though obliged by the Duty of their Places and Oaths) upon Our lawful
Commands; 'tis no wonder if ſuch Meſſengers are not very well intreated, and ſuch
Orders not obeyed: Neither can there be a ſurer and a cunninger way found out
to render the Authority of both Houſes ſcorned and vilified, than to aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(merely upon the Authority of the Name of Parliament) a power monſtrous
to all Underſtandings, and to do Actions and to make Orders evidently and demonſtrably
contrary to all known Law and Reaſon, (as to take up Arms againſt Us, under colour of
defending Us; to cauſe Money to be brought in to them, and to forbid Our own Money
to be paid to Us or to Our uſe, under colour that We will imploy it ill; to beat Us and
ſtarve Us for Our own good, and by Our own Power and Authority) which muſt in
ſhort time make the greateſt Court and the greateſt Perſon cheap and of no eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>Who thoſe ſenſible men are of the publick Calamities, of the Violations of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of Parliament, and the Common Liberty of the Subject, who have been baffled
and injured by Malignant men and Cavaliers about Us, We cannot imagine: And if
thoſe Cavaliers are ſo much without the fear of God and Man, and ſo ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all manner of Outrage and Violence as is pretended, Our Government ought
to be the more eſteemed, which hath kept them from doing ſo, inſomuch as We
believe no Perſon hath cauſe to complain of any injury or of any damage in the leaſt
degree by any man about, or who hath offered his ſervice to Us. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duly conſidered, if the Contrivers of theſe Propoſitions and Orders had been
truly ſenſible of the Obligation which lies upon them in Honour, Conſcience and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60710:145"/>
Duty, according to the high Truſt repoſed in them by Us and Our People, they would
not have publiſhed ſuch a ſenſe and apprehenſion of imminent Danger, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their Conſciences know, that the greateſt, and indeed only, Danger which
threatens this Church and State, the bleſſed Religion and Liberty of Our People, is in
their own deſperate and ſeditious Deſigns; and would not endeavour upon ſuch weak
and groundleſs Reaſons to ſeduce Our good Subjects from their Affection and Loyalty
to Us, to run themſelves into Actions unwarrantable, and deſtructive to the Peace
and Foundation of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>And that all Our loving Subjects may ſee how cauſleſs and groundleſs this ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Rumour and Imputation of Our raiſing War upon Our Parliament is, We have,
with this Our Declaration, cauſed to be printed the Teſtimony of thoſe Lords
and other Perſons of Our Counſel who are here with Us, who being upon the place,
could not but diſcover ſuch Our Intentions and Preparations, and cannot be ſuſpected
for their Honours and their Intereſts to combine in ſuch miſchievous and horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.
And therefore We ſtreightly charge and command all Our loving Subjects
upon their Allegiance, and as they will anſwer the contrary at their peril, That they
yield no Obedience or Conſent to the ſaid Propoſitions and Orders, and that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
not, under any ſuch Pretences, or by colour of any ſuch Orders, to Raiſe or Levy
any Horſe or Men, or to bring in any Money or Plate to ſuch purpoſe. But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this clear Declaration and Evidence of Our Intentions, theſe men (whoſe
Deſign is to compell Us to raiſe War upon Our Parliament, which all their Skill and
Malice ſhall never be able to effect) ſhall think fit by theſe Alarms to awaken Us
to a more neceſſary care of the defence of Our Self and Our People, and ſhall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(under colour of Defence) in ſo unheard-of a manner provide (and ſeduce
others to do ſo too) to offend Us, having given Us ſo lively teſtimony of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
what they are willing to do, when they have once made themſelves able, all
Our good Subjects will think it neceſſary to look to Our Self: and We do then excite
all Our well-Affected people, according to their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy,
and according to their ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation (whereby they are obliged to
defend Our Perſon, Honour and Eſtate) to contribute their beſt Aſſiſtance to the
Preparations neceſſary for the oppoſing and ſuppreſſing of the Traitorous Attempts of
ſuch wicked and Malignant perſons, who would deſtroy Our Perſon, Honour and
Eſtate, and ingage the whole Kingdom in a Civil War, to ſatisfie their own lawleſs
Fury and Ambition, and ſo rob Our good Subjects of the bleſſed fruit of this preſent
Parliament; which they already in ſome degree have, and might ſtill reap, to the
abundant ſatisfaction and joy of the whole Kingdom, if ſuch wicked hands were not
ready to ruine all their poſſeſſion, and fruſtrate all their hopes.</p>
                     <p>We do therefore declare, That whoſoever, of what degree or quality ſoever,
ſhall then, upon ſo urgent and viſible neceſſity of Ours, and ſuch an apparent Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Kingdom (cauſed and begotten by the Malice and Contrivance of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Party) bring in to Us, and to Our uſe, ready Money or Plate, or ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>write
to furniſh any number of Horſe, Horſemen and Arms, for the preſervation of
the publick Peace, the defence of Our Perſon, and the vindication of the Privilege
and Freedom of Parliament, We ſhall receive it as a moſt acceptable Service, and as
a teſtimony of his ſingular Affection to the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws, Liberties
and Peace of the Kingdom, and ſhall no longer deſire the continuance of that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
than We ſhall be ready to juſtifie and maintain thoſe with the hazard of
Our Life.</p>
                     <p>And We do farther declare, That whoſoever ſhall then bring in any ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Plate to aſſiſt Us in this great Extremity, ſhall receive conſideration after the
rate of eight pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> for all ſuch Moneys as he ſhall furniſh Us withall, and
ſhall, upon the payment of ſuch Money to ſuch perſons whom We ſhall appoint to
receive the ſame, receive Security for the ſame, by good lawful Aſſurance of ſuch of
Our Lands, Foreſts, Parks and Houſes, as ſhall be ſufficient for the ſame, and more
real Security than the name of <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> given without Us and againſt Us, as if
We were no part of the Publick; and beſides, We ſhall always look upon it as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
moſt affectionately and ſeaſonably performed for the preſervation of Us and the
Kingdom. But We ſhall be much gladder that their ſubmiſſion to thoſe Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and their deſiſting from any ſuch attempts of raiſing Horſe or Men, may eaſe
all Our good ſubjects of that trouble, charge and vexation.</p>

By the King.</head>
                     <head type="sub">A Proclamation forbidding all Levies of Forces without his MAJESTY's expreſs
Pleaſure ſignified under His Great Seal, and all Contributions or Aſſiſtance to
any ſuch Levies.</head>
                     <p>WHereas, under pretence that We intend to make War againſt the Parliament
(the contrary whereof is notoriouſly known to all that are here, and as We
hope by this time apparent to all other Our Subjects, as well by Our Declaration of
the ſixteenth of <hi>June,</hi> as by the Teſtimony of all Our Nobility and Council who are
here upon the place) and by colour of the Authority of both Houſes of Parliament
(a major part whereof are now abſent from <hi>London</hi>) by the contrivance of ſome few
evil perſons, diſguiſing and colouring their pernicious Deſigns and hoſtile Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under the plauſible names of, <hi>the preſervation of publick Peace, and defence of
Vs and both Houſes of Parliament from Force and violence,</hi> it hath been endeavoured
to raiſe Troops of Horſe and other Forces.</p>
                     <p>And for that purpoſe they have prevailed, not only to prohibit Our own Moneys
to be paid to Us or to Our uſe, but, by the Name and Authority of Parliament,
to excite Our Subjects to contribute their Aſſiſtance to them, by bringing in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
Plate, or under-writing to furniſh and maintain Horſes, Horſemen and Arms;
and to that purpoſe certain Propoſitions or Orders (as they are ſtyled by them) have
been printed, whereby they have endeavoured to engage the Power and Authority of
Parliament (as if the two Houſes without Us had that Power and Authority) to
ſave harmleſs all thoſe that ſhall ſo contribute, from all Prejudice and Inconvenience that
may befall them by occaſion thereof;</p>
                     <p>And although We well hope that theſe Malignant perſons (whoſe Actions do
now ſufficiently declare their former Intentions) will be able to prevail with few
of Our good People to contribute their Power or Aſſiſtance unto them: Yet leſt
any of Our Subjects, taking upon truſt what thoſe men affirm without weighing
the grounds of it, or the danger to Us, themſelves and the Commonwealth which
would enſue thereupon, ſhould indeed believe (what theſe perſons would inſinuate,
and have them to believe) that ſuch their Contribution and Aſſiſtance would tend
to the preſervation of the publick Peace and the Defence of Us and both Houſes of
Parliament, and that thereby they ſhould not incur any danger;</p>
                     <p>We, that We might not be wanting (as much as in Us lyeth) to foreſhew and
to prevent the danger which may fall thereupon, have hereby thought good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and publiſh unto all Our loving Subjects, That by the Laws of the Land, the
power of raiſing of Forces or Arms, or levying of War for the defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or otherwiſe, hath always belonged to Us, and to Us only; and that by no Power
of either or both Houſes of Parliament, or otherwiſe, contrary to Our perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
any Forces can be raiſed or any War levied.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, by the Statute of the ſeventh year of Our famous Progenitor King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, whereas there had been then ſome variances betwixt Him and
ſome great Lords of the Realm, and upon Treaty thereupon, it was agreed, that in
the next Parliament after proviſion ſhould be made, that in all Parliaments and all other
Aſſemblies which ſhould be in the Kingdom for ever, every man ſhould come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Force and Armour, well and peaceably: yet at the next Parliament, when they
met together to take advice of this Buſineſs, (though it concerned the Parliament
it ſelf) the Lords and Commons would not take it upon them, but anſwered,
That it belonged to the King to defend force of Armour, and all other force
againſt the Peace, at all times when it pleaſed Him, and to puniſh them which
ſhould do contrary, according to the Laws and Uſages of the Realm; and that they
were bound to aid Him, as their Sovereign Lord, at all ſeaſons when need ſhould be.
And accordingly in Parliament in after-times, the King alone did iſſue His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
prohibiting bearing of Arms by any perſon in or near the City where
the Parliament was, excepting ſuch of the Kings Servants as He ſhould depute,
or ſhould be deputed by His Commandment, and alſo excepting the Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
And by the Statute of <hi>Northampton,</hi> made in the ſecond year of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third, it is enacted, That no man, of what condition ſoever he be, (except the
Kings Servants, in His preſence, and His Miniſters in executing the Kings Precepts,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60710:147"/>
or of their Office, and ſuch as be in their company aſſiſting them) go nor ride armed
by night or day in Fairs, Markets, nor in the preſence of the Juſtices or other Miniſters,
nor in no part elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>And this power of raiſing Forces to be ſolely in the King, is ſo known and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Right to the Crown, that when, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, there
being a ſudden Rebellion, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> without Warrant from the King,
did raiſe Arms for the ſuppreſſion thereof, and happily ſuppreſſed it, yet was he
forced to obtain his Pardon. And whereas the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and other great
Lords in the eleventh year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second (upon pretence of the good of
the King and Kingdom, the King being then not of age, and led away, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
by evil Counſellors) did raiſe Forces, and by them maſtered their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
in that Parliament (ſuch as it was, for it was held and kept with force, how
good uſe ſoever hath been made of the Precedents therein) they procured a ſpecial
Act of Pardon for their raiſing of Men, and that thoſe Aſſemblies ſhould not be drawn
into example for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>And as no Man can levy War or raiſe Forces without the King, ſo much leſs againſt
the perſonal Commands of the King oppoſed thereunto. For by the Statute of the 25.
year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third (which is but declaratory of the old Law in that
point) it is Treaſon to levy War againſt the King in His Realm: Within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of which Statute, it is true (which was ſaid in the late Declaration under
the name of both Houſes of Parliament, of the 26. of <hi>May</hi> laſt) levying War (in
ſome ſenſe) againſt the King's Authority (though not intended againſt His Perſon)
is levying War againſt the King. And therefore the raiſing of Forces, though upon
pretence of removing of ſome evil Counſellors from about the Queen, hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Treaſon in the Caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and in divers other Caſes. (And We wiſh all Our Subjects to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if Men ſhall be raiſed contrary to Our Proclamation and againſt Our Will, it be
not againſt Our Authority.) But it is as true (and was never denied but in that
Declaration) that the raiſing of Forces againſt the King's perſonal Command (being
no Ideot nor Infant, uncapable of underſtanding to Command) being accompanied
with His Preſence, is, and is moſt properly, levying of War againſt the King. For
if it be a ſufficient pretence for raiſing of Men againſt the King's Perſon, that it is for
the defence of the King's Authority and of His Kingdom (though againſt His expreſs
Command and Proclamation) the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels will have colour for their horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
for they ſay (though it be notoriouſly falſe) it is for the defence of the
King's Authority and of His Kingdom. And <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Jack Cade</hi> and <hi>Kett</hi> the
Tanner wanted not publick Pretences, which were perhaps juſt cauſes of Complaints,
though not of raiſing of Men.</p>
                     <p>And though theſe perſons have gone about ſubtilly to diſtinguiſh betwixt Our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Our Authority, as if, becauſe Our Authority may be where Our Perſon is
not, that therefore Our Perſon may be where Our Authority is not; We require all
Our good Subjects to take notice of the Law, (which is in print and full force)
<note n="*" place="margin">Cook 7. <hi>Report.</hi> Calvin's <hi>Caſe.</hi>
                        </note>
 That their Allegiance is due unto the natural Perſon of their Prince, and not to His
Crown or Kingdom diſtinct from His natural Capacity; and that by the Oath of
Ligeance at the Common Law (which all perſons above the age of twelve years
are, or ought to be, ſworn unto) they are bound to be true and faithful, not to the
King only as King, but to Our Perſon as King CHARLES, and to bear Us truth
and faith of Life and Member, and earthly Honour; and that they ſhall neither know
nor hear of any ill or damage intended to Us that they ſhall not defend: And that
when, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> being diſcontented with
the King, cauſed a Bill to be written, wherein was contained amongſt other things,
That Homage and the Oath of Allegiance was more by reaſon of the King's Crown
(that is, His Kingdom) than of His Perſon; and that ſeeing the King cannot be
reformed by ſuit of Law, if the King will not redreſs and put away that which is ill
for the Common People and hurtful to the Crown, that the thing ought to be put
away by force, and that His Lieges be bound to Govern in aid of Him and in default
of Him; he was condemned for it by two Parliaments, and perpetually baniſhed the
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>We have made mention of theſe Caſes, not ſo much to clear Our Right, that We
alone have the power of raiſing Forces, and none of Our Subjects, either in Parliament
or out of Parliament, againſt Our Will or perſonal Command (which We think no
Man that hath the leaſt knowledge in Our Laws, and is not led away by private
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60710:147"/>
Intereſts, and may ſpeak his mind freely, will deny, nor was ever queſtioned in any
Parliament before this time) as to let them ſee how dangerous the effect and conſequence
of raiſing of Forces without Us may be unto Us and to the Commonwealth, under
pretence of Defence of both.</p>
                     <p>And though We cannot doubt of the Affections of Our good Subjects, conſidering
their Intereſt is involved with Ours, and how precious the Peace of the Kingdom is,
and ought to be unto them; and that, according to the words of the Statute of the
eleventh year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh and the eighteenth Chapter, by the duty
of their Allegiance they are bounden to ſerve and aſſiſt Us at all ſeaſons when need
ſhall require:</p>
                     <p>Yet, to the end that Our good Subjects may know what their Duty is, and what
We expect from them, and that all others, who, through Malice or private Intereſts,
ſhall be tranſported beyond their Duties, may be left without excuſe; We do therefore
by this Our Proclamation charge and command all Our Subjects upon their Allegiance,
and as they tender Our Honour and Safety, and the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom,
that they preſume not to raiſe or levy any Horſes, Horſmen, or Arms, or any Forces
whatſoever, by colour of any Authority whatſoever, without Our expreſs pleaſure ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
under Our great Seal, (other than ſuch as ſhall be raiſed, levied and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

contracted all their Falſhood, Inſolence and Malice; there being in it not one period
which is not either Slanderous or Treaſonable. And nothing can more grieve Us,
than that by their infinite Arts and Subtilty (employed by their perpetual and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
Induſtry) and by that Rabble of <hi>Browniſts</hi> and other <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> declaredly
ready to appear at their Call, they ſhould have been able ſo to draw away ſome, and
drive away others of Our good Subjects from Our Parliament, as to prevail with the
major part remaining of both Houſes, (how much ſoever that major part be the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in compariſon of the whole) to ſuffer that name (whoſe Reverence by all means
We deſire to preſerve) to be ſo ſoyl'd, as to be prefixed to a Paper of this unſufferable
nature, that tends not only to the Deſtruction of Our Perſon, but to the Diſſolution
of this Government and of all Society: If at leaſt this Declaration (which We rather
ſee cauſe to hope it hath not) have ſo much as been ſeen in the Houſes, and be not
the ſingle work of the ſame Omnipotent Committee to which is devolved the whole
power of the Parliament, and which, as We underſtand, is truſted (without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Houſes) to break up any Man's Houſe, and take away the Arms and Mony
intended to defend and feed him (if they ſhall ſee cauſe to ſuſpect that he meant to

as to Act, whatſoever they pleaſe. And though We doubt not but to their

are ſo well and ſo generally known to Our People, that We cannot fear (from
whomſoever it come, and though no Anſwer came out with it) that either what is
there ſaid ſhould be believed, or what is there commanded ſhould be obeyed. Who
knows not that Our Commiſſions for Horſe and Foot were not granted out till not
only our Prerogative, but Our Propriety, Our Goods, Arms, Towns, <hi>Militia</hi> and
Negative Voice were taken from Us, and all the Kingdom commanded to be in
Arms, and invited to bring in Horſe, Plate and Mony, to frame an Army againſt
Our Command and Proclamation, and till Horſe were raiſed and muſtered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
and then, with no intention (nor hath any Action in any of Our Miniſters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the leaſt ſuſpicion of ſuch an Intention) by them to compel Our Subjects to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Our Commiſſions of Array, or make uſe of them againſt the Parliament, but
to regain <hi>Hull,</hi> held out in Rebellion againſt Us, and to ſuppreſs all ſuch as without
Our Authority and againſt Our Commands ſhould raiſe Forces in this Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and levy War againſt Us, under pretence of any Order or Ordinance of one
or both Houſes? And ſuch traitorous Aſſemblies and Marches have been the only
lawful and neceſſary Occaſions of our good Subjects, which have not been ſo much
as interrupted by any Troops of Ours. And what is affirmed of the ſpoiling and
killing them as they were ſo travelling under our Protection, and according to Law,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60710:149"/>
is a moſt malicious Affirmation, as well without truth as without inſtance, invented
at once to make Our Troops terrible, and Us odious to Our People. What care have
We taken that by this means the power of the Sword ſhould not come into the hands
of Papiſts, who have by Our Proclamation ſtrictly charged that no Papiſt ſhould
preſume to liſt himſelf either as Officer or Soldier in this Our Army, having directed
how he ſhould be diſcovered if he did preſume, and ſuffer if he were diſcovered?
What care have We taken to avoid Combuſtion and Civil War, offering to lay down
Our Arms when they ſhall have lay'd down their, in whom it was Treaſon to take
them up, and reſtored Us thoſe things which could not, without Treaſon as well as
Injuſtice, be forced away and kept from Us, Our Arms, Ships, Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
when We might meet both Our Houſes in a ſafe and ſecure place to debate freely
of all the Differences in a Parliamentary way? And by whoſe Influences theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
were rejected, and whether the Propoſer or Rejecters were moſt careful to
avoid this Ruine and Deſolation of the Kingdom, We leave all the World to judge;
and whether they, who divert the Men and Mony collected for the relief of Diſtreſſed
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to raiſe Forces againſt their Prince (who asks them nothing but what is Legal,
nor will deny them any thing that is) do not joyn with the Popiſh and Jeſuitical
Faction in the bloody Maſſacre of many Thouſand Proteſtants in that miſerable
Kingdom. We propoſe likewiſe to every Man's judgment, whether the declaring
thoſe to be Traitors who execute Our Commiſſion of <hi>Array</hi> (iſſued in ſo many
Kings Reigns, agreed upon by Parliament, and there yielded to by the King to be
ſettled, as now it is, as a matter of great grace; and ſince that time, which was
in the 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. in no Parliament complained of) whilſt Our good Subjects are
vexed and impriſoned, not only for reſiſting, but for humbly petitioning ſo as may
ſeem but to inſinuate ſomething againſt their moſt illegal Commands concerning
the <hi>Militia;</hi> (To which power of commanding no Title can be made by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
or any Precedent; nor can We ever find by ſearch, nor obtain to be told,
what thoſe Fundamental Laws are by which it is pretended: ſo deep thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
are laid, beyond all means of diſcovery) and the declaring that thoſe who
raiſe Men by virtue of Our Command and Commiſſion (the only Legal way)
traitorouſly and rebelliouſly levy War againſt the King, and ordaining it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for all Our Subjects by force of Arms to reſiſt them and their Accomplices;
and the raiſing of Forces by Authority of Parliament (that is, by the remaining
part of both Houſes) never in the moſt outragious times before attempted, and
commanding ſeveral perſons, whom they call Lieutenants, to lead, and giving them
power to tranſport from one County to another the Forces of ſeveral of Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
againſt them, and to kill and ſlay all ſuch as by force ſhall oppoſe them, Our
Self not excepted, commanding all Our Officers and Subjects to be aſſiſting to them,
and undertaking to ſecure them for ſo doing by the Power and Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(which is firſt to allow, and next to command, and then to pardon Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;)
be not to have already ſubverted, as much as in them lies, the Liberty of the
Subject, the Law of the Land, and altered the Ancient Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
leaving Our Subjects without all Rule to walk by, when the moſt clear Laws
cannot direct and ſecure them, and they ſee all thoſe Ancient bounds paſſed over,
which were ever as much known to be the Duty of both Houſes to obſerve, as it
was evident that there were, and that it was neceſſary that there ſhould be, Two
Houſes of Parliament, and at once behold the Law (which is to defend and protect
the Subject) and Us (Who are to protect and defend the Law) need Defence and
Protection. We doubt not therefore but all Our good Subjects will come in to Our
Aſſiſtance, and that this wicked Charge of intending to introduce Propery, Idolatry, and
Arbitrary Government, laid by Implication upon Us (becauſe We defend Our Selves,
and would recover Our own) will be ſo far from being a Motive againſt Us, that this
intolerable Indignity and damnable Scandal (ſo daily and viſibly confuted by all Our
Profeſſions and Actions) will encreaſe Our good Subjects zeal towards Us, and their
Indignation againſt the Contrivers; and they will eſteem themſelves obliged by the
Religion of Almighty God to oppoſe this War, ſo impiouſly, ſo treaſonably, and ſo
groundleſly made upon Us their King and His Anointed.</p>
                     <p>We therefore require all Our Commiſſioners of Array, Sheriffs, and all Our other
Officers and Miniſters, to raiſe all the Power and Forces of their ſeveral Counties to
aſſiſt the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of
<hi>Eresby,</hi> the Lord <hi>Dunſmore,</hi> the Lord <hi>Paulet,</hi> the Lord <hi>Seymour, Henry Haſtings</hi>

and the Perſons of all ſuch Traitors, and their Adherents and Accomplices, to Arreſt
and Impriſon, to the end they may be brought to a fair and legal Tryal by their
Peers, and according to the law. And this We require from them, as they tender
the Defence of Our Perſon, the true Religion, the Law of the Land, the Liberty
and Property of the Subject, and the true and juſt Privileges of Parliament. And for
ſo doing they ſhall be defended and ſecured by Us, and by the Law; with whom and
with which We doubt not but Our Subjects will ſooner chuſe to live and dye, than
with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Adherents.</p>

thoſe Titles, and begun to put in execution thoſe Powers and Authorities which are

the ſaid publick and notorious Acts and Actions of the ſaid Earl are Acts and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of High Treaſon, being a manifeſt levying of War againſt his natural Liege Lord
and King, expreſly within the words and meaning of the Statute made in the twenty
fifth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, declaring the ſame, of which in Law there
neither is nor can be any doubt; and that the ſaid Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is a Rebel and
Traitour unto Us and to Our Crown, and that he, and all Colonels, Captains
and Officers, which upon notice hereof ſhall not immediately quit their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

adjudged and eſteemed and proceeded againſt as Traitors and Rebels.</p>
                     <p>And yet, out of Our Grace and Clemency towards ſuch of Our Subjects as have been
abuſed and miſled by the ſaid Earl, and ſuch others as joyn themſelves with him
in theſe deſperate Courſes, and to preſerve the Peace of this Kingdom, (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
and to avoid the ſhedding of blood, We abhorring the name of a Civil
War, if it can by any good means be avoided, do by this Our Royal Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
admoniſh the ſaid Earl, and all Our Subjects whom it may concern, which

'tis no wonder if being compelled to take notice of Actions of an high and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
nature, and to conſider and anſwer words impetuouſly directed againſt Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
it ſelf, We be likewiſe enforced to uſe a Dialect rougher, and different from what
We have uſed to treat in, ('tis a weapon We bluſh to find Our Self put to exerciſe:)
and We call the Almighty God to witneſs, That though We were extremely ſenſible
of the violent and unjuſtifiable Impoſition upon Our Royal Office and Authority, of
the apparent Hazard and Danger which threatened Our own Perſon and Safety; yet
not ſo much the particular conſideration of Our Self hath engaged Us in the reſolution
We have now taken, as the publick Care of the true Proteſtant Religion, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Law, and the Liberty of the Subject, and the upholding the whole
Frame and Conſtitution of this Kingdom, ſo admirably founded and continued by the
Bleſſing of God and the wiſdom of Our Anceſtours, to the wonder and envy of all the
neighbouring Kingdoms, which the Faction and Ambition of a few diſcontented ſpirits,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60710:151"/>
with their counterfeit ſhews of Religion and pretences of Liberty, endeavour to ſhake
and rend aſunder; and to bring Our Self, and all the Subjects of this Kingdom, into
perpetual Subjection unto their vaſt, unlimited, Arbitrary, Seditious Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin Our diſcourſe from the beginning of this Parliament, (for of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Diſſolution of the laſt, by the miſ-information and advice of ſome perſons, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon now under another Character, We ſhall forbear to ſpeak, being reſolved that
no diſregard or undutifulneſs of other men towards Us ſhall ever prevail with Us, to
do what We think unſuteable to the Honour and Reputation of a Juſt Prince and of a
good and loving Maſter.)</p>
                     <p>When We reſolved to ſummon this Parliament (which We did out of Our own
earneſt and affectionate deſire to beget a good and right intelligence between Us and
Our People, and before the meeting of Our great Council at <hi>York,</hi> and uncompelled
by any violence, but of Our love to Peace) We preſented to Our Self the unhappy
Condition wherein the ſtate of this Kingdom then ſtood, conſidered the nature of the
Preſſures, (then more freely repreſented to Us) which in themſelves were grievous to
Our good Subjects, and in the Conſequences of them might appear more terrible. We
took a full and clear proſpect of the Inconveniences and miſchiefs which had grown by
the long intermiſſion of Parliaments, and by the parting too much from the known
Rule of the Law to an Arbitrary power; and upon the whole reſolved (without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Gloſs upon Our own former Commands, or endeavouring to make any excuſe
for the Actions of Our Miniſters) That the meaſure of Our Juſtice and Favour,
by way of Reparation, ſhould far exceed the proportion of the Sufferings Our good
Subjects had undergone by Us, which We were confident would beget ſo mutual
an Affection and confidence between Us, that ſuch a foundation of firm and ſtable
Happineſs would immediately have been laid for the whole Kingdom, that all memory
of former Grievances would have been eaſily buried, and that this Parliament ſhould
receive a glorious celebration both by King and People to the end of the world. And
therefore upon the firſt Convention, on the third of <hi>November,</hi> We declared Our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in that point, and then, or ſoon after, deſired, that whatever miſtaking had
grown in the Government either of Church or State might be removed, and all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the Order of the time (the memory whereof is juſtly precious to this Nation) of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and for any expreſſion of their Affection to Us in ſupply of Our known
Neceſſities, We were ſo far from preſſing, We reſolved not to think of it, till all Our
good People ſhould be abundantly ſatisfied in all neceſſary proviſion for their Liberty and
Property, and whatſoever elſe might diſturb them in their Eſtates or Conſciences. How
firmly We have kept Our Self to this Reſolution is evident to all the world.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the Parliament We quickly diſcerned, by ſome Circumſtances
of their proceedings, that they meant not to confine or contain themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Paths of their Predeceſſors; which We imputed to the diſorder and impatience
the former Sufferings of the Kingdom had begot in them; and therefore We reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take no exceptions to any particular, but to do Our part in any point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
as ſoon and as often as any opportunity ſhould be offered unto Us, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that as ſoon as they ſhould find themſelves reſtored to their old ſecurity, and the
matter and ſubſtance of their Doubts and Fears to be removed, they would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and willingly reduce themſelves into their good old way, and apply themſelves to
the uſual form of their Predeceſſors in the courſe of their proceedings. And though
We well knew the Combination entred into by ſeveral perſons for an alteration
in the Government of the Church, which could not but have an Influence upon
the Civil Government of the State too, and obſerved that thoſe men had greateſt
Intereſt and power of perſwading in both Houſes who had entred into ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination;
yet Our Reſolution was ſo full for the publick ſatisfaction of Our People,
that We believed even thoſe men would either have been converted in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
by the clearneſs and juſtice of Our Actions, or would have appeared ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
or been diſcovered ſo ſeditious, that their Malice and Fury would not
have been able to have done miſchief. And therefore We took no notice of the great
labour and skill the prime Leaders amongſt them had uſed to get men of their Faction
nominated and elected to ſerve as Members of the Houſe of Commons, and did uſe
to remove others (whom they knew to be of different Opinions) though they were
fairly and legally elected; wherein there was no other meaſure or Rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
obſerved, than ſingly with reference to the Opinions or Affections of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
witneſs (beſides their putting out or keeping in men upon queſtionable Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
without the leaſt colour or ſhadow of Juſtice) their Order whereby they at
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60710:152"/>
one clap expelled a very great number of Perſons fairly elected by their Country, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence that they had ſome hand, or their names uſed in ſome Project, Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or Patent, without charging them with any Crime, or to this day proceeding againſt
them: and yet they continue amongſt them Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> Maſter <hi>Laurence Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,</hi>
and others (whoſe Affections and Opinions they are well pleaſed with;) though
the firſt of them is notoriouſly known to be the chief Promoter of the buſineſs of the
Gold and Silver Thred, (a Commiſſion complained of, viewed and examined, and
therefore his name might have been eaſily taken notice of;) and the other as converſant,
and as much imployed as a Commiſſioner in matters of that nature as any Man.
We ſpeak not this to excuſe Monopolies (the Inconveniences of which We are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of, and ſhall for the future prevent) but to ſhew the partiality of that Faction,
and the uſe they make of them to their own advantage.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Remedy (after the impeaching ſeveral Perſons of High Treaſon whom
they looked upon as the chief cauſes of the publick Sufferings) they propoſed was,
The Bill for the Triennial Parliament: to the which, though We might juſtly have
pauſed upon ſeveral Expreſſions and Clauſes in it, and might very well have inſiſted
upon Our old Priviledge and Cuſtom, not to paſs any Bill till the end of the Seſſion;
yet ſince We really did believe moſt of the Miſchiefs then complained of proceeded
from the too-long intermiſſion of Parliaments, and were reſolved for the future to
communicate freely and frequently that way with Our Subjects, We paſſed over thoſe
Exceptions, and conſented to it, eſpecially upon this Confidence, That when ſuch other
Acts ſhould be agreed upon for the eaſe and ſecurity of Our People as We deſired and
expected ſhould be preferred to Us, this Act would be a ſufficient earneſt and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that all thoſe Acts ſhould be faithfully obſerved by Us, and ſo there ſhould be
no room left for any Fears and Jealouſies, which might prevent that mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between Us and Our People We earneſtly deſired to raiſe: and for ſome time
after the paſſing this Act We found ſuch an acknowledgment from both Houſes of Our
ſingular Grace and Favour in conſenting to it, and ſo great expreſſions of their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and purpoſes towards Us, that We believed the ſenſe of it would never have been
forgotten, and were as much pleaſed that We had taken that way of obliging Our
People, as they were with the Benefit it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But We were very well able to diſcover, that whatſoever ſeemed to be asked of Us
or to be complained of to Us, there was ſtill a Faction of a few Ambitious, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and Seditious perſons, who, under pretence of being enemies to Arbitrary Power,
and of compaſſion towards thoſe who out of Tenderneſs of Conſcience could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to ſome things enjoyned or commended in the Government of the Church, had
in truth a deſire (and had entred into a Combination to that purpoſe) to alter the
Government both of Church and State; which they were yet to diſguiſe, till by their
Art or Induſtry they had infected ſome with their Opinions, and by their cunning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
and Managery of the publick Intereſts they had ſeduced others to an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
confidence in their Power, Wiſdom and Integrity. And againſt this Deſign We
only oppoſed a reſolution to contribute all Our aſſiſtance for the Peace, Happineſs and
Security of Our People, and ſo to convince their Underſtandings (if their Error pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from Weakneſs) that no alteration could produce that Happineſs they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
and (if their natures were capable of ſuch Truſts) to take ſome of the chief
of them ſo near Us, that they might be witneſſes of Our Actions and privy to Our
Counſels, that either Ingenuity or Gratitude might recover them from their deſperate
Inclinations. Hereupon, becauſe moſt of the Grievances of Our People were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to proceed from the great liberty of Our Council-board, or from ſome Orders
and Directions from them, We admitted to Our Privy Council ſeven or eight of thoſe
Lords who were eminently in eſteem with Our People for their reputation of Honour
and Juſtice; ſome of whom We knew to be moſt paſſionately diſ-inclined to the preſent
managery of Civil affairs and to the Government of the Church; and hoped that by a
free communication of their Doubts, Opinions and Counſels, they would have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that ſatisfaction, that they would have been excellent Inſtruments of a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and Confirmation in Church and State. Having begun with this foundation
of Confidence in Our Court by electing ſuch Perſons, We made the ſame haſt to apply
particular Remedies to the viſible known Diſeaſes, reſolving thoſe Remedies ſhould be
proportioned to the Counſel and Deſires of both Houſes, which We thought the ſureſt
way to win at leaſt a major part to the confeſſion and acknowledgment of Our Juſtice
and Affection. The Star-Chamber had in the exceſs of Juriſdiction, or tediouſneſs
and charge of Proceedings, or meaſure and ſeverity of Puniſhment, invaded the Laws
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60710:152"/>
of the Land and Liberty of the Subject by the exerciſe of an Arbitrary Power: We
preſſed not the Reformation of this Court, though erected or ſetled by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a wiſe time; but, at the inſtance of both Houſes, conſented to the Abolition of
it. The High Commiſſion Court had proceded with too much ſtrictneſs in many caſes,
where the Tender Conſciences of many of Our weak Subjects were concerned, and had
ſo far out-grown the power of the Law, that it would not be limited and guided by it,
but cenſured, fined and impriſoned Our People for matters unpuniſhable by the Law:
We preſſed not the Review of that Statute by which that Court was erected, that ſuch
power might be qualified and proviſions altered as had been grievous to the Subject,
nor deſired that any other care might be taken for the upholding the Eccleſiaſtical
Diſcipline than what the wiſdom and piety of both Houſes ſhould think neceſſary;
but, in compliance to the ſufferings of Our People and the deſires of both Houſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Repeal of that branch of that Statute. The Writs for Ship-mony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſeveral ſumms of mony had been received from Our good Subjects for defence and
ſafeguard of the Kingdom, had lain heavy upon Our People, yet were judged to be
Legal: Both Our Houſes of Parliament declared that the grounds and reaſons of that
Judgment (being, That when the good and ſafety of the Kingdom in general is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and that the whole Kingdom is in Danger, We might compel our Subjects to
provide Ships, Men and Victuals, for the defence and ſafeguard of the Kingdom; and
that We were the ſole Judge of that Danger, and how the ſame might be prevented)
were contrary to and againſt the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, the Property and
Liberty of the Subject, and to the Petition of Right: without diſputing our Right,
We were contented that all the proceedings in that buſineſs ſhould be adjudged void
and diſannulled, and the Judgments, Enrolments and Entries thereupon ſhould be
vacated and cancelled, in ſuch manner as was deſired. Under colour of executing the
Forreſt-Laws, and of keeping the Juſtice in Eyres Seat, very many Perſons had been
grieved and vexed by Preſentments, Fines, Judgments and Impriſonments, the Meets,
Limits and Bounds of Forreſts extended, and ſome endeavours been made to ſet on
foot Forreſts where in truth none had been: We no ſooner received complaint of this,
but We paſſed an Act for the certainty of the Meets, Limits and Bounds of all the
Forreſts in <hi>England,</hi> with ſuch further Proviſions for the eaſe of Our Subjects as were
deſired at Our hands. If by the negligence or wilfulneſs of perſons truſted by Us any
Grievance or inconvenience had been contracted in any part of Our Kingdom, (which
ſeemed not to have ſo general an influence upon the whole) upon the firſt clear Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
We did Our part for the eaſing of them; and therefore We paſſed, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Our good Subjects of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> an Act againſt divers Incroachments
and Oppreſſions in the Stannary-Courts. And We were ſo confident this way to win
the Hearts and Affections of all Our good Subjects, and that both Our Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would at laſt find a time to give too, that We made their Asking the only
Rule to Our Grants, and parted with any thing they deſired Us to relinquiſh. So in
the Preamble to the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, We parted with Our Title of
Impoſing; a Power adjudged good, and exerciſed by Our Anceſtors, and though diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
never reſolved againſt by Judgment in Parliament. So in the Act for regulating
the Office of Clark of the Marker, becauſe the undue execution thereof had been
grievous to many of Our loving Subjects, We conſented, that no Clark of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of Our Houſe ſhall hereafter execute His Office in any part of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but only within the verge of Our Court, and granted the Execution of that
Office to the Mayors and Bayliffs of Towns Corporate, and to the Lords of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Franchiſes, and to their Deputies. So, becauſe about the beginning of Our
Reign ſeveral Writs had iſſued out of Our Court of Chancery in the buſineſs of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and been tranſmitted with their Returns into Our Court of Exchequer, where
the proceedings were not fit and warrantable, We were contented, by the Act for the
prevention of vexatious proceedings touching the Order of Knighthood, abſolutely to
part with and diſcharge a Right and Duty as unqueſtionably due to Us by the Law as
any Service We can challenge. So (which is the higheſt inſtance of Truſt that ever
King gave His Subjects) upon Information that Credit could not be obtained for ſo
much Mony as was requiſite for the relief of Our Army and People in the Northern
parts, for preventing the imminent Danger the Kingdom was in, and for ſupply of
Our preſent and urgent Occaſions, for fear the Parliament might be diſſolved before
Juſtice ſhould be done upon Delinquents, publick Grievances be redreſſed, a firm Peace
between the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> concluded, and before proviſion ſhould
be made for the repayment of ſuch Monies as ſhould be ſo raiſed (though We knew
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60710:153"/>
what power We parted from, and truſted Our Houſes with, by ſo doing, and what
might be the Conſequence of ſuch a Truſt if unfaithfully managed) We neglected all
ſuch ſuſpicions, which all Men now ſee deſerved not to be ſlighted, and We willingly
and immediately paſſed that Act for the continuance of this Parliament, being reſolved
that it ſhould not be Our fault if all thoſe particulars were not ſpeedily provided for,
which ſeemed then to be the grounds of their deſire. Let all the World now judge
what greater Obligations of Juſtice, Favour, Affection and Truſt, can a Prince lay upon
His Subjects, than We did upon both Our Houſes of Parliament by theſe Acts; and
whether We did not, in Our free Grace and Favour, grant much more than had been
asked of Us by that Petition preſented to Us by ſome Lords at <hi>York,</hi> in which was then
thought to be contracted all that was grievous to Our People, and all that was juſt
and gracious for Us to do for them. And in all the time in which theſe Acts were
framing and paſſing, though Our own perſonal Wants were notoriouſly known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
unprovided for, and themſelves had asked leave to look into and ſettle Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
which We conſented to, and therefore We might have expected ſome fruit of
that pretended Care, We never preſſed them, or made the leaſt overture to them
for Our own ſupply; only deſired them (and 'twas almoſt the only thing We did deſire
of them) that they would uſe all poſſible expedition in the buſineſs of the Treaty, that
the two Armies might be ſpeedily disbanded, and Our Subjects eaſed of that heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
which in time would grow inſupportable, and waſte the whole ſtock of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But We found the Faction We feared in the beginning grew ſtill ſtronger and
nothing converted or reconciled by all thoſe Acts of Ours, which would have made any
Nation happy; That whilſt We were buſie in providing for the publick, they were contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
particular Advantages of Offices and Places for themſelves, made uſe under-hand of
the former Grievances of the Subject in things concerning Religion and Law, to change
the Religion and Law of this Kingdom, labouring, that neither any thing the Subject
had ſuffered from the Crown might be forgotten, nor any ſatisfaction from the Crown
to the Subject might be remembred. And therefore in ſtead of acknowledging Our
great Juſtice and ſingular Favour in paſſing thoſe Acts, they infuſed into Our People,
that We paſſed them unwillingly, (whereas We never made the leaſt pauſe upon any
of them but one, that for the High-Commiſſion Court; and whether that was penned
with that warineſs and animadverſion, that there be not more determined by it than
the major part of both Houſes intended at the paſſing of it, let themſelves judge) and
that We meant not to obſerve them; and grew ſo much confounded with the full
meaſure of Our Favour; that they would allow themſelves no ſecurity of enjoying
what We had freely given, but by taking away any power from Us of giving more,
they muſt have a through alteration both in Church and State, or elſe they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enjoy the benefit of the Reformation We had willingly made. Hereupon they
oppoſe the disbanding of the Armies, and give all delays to the <hi>Scots</hi> Treaty, though
the Commiſſioners for that Nation very earneſtly preſſed the haſtning of it, and in
plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> declare,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Stroud.</note>
                        <hi>That they cannot yet ſpare them, that the ſons of</hi> Zerviah <hi>were too
ſtrong for them:</hi> And finding more haſte to be made in the aſſerting the Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
than they deſired, having a deſign to ingage this Kingdom into ſo vaſt a Debt
that there might be no way of paying it but by the Lands of the Church, and leſt Our
good Subjects might be too ſoon ſatisfied, they haſtned on to their deſign upon the Church;
which they at firſt diſguiſed with a purpoſe only of removing the Biſhops from their
Votes in the Lords Houſe. This Bill paſſed the Houſe of Commons; in the Houſe
of Peers it endured ſeveral long, free debates; and in the end, upon great and ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
was by the conſent of very much the major part of that Houſe abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
This was no ſooner done, but that Faction (glad of the miſcarriage of their
former Bill, the paſſing whereof they knew would have ſatisfied many of thoſe whom
they hoped now further to ſeduce) produced a Bill to be tendred in the Houſe of Commons
for the abolition of Biſhops out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Root and Branch, (according
to their firſt reſolution, as Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> told a Member of the Lords Houſe by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
<hi>That it was not enough to be againſt the Perſons of the Biſhops, if he were not againſt
the Function,</hi>) and for extirpation of all Deans and Chapters, and reducing that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Frame of Government and ſupport of Learning into a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion, that
out of it they might mold an <hi>Vtopia</hi> no ſix of them had, nor We believe yet have, agreed,
on, further than to deſtroy the preſent; and out of the goodly Revenue which the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Bounty and Devotion of former Ages had been ſo long in raiſing, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and advancement of Learning and Religion, and which God hath bleſſed with ſo
many eminent Men, whoſe Learning and Lives have advanced the Doctrine of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60710:153"/>
Proteſtant Religion, and many of them given, their Bodies to the Fire, as a Sacrifice to
that Truth and Religion, to erect Stipends to their own Clergy, and to raiſe eſtates to
repair their own broken fortunes. And for the free paſſing of this Bill (which to this
hour they could never tell what to make of) two Armies muſt be kept in the bowels
of the Kingdom at 80000 pound a Month charge to the Commonwealth: For about
this Bill the Houſe of Commons was ſo wholly taken up, that in ten weeks none,
or very little, other buſineſs could be thought of. About this time, or a little before,
(after ſeveral Intimations of Treaſons, Plots and Conſpiracies by the Papiſts, of great
Proviſions of Arms by them, and training Men under ground, and many other falſe
reports, created, ſpread and countenanced by themſelves) upon ſome general appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of Deſigns againſt them, a Proteſtation is made in the Houſe of Commons for
ſome union and conſent amongſt themſelves, to perform thoſe Duties which, if they
had meant no more than they expreſſed, had been ſufficiently provided for by the
Oaths they had already taken, and what their former Duties obliged them to. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a Proteſtation is framed, and being put into ſuch words as no honeſt Man could
believe himſelf obliged by it to any unlawful Action, was voluntarily taken by all the
Members of the Houſe of Commons, and preſently recommended to the Houſe of Lords,
where it received the ſame countenance, that is, was looked upon as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it ſelf unlawful, though ſome Members of that Houſe refuſed to take it, being
voluntary, and not impoſed by any Lawful Authority: Then 'tis recommended to the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and over all the Kingdom, by order from the Houſe of Commons (a
ſtrange and unheard-of Uſurpation) to be taken by all perſons. But in very few days,
upon conference amongſt themſelves and with thoſe Clergy-men who daily ſolicite
their unlawful and unwarrantable deſigns with the People, they find they were by this
Proteſtation ſo far from having drawn people into their Combination, that in truth
all Men conceived that they were even engaged by it againſt their main Deſign, by
promiſing <hi>to defend the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the
Church of England,</hi> &amp;c. And thereupon ſome perſons of that Faction prevailed, that
after the Members of the Houſes had taken it, a Declaration was ſet forth by the Houſe
of Commons, That by thoſe words, <hi>The Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> was intended
only ſo far as it was oppoſite to Popery, and Popiſh Innovations, and that the words were
not to be extended to the maintainance of the <hi>Diſcipline and Government,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo
under this Explication and Declaration publiſhed only by the Houſe of Commons, and
never aſſented to by the Houſe of Peers, this Proteſtation was directed to be generally
taken throughout <hi>England:</hi> And to that purpoſe a Bill is drawn, paſſed the Houſe of
Commons, and ſent up to the Lords; who, at the ſecond reading finding many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in it unfit to be ſo ſeverely impoſed upon the Subject, abſolutely rejected it.
Upon this enſued a new and unheard-of diſtemper in the Houſe of Commons, as if it
had been great preſumption in the Houſe of Peers to refuſe any Bill ſent from them,
and thereupon a Vote paſſed in the Houſe of Commons, That that Houſe did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Proteſtation made by them is fit to be taken by every perſon that is well-affected
in Religion, and to the good of the Commonwealth; and therefore doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
That what perſon ſoever ſhall not take the Proteſtation, is unfit to bear Office
in the Church or Commonwealth; and ordered, That the Knights, Citizens and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
ſhould ſend down to the ſeveral places for which they ſerve Copies of that Vote
of the Houſe concerning the Proteſtation, and that thoſe Votes ſhould be printed. Let
all Men judge whether before that time, from the beginning of Parliaments, the Houſe
of Commons had ever preſumed to trench ſo far upon Our Priviledge, to make a
Declaration ſo like Law without Us; or upon the Priviledge of the Lords, to make
and publiſh ſuch a Declaration after they had rejected the Bill, and ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take the Proteſtation; or upon the Liberty of the Subject, ſo far to impoſe
any ſuch thing upon them without conſent of Parliament. Yet of this We took no
notice, but preſſed ſtill the disbanding of the Armies, and interpoſed and quickned
them in nothing elſe; which was again with all earneſtneſs deſired by the <hi>Scots</hi> at
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and preſſed by their Commiſſioners at <hi>London.</hi> But a new Fright was
found to ſtartle the People, and to bring Us into Hatred or Jealouſie with them: the
general Rumors of Treaſons and Conſpiracies began to loſe credit with all Men, who
began to conſider what they felt more than what others feared; and therefore they had
now found out a Treaſon indeed, even ready to be put in execution upon the whole
Kingdom, the Repreſentative body thereof, a Plot to bring up the whole Army out of
the Northern parts to <hi>London.</hi> A ſtrange Plot indeed, which, conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of that time, no Man can believe Us guilty of: and though they made great
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60710:154"/>
uſe of it, to the filling the minds of Our People with fears and apprehenſions, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not then to charge Us with any knowledge of or privity to it. What they have
done ſince all the world knows, notwithſtanding Our many Proteſtations in that point.
And We cannot but ſay, that by thoſe Examinations of Colonel <hi>Goring,</hi> Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhly,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Conyers,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Piercy</hi>'s Letter, which is all the Evidence We have
ſeen, and by which they ſeem principally to be guided, We cannot ſatisfie Our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conſcience, that there was ever a reſolution of bringing up the Army to <hi>London;</hi>
and upon the ſtricteſt examination We can make of that buſineſs, We can find it to be
no other than this: Obſervation being made of the great Tumults about <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
which ſeemed to threaten the ſafety of the Members of both Houſes, at leaſt of thoſe
who were known not to agree with the deſigns of that Faction We have before ſpoken
of, and the manner of delivering Petitions by multitudes of people atteſted (or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſo) by the hands of many thouſands, againſt the known Laws and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Government of the Kingdom, which yet ſeemed to receive ſome countenance,
and to carry ſome Authority, as inſtances of the Affections of ſo many perſons;
it fell into the thoughts of ſome Officers of the Army, of known and publick Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their Country, That a Petition of a modeſt and dutiful nature from the whole
Army, for the compoſing and ſettling all Grievances in the Church and State by Law,
might, for the reaſon of it, prevail with the whole Houſe, and coming from ſuch a
Body, might confirm thoſe who might be ſhaken with any fears of Power or Force
by the Tumults: and with this Propoſition We being made acquainted, gave Our full
approbation to it, taking great care that no Circumſtances in the framing it or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it might be any blemiſh to the matter of it. This, We call God to witneſs,
as We have done before, was all We gave Our Conſent unto, or which We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
was ever intended to be put in practice. (What attempts other men made to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Affections of the Army from Us is known to many.) If in the managery of
this debate any raſh diſcourſes happened of bringing up the Army, it is evident, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were propoſed in earneſt or no, they were never entertained, and the whole
matter laid aſide above two months before any diſcovery; ſo that that Danger was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevented by the Power or Wiſdom of Parliament. And for the Petition it ſelf,
which hath been ſo often preſſed againſt Us as a ſpecial Argument of Our privity to the
bringing up the Army, after We have ſo fully and particularly anſwered every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
circumſtance of that Petition, ſigned with <hi>C. R.</hi> We have herewith publiſhed a
true Copy of that Petition, that all Our good Subjects may ſee how juſtly We have been
traduced, and judge, when Petitions of all natures were ſo frequently and ſo willingly
received, whether ſuch a Petition might not with modeſty and duty enough have been
preſented unto them. And if in truth that deſign of bringing up the Army had been then
believed when it was firſt pretended to be diſcovered, which was about the middle of
<hi>May,</hi> they would ſurely have thought it neceſſary to have disbanded that Army ſooner
than <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which no preſſing of Ours nor of Our <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects could perſwade them
to do: And We are ſure Our Innocence in that matter would ſoon have appeared, if
the large time to bring this buſineſs to a judicial tryal had been made uſe of; if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Cuſtom, it had not been thought fit to publiſh Depoſitions before the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
concerned had been heard to make their Defence, or Witneſſes croſs-examined,
though they attended above twelve months to do it; and if ſome men had not believed
that their general and violent expreſſions, affirming this to be a Plot equal to that of
the Gun-powder-Treaſon, would ſooner be believed if it were not publickly diſcuſſed,
but left to every mans fancy to heighten according to his own Inclinations, and had
not feared, that if the whole Examinations taken (and not ſuch only as they pleaſed
to ſelect had come to light, it would have appeared by the Examination of Maſter <hi>Goring</hi>
(purpoſely ſuppreſt) with what intention that mention of bringing up the Army was
made, with what earneſtneſs it was oppoſed, and with what ſuddenneſs it was deſerted:
and many extenuations of and many other contradictions to what is now publiſhed would
have appeared, and this impoſſible Stratagem, with which they have ſo much diſturbed
Our Subjects and reproached Us, could never have been made ſo much uſe of.</p>
                     <p>After all this readineſs in Us to do whatſoever they deſired of Us, and patience in
ſuffering them to do whatſoever they pleaſed to Us, We gave them warning, that if
there were any more good Bills which they deſired might paſs for the benefit of Our
Subjects, We wiſhed they might be made ready againſt ſuch a time, when We reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
according to Our Promiſe to Our <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects (with which they were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted)
to repair into Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle the unhappy Differences
there. Upon this We were earneſtly deſired by both Our Houſes of Parliament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60710:154"/>
Our Journey thither, as well upon pretence of the Danger, if both Armies were
not firſt disbanded, as that they had many good Laws in readineſs for the ſettling the
Differences here. We were by their entreaty perſwaded to deferr. Our Journey to a
day agreed on by themſelves, aſſuring Our Self that they would think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
againſt that time not only to disband Our Armies, but ſo to prepare and digeſt
the buſineſs of Parliament, that We might have made a Seſſion before Our going. But
that Malignant Faction was ſo prevalent, that the debate of the Biſhops Bill took up
moſt of their time, ſo that neither any care was taken for the disbanding the Army, nor
any thing done that had any reference to the publick benefit: and when the time of
Our ſtay was expired, and even the day come themſelves had appointed, a new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
was made unto Us for a longer ſtay of fourteen days, becauſe the Treaty was not
concluded, nor the Armies disbanded, which was the main ground of Our deferring
it before. This Suit (which was the firſt We denied them) We could not grant,
there being that neceſſity with reference to Our Promiſe, and to the expectation of Our
Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it was not in Our power to ſatisfie them, as We informed
both Houſes Our ſelf at a Conference; and according to that neceſſity We undertook
that Journey, not doubting but that when We ſhould have diſpatched the Affairs of
that Kingdom, which We hoped ſpeedily to do, and both Our Houſes of Parliament
ſhould have refreſhed themſelves in the Viſitation of thoſe for whom they had ſo well
provided by Our Favour, We ſhould meet again with mutual Confidence one in another,
and that it would be Our turn then to receive ſuch Teſtimonies of that Confidence
and Affection as We had deſerved.</p>
                     <p>But the miſchievous and indefatigable induſtry of that Malignant party, which had
before Our going interrupted that Correſpondence which We deſerved from Our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
had with no leſs Malice provided for Our reception at Our Return; inſtead of
reducing buſineſs to that head, that the Diſtractions of the Kingdom might be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the due obſervation and execution of the Laws, We found things far more out
of order than We left them, and Our good Subjects more puzzled to know their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Orders had been made in the Houſe of Commons and publiſhed in derogation
of the Book of Common-Prayer, and for ſuſpenſion of thoſe Laws in force which
concerned the Government of the Church: and though another Order of the Lords was
likewiſe publiſhed according to Law for the due obſervation of the Laws eſtabliſhed,
and for ſuppreſſing thoſe Diſorders which were every day breaking out, by the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mean looſe perſons againſt the Divine Service appointed by Law, the Houſe of
Commons took upon them publickly to declare againſt that Order, becauſe it was only
made with the conſent of eleven Lords, and that nine other Lords did then diſſent
from it; whereas in truth the ſaid Order was made in a full Houſe in <hi>January</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and only Ordered then by that difference of number to be printed, after the Houſe
of Commons had made (in a very thin Houſe, and after it had been rejected by Vote)
that illegal Order for ſuch alteration in the Church: and if in truth it had been then
made, and but by the odds of two Voices, being in purſuance of the Law, all men
will think it of much more validity than any Order of the Houſe of Commons againſt
the Law; which in truth hath no Authority to make any Orders in buſineſs of that
nature. And therefore the publiſhing of that Order and Declaration of the ninth of
<hi>September</hi> muſt be confeſſed by all men to be ſuch a breach and violation of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the Peers Houſe, (beſides the Affront offered to Us, and injury to Our good
Subjects, and to the Law by it) that before this Parliament was never heard of; and
was an apparent evidence, that they meant the whole Managery of the Kingdom and
the Legiſlative power ſhould be undertaken by the Houſe of Commons, without the
Conſent either of Us or Our Nobility. Yet the Execution of this Order was with
great Diligence and Animoſity preſſed upon Our good Subjects, and many troubled
and impriſoned for not ſubmitting thereunto. When they had made this breach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Eccleſiaſtical State, they took care (under pretence of encouragement of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
to erect Lectures in ſeveral Pariſhes, and to commend ſuch Lecturers as beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Deſigns, men of no learning, no Conſcience, but furious Promoters of
the moſt dangerous Innovations which were ever induced into any State; many of
them having taken no Orders, yet recommended by Members of either Houſe to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
as at <hi>Leuſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and many other places: And when Mechanick perſons
have been brought before them for Preaching in Churches, and confeſſed the ſame,
the power of theſe Grand Reformers hath been ſo great, that they have been diſmiſſed
without Puniſhment, hardly with Reprehenſion. All perſons of Learning and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
in Preaching, of ſober and vertuous Converſations, and great Examples in their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60710:155"/>
Lives, even ſuch as amongſt theſe Men had been of greateſt eſtimation, and ſuffered
ſomewhat for them, were diſcountenanced, and ſuch Men principally cheriſhed, who
boldly and ſeditiouſly preached againſt the Government of the Church, againſt the
Book of Common-Prayer, againſt Our Kingly lawful Power, and againſt Our Perſon; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which were commended to (if not impoſed upon) Pariſhes, firſt by ſpecial Letters
and earneſt Sollicitations from the prime Leaders of this turbulent Faction, after by
Orders requiring ſuch Miniſters as would not accept their Recommendations to attend
and ſhew cauſe. All licence was given to thoſe leud Seditious Pamphlets which deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Government both of the Church and State, which laid any Imputations and
Scorns upon Our Perſon or Office, and which filled the ears of all Our good Subjects
with Lyes and monſtrous Diſcourſes, to make them believe all the ill of the Government
and Governors of Church and State: Books againſt the Book of Common-Prayer
and the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land ſuffered, without reprehenſion, to be dedicated to
both Houſes of Parliament; whatſoever the Rancour and Venome of any Infamous
perſon could digeſt, publiſhed without control; and nothing diſcountenanced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
but a dutiful regard of Us and Our Honour, and a ſober eſteem and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the Laws of the Kingdom. This was the condition We found at our return
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> beſides a ſtrange groundleſs apprehenſion of Danger infuſed generally
into the minds of Our good Subjects, as if ſome notable Deſign were in hand againſt
the Parliament, againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> againſt the whole Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
There fell out an Accident whileſt We were in <hi>Scotland</hi> concerning the Marqueſſes of
<hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Argile;</hi> Thoſe two Lords, upon ſome information given to them that
their Perſons were in danger, upon a ſudden withdrew themſelves from the Parliament
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for ſome few days removed out of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Whatever they had been
informed and what ever they ſuſpected, the Grounds of both were very fully examined
by the Parliament there, their Perſons being of that quality and eſtimation in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that they were ſure of Juſtice. Upon the whole, themſelves and the Parliament
were ſatisfied, that the Information firſt given to them could not be made good to the
proof of any Deſign to the Danger of theſe Lords, and the Examinations of the whole
matter ſent by Our direction to Our Parliament here. How (if all had been true that was
imagined) this buſineſs could ſo highly and nearly concern the Peace of this Kingdom,
and the preſent Safety of both Our Houſes of Parliament, We cannot imagine: Yet
upon the firſt report of it here (which was the day before the firſt Meeting after the
Receſs) without ſtaying to hear the opinion of Our Parliament there, who uſed all
diligence in the examination, or of Our Parliament here, ſuch ſtrange Gloſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
were made upon that accident (not without reflection upon Us and Our
Honour) as if at the ſame time there had been ſuch a Deſign to have been executed
here as they had fancied to themſelves that to be; and a ſudden reſolution was taken, firſt
by the Committee during the Receſs, after by the Houſes, to have a Guard for the
defence of <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and both Our Houſes of Parliament: which muſt needs
make a great impreſſion in the minds of Our good Subjects, in a time when they
were newly freed from the fears of two Armies, to be awaked with the apprehenſion
of Dangers; of which ſeeing no ground, they were to expect no end.</p>
                     <p>Matters being thus ſtated, and all poſſible skill being uſed by that Faction, and by
their Emiſſaries of the Clergy, (who at the ſame time, ſuch Clamour was raiſed
of the unlawfulneſs that the Clergy ſhould meddle in Temporal Affairs, were their
chief Agents to derive their Seditious directions to the People, and were all the week
attending the doors of both Houſes to be imployed in thoſe errands) to infuſe the
moſt deſperate Fears into the minds of all Men that could be imagined. To be ſure
that the memory of former bitterneſs might not depart, they provide for Our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
againſt We ſhould come to <hi>London,</hi> to preſent Us with <hi>a Remonſtrance</hi>
(as they called it) <hi>of the State of the Kingdom;</hi> laying before Us, and publiſhing
to all the world, all the miſtakes and all the misfortunes which had happened from
Our firſt coming to the Crown, and before, to that hour; forgetting the bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(notwithſtanding the unhappy mixture) all Our Subjects had enjoyed in the
benefit of Peace and Plenty under Us, to the envy of Chriſtendom; objecting to
Us the Actions of ſome, and the thoughts of others; and reproaching Us with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which indeed never entred into Our thoughts, nor, to Our knowledge, into
the thoughts of any other; reviling Us to the People, and complaining to Us of
the Houſe of Peers (whoſe Authority, Intereſt and Privilege was then as much
ſlighted and deſpiſed as Ours is ſince;) and eaſily paſſing over thoſe ſingular Acts
of Our Grace paſſed by Us this Parliament, or aſcribing them to their own
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60710:155"/>
wiſdom in the procurement, they concluded againſt a Malignant Party, and that
they had no hope of ſettling the Diſtractions of the Kingdom for want of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Houſe of Peers, and that concurrence was deſperate by reaſon of the
Prevalency of the Biſhops and of the Recuſant Lords, into which number all thoſe
Lords were caſt who preſumed to diſſent from any Propoſitions made by the Houſe of
Commons. When this Engine was prepared for the People by the prime Leaders of
that deſperate Faction, it was preſented to the Houſe of Commons, and the greateſt
induſtry and skill uſed that is imaginable by private Sollicitations, Threats and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
to procure conſent, that it might be paſſed by that Houſe: and after a long
debate (longer than ever was known in Parliament, till three of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
from ten the day before, when very many, through wearineſs and weakneſs,
were forced to leave the Houſe; ſo that it looked (as was well ſaid) like the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of the Starved Jury) they carryed it by eleven Voices. And ſhortly, within
very few days after Our return (when We had been received with all poſſible expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Joy by Our City of <hi>London,</hi> which was publickly murmured againſt, and
the chief advancers of that Duty and Affection diſcountenanced, as if they envied
Us the Loyalty of Our People, and when it was publickly ſaid in Our Houſe
of Commons, upon ſome diſpute of a pretended breach of the Orders of the
Houſe, <hi>That their Diſcipline ought to be ſevere, for the Enemy was in view</hi>) that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
was preſented to Us at Our Court, at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, by ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Houſe of Commons, with a Petition (contracting the ſharp Language in
the Remonſtrance into leſs room) amongſt other things, That We would concurr
with Our People for depriving the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament, (for which
there was no Bill paſſed both Houſes) and to employ ſuch Perſons about Us as
Our Parliament might confide in. We received this ſtrange Petition, and ſtranger Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
graciouſly from the hands of the Preſenters, promiſed them an Anſwer,
and in the mean time deſired that the Remonſtrance might not be publiſhed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the thing it ſelf, and the printing any thing of the like nature, being never heard
of by the direction of the Houſe of Commons till this Parliament, it being the firſt
appeal to the People, and of a dangerous conſequence to Parliaments themſelves. But
(as in other things neither Our Deſires or Commands have been conſidered) without
giving Us leiſure to anſwer either the one or the other, ſpecial direction is given for the
printing that Remonſtrance, and equal care taken for the publiſhing it in all places and
parts of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this care for the ſhaking and perplexing the minds of all men, the
next work was to get ſuch a Power into their hands as might govern and diſpoſe of
thoſe Affections. To this purpoſe they had from the beginning of the Parliament (by
reaſon of ſome complaints againſt the immoderate exerciſe of the authority of the
Lieutenants and their Deputies in raiſing Coat and Conduct-money, and ſome exceſſes
in them) had ſeveral debates in the diminution of the Office it ſelf; but ſtill
grounded upon the illegal Preſſures uſed by them, and upon ſome words in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
it ſelf, which (though of long uſage in very happy days) were conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not agreeable to the Law: but they were ſo far from ſuppoſing the Office it
ſelf or Commiſſion to be illegal, that both Houſes of Parliament had recommended
two Lords to Us, and deſired Our Commiſſion to make them Lords Lieutenants
of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and <hi>Dorſetſhire;</hi> the only end ſeeming then to be, that good and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
men ſhould be in thoſe imployments and truſts. But at laſt they reſolved againſt
the Office it ſelf, and would think of ſome other way to provide for the ſafety of the
Kingdom in that point; and in this they had a double end: Firſt, to fright all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(Members of both Houſes, who had been Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants)
to comply with them in their Votes, leſt they ſhould be called in queſtion
for the execution of thoſe Offices (a Stratagem they had found to engage many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to their Opinions, as Sheriffs for the collecting Ship-money, and all other
perſons who in truth were or might be made obnoxious to their Power:) then,
that by unſettling that whole buſineſs of the <hi>Militia</hi> throughout the Kingdom, they
might the more eaſily bring in their own power of governing it, as they have
ſince endeavoured to do. And thereupon they preſumed to bring in ſuch a Bill into the
Houſe of Commons, to place a General at Land and an Admiral at Sea by Act
of Parliament, with ſuch Power and Authority over the Lives and Fortunes of
all Our Subjects, as ſhould be liable to no control nor to be queſtioned by any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent
hand, with a pre-pardon for whatſoever they ſhould do under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of thoſe Offices, either of which Officers ſhould have been a much greater
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60710:156"/>
Man than Our Self, and commanded in Our Kingdom above Us: the matter of which
Bill, to ſhew their Deſign, is ſince digeſted into their new Generals Commiſſion, and
the pretended Ordinance to the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> And all this was then pretended to
be a matter of abſolute Neceſſity for the Preſervation of Us and Our Kingdom; but
at that time it could procure no other credit, than to be ſuffered to reſt in the Houſe as
an evidence of the liberty might be uſed in the preferring of Bills. They had by this
time taken all the licence at their private Cabals to undervalue and vilifie Our Perſon
and Our Power, and in publick, to give way and countenance to any Scandals upon Us.
Letters from the Mayor of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> call themſelves <hi>The
Queen's Army,</hi> and pretend the King's Authority for what they do, and ſtore of ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes
upon ſuch Evidence is every week printed in the Journals of the Houſe; which
without doubt muſt be of great authority with Our People, who muſt conceive ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
to be not only fully and clearly proved, but to be accepted and publiſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very weighty reaſons above the conſideration of Our Honour and Safety.</p>
                     <p>And now they were to examine what notable credit their Remonſtrance and their
other general Infuſions had got with the People, and how ready they would be upon any
occaſions to venture themſelves at their direction. They had made themſelves ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
in the Houſe of Commons, that by their Threats and their Promiſes of Places
and Preferments to ſeveral Men, and by the abſence of many, they had gotten the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part: But in the Houſe of Lords their power was not the ſame; that muſt be wrought
another way: yet there they had uſed all means to prevail upon the hopes and fears of
ſuch who they thought might that way be dealt with; witneſs, among many other
things of the ſame nature, that inſolent Speech of Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Dover, That
if he looked for any Preferment, he muſt comply with them in their ways, and not hope to
have it by ſerving Vs.</hi> Shortly after their coming together upon the Receſs, a new Bill
was preferred in the Houſe of Commons, for the taking away of the Votes of Biſhops
out of the Houſe of Peers; which being once rejected before, ought not, by the Courſe
and Order of Parliament, to have been admitted again the ſame Seſſion: but that was
eaſily over-ruled, and in the Houſe of Commons it did paſs, many good Man the more
willingly concurring therein, upon hope that that Bill being once conſented to, the
Fury of that Faction, which with ſo great Violence purſued an abſolute Deſtruction
of the Eccleſiaſtical Government, would be abated, or that Rage being diſcerned, they
would loſe that ſtrength which ſupported them. But the Lords quickly found that the
Ring-leaders of that Faction had not Ingenuity enough to be compounded with; and
therefore with them it was not like to find ſo eaſie a paſſage. Now their reſort was to
the People, whom upon ſeveral occaſions they had trained down to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in great
multitudes with Swords and Clubs, and had often ſent for them when any debate was like
to be carried againſt them in either Houſe; the particulars whereof We are ready to prove.</p>
                     <p>Every Man will conceive We were in a great ſtreight, to find Our Self ſo much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of that return the conſciouſneſs of Our own Merit and the many glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
made by both Houſes bade Us to expect. We ſaw the Laws abſolutely tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
under feet, and a Deſign laid to ruin the Government of the Kingdom, and to
deſtroy Us and Our Poſterity. We ſaw this Deſign carried by a few Men, whoſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and Malice to Our Perſon We found implacable, and their Contempt of Us and Our
Authority ſo viſible and notorious, that they forbore not to expreſs it in their mention
of Us in all companies. We ſaw their Power and Intereſt to be ſo great, that they
were able to miſ-lead very many honeſt Men, and to countenance their actions under
the name of both Houſes of Parliament. We were reſolved that nothing they ſhould
do within thoſe walls ſhould provoke Us, till time and the experience good Men ſhould
have of them ſhould diſcover their purpoſes; therefore We applied Our ſelf only to
the Law, hoping that the Inſolence and Licentiouſneſs of the People might, by Our
help, be curbed by that Rule. The Tumults grew ſo notorious and ſo dangerous, that
they Threatned and Aſſaulted the Members of both Houſes; whereupon the Houſe of
Peers (which it ſeems the Lords preſent at the paſſing of one of their late Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein they deny there have been any Tumults, had forgot) at a Conference
with the Houſe of Commons twice very earneſtly deſired, that they would, for the
dignity of Parliaments, joyn with them in a Declaration for the ſuppreſſing ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.
But the prevalency of that Faction was ſo great, that though complaint was
made by Members in the Houſe of Commons, that they had been aſſaulted and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intreated
by thoſe people, even at the door of their Houſe, in ſtead of joyning with the
Lords for the ſuppreſſing or puniſhing them, ſeveral Speeches were made in juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them and commending their Affections, ſaying, <hi>They muſt not diſcourage their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60710:156"/>
friends, this being a time they muſt make uſe of all their friends;</hi> and Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> ſaying,
<hi>God forbid that the Houſe of Commons ſhould proceed in any way to diſhearten people to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their juſt deſires in ſuch away:</hi> which he had good reaſon to ſay, himſelf and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſons whom We afterwards accuſed of High Treaſon, having by great ſollicitation
and encouragement, cauſed thoſe multitudes to come down in that manner. The Lords
having in vain tried this way, appoint (upon the advice of the Judges) that a Writ be
directed to the Sheriff and Juſtices, upon divers Statutes, (which iſſued accordingly)
to ſuppreſs and hinder all tumultuous reſort: in obedience to which the Juſtices and
other Miniſters appoint the Conſtables to attend about <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to hinder that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Conflux of People. This was no ſooner done, but the Conſtables and Juſtices
of the Peace were ſent for by the Houſe of Commons, the ſetting ſuch a Watch Voted
to be a breach of Priviledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and before any Conference with the Lords by whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
that legal Writ iſſued out, the Watch diſcharged, and one of the Juſtices for doing
his Duty according to that Writ ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> About the ſame time there was a
Tumultuous Aſſembly of <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts</hi> and other Sectaries called together by
the Sound of a Bell into a place in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where the Arms and Magazine for that
Burrough were kept. The Conſtable knowing ſuch Meetings to be unlawful, and
the Conſequences of them, eſpecially in ſuch places, to be very dangerous, came amongſt
them. He was no ſooner come, but he was reproached with words, beaten and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a barbarous manner, inſomuch as he hardly eſcaped from them with his life.
Complaint was made by him to the next Juſtices, and Oath made of the truth of that
complaint: whereupon a Writ was ſent to the Sheriff to impannel a Jury according
to the Law, for the examination and finding of this Riot. This was complained of
too, and the meeting (in how tumultuous and diſorderly a manner ſoever) pretended
to be only for the drawing of a Petition againſt Biſhops, and that the Conſtable was a
friend to Biſhops, and came to croſs them, and to hinder Men from ſubſcribing that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.
Hereupon an Order was made in the Houſe of Commons, and the under-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
of <hi>Surrey</hi> by it enjoyned, that he ſhould not ſuffer any proceedings to be made upon
any inquiſition that might concern any perſons who met together to ſubſcribe a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be preferred to that Houſe. What Authority the Houſe of Commons had or
have to ſend any ſuch Injunctions, We cannot conceive; yet by this any diſorderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(let their Intentions and demeanour be never ſo Seditious) are above the reach of
the Law and Juſtice, if they pleaſe to ſay they meet to prepare any Petition to the
Houſe of Commons. And 'tis no wonder if, after all this care taken to remove all
thoſe Obſtacles the Law had put in the way to ſuch Tumults, all people took upon them
to viſit Our Parliament in ſuch manner as they thought fit, and thereupon great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of mutinous people every day reſorted to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> threatned to pull down
the Lodgings where divers of the Biſhops lay, aſſaulted ſome in their Coaches, chaſed
others with Boats by water, laid violent hands on the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> in his paſſing
to the Houſe, and had he not been reſcued by force, it is probable they had murthered
him; crying through the Streets, <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and between the two Houſes, <hi>No
Biſhops, No Biſhops, No Popiſh Lords;</hi> and miſuſed the ſeveral Members of either Houſe,
who they were informed favoured not their deſperate and Seditious ends; proclaiming
the names of ſeveral of the Peers as <hi>Evil and Rotten-Hearted Lords;</hi> attempting the
defacing the Abby at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with great Violence, and in their return from thence
made a Stand before Our Gate at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> ſaid, <hi>They would have no more Porters-Lodge,
but would ſpeak with the King when they pleaſed;</hi> and uſed ſuch deſperate Rebellious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
that We had great reaſon to believe Our own Perſon, Our Royal Conſort and
Our Children to be in evident Danger of Violence, and therefore were compelled at
Our great charge to entertain a Guard for ſecuring Us from that Danger. And yet all
this Danger is ſo ſlighted, that We are told in the laſt Declaration, after We have ſo
often urged it, <hi>That it is a Suggeſtion as falſe as the Father of Lies can invent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Licentious and unpuniſhed Tumults gave occaſion to the Biſhops (who could
not repair to the Houſe without Danger of their Lives) to make that their Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the which they were forthwith accuſed of High Treaſon by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and committed to the Tower by the Houſe of Peers, where they continued for
the ſpace of four Months at the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>That ſmall Guard We had taken for Our neceſſary Safety, and the reſort of ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
(who attended both Our Houſes of Parliament, for Mony due to them by Act of
Parliament and upon the publick Faith) to Our Court for Our Defence againſt thoſe
Tumults, was objected againſt Us, and divers counterfeit Letters were written, and
ſenſleſs Fears infuſed into the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> that We had a deſign of actual Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60710:157"/>
upon that City, and thereupon they were drawn into Arms, and put upon their
Guard againſt Us. So that there was not only no proviſion made for the ſuppreſſing
of Tumults, but that proviſion the Law had made againſt them diſcountenanced and
taken away, and We Our Self cenſured for taking ſo much ſtrength about Us as might,
for ſome time, oppoſe ſuch Force as was like to be offered to Our own Gates. What
ſhould We do? We very well knew the Contrivers of all theſe Miſchiefs, who had by
their exceeding Induſtry and Malice wrought this Diſtraction throughout the Kingdom,
ſuch a defection of Allegiance in the Common people, ſuch a damp of Trade in the
City, and ſo horrid a Confuſion in the Church, and all this to ſatisfie their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Ends and Ambition: for themſelves know what overtures have been made by
them, and with what importunity, for Offices and Preferments, what great Services
ſhould have been done for Us, and what other undertakings were (even to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Life of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) if We would confer ſuch Offices upon them.
We were ſure We could make ſuch particular proofs againſt them of a ſolemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
entred into by them for altering the Government of the Church and State,
of their deſigning Offices to themſelves and other Men, of their ſolliciting and
drawing down the Tumults to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and of their bidding the People in the
height of their rage and fury to go to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> of their ſcornful and odious mention
of Our Perſon, and their deſign of getting Our Son, the Prince, into their hands, of
their treating with Foreign Power to aſſiſt them if they ſhould fail in their enterpriſes:
Yet we ſaw too that their Intereſt and reputation was ſo great with many of both
Houſes of Parliament, their Power ſo abſolute with a multitude of <hi>Browniſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
and other Sectaries about <hi>London,</hi> who were ready to appear in a body at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that it would be a hard matter to proceed againſt them. In this ſtreight We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to do Our part in both, to give Our People a clear ſatisfaction of Our upright
Intentions to the publick, whereby they ſhould find their Happineſs did not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on ſuch Inſtruments; and to proceed againſt the Perſons of the other in a legal way,
that all the world might ſee what Ambition, Malice and Sedition had been had under
the Vizour of Conſcience and Religion. Hereupon We prepared an Anſwer to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
the Houſe of Commons had before publiſhed to the People of the State
of the Kingdom; wherein, without taking notice of the uncomely Language in, and
the Circumſtances of that Remonſtrance, We declared with as gracious and full Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as We could make, Our earneſt Reſolutions for the maintenance of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Law of the Land;
and made no leſs gracious offers to conſent to any Act that ſhould be offered for the
eaſe of tender Conſciences in matters indifferent, and very earneſtly deſired that the
ſame might be provided, and whatever elſe ſhould be thought neceſſary for the Peace
and Security of Our People: And then, that We might likewiſe manifeſt the Actions
of that Malignant Party which had done ſo much miſchief, and intended ſo much more,
We reſolved to accuſe the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hollis,</hi> Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Stroud,</hi> (who had ſo maliciouſly contrived the Ruine of Our Self and
the eſtabliſhed Government of this Church and Kingdom) and Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrigge,</hi>
who had been made their Inſtrument to obey and execute their bold and wild deſigns
of High Treaſon, as We had great reaſon to do, hoping that their Duty due to Us, and
the Obligations We had put upon Our People this Parliament, would never ſuffer the
Intereſt and reputation of theſe Men to be laid in the ſcale, and to over-weigh Our
Regal Authority and the Law of the Land, but that We ſhould have found a way
open to a fair and Legal Trial of them, which was all We deſired. How our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was in that buſineſs and Our managery of it, We have truly and at large ſet forth
in Our Anſwer to the Declaration of both Houſes of the nineteenth of <hi>May,</hi> That what
We did firſt in acquainting the Houſe of Commons with Our Accuſation by Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
at Arms, was in Correſpondence and out of regard to that Houſe, that We might
rather have them delivered to the hands of Juſtice by them, than apprehend them by
an ordinary Miniſter of Juſtice; which We were and are aſſured, whatever Doctrine is
preached to the contrary, We might well have done in the caſe of Treaſon: otherwiſe
that Maxime in the Law, acknowledged in a Petition of both Houſes to Us in the
beginning of Our Reign, in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> That in caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Felony and breach of Peace, Priviledge of Parliament doth not extend, is of no
ſignification. The words are, <hi>They find it an undoubted Right and conſtant Priviledge of
Parliament, That no Member of Parliament (ſitting the Parliament, or within the uſual
times of Priviledge of Parliament) is to be impriſoned or reſtrained without Sentence or
Order of the Houſe, unleſs it be for Treaſon, Felony, or for refuſing to give Sureties for the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60710:157"/>
Peace.</hi> In thoſe Caſes 'twas then thought a Member of either Houſe was not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from another Subject: and why We might not as well have expected that
upon Our Articles (not ſo general as a meer verbal Accuſation) of High Treaſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Houſe would have committed their ſeveral Members, as they had done ſo many
this Parliament, and about that time Twelve together (upon a confeſſed ground, which
every Man there, who knew what Treaſon was, knew that fact to be none) meerly
becauſe they were accuſed, and as the Houſe of Peers had formerly done a Member
of that Houſe, (the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>) accuſed in the ſame manner, moſt of the good
Lords being then Judges, We neither could then, nor can yet underſtand. That Our
own coming to the Houſe was to prevent that ſhedding of blood, which in all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
was likely to follow that Order made the night before, for reſiſting all ſuch
Officers who endeavoured (upon how legal Warrant ſoever) to arreſt any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of either Houſe (an Order much more unjuſtifiable by any Rule of Law
and Juſtice, by which Orders or Acts are to be examined, than any thing We
have done, or any body by Our Authority.) That Our purpoſe was no other but to
acquaint that Houſe with the matter of Our Accuſation, to deſire their Perſons might
be ſecured, and without any thought of the leaſt violation of their Priviledges. This
is that which We did: Examine now their part, and their progreſs ſince, and then judge
whoſe Priviledges have been invaded, and with how good a mind to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
they have proceeded. We were no ſooner gone but the Houſe adjourned it
ſelf, with ſome unuſual expreſſions of offence, and We were ſpeedily informed that
ſome Reports and Scandals were raiſed againſt Us in Our City of <hi>London;</hi> That We
had offered Violence to Our Houſe of Commons, come thither with force to murther
ſeveral Members, and uſed threatning Speeches there againſt Our Parliament; and
that this was but a Preface to an attempt We meant to make againſt and upon the
City. Whereupon We reſolved the next day to go to the <hi>Guild-Hall;</hi> and to ſhew
the great Confidence We had in the affections of Our ſaid City (which We expected
ſhould have begot a proportionable Confidence from them in Us) We went attended
with very few of Our own Servants, and then in the preſence of the Lord Mayor,
the Aldermen, and a very great aſſembly of the chief Citizens and others, We made
them a full Narration of what We had done the day before, and aſſured them, that We
intended no proceedings but ſuch as were moſt agreeable to the Law of the Land
and the Priviledge of Parliament. This demeanour of Ours We thought would have
given ſatisfaction to all Our loving Subjects, that if in truth We had erred in the form
of Our Proceedings, yet Our intentions were full of Juſtice and regard to the general
Law of the Land, from which We ſhall never willingly ſwerve. But in ſtead of any
application to inform our Judgment wherein we had erred, and how We were to
proceed, both Our Houſes of Parliament, under the title of Committees, adjourned
themſelves to the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Grocers-Hall;</hi> the Perſons accuſed
remove themſelves into the City, as to a Sanctuary, and there manage and contrive
buſineſs to their own ends; they cauſe Diſcourſes to be publiſhed and Infuſions to
be made of incredible danger to the City and Kingdom by that Our coming to the
Houſe; and Alarm was given to the City in the dead time of the night, That We
were coming with Horſe and Foot thither, and thereupon the whole City put in
Arms. And however the envy ſeemed to be caſt upon the Deſigns of the Papiſts,
mention was only made of actions of Our own. Their ſeditious Preachers and
Agents are by them and their ſpecial and particular directions ſent into the ſeveral
Counties to infuſe thoſe Fears and Jealouſies into the minds of Our good Subjects,
with Petitions ready drawn by them for the People to ſign; which were yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times by them changed, three or four times, before the delivery, upon accidents
and occurrences of either or both Houſes. And when many of Our poor deceived
People of Our ſeveral Counties have come to Our City of <hi>London</hi> with a Petition ſo
framed, altered and ſigned as aforeſaid, that Petition hath been ſuppreſſed, and a new
one ready drawn hath been put into their hands after their coming to Town, (inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as few of the company have known what they petitioned for) and hath been
by them preſented to one or both Houſes of Parliament, as that of <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> and
<hi>Buckinghamſhire;</hi> witneſs thoſe Petitions, and, amongſt the reſt, that from <hi>Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
which took notice of matters agreed on or diſſented from the night before the
delivery, which was hardly time enough to get ſo many thouſand hands, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
to <hi>London</hi> in that errand. The accuſed Members, to ſhew how much they were
above Us and the reach of the Law, march with a Guard of armed Men to the
place where the Committee ſate, ſit with them, and govern thoſe Counſels. Firſt,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60710:158"/>
they procure a Declaration to be ſet forth and printed from the Committee (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being reported to the Houſe, contrary to all Cuſtom and Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and againſt the Law it ſelf) with very ſtrange expreſſions of Our carriage;
and, upon the matter, requiring all people to aſſiſt them. This they cauſe to be ſent
into the City to the common-Councel, which by the undue practices of Captain <hi>Venne,</hi>
and Maſter <hi>Foulk,</hi> ſince made Alderman for his good ſervice, (their principal Agents)
they had cauſed to be altered, by putting out the graveſt and moſt ſubſtantial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and taking in perſons of deſperate Fortunes and Opinions, who they knew
would concur with them in their more deſperate Actions; (the ſame Deſign, and
the ſame way purſued to make the City of <hi>London</hi> at their diſpoſal, as had been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in the Houſe of Commons to work upon the whole Kingdom:) and with
this Common-Council Correſpondence is kept for the ſetting of unuſual Watches,
placing of Guards in ſeveral places of the City, as if ſome deſperate attempt and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
were to be made upon the whole City by Us, who were known ſcarce to have a
Guard ſtrong enough to preſerve Our own Houſe from Violence. A Commander is
appointed under the Title of Serjeant-Major-general; and, as if all Men were now
by their new Proteſtation made Judges of the Priviledges of Parliament and the
Breaches thereof, and abſolved from all Rules of Obedience, ſpecial proviſion is made,
and publick direction is given, for drawing down the Trained-bands of Our City of
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on a day appointed, to guard and bring in triumph the perſons
accuſed of High-Treaſon, as ſuch worthy Patriots that the Commonwealth it ſelf
could not ſubſiſt but with reference to them; who in their diſcourſes and by their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
to their Confederates expreſſed the greateſt Scorn of, and the moſt treaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
againſt Us that can be imagined. When We underſtood this horrid prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made againſt Us, the Power it was evident theſe perſons had to do hurt, and the
Malice We knew they bore againſt Our Perſon (which We had too great reaſon to fear
they intended to ſeize) We reſolved to yield, for the preſent, to this Storm: and ſo
the day before their coming to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> We withdrew Our Perſon, with Our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Conſort and Our Children, to Our Houſe at <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> and the rather, leſt
the Courage and Indignation of ſome of Our good Subjects might (how weakly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
yet with the effuſion of blood) oppoſe that great ſcorn intended Us; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that poſſibly by Our removing with all ſuch perſons whoſe preſence was
excepted againſt, and diſcharging that ſmall Guard which the Tumults had forced
Us to take for Our Safety, and which was urged as an Argument of Danger, and Ground
of the general Fears, might at leaſt leſſen their appearance the next day. But theſe
Powerful Perſons would by no means conceal their triumph over Us, but the next
day are guarded from their reſidence in the City with multitudes of armed Men and
Ammunition in a hoſtile and warlike manner to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The ſame Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
was uſed to provoke and incenſe Our Mariners, Maſters of Ships, and other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were ſolicited by the Agents for the accuſed Perſons, and by their ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
to expreſs their Affection likewiſe to the Cauſe in hand; and thereupon near one
hundred Lighters and Long-Boats were ſet out by water, laden with Sakers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering-Pieces,
and other Ammunition, dreſſed up with Waſt-clothes and Streamers, as
ready for fight. And in this Array, theſe Men by water and the Soldiers by land cried
out as they paſſed by, <hi>That they would thus Protect and Defend thoſe worthy Gentlemen
whom We had accuſed of High-Treaſon;</hi> and as they paſſed by Our Windows at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
ſcornfully asked <hi>what was become of Vs, whither We were gone.</hi> In this Equipage
they came to both Houſes, where it is no wonder they have been ſince able to govern,
having given ſuch teſtimony of their Power both by land and water. Let all the world
judge by what Law this Army was raiſed, and whether any Act of Ours againſt theſe
perſons was as unwarrantable as theſe proceedings.</p>
                     <p>We bore all this, being ſo much amazed at theſe Diſtractions, that We could not
eaſily find what colour the Malice of theſe Men had found out thus to out-face Us,
not yet conceiving We had broke any Priviledge, or that the caſual breaking of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
could have produced ſuch prodigious Diſtempers. But We were no ſooner adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
where Our miſtaking was, but, without recrimination or complaining of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
againſt Our Self, We ſent to both Houſes on the twelfth and fourteenth of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
by Meſſage, That in Our proceeding againſt thoſe Perſons We had not the leaſt
Intention of violating their Priviledges, which We would be willing to aſſert by any
reaſonable way We ſhould be adviſed; That We would wave Our former proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
againſts them, and when the minds of Men ſhould be compoſed, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in an unqueſtionable way; in the mean time deſired all jealouſies might be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60710:158"/>
laid aſide, and application be made to the publick and preſſing Affairs, eſpecially to
thoſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which cried for the utmoſt of Our Aſſiſtance. But it concerned thoſe
Perſons by no means to ſuffer ſuch a Compoſition; if theſe Fears and Jealouſies were
not kept up and inflamed in the People, and the Diſtractions heightned, they knew they
ſhould not only be diſappointed of the Places, Offices, Honours and Employments
they had promiſed themſelves, but be expoſed to the Juſtice of the Law, and juſt
Hatred of all good Men. Therefore the buſineſs of both Kingdoms was not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Intereſts of the Six Members, who would be thought the Pillars both of
Church and State. They had now found a danger nearer hand than <hi>Ireland,</hi> and an
Army raiſed by Us in one night at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames;</hi> and upon ſome extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Information pretended to be given to a Committee, (though ſome of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Witneſſes publickly in the Houſe diſavowed any ſuch Teſtimony) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
an Order to be framed; and though before the publiſhing of it they had full
and clear evidence to the contrary by Perſons come immediately from the place, and
teſtifying it to be moſt quiet and peaceable, they yet had power to procure that Order
to be publiſhed on the thirteenth of <hi>January,</hi> (the next day after they had received ſo
gracious a Meſſage from Us) declaring that the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lunsford</hi>
(the former of which was in the Town only with a Coach and ſix Horſes, the other
only attended by his Servant, and hath been ſince earneſtly preſſed by the Serjeant of
the Houſe of Commons (in whoſe cuſtody he was) to accuſe the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> with
promiſes that thereby himſelf ſhould be diſcharged) had gathered Troops of Horſe,
and appeared in a warlike manner at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> (being within a Mile of
Our Court) to the terror and affrightment of Our good Subjects, and to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the publick weal of the Kingdom; and therefore it was ordered, That the
Sheriff and Juſtices of the Peace ſhould, with the Aſſiſtance of the Train-Bands, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ſuch Aſſemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this way they found out to draw that County to affront
Us, and ſent multitudes of mean people, under pretence of petitioning Us, to ſhew Us
how unſecure Our Reſidence was like to be there too, and ſo in a ſhort time compelled
Us, Our Royal Conſort and Our Children, to remove to Our Caſtle at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They proceed then by a Cloſe Committee (a thing ſcarce heard of till this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of dangerous conſequence to the fame and reputation of all Men) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
ſuch mean, unknown perſons as they had by Threats and Promiſes ſolicited to
that purpoſe, concerning the circumſtances of Our coming to the Houſe, exhibiting
bold and malicious Interrogatories and Queſtions concerning Our Self; and upon ſuch
wild Informations of deſperate perſons, contrary to the known truth, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
other Examinations which they had taken, and by which the contrary to what
they would have the People believe would have appeared, particularly that very full
Examination of Captain <hi>Aſhley,</hi> wherein Our publick and peremptory Commands
againſt all manner of Violence (though provoked) are ſufficiently manifeſted, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
an infamous Declaration to be publiſhed by the Houſe of Commons (for the
Houſe of Peers could not be yet prevailed with to joyn in thoſe Extravagancies) on
the ſeventeenth of <hi>January,</hi> mentioning Our coming to the Houſe, and ſome rude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of ſome perſons, (who, if there were any ſuch perſons there, We are moſt
confident they were not of Our Train) and would infer from ſome Mens calling for
the Word at Our coming out of the Houſe (which is a form uſed in Our Court, that
thoſe of Our Train who are before may know when and whither they are to go) that
We had a purpoſe to have fallen upon the Houſe of Commons, and to have cut all
their Throats; and do therefore declare, That <hi>Our coming to the Houſe was a traitorous
Deſign againſt the King and Parliament; That Our Proclamation iſſued out of the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of them was falſe, ſcandalous and illegal; That it was lawful for all Men to harbour
them, and that whoſever did ſo, ſhould be under the Protection and Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
with many other expreſſions of and aſperſions upon Us, which they hoped
would render Us odious to Our good Subjects, and force Us for Our ſafety to ſubmit
to ſuch unreaſonable Propoſitions which amongſt themſelves they had provided to be
offered to Us, or provoke Us to ſuch Actions as might give them ſome advantage. To
keep the People in a continual Alarm and apprehenſion of Danger, few days paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome pretended Diſcovery by Sir <hi>Walter Earl</hi> or other quick-ſighted Men, of ſome
Treaſon or Plot againſt the Parliament, the City, or the Kingdom; and upon every
light and impoſſible Information many of Our Subjects ſent for out of ſeveral Counties,
who, after chargeable attendance, were diſmiſſed without any reparation or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
One day the Tower of <hi>London</hi> is in danger to be taken, and Information
given, That great Multitudes, at leaſt a hundred, had that day reſorted to viſit a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60710:159"/>
Prieſt, then a Priſoner there by Order of the Lords, and that at the time of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
above fifty or threeſcore were then there, and a Warder diſpatched of purpoſe to
give that notice: upon enquiry, but four Perſons were then found to be there, and but
eight all that day, who had viſited that Prieſt. Another day a Tailour in a Ditch, in
the open fields, over-hears two Paſſengers to plot the death of Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Members of both Houſes: then Libellous Letters found in the Streets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
names (probably contrived by themſelves, and by their Power publiſhed, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and entred in their Journals;) and Intimations given of the Papiſts training un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, and of notable proviſion of Ammunition in Houſes, where, upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
a ſingle Sword and a Bow and Arrows are found: a deſign of the Inhabitants
of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> to murther the City of <hi>London:</hi> news from <hi>France, Italy, Spain</hi> and
<hi>Denmark,</hi> of Arms ready to come for <hi>England;</hi> with infinite ſuch ridiculous Diſcourſes,
which are not only ſuffered and directed to be Printed, but ſuch countenance and credit
given to them, that thereupon Guards muſt be doubled, Correſpondencies and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
interrupted and broken open, even of and to Forein Miniſters of State and Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
to the Scandal of the Nation, and againſt the Laws of Society and Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:
a Committee appointed for Information, where Liberty hath been taken,
without any Accuſation or Complaint extant, to examine the diſcourſes paſſed at Meals
and Entertainments, what words ſuch a Man ſpoke; and ſuch other monſtrous things
as in a ſhort time will render life it ſelf unpleaſant, and make every Room and every
Table a bait to betray Men, and to bring them to ruine and deſtruction. Inſomuch
as perſons have been ſent and imployed by Members of that Committee on purpoſe to
the Tables of Perſons of Honour and Quality, to enquire, obſerve and inform what
Language and Freedom was there uſed; whileſt theſe Worthy accuſed Members took
the Liberty to themſelves in all their private Meetings, and by their Letters, to Deprave
and Slander Our Perſon to contrive the Alteration of the Government of the Church
and State, to treat with Forein Power to aſſiſt them as ſoon as their Deſigns ſhould
be ripe, to labour by Promiſes and Threats to bring the ſeveral Members of either
Houſe to their opinion, and to raiſe Scandals upon, and to plot Danger and Ruine for
thoſe who were of another opinion.</p>
                     <p>And having now by theſe Arts diſquieted and diſtracted the People abroad, and
made them fit to receive any impreſſions from them, they proceed to work upon the
Members of both Houſes with infinite Induſtry and Applications, that they might be
able to get the reputation of Conſent from them, to encourage and ſet the People a work,
if We refuſed to conſent with them. They had remoed as many Members from them
of a contrary opinion as they could, and had uſed all means to get Men who would be
diſpoſed by them into their rooms. If they found any ſuch Lord, who had not a name
in their Liſt of the good Lords, were like to have any influence upon a Place where
an Election was to be, preſently an Order was conceived and publiſhed, That no Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from any Noble-man ought to be written in ſuch Caſes, and if written, to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
but would by no means conſent that this Order ſhould conclude thoſe of the
Houſe of Commons, leſt Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> or any of thoſe bleſſed Members might not
write in the behalf of the Commonwealth for a worthy Gentleman. If any Elections
were queſtioned, whereby they were like to loſe a Man at their diſpoſal, ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and queſtions were of too private a nature to interrupt their proceedings: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Election of <hi>New-Caſtle, Warwick, Windſor,</hi> and very many other places, for
whom Perſons ſerve without and againſt the Conſent of the Burroughs for whom they
have got themſelves returned or admitted, can be heard or conſidered. If the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any ſuch Perſons hath been heard at the Committee, and they Voted out of
the Houſe as unduly choſen or returned, they will by no means ſuffer ſuch a report to
be made, leſt a good Member ſhould be loſt; as in the Caſe of Maſter <hi>Nicholas</hi> (Maſter
<hi>Pym</hi>'s Nephew) and others. Are they concerned in the contrary, and is any Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and admitted whom they would be rid of, and againſt whom the leaſt pretence
is made? ſtraight a day is appointed, no buſineſs ſo great, as fit to be a Cauſe to keep
a worthy Member from the Service of his Countrey: This is the Caſe of <hi>Andover,</hi> and
other places. They rid themſelves of thoſe (how juſtly ſoever elected) whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are not ſuteable, nor their Diſpoſitions weak and guilty enough to be wrought
upon. Their next Conqueſt muſt be of thoſe whom they could under any general
Vote conclude to be obnoxious to the Juſtice (and ſo to be within the Mercy) of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
To this purpoſe their terrible Votes (which they keep as Rods over them,
having never proceeded againſt any) againſt all thoſe Lords who had concurred in
ſuch an Order at the Council-Table, or ſuch a Cenſure in the Star-Chamber; againſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60710:159"/>
all Lords Lieutenants and their Deputies, who had raiſed Coat and Conduct-money;
againſt all Sheriffs who had levied Ship-money; againſt all Lords and others who
had been concerned in, or received profit by any Monopoly or illegal Patent; in a
word, againſt all ſuch who had medled in any thing which their Interpretation would
call grievous to the Subject, brought all Perſons of either Houſe, who had guilt
enough to doubt themſelves, or want of Spirit enough to fear them, either to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or ſilent, or to comply with them. And if any Man had the Courage to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſingle buſineſs juſtly and by it ſelf, they were ſtraight making an Inquiſition
into his whole life, and preparing ſomething againſt him for matters of which their
Favourites were equally guilty;<note place="margin">Mr. Pym.</note>
 and declared publickly, <hi>That what diſſervice ſoever any
Man had done formerly, if his preſent Actions were ſuch as brought benefit to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
he ought not to be queſtioned for what was paſt, but cheriſhed and protected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They had ſeveral Baits to catch and betray other Men. Thoſe who had been from
the beginning deceived by them, and complied with them in their paſſion, and been
ſubtilly involved in ſome of their private counſels, they perſwaded, That they were ſo
far in, there was no retiring; that We would never forget the diſ-ſervice they had
done Us; and therefore that there was no way to ſafety for themſelves but by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Us, and putting themſelves into ſuch a condition as it ſhould not be in Our Power
to ſuppreſs them. To thoſe who had publick thoughts about them, and deſired
the eſtabliſhment of right equally between Us and Our Subjects, and thought that
right and favour they had obtained from Us this Parliament could never be enjoyed
by them with that luſtre and ſecurity, if the Power from which they received it were
oppreſſed or rendred of leſs veneration, they ſeemed abundantly ſatisfied with thoſe Acts
We had paſſed, that they had no further aim than to enjoy thoſe; but that they had
upon Our unwilling paſſing thoſe Acts (which all the world knows to be an Untruth
moſt maliciouſly framed) great reaſon to fear, We meant not to obſerve them: when in
truth We had, by the Bill for the Triennial Parliament, put Our Self and Our Poſterity
(which We were willing to do) out of any poſſibility of deſtroying or not obſerving
thoſe good Laws, To thoſe who were deſirous to give that ſatisfaction to weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
that they might be eaſed of unneceſſary Ceremonies, yet were ſcandalized at
the prophane and odious Licence which the Rabble of <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts</hi> and other
Sectaries took to themſelves of deſpiſing and reviling the Book of Common-Prayer, of
ſuffering Mechanick, Ignorant fellows to undertake publickly, even in Churches, to
preach and expound the Scripture, they ſeemed no leſs to be diſquieted at that Diſorder,
but alledge that all Reconciliation and Union was to be embraced and purſued againſt
the Common Enemy the Papiſt (from whom the Danger was principally to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;)
and when a perfect Victory was obtained againſt them, they ſhould eaſily bring
the other poor harmleſs Creatures to Conformity. Thoſe who out of Lazineſs and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-ſpiritedneſs
were apt to comply with that part which was at laſt likely to prevail,
they informed and aſſured confidently, That they had thoſe about Us, who would
at laſt perſwade Us to yield to all they demanded; and that all Places and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
ſhould attend their directions, and be diſpoſed by them, and that all ſuch
who oppoſed them ſhould be inevitably deſtroyed. Thoſe whom neither their Skill
nor Importunity, their Threats nor their Promiſes could prevail with to comply
in their bad ways, they proſcribed as a Malignant Party, and having caſt all the
aſperſions upon them Folly and Madneſs could deviſe, expoſed them to be torn in
pieces by the People.</p>
                     <p>And having thus diſpoſed themſelves and perplexed the People, they proceed to lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Foundation of Greatneſs and Power to themſelves they had from the beginning
contrived: and as if all the Pillars upon which the Peace and Happineſs and Being of
this Kingdom was founded, were now ſhaken by the attempt againſt thoſe ſix Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
perſons, and that all Our Power were therefore to be transferred into other hands,
they cauſe the matter of the Bill formerly exhibited in <hi>October</hi> before to be again
reviewed; and now all the Forts and Caſtles of the Kingdom, and the whole <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
muſt be put into ſuch hands as they might confide in. A Garriſon muſt be put
into Our Town of <hi>Hall,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> appointed Governour of it, to whom
the Mayor of <hi>York</hi> is ordered to diſpoſe 2000 pound out of the Poll-money, which
was to pay the Arrears due to that County for Billet, and the great Debt to Our
Subjects of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And when the Mayor and principal Aldermen of <hi>Hull</hi> refuſe
to receive that Garriſon, and urge the Petition of Right, that they may not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to billet thoſe Souldiers, they are ſent for to the Houſe of Commons, and there
kept in a tedious and chargeable Attendance, till the Garriſon be taken in, being ſent
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60710:160"/>
for to no other purpoſe. Our Own Magazine muſt be managed and diſpoſed by their
diſcretion.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> John Biron.</note>
 The Tower of London muſt be put into their hands, and a Perſon againſt
whom Malice it ſelf could not find the leaſt accuſation muſt be removed, for no other
reaſon but becauſe We had a good opinion of him.</p>
                     <p>They who are the ſtricteſt in their Cenſure of Us and of Our Eaſineſs will find,
upon this State of things, that We had enough to do, and that there was much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to reſolve. We will never deny that Our extream tenderneſs of the Peace of
the Kingdom, and Our great Grief of heart to ſee Our good Subjects miſ-led in their
Duty and Affection, begot more of Our Compaſſion and Pity than of Our Anger and
Indignation, ſo that We were more awake to the ſenſe of the Calamity and Miſery
which in all probability was like to befal them, than of Our own Honour and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore, without expreſſing the leaſt reſentment of all the Scorns and Injuries
put upon Us, and to ſhew how much Our Soul was poſſeſſed with the care of Our
People, We ſent a Meſſage to both Our Houſes of Parliament from <hi>Windſor</hi> on the
twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> deſiring them, for the compoſing the miſerable Diſtractions of
the Kingdom, to enter ſpeedily into a ſerious conſideration of all particulars, as well
thoſe which might concern their Privileges, their Liberty and their Property, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the true Religion and the ſettling of Ceremonies, as thoſe of Our juſt Regal
Authority and Revenue, that ſo both We and they might make a clear Judgement of
them, and We might make it appear how far We were from giving grounds for thoſe
Fears and Jealouſies, by exceeding the examples of the moſt indulgent Princes in Our
Acts of Grace and Favour to Our People. No body will blame Us, if We expected
at leaſt ſuch an Anſwer as might bring Us and Our Houſes of Parliament to an iſſue,
that We might temperately debate what was to be done: But they who well knew
the nature of their own demands, and what they meant to inſiſt upon, would by no
means that things ſhould be brought into ſo little Room, or diſcover the particulars
of their Deſires, till they ſaw what Strength they were like to have to ſecond thoſe
Deſires; therefore a new Adjournment is made to <hi>Grocers-Hall</hi> to conſult of Evils
and Remedies; ſeveral Petitions, framed and contrived by theſe perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are ſent into the ſeveral Counties, and multitudes of people reſort every day to
both Houſes with Petitions, avowing the Fears and Jealouſies theſe men had infuſed
into them, and deſiring to have the Kingdom put into a poſture of Defence, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their ſtout Reſolutions to maintain the Privilege of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In this Triumph they vouchſafe to petition Us to proceed againſt the Members ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
or elſe that they might be publickly quit. We were reſolved to give them no
more advantage upon breach of Privilege, and therefore deſired to be informed which
way We were to proceed, and whether We might prefer Indictments againſt them at
the Common-Law. We were anſwered that no proceeding ſhould be againſt them
without Conſent of that Houſe of which they were Members; and therefore We were
deſired within three days to inform both Houſes what proof We had againſt them,
or elſe they ſhould be cleared: and they had before cauſed their falſe, ſcandalous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the fourteenth of <hi>January,</hi> of Our coming to the Houſe, to be new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
together with the Proteſtation, and to be ſent over the whole Kingdom by the
Knights and Burgeſſes, as if by the one they were obliged to defend the other. In
this caſe no Man will believe We had reaſon to bring in Our Proofs againſt theſe Men,
and to publiſh Our Evidence, when We were told it was in the power of the major
part to chuſe whether they ſhould be tried or no: And We might eaſily ſee, and all
the world will judge by the proceedings then, and their publick expreſſions ſince, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if We had proved a Conſpiracy amongſt them to have taken away Our Life,
they would not have found ſome diſtinction between Our Perſon and Our Office,
which ſhould have preſerved theſe Perſons from the hand and courſe of Juſtice; and
to what other end that Doctrine ſhould be publiſhed with ſo much paſſion, <hi>That in
caſe of Treaſon We might not proceed againſt any Member but by Conſent of the Houſe,</hi>
(ſo contrary to Cuſtom, Law and Reaſon) but to let all Men know it ſhould not
be in Our Power to queſtion them for any thing they ſhould do againſt Us, let the
Law be never ſo clear in the point. Upon all theſe Conſiderations, rather than to
waſte time in the diſpute, when they were reſolved to be their own Judges too, We
fent them word by Our Anſwer to their Petition of the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> That We
found We had good cauſe to deſert any Proſecution of thoſe Members, and further of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffered
to grant ſuch a free and a general Pardon to all Our loving Subjects as ſhould be
thought fit by the advice of both Houſes, which We thought to be the beſt way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all Fears and Jealouſies of what kind ſoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:60710:160"/>
But the Buſineſs of theſe Men could not be done that way; a general Pardon
would never have ſettled the <hi>Militia,</hi> and diſpoſſeſſed Us of thoſe Rights and that Power
without which they could not compaſs their Deſigns: They now reſort to their old
refuge, the Common People of the City and Suburbs, and whatever they deſired, theſe
Men muſt ask, for the ſatisfaction of the Fears and Jealouſies of the City. The City
had been deſired to lend a hundred thouſand pounds for the relief of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and
their Anſwer is drawn up to their hands, of their inability to lend, and ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
given as might advance what had been upon general Diſcourſes neglected. The
ten thouſand Men proffered by the <hi>Scots</hi> for <hi>Ireland</hi> were not accepted. A Bill having
been offered Us for Preſſing, and in it a Clauſe (not neceſſary to the preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
purpoſely, as We conceive, put in, in hope We would upon that refuſe it) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Us to have no power to preſs, (a Power conſtantly practiſed by Our Anceſtors,
and even in the bleſſed times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>) Our pauſe upon it was urged as
a Deſign to lofe that Kingdom, although We had offered to raiſe ten thouſand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers
for that purpoſe, if they would pay them. The not ſecuring the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
(though the Cuſtody of them was in a Noble Perſon, againſt whom the leaſt
exception could not be made) and the not ſettling the Kingdom in a Poſture of Defence;
the not removing Sir <hi>John Byron</hi> from being Lieutenant of the Tower, whereby
through diſtruſt they were forced to forbear the bringing in of Bullion to the Mint,
(when'tis notoriouſly known, there was more Bullion brought in to Our Mint in
the time that Gentleman was Lieutenant, than in the ſame quantity of time in any
Mans Remembrance;) the Votes of the Biſhops and the Popiſh Lords in the Houſe
of Peers, and all others things which were then in Deſign, and had in vain been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them by the refuſal of the Houſe of Peers ſeveral times to joyn with them, were
now urged as principal reaſons, by this Petition of <hi>London,</hi> why they could not lend
a hundred thouſand pounds to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were preſſed by ſeveral other Petitions
contrived by them, and preſented to both Houſes, or to the Houſe of Commons. And
theſe Petitions are carried up to the Lords by Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> who takes upon him to
reproach them for not concurring with the Houſe of Commons, and impudently lays
that Scandal upon Us, That We had ſuffered many to paſs by Our own immediate
Warrant, who were ſince Commanders in the head of the Rebels. A falſe and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Scandal, raiſed by his own Malice, to draw Our good Subjects againſt Us,
without the leaſt colour or ſhadow of truth, as appears by thoſe Anſwers they have
publiſhed to Our Exception in that point, wherein there is not the leaſt Evidence of
any ſuch Warrant granted by Us: though Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> be ſo great a Perſon, that
We can have no Reparation againſt him for that Calumny; but had credit enough
with the Houſe of Commons, to perſwade them to charge themſelves unjuſtly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him, and to take upon them, that he had ſaid nothing in that Speech but by
their directions.</p>
                     <p>All this had not that quick operation with the Lords, with whom (though they
had committed Twelve Biſhops for Treaſon, a thing themſelves bluſh at, and the
Popiſh Lords had abſented themſelves) they could not prevail to joyn in matters ſo
unreaſonable in themſelves and diſhonourable to Us: therefore the Houſe of Commons
by themſelves Petition Us, thank Us for Our Meſſage of the twentieth of <hi>January,</hi>
though they have ſince declared it to be a breach of Privilege, reſolving to take it into
ſerious and ſpeedy Conſideration; only deſire for their ſecurity, That We will put the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and all the Forts of the Kingdom, and the whole <hi>Militia</hi> into ſuch
hands as ſhould be recommended unto Us by them, (for the Houſe of Peers had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to joyn with them, and ſo were upon the matter petitioned againſt, and left out
in the power of recommendation.) Sure this was the ſtrangeſt Petition that, till that
time, had ever been preſented by the Houſe of Commons to their King: yet We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
a gracious Anſwer, That if any particular ſhould be preſented to Us, whereby
it might appear that the Lieutenant of the Tower was unfit for the truſt We had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, We would immediately remove him; otherwiſe We were obliged in
Honour and Juſtice, not to put ſuch a Diſgrace upon him. For the Forts and Caſtles,
that We were reſolved they ſhould be always in ſuch hands, and only in ſuch, as Our
Parliament ſhould have cauſe to confide in; that We would have the nomination of
them Our Self, but that they ſhould be always left (if any thing were objected againſt
them) to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of the Parliament. For the <hi>Militia,</hi> that when
ſome particular courſe ſhould be propoſed to Us for the ordering of it, We ſhould return
an Anſwer agreeable to Honour and Juſtice, as appears more at large in Our Anſwer
of the 28. of <hi>February</hi> to that Petition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:60710:161"/>
This gave them no better ſatisfaction than the former; but finding that without the
Conſent of the Houſe of Peers (of whom much the major part, though the Popiſh Lords
and the Biſhops were abſent, diſſented from them) and againſt Our Conſent, they
were not like to prevail over Our People, they reſolve of another Attempt upon them;
their old friends, the Multitude, muſt be again brought down by the great Conductor
Captain <hi>Venne</hi> (who is notoriouſly known, and proof thereof offered to be produced
by Maſter <hi>Kirton</hi> to the Houſe of Commons, to have ſeveral times ſent to, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
People to come down out of the City with Swords and Piſtols, when he hath
told them, or ſent them word by his Wife, that <hi>the worſer Party was like to have the
better of the good Party;</hi> and for all which publick offer, neither was Maſter <hi>Venne</hi> then
ſuffered to anſwer to this Charge, nor Maſter <hi>Kirton</hi> allowed any time (though many
days were ſet) to bring in the particulars and witneſſes.) Many Perſons are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
to ſet their hands againſt the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> That they durſt not bring
in any Bullion to the Mint, for want of Confidence, when they never brought in any
in their lives: and being asked how they could ſet their hands to ſuch a Certificate,
when it was known that never greater quantity was brought in than at that time;
anſwered, <hi>That they were directed by Parliament-men to do ſo, or elſe they could not
compaſs their Ends.</hi> And having gotten Multitudes of People of ſeveral Counties,
(OF ſuch as pretended to be ſo) to deliver Petitions to both Houſes, and to deſire leave
that they might proteſt againſt thoſe Lords who would not agree to the Votes of the
Houſe of Commons, as the Petitions of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> do, and perſwaded
others, in the name of many thouſands of poor People in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi>
to Petition againſt a Malignant Faction which made abortive all thoſe good Intentions
which tended to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom, and to deſire, <hi>That thoſe
Noble Worthies of the Houſe of Peers who concurred with them in their happy Votes, might
be earneſtly deſired to joyn with the Houſe of Commons, and to ſit and Vote as one entire
body;</hi> profeſſing, that unleſs ſome ſpeedy remedy were taken for the removal of all ſuch
Obſtructions as hindered the happy Progreſs of their great Endeavours, <hi>the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
ſhould not reſt in quietneſs, but ſhould be enforced to lay hold on the next remedy which
was at hand, to remove the Diſturbers of their Peace,</hi> and (want and neceſſity breaking
the bounds of modeſty) <hi>not to leave any means unaſſayed for their relief;</hi> adding, that the
cry of the poor and needy was, <hi>That ſuch Perſons,</hi> who were the Obſtacles of their Peace,
and Hinderers of the happy proceedings of this Parliament, might be forthwith publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
whoſe removal they conceived would put a period to thoſe Diſtractions, after it had
been ſaid in the Houſe of Peers, That <hi>whoever would not conſent to the Propoſition made
by the Houſe of Commons concerning the Forts, Caſtles and the</hi> Militia, (when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by a major part twice) <hi>was an Enemy to the Commonwealth.</hi> This Petition was
brought up to the Houſe of Lords by the Houſe of Commons at a Conference; and
after the ſame day Maſter <hi>Hollis</hi> (a Perſon formerly accuſed by Us of High Treaſon,
and a moſt malicious Promoter and Contriver of thoſe Petitions and Tumults) preſſed
the Lords, at the Bar, to joyn with the Houſe of Commons in their deſire about the
<hi>Militia,</hi> and further (with many other expreſſions of like nature) deſired in words to
this effect, <hi>That (if that deſire of the Houſe of Commons were not aſſented to) thoſe Lords
who were willing to concur, would find ſome means to make themſelves known, that it might
be known who were againſt them, and they might make it known to them who ſent them.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Petition ſo ſtrangely framed, countenanced and ſeconded, ſo great a number
of the Lords departed, that that Vote paſſed (which they had ſo often before denied)
in order to the Ordinance concerning the <hi>Militia;</hi> and ſince that time they have been
able to carry any thing: and, upon the matter, the Reſolution of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
hath been wholly guided by thoſe Perſons who had given ſo plain evidence that
they had the Multitude at their Command, and hath wholly guided that of the Houſe
of Peers, who with little debate or diſpute have, for the moſt part, ſubmitted to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
hath been brought to them.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after they paſſed their Ordinance, with ſuch a Preamble as highly concerned
Us in Honour and Juſtice to proteſt againſt, and wholly excluding Us (in whom that
whole Power abſolutely was and is) from any Power or Authority in the <hi>Militia,</hi> the
Arms and Strength of the Kingdom, and that for as long as they pleaſed. And as if
the matter were not worth the conſidering, or that there ought to be no other meaſure
to guide Us in point of Judgment or Underſtanding but their Votes, it was ill taken
that We did not immediately return Our Anſwer, but took ſome time to conſider it; and
We were again with great paſſion and impatience preſſed to give Our Anſwer, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleaſed to tell Us, <hi>They could not but interpret the Delay to be in a degree a Denial:</hi> and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60710:161"/>
in the mean time, to give Us an inſtance how modeſtly they were like to uſe ſuch Power
when We ſhould commit it to them, they preſumed of themſelves (knowing We had
appointed Our Son, the Prince, to meet Us at <hi>Greenwich</hi> in Our return from <hi>Dover</hi>) to
inhibite his meeting Us there, and to endeavour to get him into their cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things conſidered, and the Inſolence and Injuſtice of the Ordinance, We
might very well have rejected that Propoſition with a flat denial and juſt indignation;
but We eaſily perceived, that Our good People were miſled by the Cunning and Malice
of thoſe <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> and thought it always compliance worthy a Prince to take all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pains to undeceive ſuch who are led into miſtakings: and therefore We returned
to their Propoſition for the Ordinance a gracious Anſwer and Animadverſion; made it
evident to them, that the Preamble was in it ſelf untrue and againſt Our Honour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, and expreſſed Our clear intention in Our going to Our Houſe of Commons.
We allowed all thoſe perſons recommended to Us (except only in Corporations, to whom
a Right was formerly granted by Charter, not conſiſtent with this Ordinance) and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to grant ſuch Commiſſions to them as had very long and happily been uſed in this
Kingdom, and which We had this very Parliament granted to two Lords at the inſtance
and intreaty of both Houſes. If that Power ſhould not be thought enough, We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to grant any ſhould be firſt veſted in Us, and ſo we be enabled to grant; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that the whole might be digeſted into an Act of Parliament, whereby Our good
Subjects might know what they were to do, and what they were to ſuffer, that there
might be the leaſt latitude for the exerciſing of any Arbitrary Power over them.
Which Anſwer We deſire all Our Subjects to read and conſider, whether We did not
thereby grant all which themſelves had firſt deſired; and whether there was cauſe to
vote ſuch who adviſed that Anſwer to be enemies to the State, and miſchievous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
againſt the Defence of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But as if all the Acts paſſed by Us (amongſt which that for the taking away the
Votes of Biſhops out of the Houſe of Peers was the laſt) were of no other value, but
as inſtances that We would never deny them any thing, they immediately in great fury
addreſs themſelves to Us with a new <hi>humble Petition,</hi> (as they called it, but it was indeed
a Threatning) and told Us plainly, That if We would not then (in that inſtant) give
Our Royal aſſent to their Ordinance, they were reſolved to diſpoſe of the <hi>Militia</hi> by the
Authority of both Houſes without Us; adviſed Us to ſtay about <hi>London,</hi> to put away
evil Counſellors, and to let Our Son, the Prince, be and continue at S. <hi>James's,</hi> or ſome
other of Our Houſes near about <hi>London,</hi> that the Jealouſies and Fears of Our People
might be prevented. We muſt appeal to all the World, whether, conſidering what had
been done in publick and ſaid in private, We had no cauſe of Jealouſie; and whether, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch evidence of the Malice, Guilt, and Power of thoſe accuſed Members, who had
deſigned to have taken the Prince, Our Son, from Us by froce, it was not high time to
remove a little further from that Torrent which might have overwhelmed Us, and made
them as well, and by the ſame Rule, Maſters of Our Perſon as of Our <hi>Militia.</hi> This car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Us firſt from <hi>Theobald's</hi> to <hi>New-market:</hi> And whoſoever reads the Declaration ſent
Us thither, the ſtrange language given Us and Scandals laid upon Us in that Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will not wonder that We made all the haſte We could from thence to <hi>Tork.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What hath hapned ſince Our coming hither, both in Words and Actions, is too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to all the parts of Chriſtendom, who with wonder and delight are amazed to ſee
the Wiſdom, Courage, Affection and Loyalty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation appear ſo far ſhrunk
and confounded by the Malice, Cunning and Induſtry of perſons contemptible in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
inconſiderable in Fortune and Reputation, united only by Guilt and Conſpiracy
againſt Us. A Licence even to Treaſon is admitted (that is, not puniſhed in Pulpits;
and perſons ignorant in Learning and Underſtanding, turbulent and Seditious in diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Scandalous in life, and unconformable in Opinion to the Laws of the Land, are by
theſe Men, their recommendation and authority, impoſed upon Pariſhes, to infect and
poiſon the minds of Our People. Our Towns, Our Goods, Our Mony are taken from
Us; and to make the ſcorn compleat, care is taken to perſwade Us that We are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
but that all is done for Our good. Opinions and Reſolutions are impoſed upon
Us by Votes and Declarations, that We intended to levy War, and then Arms taken
up to deſtroy Us; Rebellions and Treaſons contrived, fomented and acted againſt Us,
and then Reproaches caſt on Us, and War raiſed againſt Us, becauſe We are diſpleaſed.
We ſend Our Command to Our Keeper of Our Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to Adjourn the
Term from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> a thing as much in Our Power as in what room of Our
Houſe We will lodge or eat. This is ſtraight Voted to be illegal, and Our Keeper of Our
Own Seal peremptorily forbid to do his Duty, to Seal a Writ or Proclamation to that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60710:162"/>
purpoſe; and when, in Obedience to Our expreſs Command, he comes to wait on Us,
he is purſued with a Warrant to all Mayors, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs and other
Officers, to apprehend him. A Committee is ſent down into the Countries near Us
to execute their pretended Ordinance, who compel Our Subjects to take Arms againſt
Us, and threaten and impriſon ſuch as refuſe, without the leaſt colour of Law; whilſt
ſuch who execute Our legal Commiſſion of Array are ſent for as Delinquents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be Enemies to the Kingdom. Our own Monies ſeized upon at <hi>London,</hi> and
no ſupply ſuffered to be ſent Us; all perſons are forbid to come to Us, and charge given
to all Men near the Northern Road, to ſtop all Men and Horſes who are for Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
coming to <hi>York,</hi> there being (as Maſter <hi>Hollis</hi> ſays in his Speech, of which he hath the
ſole Printing, and hath granted that Monopoly to one <hi>Vnderhill</hi>) a mark ſet upon that
Place, and an opinion declared concerning thoſe who ſhall reſort thither. Our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
are ſhut up, and Our good Subjects are hindred in their journies, and their goods
ſeized and detained from them, becauſe they have occaſions to uſe them in the North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Our own Houſhold Servants refuſe to attend Us upon Our Summons; and then the
putting them from their Places is voted an injury to the Parliament, and whoſoever ſhall
accept of thoſe Places, to offer an affront to the Parliament, and render themſelves Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of any place of Honour or Truſt in the Commonwealth. Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> is
commended and protected for keeping Us out of Our Town of <hi>Hull</hi> by Force and Arms;
and Our raiſing a Guard for Our Defence is voted levying War againſt Our Parliament,
whilſt he murthers Our Subjects, takes them Priſoners, burns their Houſes, drowns their
Land, and robs all Men he can lay hold of, and commits all the inſolent Acts of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt Us and Our Subjects which the moſt equal and declared Enemies practiſe in
any Country. And when, after all theſe Outrages, Our miſerable Subjects throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at Our feet, crying for and challenging Our Protection, We muſt not perform that
Duty towards them, nor preſume to ſay Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> is a Traitor, becauſe he hath
Priviledge of Parliament. Our Royal Navy, Our Own Ships are taken from Us, the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> made Our Admiral in deſpight and ſcorn of Us, who chaſes Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and makes War upon Us, under the Authority of another pretended Ordinance;
and his Letter publiſhed by the direction of the Houſe of Peers, to ſhew how eaſie it
was to make an election rather to deſpiſe Us and the known unqueſtionable Law of the
Land, than to neglect an Order of both Houſes, in a matter they have no more juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to meddle in than they have to ſell Our Houſes, Parks and Crown-Land: and they
may as lawfully ſend thoſe Ships to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ordain that We ſhall never have
more, as keep them in the Downs againſt Our Will, and under a Command We do
proteſt againſt to all the World. We are defamed and publickly reproached for want
of zeal againſt the Rebels in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and when We offer to venture Our own Perſon
and Our Crown-Land for the relief of Our miſerable Subjects there, ſuch a Journy is
voted to be againſt the Law, to be an incouragement to the Rebels, that whoſoever ſhall
aſſiſt Us in it ſhall be an Enemy to the Commonwealth, and that the Sheriffs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſhall raiſe power to ſuppreſs any Levies We ſhall make to that purpoſe. And after
all this (when it hath been publickly ſaid by Maſter <hi>Martin, That Our Office is forfeita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that the Happineſs of this Kingdom doth not depend upon Vs or any of the Regal
Branches of that Stock;</hi> and by Sir <hi>Henry Ludlow, That We are not worthy to be King of
England;</hi> and been declared, that <hi>We have no Negative voice,</hi> which puts Our Crown,
the Law of the Land, the Liberty and Property of the Subjects abſolutely into their
hands) We are told by theſe devout Champions for Anarchy and Confuſion, <hi>That We
are fairly dealt with that We are not depoſed; That if they did that, there would be neither
want of Modeſty or Duty in them:</hi> They publiſh falſe ſcandalous Declarations to corrupt
Our good Subjects in their Loyalty and Affection to Us, injoyn them to be read, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe
them with all Care and Induſtry; and ſend for all Miniſters who, according to
Our Command, publiſh Our Anſwers to undeceive Our People, as Delinquents, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
We have not prohibited any to read theirs: They commit the Lord Mayor
of <hi>London</hi> (and other Mayors) for publiſhing Our Proclamations according to Our
Writ and his Oath, and ſtreightly charge all Our miniſters of Juſtice not to obey Us:
They raiſe an Army againſt Us, and chuſe the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> for their General, and grant
him a power Over Us, the Law, and all Our People, that he may kill and deſtroy whom
he thinks fit; and impoſe an Oath upon Our Subjects, to execute all the Commands of
both Houſes: They waſte and conſume the Mony given by Act of Parliament for the
diſcharge of the great Debt of the Kingdom, and for the relief of the bleeding Condition
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> imploy the Mony brought in by the Adventurers, and thoſe Men who are
levied by Our Authority and Commiſſion, for the preſervation of Our miſerable Subjects
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60710:162"/>
there, to ſerve them in a War againſt Us; whereby all Men may ſee what reaſon We
had not to conſent to a Warrant dormant, under pretence of Levies for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
might have furniſhed them with Men to fight againſt Us, as the ſame Pretence hath done
with all the Arms We had in Our Magazines: They commit ſuch of Our Subjects to
Priſon whom they are pleaſed to ſuſpect, (as the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi>) and for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but that they believe them loyal to Us; cenſure and degrade nine Lords at a clap, for
obeying Our Summons and coming to Us, when ſcarce that number concurred in the
Judgment; and declared two others Enemies to the Commonwealth, taking their Votes
from them, without ſo much as ſummoning them to anſwer any Charge brought againſt
them: They preſume to take Tonnage and Poundage by a pretended Ordinance, without
Our Conſent, though they have ſo often preſſed it againſt Us, that We took it without
theirs; and ſo now diſpence with a <hi>Praemunire</hi> made this Parliament, as they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done with Treaſon: Laſtly, to ſhew into what hands they intend the Government of
this Kingdom ſhall be put, they have reduced the buſineſs of the whole Kingdom, from
both Houſes of Parliament, into the hands of a few deſperate perſons, who have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
committed to them to act this Tragedy without acquainting the Houſes, and ſo have
gotten the Authority of King and both Houſes of Parliament to deſtroy all Three; make
Orders to break up Houſes, take away Plate and Money, becauſe 'tis poſſible the Owners
wiſh it with Us at <hi>York;</hi> ſend Troops of Horſe to make War upon Us in what Counties
they pleaſe, and commit ſuch unheard-of Acts of Oppreſſion and Injuſtice as no Story
can parallel, where the leaſt form of Government hath been left; that all Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
may ſee by what Rules they ſhall live, and what Right they are like to enjoy, when
theſe Men have gotten the Sway, who in the infancy of their Power, and when there is
yet left ſome memory of and reverence to the Laws under which their Fathers lived ſo
happily, dare leap over all thoſe known and confeſſed Principles of Government and
Obedience, and exerciſe a Tyranny both over Prince and People more inſupportable
than Confuſion it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And for all this impudent Injuſtice (odious to God and Man) what is objected againſt
Us? That We will not be adviſed by Our Parliament. In what? what one Propoſition
that is evidently for the eaſe of Our Subjects have We denied? That We have granted
many is confeſſed. We will not conſent that the Ordinance of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhall be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
and obeyed; that is, We will not allow that both Houſes of Parliament ſhall make
Laws, and impoſe upon the Property and Liberty of Our Subjects, Without Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
(which if We ſhould yield to upon the ſame pretences of Neceſſity, a word fatal to
this Kingdom and the publick good, the Houſe of Commons might as well, and would
quickly come to make Laws without the Houſe of Peers, and the common People without
either) nor are willing that thoſe Men who have diſcovered all Malice to Our Perſon,
and diſ-eſteem and irreverence of Our Office, ſhall be legally qualified to take up Arms
againſt Us, when they ſhall be thereunto provoked by their Malice or Ambition.</p>
                     <p>There can be no new thing ſaid in this Argument; We muſt refer Our good Subjects
to Our ſeveral Anſwers, Declarations and Proclamations in that point: only it will be
worth their conſidering, that this extraordinary, unheard-of, extravagant Power was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in a caſe of peremptory Neceſſity, for the prevention of imminent Danger in the
beginning of <hi>March</hi> (how long it was in deſign before is underſtood by Sir <hi>Arthur Heſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigge</hi>
his Bill long preceeding;) whether any ſuch Danger hath been ſince diſcovered, and
whether unſpeakable Calamities have not already, and are not like to enſue from that
Fountain, We wiſh it were not too apparent. And if thoſe Fears and Jealouſies which
ſeem to make that Ordinance neceſſary were indeed real and honeſt, that in truth nothing
were deſired but putting the Kingdom into a poſture, that is, that all Our Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
might be provided with Arms, and dexterous in the uſing them, if any Invaſion or
Rebellion ſhould be, is not all this Care taken, and all this Security provided for by the
Commiſſion of Array? What honeſt end can that Ordinance have which is not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the execution of and obedience to that Commiſſion? But 'tis true, the power is
not in thoſe hands, nor like to be imployed to thoſe uſes 'tis now intended. Who hath
not heard theſe Men ſay, <hi>That the alteration they intend, and is neceſſary both in Church
and State, muſt be made by blood?</hi> Are not the Principles by which they live deſtructive
to all Laws and Compacts? Is not every thing Neceſſary they think ſo, and every thing
lawful that is in order to that Neceſſity? Sure if Our good Subjects were throughly
awake in this buſineſs, they would think they had much more cauſe to thank Us for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
this Ordinance, than for granting all that We have granted.</p>
                     <p>What is there elſe? We do not think Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> hath dealt well with Us in
keeping Our Town from Us, nor do take it kindly that We are robbed of Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60710:163"/>
and Munition, but think of recovering both by Force, becauſe We cannot have
them otherwiſe; which will be an actual levying War againſt Our Parliament. This
Argument is ſufficiently vexed too: Our good Subjects will read the Meſſages, Anſwers,
Votes and Declarations in this Caſe; and We are ſure upon the grounds laid to juſtifie
this Treaſon, no Subject in <hi>England</hi> hath a Houſe of his own which may not to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
be given to Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> for as long a term as they think fit, and he may be
ſent to morrow to murther Us, and be no Traitor, and they who ſhall ſhut the door
againſt him ſhall be Delinquents.</p>
                     <p>Is there no more? Yes We will not ſubmit to thoſe Nineteen dutiful and modeſt
Propoſitions which have been lately thrown at Us as the neceſſary means of removing
Jealouſies and Differences, and as the laſt Complement of all their Scorns and Injuries,
that Poſterity may ſee to what a tameneſs We were brought when ſuch things were
asked of Us: We will not be content that all Our Officers and Miniſters of State, be
they never ſo faithful to Us, ſo affectionate to their Country, never ſo wiſe, never ſo
honeſt, ſhall be immediately removed from Us and their places, be diſgraced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and in their rooms theſe Gentlemen (who have taken all poſſible pains to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
King and People) or ſuch whom they ſhall recommend, to ſucceed; that the ſame
Faction may be carried through the whole Kingdom, which theſe Men have raiſed in
both Houſes of Parliament; that all Affairs of the Kingdom be managed not only by
their Advice, but their abſolute Direction and Command, leſt any Man ſhould think
himſelf Our Servant; that the Education and Marriage of Our Children be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, leſt any Chriſtian Prince ſhould make addreſſes to Us in ſuch Treaties; in
a word, that in gratitude to their Modeſty and Duty for not depoſing Us, We will not
now depoſe Our Self, and ſuffer the People and Kingdom (which God and the Law hath
committed to Our Government and Protection, and for which We muſt make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
to be devoured by them. Sure theſe Men think 'tis no affront to ask any thing.</p>
                     <p>But can Our good Subjects be longer kept in this Trance? Can the Nobility,
Gentry, Clergy, Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> ſacrifice their Honour, Intereſt, Religion,
Liberty, to Terms, and the meer ſound of Parliament and Privilege? Can their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
Reaſon and Underſtanding be captivated by words and aſſumptions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to all Principles? What one thing have We denied that with reference to the
publick Peace and Happineſs were to be bought with the loſs of the meaneſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?
And yet into what a Sea of blood is the rage and fury of theſe Men launching
out, to wreſt that from Us which We are bound (if We had a thouſand lives to loſe in
the contention) to defend? Nay, what one thing is there that makes life precious to
good Men which We do not defend, and theſe Men oppoſe, and would evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy?
What Grievance or Preſſure have Our People complained of, and been eaſed by
Us, whch is not now brought upon them in an unlimited degree?</p>
                     <p>Is the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, ſealed by the blood of ſo many Reverend
Martyrs, and eſtabliſhed by the Wiſdom and Piety of former bleſſed Parliaments, dear
to them? We muſt appeal to all the world (being called upon by the Reproaches of
theſe men) whether Our own practice, (the beſt evidence of Religion) and all the
aſſiſtance and offers We can give, have been wanting to the Advancement of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And what can be more done by Us to ſatisfie and ſecure Our People in that point?
On the other ſide, let all Our good Subjects conſider and weigh what pregnant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
they have to fear Innovation in Religion if theſe deſperate perſons prevail,
when the principal Men to whoſe care and authority they have committed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery
of that part refuſe Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> as much as the
Papiſts do;<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Say.</hi>
                        </note>
 and have not only with that freedom they think fit to uſe reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Book of Common-Prayer and the Government of the Church in their Speeches,
but have publiſhed thoſe Speeches in the view of all Men in Print, that the World
might ſee by what Meaſure and Rule the Reformation they ſo much talk of is to be
made: when ſuch Petitions have been contrived by them, and accepted with publick
thanks, which revile the Book of Common-Prayer, calling it a Maſs-book, in ſcorn and
contempt of the Law; whileſt other Petitions for the Government eſtabliſhed by Law
have been rejected, diſcountenanced, and the Petitioners puniſhed: and when two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were kept in the bowels of the Kingdom ten weeks, at the charge of fourſcore
thouſand pounds a Month, for the countenance of a Bill to eradicate Epiſcopacy <hi>Root
and Branch:</hi> when ſuch licence is given to <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Sectaries;</hi> and
whilſt Coachmen, Felt-makers and ſuch Mechanick perſons are allowed and entertained
to preach by thoſe who think themſelves the principal Members of either Houſe:
when ſuch barbarous Outrages in Churches, and heatheniſh Irreverence and Uproars,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60710:163"/>
even in the time of Divine Service and the Adminiſtration of the bleſſed Sacrament,
are practiſed without control: when the bleſſed means of advancing Religion, the
Preaching of the Word of God, is turned into a licence of Libelling and Reviling both
Church and State, and venting ſuch Seditious Poſitions as by the Laws of the Land
are no leſs than Treaſon, and ſcarce a Man in Reputation and Credit with theſe grand
Reformers, who is not notoriouſly guilty of this; whileſt thoſe Learned, Reverend,
Painful and Pious Preachers, who have been and are the moſt eminent and able Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Proteſtant Religion, are (to the unſpeakable joy of the Adverſaries to
Our Religion) diſregarded and oppreſſed: laſtly, when for the ſettling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
all theſe Diſtractions and Diſtempers, inſtead of a free and general Synod
of Grave and Learned Divines which hath been ſo much talked of (and to whoſe
deliberations We were and are willing to commit the Conſideration of thoſe Affairs)
a Conference is deſired with particular Men nominated by themſelves, contrary to the
Rights and Practice of the Church; the major part of whom (though We confeſs there
are many Reverend, Learned, and Pious perſons amongſt them) are not of Learning nor
Underſtanding ſutable to ſo great a Work, or are of known avowed Diſaffection to the
Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, and of thoſe who have preached Seditiouſly and
Treaſonably againſt Our Perſon and Authority, as Doctor <hi>Downing</hi> and others. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
from his Soul deſires a true Examination and Reformation in Religion cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it from the reſults of theſe Mens Counſels, nor think the true ſervice of God is like
to be advanced or preſerved by ſuch practices. And all ſober Men muſt look with
ſtrange Horrour and Indignation upon the laſt Declaration of the Lords and Commons,
which after ſuch unprecedented Outrages and Violences againſt Us, publiſhes the
ground of their taking up defenſive Arms (as they call them) to be for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the true Religion; the taking and keeping of <hi>Hull,</hi> Our Navy, Our Money
and Goods, the exerciſing of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and all the other Injuries We complain of, to be
for the maintenance of Religion. But whoſoever believes them to be for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Our Perſon, may believe the other too.</p>
                     <p>Would Men enjoy the Laws they were born to, the Liberty and Property which
makes the Subjection of this Nation famous and honourable with all neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms?
We have done Our part, to make a Wall of Braſs for the perpetual defence of
them; whileſt theſe ill Men uſurp a Power to undermine that Wall, and to ſhake thoſe
Foundations, which cannot be pulled down, but to the confuſion of Law, Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and the very Life and Being of Our Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Is the Dignity, Privilege and Freedom of Parliament (Parliaments whoſe Wiſdom
and Gravity have prepared ſo many wholſome Laws, and whoſe Freedom diſtinguiſhes
the Condition of Our Subjects from thoſe of any Monarchy in <hi>Europe</hi>) precious unto
Our People? Where was that Freedom and that Privilege when the Houſe of Commons
preſumed to make Laws without the Houſe of Peers, as they did in their Vote
upon the Proteſtation, and of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> when the Houſe of Commons and
the Houſe of Peers preſumed to make Laws without Our Conſent, as they have done
in the buſineſs of the <hi>Militia,</hi> of <hi>Hull,</hi> in the behalf of their Champion, Serjeant Major
General <hi>Skippon,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> of their new General, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex, (with
whom they will live and dye)</hi> and many other Caſes? Where was that Freedom and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
when Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> and Captain <hi>Venne</hi> brought down their <hi>Myrmidons</hi> to
aſſault and terrifie the Members of both Houſes, whoſe faces or whoſe opinions they
liked not, &amp; by that Army to awe the Parliament; when thoſe rude Multitudes publiſhed
the names of the Members of both Houſes as Enemies to the Commonwealth, who would
not agree to their frantick Propoſitions; when the names of thoſe were given by Members
of the Houſe, that they might be proſcribed, and torn in pieces by thoſe multitudes;
when many were driven away for fear of their Lives from being preſent at thoſe Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
and when Maſter <hi>Hollis</hi> required the names of thoſe Lords who would not agree
with the Houſe of Commons? Laſtly, where was that Freedom and Privilege of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when Members of the one Houſe that had been queſtioned for words ſpoken in
the Houſe, and one freed, the other but reprehended by Vote of the major part, were again
queſtioned by the other Houſe, and a charge brought againſt them for theſe words?</p>
                     <p>Is Honour, Reputation, Freedom and Civility to be eſteemed? What cauſeleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations
have been raiſed and entertained upon Perſons of quality and unblemiſhed
eſtimation, upon no grounds, or appearance of reaſon, but becauſe their opinions ran not
with the Torrent? What careſſes have been and are made to perſons looſe, vicious and
debauched, of no Vertue, no Religion, no Reputation, but of Malice and Ingratitude to
Us? Their names will be eaſily found out by all Mens obſervation and their own bluſhes,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60710:164"/>
though they ſhall not have the honour of Our mention. How have the Laws of Hoſpitality
and Civility been violated, the freedom and liberty of Converſation (the pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of life) been invaded by them; the diſcourſes at Tables, whiſpers in Gardens and
Walks examined, and of perſons under no accuſation; Letter broken up (Our own to Our
deareſt Conſort, the Queen, not ſpared) read publickly and commented upon, with ſuch
Circumſtances as make Chriſtendom laugh at Our follies, and abhorr Our correſpondence?</p>
                     <p>Is Peace and tranquillity dear to Our Subjects? To ſhew that We have left no way
to that (not deſtructive to Honour and Juſtice) unattempted, We offered to lay down
Our Arms upon no other Reparations for all the Indignities multiplied upon Us than
theſe, That they ſhould lay down theirs, ſo unjuſtifiably taken, and We have Our own
Town, Goods and Navy (taken and kept by violence from Us) to be peaceably reſtored
to Us, and the Power of making Laws without Us by the way of Ordinances (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a power by Ordinance to depoſe Us) and that in particular concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> to
be diſavowed, and a ſafe place to be agreed on where We might be preſent with Our great
Council, for the compoſing of all Miſ-underſtandings, and making this Kingdom happy.
Which Offers not only were not accepted, but not ſo much as any Anſwer directed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to Us, ſomewhat only ſent down by their under-Clerk, which, with their firſt
Petition and Our Anſwer (We are much pleaſed to hear) are ordered to be printed and
read in all Churches (We deſire no better evidence than Our and their Writings and
Actions, and no better Judges and Witneſſes than Our People, of Our love to Peace.)
And even before this kind of Anſwer came to Us, whileſt We, with patience and hope
expecting ſuch a return as We deſired, forbore any action or attempt of Force, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Our Promiſe, Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> ſallied out in the night, and murthered the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his fellow-Subjects; and ever ſince in this Quarrel they labour to increaſe their
Army, (the very levying of which is Treaſon) and are ready to march againſt Us. Lee
all the world judge who are lovers of the Peace.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Is the Conſtitution of the Kingdom to be preſerved, and Monarchy it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held?
Can any thing be more evident than that the End of theſe Men is, or the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which muſt attend their Premiſſes muſt be, to introduce a Paricy and Confuſion of
all degrees and conditions? Are not ſeveral Books and Papers (ſuch as the <hi>Obſervations
upon parts of Our Meſſages</hi>) publiſhed by their direction, at leaſt under their countenance,
againſt Monarchy it ſelf? Is it poſſible for Us to be made vile and contemptible, and ſhall
Our good Subjects continue as they are: Can Our juſt Power be taken from Us, and
ſhall they enjoy their liberty? Whoſoever is a friend to the conſtitution of the Kingdom
muſt be an enemy to theſe Men. How the benefit, advantages and hopes of the Kingdom
have been and are advanced and promoted by theſe Men, all good Men ſee and diſcern.</p>
                     <p>Let Us conſider now, whether all thoſe Grievances and Preſſures which Our Subjects
have heretofore ſuffered under, and of which Our Juſtice and Favour hath eaſed them, be
not by the Faction and Tyranny of theſe Men redoubled upon Our People. Were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of Men grieved and ſcandalized at the too much Formality and circumſtances
uſed in the exerciſe of Religion? and are they not equally concerned in the Uncomelineſs,
Irreverence and Prophaneneſs now avowed to the diſhonour of Chriſtianity? Were they
troubled to ſee the Pulpit ſometimes made a Barr to plead againſt the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Subject? and are they not more confounded to ſee it ſo generally made a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to incite the People to Rebellion and Sedition againſt Us? Have Our People ſuffered
under and been oppreſſed by the exerciſe of an Arbitrary Power, and out of a ſenſe of
thoſe Sufferings have We conſented to take away the Star-Chamber, the High-Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Courts, to regulate the Council-Tables, and to apply any remedies have been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Us for that diſeaſe? and have not theſe Men doubled thoſe Preſſures in the latitude
and unlimitedneſs of their proceedings, in their Orders for the Obſervation of the Law,
as they pretend, and then puniſhing Men for not obeying thoſe Orders in a way and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
the Law doth not preſcribe; in their ſending for Our good Subjects upon general
informations without proof, and for Offences which the Law takes no notice of; in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Men enemies to the Commonwealth, fining and impriſoning them, for doing or not
doing that which no known Law enjoyns or condemns? Were the Purſuivants of the
Council-Table, the delay and attendance there or at the High-Commiſſion Court, the
Judgements and Decrees of the Star-Chamber more grievous, grievous to more perſons,
more chargeable, more intolerable than the Serjeants and Officers Fees, the Attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Houſes and upon Committees, or than the Votes and Judgments which have lately
paſſed in one or both Houſes? Let all the Decrees, Sentences and Judgments of the high-Commiſſion
Court and Star-Chamber be examined, and any found ſo unjuſt, ſo illegal as the
proceedings againſt the Gentlemen of <hi>Kent,</hi> for preparing and preſenting a Petition agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60710:164"/>
in form and matter to all the Rules of Law and Juſtice, by which Men are to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ask any thing; as the judgment againſt Mr. <hi>Binyon,</hi> that he ſhould be disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed,
be incapable of ever bearing Office in the Commonwealth, impriſoned in the
Gaol at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> for the ſpace of two years, and to pay three thouſand pounds fine, nothing
being charged and proved againſt him that any Law or Reaſon could tell him he was not
to do. Though the Sentences in the other Courts were in ſome caſes too ſevere, and
exceeded the meaſure of the offence, there was ſtill an offence, ſomewhat done that in
truth was a crime: but here Declarations, Votes and Judgments paſs upon Our People
for matters not ſuſpected to be crimes till they are puniſhed. And have ſuch proceedings
ever been before this Parliament? If Monopolies have been granted to the prejudice of
Our People, the calamity will not be leſs if it be exerciſed by a good Lord, by a Bill, than itt
was before by a Patent; and yet the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> thinks fit to require the Letter-Office
to be confirmed to him for three lives at the ſame time that 'tis complained of as a
Monopoly, and without the alteration of any Circumſtance for the eaſe of the Subject;
and this with ſo much greedineſs and authority, that whileſt it was complained of as a
Monopoly, he procured an Aſſignment to be made of it to him from the perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, after he had by his Intereſt ſtopped the proceedings of the Committee for the
ſpace of five Months before that Aſſignment made to him, upon pretence that he was
concerned in it, and deſired to be heard: Of ſuch ſoveraign Power was his Name, as it
could be no longer a Grievance to Our People if it might prove an Advantage to him. A
Precedent very likely to be followed in many Monopolies, if they may be aſſigned to
Principal members or their friends: witneſs the connivence now given to Sir <hi>John Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dram</hi>
for his Lights, ſince his undertaking their Service at <hi>Hull.</hi> Have Partiality and
Corruption in Judges obſtructed the courſe of Juſtice? was there ever ſuch Partiality and
Corruption, when their fellow-Members of either Houſe are by them importuned and
ſolicited for their Votes in cauſes before them, and no other meaſure or Rule to the Juſtice
of that faction than the opinions of the perſons contending? What ſums of mony have
been given to, and what contracts have been made with ſome Members of either Houſe,
who are of this powerful Faction We complain of, for preſerving this Man from being
queſtioned, and promoting an Accuſation againſt that Man, for managing ſuch a Cauſe,
and procuring ſuch an Order? We are very well able to give particular Information, which
We ſhall willingly do, when there may be ſuch a ſober and ſecure debate as becomes the
Dignity and Freedom of Parliament, and the Witneſſes, now within their reach, may
neither be awed nor tampered with before Trial. For how little care there is taken for
diſcoveries of this nature, appears by that which upon complaint of a ſlander againſt
Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> was juſtified, and the Author averred againſt him, for taking thirty pound
Bribe to preſerve a Papiſt from legal proſecution, which hath been ſo long ſuffered to
ſleep at a Committee.</p>
                     <p>Our Caſe is truly ſtated, ſo truly, that there is ſcarce any Particular urged or alledged
by Us which is not known to many, and the moſt to all Men. And muſt Our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be now irreparable? Are the Injuries committed againſt Us and the Law juſtifiable?
And muſt We be cenſured for uſing all poſſible means to be freed from them, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
for them, becauſe they ſeem to carry the Name, Conſent and Authority of both
Our Houſes of Parliament? There is not a Particular of which We complain that found
not eminent oppoſition in both Houſes, and yet for the moſt part not above a moiety of
either Houſe preſent. The Order of the ninth of <hi>September</hi> (an Order to ſuſpend the
execution of Laws in force) paſſed when there were not above eighty Commoners, of
which many diſſented, and but twenty Lords, whereof eleven (the major part) expreſly
contradicted it. The firſt unſeaſonable Remonſtrance (the fountain from whence all the
preſent miſchiefs have flowed) was carried but by eleven Voices after fifteen hours ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
when above two hundred were abſent, and was never approved by the Lords. The
buſineſs of the <hi>Militia</hi> was at leaſt twice rejected by double their number in the Houſe of
Peers who conſented to it, there being no Popiſh Lord preſent, and twelve Biſhops in
the Tower; and yet this propoſed again, the Houſe being made thin of thoſe Lords who
had formerly oppoſed it, who went out immediately (it being their uſual courſe, to watch
ſuch opportunities to effect their buſineſſes) after Maſter <hi>Hollis</hi> his Threats, and then
carried. The Declaration againſt Us ſent to <hi>New-market</hi> was carried but by one Voice
in the Houſe of Peers, and by a ſmall number in the Houſe of Commons. The juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> in his Act of High Treaſon was oppoſed by many Perſons of great
worth, though neither Houſe had half its number, And We are very far from cenſuring
all thoſe Perſons who concurred in theſe or any other particulars; We believe very many
of them ſtood not in ſo clear a light to diſcern the Guilt, Malice, Ambition or Subtilty
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60710:165"/>
of their Seducers. But if in truth there were a conſent entirely in both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(as We are moſt aſſured there will never be) to alter the whole frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
muſt We ſubmit to thoſe Reſolutions, and muſt not Our Subjects help and aſſiſt
Us in the defence of Laws and Government eſtabliſhed, becauſe they do not like them?
Did We intend when we called them to that great Council, or did Our good Subjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
when they ſent them thither in their behalfs, that they ſhould alter the whole frame
of Government according to their own Fancies and Ambition, and poſſeſs thoſe Places
during their Lives? What Our opinion and reſolution is concerning Parliaments, We
have fully expreſſed in Our Declarations: We have ſaid, and will ſtill ſay, they are ſo
eſſential a part of the Conſtitution of this Kingdom, that We can attain to no Happineſs
without them, nor will We ever make the leaſt attempt (in our thoughts) againſt them.
We well know that our Self and Our two Houſes make up the Parliament, and We are
like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Twins, We muſt laugh and cry, live and dye together; that no Man
can be a friend to the one, and an enemy to the other; the Injuſtice, Injury and Violence
offered to Parliaments, is that which We principally complain of: and We again aſſure
all Our good Subjects, in the preſence of Almighty God, that all the Acts paſſed by Us
this Parliament ſhall be equally obſerved by Us, as We deſire thoſe to be which do moſt
concern Our Rights.</p>
                     <p>Our Quarrel is not againſt the Parliament, but againſt particular Men, who firſt made
the Wounds, and will not now ſuffer them to be healed, but make them deeper and wider,
by contriving foſtering and fomenting Miſtakes and Jealouſies betwixt Body and Head,
Us and Our two Houſes of Parliament; whom We name, &amp; are ready to prove them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of High Treaſon. We deſire that the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis, Mr. Pym, Mr. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrigge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stroud, Mr. Martin,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Ludlow,</hi> Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi>
and Captain <hi>Venn,</hi> may be delivered into the hands of Juſtice, to be tried by their Peers,
according to the known Law of the Land: if we do not prove them guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they will be acquitted, and their Innocence will juſtly triumph over Us. Againſt the
Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Earl of <hi>Stamford,</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> Serjeant
Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> and thoſe who ſhall henceforth exerciſe the <hi>Militia</hi> by virtue of
the Ordinance, We ſhall cauſe Indictments to be drawn of High Treaſon upon the Statute
of the 25. year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: Let them ſubmit to the Trial appointed by
Law, and plead their Ordinances; if they ſhall be acquitted, We have done.</p>
                     <p>And that all Our loving Subjects may know, that in truth nothing but the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the true Proteſtant Religion invaded by <hi>Browniſme, Anabaptiſme</hi> and <hi>Libertiniſme;</hi>
the Safety of Our Perſon, threatned and conſpired againſt by Rebellion and Treaſon; the
Law of the Land and Liberty of the Subject, oppreſſed and almoſt deſtroyed by an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
Unlimited, Arbitrary Power; and the Freedom, Priviledge and Dignity of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
awed and inſulted upon by Force and Tumults, could make us put off Our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Robe of Peace, and take up defenſive Arms; We once more offer a free and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pardon to all Our loving Subjects who ſhall deſire the ſame (except the perſons before
named,) and ſhall be as glad with Safety and Honour to lay down theſe Arms, as of the
greateſt Bleſſing We are capable of in this World. But if to juſtify theſe Actions and theſe
Perſons our Subjects ſhall think fit to engage themſelves in a War againſt Us, We muſt not
look upon it as an Act of Our Parliament, but as a Rebellion againſt Us and the Law in
the behalf of theſe Men, and ſhall proceed for the ſuppreſſing it with the ſame Conſcience
and Courage as We would meet an Army of Rebels, who endeavour to deſtroy both
King and People: And We will never doubt to find honeſt Men enough of Our minds.</p>

                     <head type="sub">To the KING'S moſt Excellent Majeſty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the

The Humble Petition of the Officers and Souldiers of the Army:</head>
                     <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
                     <p>THat although our Wants have been very preſſing, and the Burthen we are become unto
theſe parts (by reaſon of thoſe Wants) very grievous unto us; yet ſo have we demeaned
our ſelves, that Your Majeſty's great and weighty Affairs in this preſent Parliament have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
received no interruption by any Complaint either from us or againſt us; A temper not
uſual in Armies (eſpecially in one deſtitute not only of Pay, but alſo of Martial Diſcipline, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60710:165"/>
many of its principal Officers;) That we cannot but attribute it to a particular bleſſing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God on our moſt hearty affection and zeal to the Common good in the happy ſucceſs of
this Parliament; to which as we ſhould have been ready hourly to contribute our deareſt blood, ſo
now that it hath pleaſed God to manifeſt his bleſſing ſo manifeſtly therein, we cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it with thankfulneſs. We cannot but acknowledge his great Mercy in that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
Your Majeſties Royal heart ſo to co-operate with the wiſdom of the Parliament, as to
effect ſo great and happy a Reformation upon the former Diſtempers of this Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth:
As firſt, in Your Majeſties gracious condeſcending to the many important Demands
of our neighbours of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation; ſecondly, in granting ſo free a courſe of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Delinquents, of what quality ſoever; thirdly, in the removal of all thoſe Grievances
wherewith the Subjects did conceive either their Liberty of Perſons, Propriety of Eſtate, or
Freedom of Conſcience prejudiced; and laſtly, in the greateſt pledge of ſecurity that ever the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>England</hi> received from their Soveraign, the Bill of Triennial Parliaments. Theſe things
ſo graciouſly accorded unto by Your Majeſty without bargain or compenſation as they are more than
expectation or hope could extend unto, ſo now certainly they are ſuch as all Loyal hearts ought
to requieſce in with thankfulneſs, which we do with all humility; and do at this time, with as
much earneſtneſs as any, pray and wiſh that the Kingdom may be ſettled in peace and quietneſs,
and that all Men may at their own homes enjoy the bleſſed fruits of Your Wiſdom and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But may it pleaſe Your Excellent Majeſty and this High Court of Parliament to give us
leave, with grief and anguiſh of heart, to repreſent unto You, that We hear that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perſons ſtirring and practical, who, in ſtead of rendring Glory to God, Thanks to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and acknowledgment to the Parliament, remain yet as unſatisfied and mutinous as ever;
who, whileſt all the reſt of the Kingdom are arrived even beyond their wiſhes, are daily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
new and unſeaſonable demands; who, whileſt all Men of Reaſon, Loyalty and Moderation,
are thinking how they may provide for your Majeſties Honour and Plenty, in return of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Graces to the Subject, they are ſtill attempting new Diminutions of Your Majeſty's juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities,
which muſt ever be no leſs dear to all honeſt Men than our own Freedoms; in fine, Men
of ſuch turbulent Spirits, as are ready to ſacrifice the Honour and Welfare of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to their private fancies (whom nothing elſe than a ſubverſion of the whole frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
will ſatisfie.) Far be it from our thoughts to believe, that the Violence and Vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of ſuch kind of perſons can have any influence upon the Prudence and Juſtice of the
Parliament. But that which begets the trouble and diſquiet of Our Loyal hearts at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is, That we hear thoſe ill-affected perſons are backed in their Violence by the Multitude,
and the power of raiſing Tumults; that thouſands flock at their call, and beſet the Parliament
(and <hi>White-Hall</hi> it ſelf) not only to the prejudice of that freedom which is neceſſary to great
Councils and Judicatories but poſſibly to ſome perſonal danger of Your Sacred Majeſty and
Peers. The vaſt conſequence of theſe Perſons Malignity, and of the Licentiouſneſs of thoſe
Multitudes that follow them, conſidered, in moſt deep care and zealous affection for the ſafety of
Your Sacred Majeſty and the Parliament, Our Humble Petition is, that in Your wiſdoms You would
be pleaſed to remove ſuch Dangers, by puniſhing the Ring-leaders of theſe Tumults, and that Your
Majeſty and the Parliament may be ſecured from ſuch Inſolencies hereafter. For the ſuppreſſing
of which, in all humility we offer our ſelves to wait upon You (if You pleaſe) hoping we ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as conſiderable in way of Defence to our Gracious Sovereign, the Parliament, our Religion,
and the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Kingdom, as what number ſoever ſhall audaciouſly preſume to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

from precedent Innovations, but be ſecured from the future that are threatned, and likely
to produce more dangerous effects than the former. And we ſhall pray, &amp;c.</p>

Our very Soul is full of anguiſh, until We may find ſome remedy to prevent the
Miſeries which are ready to overwhelm this whole Nation by a Civil War: And though all Our
endeavours tending to the Compoſing of thoſe unhappy Differences betwixt Vs and Our two
Houſes of Parliament (though purſued by Vs with all zeal and ſincerity) have been hitherto
without that Succeſs We hoped for; yet ſuch is Our conſtant and earneſt care to preſerve the
publick Peace, that We ſhall not be diſcouraged from uſing any Expedient which, by the bleſſing
of the God of Mercy, may lay a firm foundation of Peace and Happineſs to all Our good Subjects.
To this end obſerving that many miſtakes have ariſen by the Meſſages, Petitions and Anſwers
betwixt Vs and Our two Houſes of Parliament, which haply may be prevented by ſome other
way of Treaty, wherein the matters in difference may be more clearly underſtood and more freely
tranſacted; We have thought fit to propound to you, That ſome fit perſons may be by you inabled
to treat with the like number to be authorized by Vs, in ſuch a manner and with ſuch freedom
of debate as may beſt tend to that happy Concluſion which all good Men deſire, <hi>The peace of
the Kingdom:</hi> Wherein as We promiſe in the Word of a King all ſafety and encouragement
to ſuch as ſhall be ſent to Vs, if you ſhall chuſe the place where We are for the Treaty, which
We wholly leave to you, preſuming of your like care of the ſafety of thoſe We ſhall imploy, if
you ſhall name another place; ſo We aſſure you and all Our good Subjects, that (to the beſt of
Our underſtanding) nothing ſhall be therein wanting on Our parts which may advance the
True Proteſtant Religion, oppoſe Popery and Superſtition, ſecure the Law of the Land (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is built as well Our juſt Prerogative as the Propriety and Liberty of the Subject) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all juſt Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and render Vs and Our People truly happy
by a good underſtanding betwixt Vs and Our two Houſes of Parliament. Bring with you as
firm Reſolutions to do your Duty, and let all Our good People joyn with Vs in Our Prayers to
Almighty God for his Bleſſing upon this Work.</p>
                     <p>If this Propoſition ſhall be rejected by you, We have done Our Duty ſo amply, that God will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
Vs from the Guilt of any of that Blood which muſt be ſpilt: and what opinion ſoever other
Men may have of Our Power, we aſſure you nothing but Our Chriſtian and Pious care to prevent
the effuſion of blood hath begot this Motion; Our Proviſion of Men, Arms and Mony being ſuch
as may ſecure Vs from farther Violence, till it ſhall pleaſe God to open the eyes of Our People.</p>

effect of ſuch evil Counſel as was unparallel'd by any former Examples. We believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſuch Proclamations and Declarations have never been before ſet forth; but were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times ever acquainted with ſuch intolerable Provocations? Were there ever before
theſe twelve months Declarations publiſhed in the name of eitheir or both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to make their King odious to the People? Have either or both Houſes ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
aſſumed or pretended to a Power to raiſe Armes or levy War in any Cauſe? or can both
Houſes together exerciſe ſuch a Power? Are thoſe Actions which the Law hath defined
literally and expreſly to be Treaſonable, or ſuch Perſons to be Traitors, not ſo, becauſe they
are done by Members of either Houſe, or their appointment? And muſt not We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
ſuch who March with Arms and Force to deſtroy Us to be Traitors, becauſe the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is their General? Thoſe whom We have or do accuſe We have named, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

And now that by this We ſhould have put the whole Kingdom out of Our Protection

former Paſſages as by Our two laſt Meſſages, which have been ſo fruitleſs, that (though We have
deſcended to deſire and preſs it) not ſo much as a Treaty can be obtained, unleſs We would
denude Our Self of all force to defend Vs from a viſible ſtrength marching againſt Vs,
and admit thoſe Perſons as Traitors to Vs, who, according to their Duty, their Oaths of
Allegiance, and the Law, have appeared in defence of Vs their King and Liege Lord (whom
We are bound in Conſcience and Honour to preſerve) though We diſclaimed all our Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations

All We have now left in Our Power is to expreſs the deep ſenſe We have of the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery

and to apply Our Self to Our neceſſary Defence, wherein We wholly rely upon the Providence

 do preſent this our humble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to Your Majeſty's Meſſage of the 11th of this inſtant Month of <hi>September.</hi>
When we conſider the Oppreſſions, Rapines, Firing of Houſes, Murthers, (even at this time
whilſt Your Majeſty propounds a Treaty) committed upon Your good Subjects by Your Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in the preſence and by the Authority of their Commanders, being of the number of thoſe
whom Your Majeſty holds Your ſelf bound in Honour and Conſcience to protect as Perſons do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Duties; We cannot think Your Majeſty hath done all that in You lies to prevent or
remove the preſent Diſtractions; nor ſo long as Your Majeſty will admit no Peace, without
ſecuring the Authors and Inſtruments of theſe Miſchiefs from the Juſtice of the Parliament,
which yet ſhall be ever diſpens'd with all requiſite Moderation and diſtinction of Offences, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome of thoſe Perſons be ſuch in whoſe Preſervation Your Kingdom cannot be ſafe,
nor the unqueſtionable Rights and Priviledges of Parliament be maintain'd, without which the
Power and Dignity thereof will fall into contempt. We beſeech Your Majeſty therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
Your Expreſſions, That God ſhould deal with You and Your Poſterity as Your Majeſty
deſires the Preſervation of the juſt Rights of Parliament; which being undeniable in the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch as we have declared to be Delinquents, we ſhall believe Your Majeſty, both towards
Your ſelf and Parliament, will not in this Priviledge we are moſt ſenſible of deny us that
which belongs unto the meaneſt Court of Juſtice in this Kingdom. Neither hath Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
cauſe to complain that You are denied a Treaty, when we offer all that a Treaty can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
or Your Majeſty expect, Security, Honour, Service, Obedience, Support, and all other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of an Humble, Loyal and Faithful Subjection, and ſeek nothing but that our Religion,
Liberty, Peace of the Kingdom, Safety of the Parliament may be ſecured from the open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and cunning Practices of a wicked party, who have long plotted our ruin and deſtruction.
And if there were any Cauſe of Treaty, we know no competent Perſons to Treat betwixt the
King and Parliament; and if both Cauſe and Perſons were ſuch as to invite Treaty, the
Seaſon is altogether unfit, whilſt Your Majeſty's Standard is up, and Your Proclamations and
Declarations unrecalled, whereby Your Parliament is charged with <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If Your Majeſty ſhall perſiſt to make Your ſelf a ſhield and defence to thoſe Inſtruments, and
ſhall continue to reject our faithful and neceſſary Advice for ſecuring and maintaining Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Liberty, with the Peace of the Kingdom and Safety of the Parliament, we doubt not
but to indifferent judgments it will eaſily appear who is moſt tender of that Innocent Blood
which is like to be ſpilt in this Cauſe; Your Majeſty, who by ſuch perſiſting doth endanger Your
ſelf and Your Kingdoms, or we, who are willing to hazard our ſelves to preſerve both.</p>
                           <p>We humbly beſeech Your Majeſty to conſider how impoſſible it is that any Proteſtation, though
publiſhed in Your Majeſty's name, of Your tenderneſs of the Miſeries of Your Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Your Reſolution to maintain the Proteſtant Religion and Laws of this
Kingdom, can give ſatisfaction to reaſonable and indifferent men, when at the ſame time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Traitors and Rebels, the known Favourers of them and Agents for them,
are admitted to Your Majeſty's preſence with Grace and Favour, and ſome of them imployed in
Your ſervice; when the Cloaths, Munition, Horſes, and other Neceſſaries bought by your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſent for the ſupply of the Army againſt the Rebels there, are violently taken away,
ſome by Your Majeſty's Command, others by Your Miniſters, and applied to the maintenance
of an unnatural War againſt Your People here.</p>
                           <p>All this notwithſtanding, as we never gave Your Majeſty any juſt cauſe of withdrawing Your
ſelf from Your great Council, ſo it hath ever been and ſhall ever be far from us to give any
impediment to Your Return, or to neglect any proper means of curing the Diſtempers of the
Kingdom, and cloſing the dangerous Breaches betwixt Your Majeſty and Your Parliament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the great Truſt which lies upon us: and if Your Majeſty ſhall now be pleaſed to come
back to Your Parliament without Your Forces, we ſhall be ready to ſecure Your Royal Perſon,
Your Crown and Dignity, with our Lives and Fortunes; Your Preſence in this Your great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
being the only means of any Treaty betwixt Your Majeſty and them with hope of Succeſs.</p>
                           <p>And in none of our Deſires to Your Majeſty ſhall we be ſwaied by any particular man's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
but ſhall give a clear Teſtimony to Your Majeſty and the whole World, that in all
things done by us we faithfully intend the good of Your Majeſty and of Your Kingdoms, and
that we will not be diverted from this End by any private or ſelf-reſpects whatſoever.</p>

Diſtractions, becauſe of the Oppreſſions, Rapines and the like committed upon Our
good Subjects by Our Soldiers. Let them remember who have compelled Us, and
againſt Our Souls deſire forced Us to raiſe thoſe Soldiers: and then if the Oppreſſions
and Rapines were indeed ſuch as are falſly pretended, Our poor Subjects who ſuffer under
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60710:168"/>
them will look on them, and only on them, as the Authors of all the Miſeries they do
or can undergo. We confeſs with grief of heart ſome Diſorders have and many more
may befal Our good People by Our Soldiers; but We appeal to all thoſe Counties through
which We have paſſed, what care We have taken to prevent, and what Juſtice We
daily inflict upon ſuch Offendors: neither hath the leaſt complaint been ever made to
Us of Violences and Outrages which We have not to Our utmoſt Power repaired or
puniſhed; however thoſe falſe and treaſonable Pamphlets are ſuffered, which accuſe Us
of giving Warrant for plundring of Houſes. Our Mercy and Lenity is ſo well known
to the contrary, that it is uſually made an excuſe by thoſe who againſt their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
aſſiſt this Rebellion againſt Us, that they chuſe rather to offend Us upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Pardon, than provoke thoſe Malignant Perſons who without Charity or
Compaſſion deſtroy all who concur not with them in Faction and Opinion. How far
We are from Rapine and Oppreſſion may appear by Our Lenity to the Perſons and
Eſtates of thoſe who have not only exerciſed the <hi>Militia</hi> (the ſeed from whence this
Rebellion againſt Us hath grown) but contributed Mony and Plate to the maintenance
of that Army which now endeavours to deſtroy Us; as of <hi>Nottingham, Leiceſter,</hi> and
many other places through which We have paſſed, many of whom then were and now
are in that Army: to let paſs Our paſſing by <hi>Chartly</hi> (the Houſe of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>)
without other preſſures than as if he were the General of Our own Army, and Our
expreſs Orders to reſtrain the liberty Our Soldiers would otherwiſe have uſed upon that
Place and his Eſtate about it. How contrary the proceedings are of theſe great Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the publick Liberties, appears fully by the ſad inſtances they every day give in
the plundring by publick Warrant the Houſes of all ſuch whoſe Duty, Conſcience and
Loyalty hath engaged them in Our Quarrel, which every good Man ought to make his
own; by their declaring all Perſons to be out of the Protection of Parliament (and ſo
expoſing them to the Fury of their Soldiers) who will not aſſiſt this Rebellion againſt
Us, their anointed King; by the daily Outrages committed in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> when, contrary
to the deſire and agreement of that County (ſigned under the hands of both Parties)
they will not ſuffer the Peace to be kept, but that the Diſtractions and Confuſion may
be univerſal over the whole Kingdom, direct their Governour of <hi>Hull</hi> to make War
upon Our good Subjects in that County, and ſo continue the robbing and plundring the
Houſes of all ſuch who concur not with them in this Rebellion; laſtly, by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
Sacrilegious Inhumanity exerciſed by their Soldiers in Churches, as in <hi>Canterbury,
Worceſter, Oxford,</hi> and other Places, where they committed ſuch unheard-of Outrages as
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> never practiſed before. God in his good time will make them exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Vengeance.</p>
                     <p>We never did nor ever ſhall deſire to ſecure the Authors and Inſtruments of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
to the Kingdom from the Juſtice of Parliament. We deſire all ſuch Perſons may
be ſpeedily brought to condign Puniſhment by that Rule which is, on ought to be, the
Rule of all puniſhment, the known Law of the Land. If there have ſeemed to be any
interruption in proceedings of this nature, it muſt be remembred how long Perſons have
been kept under general Accuſations without Trial, though earneſtly deſired; that the
Members who were properly to judge ſuch Accuſations have by Violence been driven
thence, or could not with Honour and Safety be preſent at ſuch Debates; that notorious
Delinquents by the known Laws were protected againſt Us from the Juſtice of the
Kingdom, and ſuch called Delinquents who, committing no Offence againſt any known
Law, were ſo voted only for doing their Duties to Us: and then there will be no cauſe
of complaint found againſt Us.</p>
                     <p>And for the Priviledges of Parliament, We have ſaid ſo much and upon ſuch reaſons,
(which have never been anſwered but by bare poſitive Aſſertions) in Our ſeveral. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
that We may well and do ſtill uſe the ſame expreſſion, That We deſire God
may ſo deal with Us and Our Poſterity, as We deſire the preſervation of the juſt Rights
of Parliament; the violation whereof in truth by theſe deſperate Perſons is ſo clearly
known to all Men who underſtand the Priviledges of Parliament, that their Rage and
Malice hath not been greater to Our Perſon and Government, than to the Liberty, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
and very Being of Parliaments: witneſs their putting in, putting out, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending
what Perſons they pleaſe, as they like or diſlike their Opinions; their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Tumults to aſſault the Members and awe the Parliament; their poſting
and proſecuting ſuch Members of either Houſe as concurred not with them in their
Deſigns, and ſo driving them from thence for the ſafety of their Lives; their denying
Us, againſt the known, eſtabliſhed Law and the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, to have
a Negative Voice, without which no Parliament can conſiſt; their making cloſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60710:168"/>
from whence the Members of the Houſes are exempted, againſt the Liberty of
Parliament; and laſtly, reſolving both Houſes into a cloſe Committee of Seventeen
perſons, who undertake and direct all the preſent Outrages and the managery of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt Us, in the abſence of four parts of five of both Houſes, and without the
privity of thoſe who ſtay there, which is not only contrary, but deſtructive to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themſelves. By theſe groſs, unheard-of Invaſions and Breaches of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Parliament, (and without them they could not have done the other) they
made way for their attempts upon the Law of the Land, and the introduction of that
unlimited Arbitrary Power which they have ſince exerciſed to the intolerable Damage
and Confuſion of the whole Kingdom. And We aſſure Our good Subjects, the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of theſe juſt Liberties and Priviledges of Parliament, thus violated by theſe Men,
is not leſs the Argument of Our preſent Quarrel and Undertaking, than Our own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Intereſt and Safety; thoſe being no way ſo ſecurely to be preſerved, as by preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Parliaments and their juſt Priviledges. Neither is there any Proteſtation, to Our
knowledge, publiſhed in Our name of Our tenderneſs of the Miſeries of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Our
Reſolution to maintain the Proteſtant Religion and Laws of this Kingdom, that is not
the Proteſtation of Our Soul, and manifeſted in all Our Actions: and We hope that falſe
Scandal, that divers of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Traitors and Rebels, the known Favourers of them
and Agents for them, are admitted to Our preſence with favour, and imployed in Our
Service, will gain no credit with good Men, who remember well the notorious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſo confidently and groundleſly heretofore caſt on Us by Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> of which as
there could never be the leaſt Proof, ſo We could never receive any ſatisfaction for that
high Injury, which might have been a warning to them to have publiſhed no more ſuch
Untruths, if they had not found that Truth and their Ends cannot meet together.</p>
                     <p>For the Horſes taken for Our Service, which were provided for the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
'tis true, We were compelled for the bringing Our own Waggons from <hi>Cheſter</hi> for the
Carriage of Our Munition to make uſe of them, being few in number and of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
after they were certified to be of no uſe for the Service for which they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.
And for the Clothes, upon enquiry We find that ſome few were taken by Our
Soldiers (but without any Order from Us) going to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and as was probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
for the relief of that place then in actual Rebellion againſt Us. But how far We
have been and are from diverting any of thoſe Proviſions made for the Relief of that
poor Kingdom, (the thought of whoſe miſerable Condition makes Our heart bleed)
may appear by Our expreſs Command given for the ſpeedy tranſportation of 3000 Suits
of Clothes which We found provided at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but neglected to be ſent, and which
no neceſſity of Our own Army here could prevail with Us to ſeize. And how bold
ſoever the Reproaches of that kind have been upon Us, We are confident Malice it ſelf
cannot lay the leaſt probable imputation upon Us for the neglect of Our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Kingdom. What one thing in Our power have We neglected or omitted
which might contribute to the aſſiſtance or eaſe of Our poor Proteſtant Subjects
there? We firſt recommended the care of that buſineſs to both Our Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
We conſented to all Propoſitions made on the behalf, offered to raiſe 10000 Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers,
(which if then accepted, had ſhortned that Work,) offered to venture Our
own Perſon in the Service; (what interpretation that Offer of Ours found is known
to all the World) We parted with Our Intereſt in the Land of the Rebels, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
ſuch who were willing to adventure in that buſineſs, and when Mony is raiſed by
Our Conſent for that ſole purpoſe, they have at once ſeized on a hundred thouſand
pound particularly appointed by Act of Parliament for the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> (Our Army
being ready to periſh for want of it) and imployed it to maintain this unnatural Civil
War at home. They have levied Men and entertained Commanders for that Service,
and then compelled them to joyn in this Rebellion, and to march againſt Us. And
though they have complained of Our keeping the Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome weeks
with Us, (when in truth it was a ſeaſon of extraordinary buſineſs,) after We had in vain
for many months preſſed his diſpatch, yet themſelves now detain him, when his going
is ſo neceſſary for the Preſervation of that Kingdom. And no doubt theſe Men (and
theſe alone) by begetting this miſerable Diſtraction of <hi>England,</hi> are guilty before God
and Man of all the inſupportable Calamities that Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> endures.
Let all the World judge where the deſire of Peace is, and upon whoſe account the
Blood and Confuſion which hath been ſhed and muſt follow ſhall be caſt, and whether
the ſeveral Proclamations and Declarations publiſhed by Us have not been extorted
from Us by ſuch unheard-of Inſolencies and Injuries which no former times ever
produced. Neither can any ſober Man wonder, when We are publickly reproached,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60710:169"/>
traduced and reviled to Our People (a practice never known till this Parliament) that
We endeavour by a true Relation and Declaration of Our Actions and Intentions, and
of their Conſpiracies who have vowed Our Deſtruction, to inform Our good Subjects
of the Cunning and Malice they are to encounter with; and when a Combination is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into to deſtroy Us, and to alter the Religion and Law of the Kingdom, and to that
purpoſe an Army raiſed and marching againſt Us, that We proclaim the General of that
Army, and ſuch who ſhall aſſiſt him in levying a War againſt Us, to be <hi>Traitours,</hi> and
have ſet up Our Royal Standard, and required all Our good Subjects to come to Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And yet both in that Proclamation and in all Our Declarations We have never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
Our Parliament, but ſuch factious, ſeditious Members of both Houſes whom We
have named, and whom We are ready to prove according to the Rules of the known Law
to be guilty of High Treaſon. We well know, and all the Kingdom knows, that of near
500. Members which the Houſe of Commons contains, there remains not now there 100.
neither hath above ſuch a number conſented almoſt to any thing of which We have ever
complained; the reſt have either been driven away by Tumults and Threats of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whom We have accuſed, or out of Conſcience withdrawn themſelves from their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Conſultations: and of about 100. Peers of the Realm, there are not above 15. or 16.
who concurre in theſe miſerable Reſolutions which diſturb the publick Peace; many of
which being of deſperate fortunes, have no other ſupport than the Commands now given
them to make War upon Us: and now theſe Men muſt ſit upon the Lives and Fortunes
of all the Nobility, Gentry and Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and becauſe We will not put
Our Self into the hands, Government and diſpoſal of them, all Our good Subjects are
invited and encouraged to Rebel againſt Us. Yet We have been, and are ſtill, far
from accuſing all that ſmall number of both Houſes who are yet left together. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
many of them are miſled by the Cunning and Malice, and frighted by the Power of
thoſe Men whom We have accuſed; againſt every one of whom We have evidence of
matter of Fact, that the known Law of the Land determines to be High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>And now that all Our good Subjects may ſee how deſirous theſe Men and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
are to prevent the effuſion of blood and the laſting Miſeries of a Civil War, they
will make themſelves ſo conſiderable, that except We will recall Our Proclamations and
Declarations whereby thoſe Perſons particularly named, for particular Actions, (which
the Law hath defined to be Treaſon) are ſo accuſed, and others warned from involving
themſelves in their Guilt, and except We will take down Our <hi>Standard,</hi> that Our good
Subjects may not repair to Us for Our Defence, when ſo many Armies are raiſed againſt
Us in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, and ready to deſtroy Us, and ſuch of Our good
Subjects who dare continue loyal to Us, and except We will return to <hi>London,</hi> from
whence with Violence We have been driven, We muſt not be treated with, or receive
any Anſwer to ſo gracious a Meſſage.</p>
                     <p>It can no longer be doubted by any Man who hath not wilfully forſaken his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that it is no more a Quarrel undertaken by the Parliament, but contrived and
ſomented by the perſons We have named, and now continued ſolely in their defence, to
whoſe Ambition, Faction and Malice, the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, the
juſt Right, Honour, Safety and Life of Us and Our Poſterity, the Law of the Land,
which hath ſo long preſerved this Nation Happy, the Liberty of the Subject eſtabliſhed
by that Law, and the glorious Frame and Conſtitution of this Kingdom, muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.
But as We have hitherto left no Action unperformed which in Honour, Juſtice
and Conſcience We were obliged to do, or in Chriſtian Policy and Prudence We could
conceive might probably prevent theſe Calamities; ſo We thank God he hath given Us a
full Courage and Reſolution to run the utmoſt hazard of Our Life for the ſuppreſſion of
this Horrible Rebellion, in the which no diſproportion of Power, Arms or Money ſhall
diſcourage Us. And We hope that all Our good Subjects beſides, by the common Duty of
Allegiance, will be ſtirred up for their own ſakes, for the preſervation of the bleſſed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, and for the upholding this whole admirable Frame of Government, which
being diſſolved, all their private and particular Rights and Intereſts muſt be immediately
confounded, to bring in their utmoſt power and Aſſiſtance unto Us in this deſperate Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
And We do declare, that whoſoever ſhall loſe his life in this Service for Our defence,
the Wardſhip of his Heir ſhall be granted by. Us without Rent or Fine to his own uſe; and
We ſhall hold Our Self obliged to take all poſſible care for the ſupport, relief and protection
of all their Wives and Children, who ſhall have the hard fortune to dye in this Service.</p>

His MAJESTY's Declaration to all His loving Subjects, after His late Victory
againſt the Rebels on Sunday the 23. of October.</head>
                     <p>AS We muſt wholly attribute the Preſervation of Us and Our Children in the late
bloody Battel with the Rebels to the Mercy and Goodneſs of Almighty God,
who beſt knowing the Juſtice of Our Cauſe, and the Uprightneſs of Our Heart to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and to the good and welfare of Our People, would not ſuffer Us and this whole
Kingdom to be made a Prey to thoſe deſperate Perſons: ſo We hold it Our Duty ſtill to
uſe all poſſible means to remove that Jealouſie and Miſ-underſtanding from Our good
Subjects, which by the Induſtry and Subtilty of that Malignant Party (which hath
brought this Miſchiefand Confuſion upon the Kingdom) hath been infuſed into them;
and to that purpoſe (thugh even thoſe Scandals are ſufficiently anſwered by many of
Our Declarations and Meſſages, and by Our late Proteſtation made in the head of Our
Army, which We ſhall always by the help of God ſtedfaſtly and ſolemnly obſerve) We
ſhall take notice of thoſe ſubtile Inſinuations by which at this preſent (according to that
obſervation We can make, and Information We can receive) they endeavour to poyſon
the hearts and corrupt the Allegiance of ſuch of Our good Subjects who cannot ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern their Malice and Impoſtures: Firſt, by urging and preſſing that falſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Imputation of Our favouring Popery, and Our imploying many of that Religion now
in Our Army; ſecondly, by ſeducing Our good People to believe that this Army raiſed
and kept for Our neceſſary Defence (and without which in all probability, the Malice
of theſe Men had before this taken Our Life from Us) is to fight againſt and ſubdue the
Parliament, to take away the Privileges thereof, and thereby to root out Parliaments.
If either of which were true, We ſhould not have the courage with an Army much
greater than Ours to hope for ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>For the Firſt, for Our Affection to that Religion, Our continual Practice, Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Profeſſion and ſeveral Proteſtations will ſatisfie all the World, againſt which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Treaſon it ſelf cannot find the leaſt probable Objection: We wiſh from Our
heart the zeal and affection of theſe Men to the true Proteſtant Religion were as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as Ours. For the imploying Men of that Religion in Our preſent Service in the Army;
whoſoever conſiders the hardneſs and ſtreights the Malice and Fury of theſe Men have
driven Us to, their ſtopping all paſſages and ways that neither Men nor money might
come to Us, their declaring all ſuch to be Traitours who ſhall aſſiſt Us, their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men of all Countries, all Religions, to ſerve againſt Us, would not wonder if We
had been very well contented to have received the ſervice and aſſiſtance of any of Our
good Subjects who had Loyalty enough (whatſoever their Religion is) to bring them
to Our Succour. All Men know the great number of Papiſts which ſerve in their Army,
Commanders and others, the great Induſtry they have uſed to corrupt the Loyalty
and Affection of all Our Subjects of that Religion, the private Promiſes and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
they have made to them, that if they would aſſiſt them againſt Us, all the
Laws made in their prejudice ſhould be repealed: yet neither the weakneſs of
Our own condition, nor the other Arts uſed againſt Us, could prevail with Us to
invite thoſe of that Religion to come to Our ſuccour, or to recal Our Proclamation
which forbad them to do ſo. And We are confident (though We know of ſome few
whoſe eminent Abilities in Command and Conduct, and moderate and unfactious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
hath moved Us in this great Neceſſity to imploy them in this Service) that a far
greater number of that Religion is in the Army of the Rebels than in Our own. And
We do aſſure Our good Subjects, though We ſhall always remember the particular
ſervices which particular Men have or ſhall in this Exigent of Ours perform to Us with
that Grace and Bounty which becomes a juſt Prince; yet We ſhall be ſo far from ever
giving the leaſt countenance or encouragement to that Religion, that We ſhall always
uſe Our utmoſt endeavour to ſuppreſs it, by the execution of thoſe good and wholſome
Laws already in force againſt Papiſts, and concurring in ſuch further Remedies as the
care and wiſdom of Us and both Houſes of Parliament ſhall think moſt neceſſary for
the Advancement of God's Service.</p>
                     <p>For the Second, of Our Intention to make War upon Our Parliament, and ſo to root
out Parliaments; the Scandal is ſo ſenſeleſs, when Our Accuſation of a few particular
Perſons for particular Crimes notoriouſly committed, adjudged by the known Laws of
the Land to be Treaſon, is evident, that no Man can be moved with it, who doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a dozen or twenty Factious, Seditious Perſons to be the High Court of Parliament,
which conſiſts of KING, Lords and Commons. And for the Privileges of it, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth not believe that to raiſe an Army to murther and depoſe the King, to alter the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60710:170"/>
whole frame of Government and eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land by extemporary, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Votes and Reſolutions of either or both Houſes, to force and compel the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to ſubmit to the Faction and Treaſon of a few, and to take away the Liberty and
Freedom of conſultation from them, be the Privileges of Parliament, muſt confeſs that
the Army now raiſed by Us is no leſs for the Vindication and Preſervation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than for Our own neceſſary Defence. We have often ſaid, and We ſtill ſay,
that We believe many Inconveniences have grown upon this Kingdom by the too long
intermiſſion of Parliaments, that Parliaments are the only neceſſary ſovereign Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the growing Miſchiefs which Time and Accidents have and will always
beget in this Kingdom, that without Parliaments the Happineſs cannot be laſting to
King or People; We have prepared for the frequent aſſembling of Parliaments, and
will be always as careful of their juſt Privileges as of Our Life, Honour or Intereſt: But
that thoſe Privileges ſhould extend ſo far as hath been lately declared, that it ſhould
not be lawful for Us to apprehend the Lord <hi>Saint-John,</hi> Captain <hi>Wingate,</hi> or Captain
<hi>Walton,</hi> when they came to deſtroy Us, becauſe they were Members of Parliament,
without the conſent of that Houſe of which they were Members, is ſo ridiculous, that
there need no more to be ſaid in this Argument than the giving theſe inſtances. In a word,
as whoever knows in what Danger Our Perſon was on Sunday the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> can
never believe that the Army which gave Us Battel was raiſed for Our Defence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
ſo when they conſider how much the Liberty of the Subject is invaded by their
Rapine and Impriſoning, and that four parts at the leaſt of five of the Members of both
Houſes are by Violence driven from being preſent in that Council; that the Book of
Common-Prayer is rejected, and no countenance given but to <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Browniſts;</hi>
they will eaſily find the pretences of care of the Proteſtant Religion, the Liberty of the
Subject, and of the Privilege of Parliament, to be as vain and pretended, as thoſe which
refer to the Safety of Our Perſon and preſervation of Our Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>We cannot omit the great pains and endeavours theſe great pretenders to Peace and
Charity have taken to raiſe an implacable Malice and Hatred between the Gentry and
Commonalty of the Kingdom, by rendring all Perſons of Honour, Courage and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
odious to the Common People under the ſtyle of Cavaliers; inſomuch as the
High-ways and Villages have not been ſafe for Gentlemen to paſs through without Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
or Affronts: and by infuſing into them that there was an intention by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of <hi>Array</hi> to take away a part of their Eſtates from them; a Scandal ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeleſs
and impoſſible, that the Contrivers of it well know that they might with equal
Ingenuity have charged Us with a purpoſe of introducing <hi>Turciſme</hi> or <hi>Judaiſme</hi> amongſt
them: and We hope when Our good Subjects have well weighed the continual Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of theſe Men to reject all offers of Treaty, and to ſuppreſs Truth, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
them by bold and monſtrous Falſehoods, they will not think ſuch arts and ways
to lead to Peace and Unity. And We deſire Our good Subjects of all Conditions to
believe that We hold Our Self bound no leſs to defend and protect the meaneſt of Our
People (who are born equally free, and to whom the Law of the Land is an equal
Inheritance) than the greateſt Subject; and that as the Wealth and Strength of this
Kingdom conſiſts in the Number and Happineſs of Our People, which is made up of
Men of all Conditions, ſo We ſhall, to the utmoſt of Our Power, endeavour without
diſtinction to give every one of them that Juſtice and Protection which is due to
them: and We do exhort them all to that charitable and brotherly Affection one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, that they may be reconciled in a juſt Duty and Loyalty to Us, which
may enable Us for that Protection.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, We would have all the World know, that We ſhall never forget the
Proteſtations and Vows We have made to Almighty God in Our ſeveral Declarations
and Meſſages to both Our Houſes of Parliament. And We are too much a Chriſtian to
believe that We can break thoſe Promiſes, and avoid the Juſtice of Heaven.</p>

His MAJESTY's Declaration to all His loving Subjects, of His true Intentions
in advancing lately to Brainceford.</head>
                     <p>THough Our Reputation be moſt dear to Us, and eſpecially in thoſe caſes
wherein the truth of Our moſt ſolemn Profeſſions (and by conſequence of
Our Chriſtianity) is queſtioned; yet it is not only for the Vindication of
that, and to clear Our ſelf from ſuch Aſperſions, but withal to preſerve Our

and Dangers by thoſe malicious Reports, ſo ſpightfully framed and cunningly ſpread
againſt Us concerning Our late advancing to <hi>Brainceford,</hi> that We have reſolved to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

                     <p>AT <hi>Colebrook,</hi> on Friday the 11. of <hi>November,</hi> We received a Petition from both

and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wenman,</hi> Maſter <hi>Pierrepont</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hippeſly:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
We were well pleaſed to ſee it ſo much liker a Petition than the other Papers
We had often of late received under that name, and return'd to it the next day ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                     <head>To the KING's moſt Excellent MAJESTY,
The humble Petition of the Lords and Commons now aſſembled in Parliament.</head>
                     <p>WE Your Majeſty's moſt loyal Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
being affected with a deep and piercing ſenſe of the Miſeries of this Kingdom,
and of the Dangers to Your Majeſty's Perſon, as the preſent Affairs now ſtand, and much
quickned therein with the ſad conſideration of the great effuſion of Blood at the late Battel,
and of the loſs of ſo many eminent Perſons; and further weighing the addition of Loſs,
Miſery and Danger to Your Majeſty and Your Kingdom, which muſt enſue if both Armies
ſhould again joyn in another Battel, as without God's eſpecial Bleſſing, and Your Majeſty's
Concurrence with Your Houſes of Parliament, will not probably be avoided.</p>
                     <p>We cannot but believe that a ſuitable Impreſſion of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion is wrought
in Your Majeſty's Royal Heart, being Your Self an eye-witneſs of the bloody and ſorrowful
deſtruction of ſo many of Your Subjects; and that Your Majeſty doth apprehend what dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Your own Power and Greatneſs will follow, and that all Your Kingdoms will thereby
be ſo weakned as to become ſubject to the Attempts of any ill-affected to this State. In all
which reſpects, we aſſure our ſelves that Your Majeſty will be inclined graciouſly to accept this
our humble Petition, that the Miſery and Deſolation of this Kingdom may be ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and prevented. For the effecting whereof we moſt humbly beſeech Your Majeſty to
appoint ſome convenient place, not far from the City of <hi>London,</hi> where Your Majeſty will
be pleaſed to reſide, until Committees of both Houſes of Parliament may attend Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
with ſome Propoſitions for the removal of theſe bloody Diſtempers and Diſtractions,
and ſettling the ſtate of the Kingdom in ſuch a manner as may conduce to the Preſervation

                     <head>His MAJESTY's Anſwer to the aforeſaid Petition.</head>
                     <p>WE take God to witneſs how deeply We are affected with the Miſeries of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which heretofore We have ſtroven as much as in Vs lay to prevent, it being
ſufficiently known to all the World, that as WE were not the firſt that took up Arms, ſo We
have ſhewed Our readineſs of Compoſing all things in a fair way by Our ſeveral Offers of Treaty,
and ſhall be glad now at length to find any ſuch Inclinations in others; the ſame Tenderneſs
to avoid the Deſtruction of Our Subjects (whom We know to be Our greateſt Strength)
which would always make Our greateſt Victories bitter to Vs, ſhall make Vs willingly hearken
to ſuch Propoſitions whereby theſe bloody Diſtempers may be ſtopped, and the great Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this Kingdom ſettled to God's Glory, Our Honour, and the Welfare and flouriſhing
of Our People; and to that end ſhall reſide at Our own Caſtle at <hi>Windſor</hi> (if the Forces
there ſhall be removed) till Committees may have time to attend Vs with the ſame (which,
to prevent the Inconveniences that will intervene, We wiſh may be haſtened) and ſhall be
ready there, or (if that be refuſed Vs) at any place where We ſhall be, to receive ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
as aforeſaid from both Our Houſes of Parliament. Do you your Duty, We will not
be wanting to Ours: God of his mercy give a Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>But the ſame night after the Meſſengers were gone, certain Information was brought
unto Us, that the ſame day the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had drawn his Forces with great ſtore
of Ordnance out of <hi>London</hi> towards Us: upon which a Council of War being preſent,
and We having there conſidered, upon debate, Our preſent Condition, That being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
almoſt ſurrounded by his Forces, ſome at <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſome at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and ſome
at <hi>Acton,</hi> if We ſuffered the Remainder to poſſeſs <hi>Brainceford,</hi> We ſhould be totally
hemm'd in, and Our Army deprived of all convenience of either moving or ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet how neceſſary ſoever it appeared, We could not obtain Our own Conſent to
advance towards <hi>Brainceford,</hi> and either prepoſſeſs it, or diſpoſſeſs them of it, till We
had ſatisfied Our Selves that it was as lawful as neceſſary, and fully weighed all that
not only Reaſon, but Malice it ſelf (which We knew to be very watchful upon Our
Actions) could object againſt it. We conſidered firſt, that it could not reaſonably be
eſteemed an Averſion from Peace, and an Intention to interrupt the Treaty than in
expectation; ſince on the other ſide We had cauſe to believe by the former rejection of
Our offers of Treaty, when We were ſuppoſed to be in no condition of ſtrength, that
if We would not thus preſerve Our Selves from being ſo encompaſs'd as to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Powers, the very poſſibility of a Treaty would immediately vaniſh. We
conſidered next, that much leſs could it be interpreted any breach of Faith, ſince wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to receive Propoſitions of Treaty was never held to amount to a ſuſpenſion of
Arms; ſince otherwiſe We muſt (becauſe mention of a Treaty had been once made) by
the ſame Logick have been bound not to hinder them to encompaſs Us on all parts to
<hi>Colebrook</hi> Towns-end; ſince no word to that purpoſe (of any ſuſpenſion) was in Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
nay, ſince in that (by wiſhing their Propoſitions might be haſtned, to prevent
the Inconveniences which would intervene) We implied, that by this Arms were not
ſuſpended; and ſince their own Votes of proceeding vigorouſly notwithſtanding the
Petition, and their own actions in ſending after their Meſſengers great ſtore of Forces
with Ordnance ſo near to Us (having before girt Us in on all other parts, and ſent Men
and Ordnance to <hi>Kingſton</hi> after the ſafe Conduct asked of Us) implied the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Being reſolved upon theſe Reaſons, that this Advancing was neceſſary and juſt, We
were not yet ſatisfied, till We had endeavoured the ſame day (though the interruptions of
ſhooting ſtopt the way till the next) to ſatisfie Our Parliament and People of the ſame,
and that Peace was ſtill Our deſire. We to that end directed a Meſſage by <hi>John White</hi>
Eſquire, which was ſo received, that his danger of being put to death for bringing it,
and the Impriſonment of him and the Trumpeter that went with him in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi>
ſhew'd that the Law of Nations was by ſome no more conſidered than all other Laws
had been before. A Copy of which Meſſage hereafter follows, to ſhew how little

We have thought hereby fit to ſignifie to both Our Houſes of Parliament, That We are
no leſs deſirous of the Peace of the Kingdom than We expreſt in Our aforeſaid Anſwer, the
Propoſitions for which We ſhall willingly receive where-ever We are, and deſire (if it may be)
to receive them at <hi>Brainceford</hi> this night, or early to morrow morning, that all poſſible ſpeed may
be made in ſo good a Work, and all Inconveniences otherwiſe likely to intervene may be avoided.</p>
                     <p>And to juſtifie yet further that Our Intention was no other than was here profeſt, as
ſoon as We were informed that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Forces were departed from <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
before any appearance or notice of further Forces from <hi>London</hi> (Our end of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incloſed being obtained) We gave orders to quit <hi>Brainceford,</hi> and to march away;
and poſſeſs that place.</p>
                     <p>We cannot but make one Argument more of the truth of Our Profeſſion, that this
was all Our end, and that We had not the leaſt thought by ſo advancing to ſurpriſe and
ſack <hi>London</hi> (which the Malignant party would infuſe into that Our City;) and that
is, That probably God Almighty would not have given ſuch a Bleſſing to Our Journy;
as to have aſſiſted Us ſo both by Land and Water, as with leſs than a third part of Our
Foot, and with the loſs but of ten Men, to beat two of their beſt Regiments out of
both <hi>Braincefords,</hi> for all the great advantage of their Works in them, to kill him who
commanded in chief, and kill and drown many others, to take five hundred Priſoners;
more Arms, eleven Colours, and good ſtore of Ammunition, fifteen Pieces of Ordnance
(whereof We ſunk moſt that We brought not away) and then unfought with, and
unoffer'd at, nearer than by Ordnance, to march away, notwithſtanding the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of Our Forces by the difficulties of the Paſſages, if He, who is the Searcher of
all Hearts, and Truth it ſelf, had not known the truth of Our Profeſſions, and the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Our Heart, and how far We were from deſerving thoſe horrid Accuſations of
Falſhood and Treachery caſt ſo point-blank upon Our own Perſon, that it would amaze
any Man to ſee them ſuffered to be printed in Our City of <hi>London,</hi> if any thing of that
kind could be a wonder after ſo many of the ſame, and how really they deſire Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
who have upon this voted they will have none.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Our Reaſons for this Action, this Our ſatisfaction ſent for it, and this Bleſſing
of God's upon it, will (We doubt not) clear Us to all indifferent perſons both of the
Jeſuitical Counſels and the Perſonal Treachery to which ſome have preſumed ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to impute it: And God ſo bleſs Our future Actions as We have delivered the
truth of this.</p>

                     <p>TO Your Majeſty's Meſſage of the 12 of this Month of <hi>November,</hi> we the Lords
and Commons in Parliament do make this humble Anſwer, That this Meſſage
was not delivered to us till Monday the 14. We thought it a ſtrange Introduction to
Peace, that Your Majeſty ſhould ſend Your Army to beat us out of our Quarters at
<hi>Brainceford,</hi> and then appoint that place to receive our Propoſitions; which yet it plainly
appears Your Majeſty intended not to receive, till You had firſt tried whether You
could break through the Army raiſed for Defence of this Kingdom and Parliament, and
take the City being unprovided, and ſecure in expectation of a fair Treaty made to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the City. If herein Your Majeſty had prevailed, after You had deſtroyed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and maſtered the City, it is eaſie to imagine what a miſerable Peace we ſhould have
had: and whether thoſe Courſes be ſuitable to the Expreſſions Your Majeſty is pleaſed
to make in Your Anſwer to our Petition, and of Your Earneſtneſs to avoid any further
Effuſion of blood, let God and the world judge.</p>
                     <p>As for our Proceedings, they have in all things been anſwerable to our Profeſſions:
we gave directions to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to draw the Army under his Command out of
the City and Suburbs, before we ſent any Meſſage to Your Majeſty; ſo that part of it
was inquartered at <hi>Brainceford</hi> before the Committee returned with Your Anſwer: and
immediately upon the receit thereof, that very morning order was taken that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſhould exerciſe no Act of Hoſtility againſt any of Your Majeſty's People. We
ſent a Letter by Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew,</hi> to know Your Majeſty's Pleaſure, whether You in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60710:172"/>
the like forbearance of Hoſtility: but the fury of your Souldiers, thirſting after
blood and ſpoil, prevented the delivery of the Letter; for coming upon Saturday in his
way towards Your Majeſty as far as <hi>Brainceford,</hi> he found them in fight there, and could
paſs no further. God, who ſees our Innocency, and that we have no Aims but at his
Glory and the publick good, will (we hope) free Your Majeſty from thoſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Counſels, who labour to maintain their own Power by Blood and Rapine, and
bleſs our Endeavours, who ſeek nothing but to procure and eſtabliſh the Honour,
Peace and Safety of Your Majeſty and Kingdoms, upon the ſure foundation of Religion
and Juſtice.</p>

To the Anſwer of both Houſes of Parliament to His Majeſty's Meſſage
of the 12 of November,
His MAJESTY makes this Reply.</head>
                     <p>THat His Meſſage of the twelfth, though not received by them till the fourteenth,
was ſent to them firſt upon the ſame day upon which it was dated, and meeting
with ſtops by the way, was again ſent upon the 13, and taken upon that day at ten in
the morning by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and though not to him directed, was by him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſo the ſlowneſs of the Delivery is not ſo ſtrange as the ſtop of the Letter ſaid to be
ſent by Sir <hi>Peter Killegrew,</hi> which His Majeſty hath not yet received, but concludes
from the matter expreſſed to have been contain'd in that Letter, (to wit, to know His
Pleaſure, whether He intended the forbearance of Hoſtility) and by the Command of
ſuch forbearance ſaid to be ſent to the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army, that no ſuch forbearance
was already concluded, and conſequently neither had His Majeſty cauſe to ſuppoſe that
He ſhould take any of their Forces unprovided, and ſecure in expectation of a fair
Treaty, neither could any Hoſtile Act of His Majeſties Forces have been a courſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable
to His Expreſſions; much leſs could an endeavour to prepoſſeſs (for ſo He hoped
He might have done) that Place, which might have ſtopt the farther march of thoſe Forces
towards Him, (which, for ought appeared to Him, might as well have been intended to
<hi>Colebrook</hi> as to <hi>Brainceford</hi>) and by that, the further effuſion of blood, deſerve that ſtyle.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty further conceives, that the Printing ſo out of time of ſuch a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as their <hi>Reply</hi> to His <hi>Anſwer</hi> to theirs of the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> but the day before they
Voted the Delivery of their Petition, and the March of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Forces to
<hi>Brainceford</hi> ſo near to his Majeſty, when the Committee at the ſame time attended Him
with a Petition for a Treaty, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being before poſſeſt of all the Avenues to
his Army, by his Forces at <hi>Windſor, Acton</hi> and <hi>Kingſton,</hi> was a more ſtrange Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Peace, than for His Majeſty not to ſuffer Himſelf to be coopt up on all ſides,
becauſe a Treaty had been mentioned, which was ſo really and ſo much deſired by His
Majeſty, that this Proceeding ſeems to Him purpoſely by ſome intended to divert
(which it could not do) that His Inclination.</p>
                     <p>That His Majeſty had no intention to maſter the City by ſo advancing, beſides His
Profeſſion, which (how meanly ſoever they ſeem to value it) He conceives a ſufficient
Argument, (eſpecially being only oppoſed by ſuſpicions and ſurmiſes) may appear by
His not purſuing His Victory at <hi>Brainceford,</hi> but giving orders to His Army to march
away to <hi>Kingſton</hi> as ſoon as He heard that place was quitted, before any notice or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of farther Forces from <hi>London.</hi> Nor could He find a better way to ſatisfie
them before-hand that He had no ſuch intention, but that His deſire of Peace and of
Propoſitions that might conduce to it ſtill continued, than by that Meſſage of the
twelfth. For which care of His He was requited by ſuch a reception of His Meſſage
and Meſſenger, as was contrary at once both to Duty, Civility, and the very Cuſtoms
and Law of War and Nations, and ſuch as theirs (though after this Provocation) hath
not found from Him.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty wonders that His Souldiers ſhould be charged with thirſting after <hi>Blood,</hi>
who took above five hundred <hi>Priſoners</hi> in the very heat of the Fight, His Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſince diſmiſſed all the common Souldiers, and entertain'd ſuch as were willing to
ſerve Him, and required only from the reſt an Oath not to ſerve againſt Him: And
His Majeſty ſuppoſes ſuch moſt apt and likely to maintain their Power by Blood and
Rapine, who have only got it by Oppreſſion and Injuſtice; That His is veſted in Him
by the Law, and by that only (if the deſtructive Counſels of others would not hinder
ſuch a Peace, in which that might once again be the Univerſal Rule, and in which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60710:172"/>
and Juſtice can only flouriſh) He deſires to maintain it. And if Peace were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſired by them, as it is by His Majeſty, He conceives it would have been proper
to have ſent Him ſuch a Paper as ſhould have contained juſt Propoſitions of Peace, and
not an unjuſt Accuſation of His Counſels, Proceedings and Perſon. And His Majeſty
intends to march to ſuch a diſtance from His City of <hi>London,</hi> as may take away all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Apprehenſion from His Army; that might hinder them in all ſecurity from yet
preparing them to preſent to Him; and there will be ready either to receive them, or
to end the Preſſures and Miſeries which His Subjects to His great Grief ſuffer through
this War, by a preſent Battel.</p>

                        <p>WE expected ſuch Propoſitions from you as might ſpeedily remove and prevent

(We now reſiding at a convenient place not far from Our City of <hi>London</hi>) Committees
from both Our Houſes of Parliament ſhould attend Us (for you pretended by your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

all the World judge of the deſign of that Overture) We have only received your humble
Petition, <hi>That We would be pleaſed to return to Our Parliament with Our Royal, not Our
Martial Attendance.</hi> All Our good Subjects that remember what We have ſo often
told you and them upon this Subject, and what hath ſince paſt, muſt with Indignation
look upon this Meſſage, as intended by the Contrivers thereof for a Scorn to Us, and
thereby deſigned by that Malignant party (of whom We have ſo often complained,
whoſe Safety and Ambition is built upon the Diviſions and Ruines of this Kingdom,
and who have too great an Influence upon your Actions) for a Wall of Separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Us and Our People. We have told you the Reaſons why We parted from <hi>London,</hi>
how We were chaſed thence, and by whom: We have often complained that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of Our Peers, and of the Members of Our Houſe of Commons, could not with
ſafety to their Honours and Perſons continue and Vote freely among you, but by violence
and cunning practices were debarred of thoſe Priviledges which their Birth-rights and
the Truſt repoſed in them by their Countries gave them; the truth whereof may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appear by the ſmall number of thoſe that are with you. We have offered you to
meet both Our Houſes in any place free and convenient for Us and them; but We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could receive the leaſt ſatisfaction in any of theſe particulars, nor for thoſe Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and Seditious Pamphlets and Sermons which ſwarm amongſt you. That's all one;
you tell Us, it is now for Our Honour and the Safety of Our Royal Perſon, to return
to Our Parliament: wherein your formerly denying Us a Negative Voice gives Us
cauſe to believe, that by giving your ſelves that Name without Us, you intend not to
acknowledge Us to be part of it. The whole Kingdom knows that an Army was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under pretence of Orders of both Houſes (an Uſurpation never heard of before
in any Age) which Army hath purſued Us in Our own Kingdom, gave Us Battel at
<hi>Keynton,</hi> and endeavoured to take away the life of Us and Our Children; and yet
(theſe Rebels being newly recruited and poſſeſſed of Our City of <hi>London</hi>) We are cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60710:173"/>
invited to return to Our Parliament there, that is, into the Power of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Doth this ſignifie any other thing, than that ſince the traitourous endeavours of
thoſe deſperate Men could not ſnatch the Crown from Our Head, (it being defended
by the Providence of God, and the Affections and Loyalty of Our good Subjects) We
ſhould now tamely come up and give it them, and put Our Selves, Our Life, and the
lives, liberties and fortunes of all Our good Subjects, into their merciful hands? Well,
We think not fit to give any other Anſwer to this part of your Petition But as We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not this Affront to both Our Houſes of Parliament, nor to the major part of thoſe
that are now preſent there, but to that dangerous Party We and the whole Kingdom
muſt cry out upon; ſo We ſhall for Our good Subjects ſake, and out of Our moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſenſe of their Miſeries and the general Calamities of this Kingdom, which muſt (if
this War continue) ſpeedily overwhelm this whole Nation, take no Advantage of it:
But if you ſhall really purſue what you preſented to Us at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> We ſhall make
good all that We then gave you in Anſwer to it; whereby the hearts of Our diſtreſſed
Subjects may be raiſed with the Hopes of Peace, without which, Religion, the Laws

                        <p>Touching the late and ſad Accident you mention, if you thereby intend that of <hi>Braince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>

X. That Your Majeſty will be pleaſed to paſs the Bill now preſented to Your Majeſty,
to vindicate and ſecure the Privileges of Parliament from the ill conſequence of the late
Precedent in the Charge and Proceeding againſt the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
and the five Members of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>XI. That Your Majeſty's Royal Aſſent may be given unto ſuch Acts as ſhall be adviſed
by both Houſes of Parliament, for the ſatisfying and paying the Debts and Damages
wherein the two Houſes of Parliament have ingaged the Publick Faith of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>XII. That Your Majeſty will be pleaſed, according to a Gracious Anſwer heretofore
received from You, to enter into a more ſtrict Alliance with the States of the United
Provinces, and other Neighbour Princes and States of the Proteſtant Religion, for the
defence and maintenance thereof againſt all deſigns and attempts of the Popiſh and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical
Faction to ſubvert and ſuppreſs it; whereby Your Subjects may hope to be free
from the miſchiefs which this Kingdom hath endured through the power which ſome
of that Party have had in Your Counſels, and will be much encouraged in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
way for Your Aid and Aſſiſtance in reſtoring Your Royal Siſter and the Prince
Elector to thoſe Dignities and Dominions which belong unto them, and relieving the
other diſtreſſed Proteſtant Princes who have ſuffered in the ſame Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>XIII. That in the General Pardon, which Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to offer to
Your Subjects, all Offences and Miſdemeanours committed before the tenth of <hi>January</hi>
1641. which have been or ſhall be queſtioned or proceeded againſt in Parliament upon
complaint in the Houſe of Commons before the tenth of <hi>January</hi> 1643. ſhall be excepted;
which offences and miſdemeanours ſhall never the leſs be taken and adjudged to be fully
diſcharged againſt all other inferiour Courts. That likewiſe there ſhall be an exception
of all Offences committed by any perſon or Perſons which hath or have had any hand or
practice in the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which hath or have given any counſel, aſſiſtance
or encouragement to the Rebels there for the maintenance of that Rebellion; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

                     </p>
                     <p>XIV. That Your Majeſty will be pleaſed to reſtore ſuch Members of either Houſe

been put ſince the beginning of this Parliament; that they may receive ſatisfaction and
reparation for thoſe places, and for the profits which they have loſt by ſuch removals,
upon the Petition of both Houſes of Parliament; and that all others may be reſtored to
their Offices and Imployments who have been put out of the ſame upon any diſpleaſure

their Commands, or forbearing to leave their Attendance upon the Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>Theſe things being granted and performed, as it hath always been our hearty Prayer,
ſo ſhall we be enabled to make it our hopeful Endeavour, That Your Majeſty and Your
People may enjoy the bleſſings of Peace, Truth and Juſtice; the Royalty and Greatneſs

their Liberties and Privileges maintained by Your Majeſty's Protection and Juſtice;
and this publick Honour and Happineſs of Your Majeſty and all Your Dominions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

                     <p>IF His Majeſty had not given up all the faculties of His Soul to an earneſt endeavour
of a Peace and Reconciliation with His People, or if He would ſuffer Himſelf by any
Provocation to be drawn to a ſharpneſs of Language at a time when there ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like an Overture of Accommodation, He could not but reſent the heavy charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Him in the Preamble of theſe Propoſitions, and would not ſuffer Himſelf to be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with protecting of Delinquents by force from Juſtice, (His Majeſty's deſire having
always been, that all Men ſhould be tryed by the known Law, and having been refuſed
it) with raiſing an Army againſt His Parliament, and to be told that Arms have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up againſt Him for the defence of Religion, Laws, Liberties, Privileges of Parliament,
and for the ſitting of the Parliament in ſafety, with many other Particulars in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60710:174"/>
ſo often and ſo fully anſwered by His Majeſty, without remembring the world of
the time and circumſtances of raiſing thoſe Arms againſt Him, when His Majeſty was
ſo far from being in a condition to invade other mens Rights, that He was not able to
maintain and defend His own from violence; and without telling His good Subjects that
their Religion (the true Proteſtant Religion, in which His Majeſty was born, hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
lived, and to which He will die a willing Sacrifice) their Laws, Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and ſafety of Parliament were ſo amply ſettled and eſtabliſhed, or offered to be ſo
by His Majeſty, before any Army was raiſed againſt Him, and long before any raiſed by
Him for His defence; that if nothing had been deſired but that Peace and Protection
which His Subjects and their Anceſtors had in the beſt times enjoyed under His Majeſty
or His Royal Predeceſſors, this Miſunderſtanding and diſtance between His Majeſty
and His People, and this general Miſery and Diſtraction upon the face of the whole
Kingdom, had not been now the diſcourſe of Chriſtendom. But His Majeſty will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
any Expreſſions of Bitterneſs or of a ſenſe of His own Sufferings, that, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the memory thereof may be loſt to the World. And therefore though many of
the Propoſitions preſented to His Majeſty by both Houſes appear to Him very derogatory
from and deſtructive to His juſt Power and Prerogative, and no way beneficial to His
Subjects, few of them being already due to them by the Laws eſtabliſhed, (and how
unparliamentary it is by Arms to requrie new Laws, all the World may judge:) yet
(becauſe theſe may be waved or mollified, and many things that are now dark or doubtful
in them cleared and explained upon debate) His Majeſty is pleaſed (ſuch is His ſenſe of
the Miſeries this Kingdom ſuffers by this unnatural War, and His earneſt deſire to remove
them by a happy Peace) that a ſpeedy time and place may be agreed upon for the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſuch perſons as His Majeſty and both Houſes ſhall appoint to diſcuſs theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and ſuch others here following as His Majeſty doth propoſe to them.</p>
                     <p>I. That His Majeſty's own Revenue, Magazins, Towns, Forts and Ships, which
have been taken or kept from Him by force, be forthwith reſtored unto Him.</p>
                     <p>II. That whatſoever hath been done or publiſhed contrary to the known Laws of the
Land, or derogatory to His Majeſty's Legal and known Power and Rights, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and recalled, that no ſeed may remain for the like to ſpring out of for the future.</p>
                     <p>III. That whatſoever illegal power hath been claimed and exerciſed by or over His
Subjects, as Impriſoning their Perſons without Law, ſtopping their <hi>Habeas Corpuſſes,</hi>
and impoſing upon their Eſtates without Act of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either by both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Houſe, or any Committee of both or either, or by any perſons appointed by any of
them, be diſclaimed, and all ſuch perſons ſo committed forthwith diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>IV. That as His Majeſty will readily conſent (having done ſo heretofore to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Laws already made, and to any good Acts to be made, for the ſuppreſſing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and for the firm ſettling of the Proteſtant Religion now eſtabliſhed by Law:) ſo He
deſires that a good Bill may be framed for the better preſerving of the Book of Common-Prayer

ſuch clauſes for the eaſe of Tender Conſciences as His Majeſty hath formerly offered.</p>
                     <p>V. That all ſuch perſons as upon the Treaty ſhall be excepted out of the general
Pardon ſhall be tried <hi>per Pares,</hi> according to the uſual courſe and known Law of the
Land, and that it be left to that either to acquit or condemn them.</p>
                     <p>VI. And to the intent this Treaty may not ſuffer interruption by any intervening
Accidents, that a Ceſſation of Arms, and free Trade for all His Majeſty's Subjects,
may be firſt agreed upon.</p>
                     <p>This Offer and Deſire of His Majeſty He hopes will be ſo chearfully entertained,
that a ſpeedy and bleſſed Peace may be accompliſhed. If it ſhall be rejected, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
upon unreaſonable Circumſtances be made impoſſible (which He hopes God in
his Mercy to this Nation will not ſuffer) the guilt of the Blood which will be ſhed, and
the Deſolation which muſt follow, will lie upon the heads of the Refuſers. However
His Majeſty is reſolved, through what accidents ſoever He ſhall be compelled to recover
His Rights, and with what proſperous Succeſſes ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſs Him,
that by His earneſt, conſtant endeavours to propagate and promote the true Proteſtant

Miſeries and Diſtractions of the Kingdom, and for the obtaining and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of a happy Peace between His Majeſty and His People, have humbly preſented
to His Majeſty divers Propoſitions, to which He hath been pleaſed to make this return,
That His deſire was, that a ſpeedy time and place might be appointed for the diſcuſſing
of thoſe Propoſitions, and likewiſe ſome others propoſed by His Majeſty: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

 that for avoiding all intervening Accidents of War

concurring with His Majeſty, it is by them aſſented and agreed, That a Ceſſation of

                     </head>
                     <p>HIS Majeſty hoped the Treaty would have been begun and the Ceſſation agreed
on long ſince, and that much might in this time have been concluded in order to
the Peace and Happineſs of the Kingdom; but ſince in almoſt a month (for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Propoſitions were made on the third of <hi>February,</hi> and He heard not ſince from
both Houſes till the firſt of <hi>March</hi>) no conſent hath been yielded to it, He conceives the
Ceſſation cannot begin ſo ſoon as the fourth of this month, by which time (though His
Majeſty uſes no delay in making His Anſwer) the ſame can hardly be returned to them;
and many of the Articles now preſented to Him from both Houſes concerning the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
are ſo ſtrict, that ſuch of His good Subjects who are not of His Army (and for
whom generally He ſhall always have a principal, juſt and compaſſionate regard) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not any benefit; or are reſtored to any liberty thereby, which His Majeſty ſhall ever
inſiſt upon (when in matters meerly concerning Himſelf He may deſcend to eaſier Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions)
and which He hath returned with ſuch Alterations as He doubts not both
Houſes will conſent to, and do ſufficiently manifeſt how ſollicitous His Majeſty is for the
good of His People, and how deſirous He is that in this unnatural contention no more
blood of His Subjects may be ſpilt (upon which He looks with much grief, compaſſion
and tenderneſs of heart) even of thoſe who have lifted up their hands againſt Him: and
His Majeſty therefore deſires (againſt which He can imagine no objection can be made)
that the Ceſſation may begin upon the twelfth of this month, or ſooner, if the Conditions
of the Ceſſation ſhall be ſooner agreed on; and is willing the ſame ſhall continue for
twenty days, in which time He hopes by the Treaty, and a clear underſtanding of each
other, a full Peace and Happineſs may be eſtabliſhed throughout the Kingdom. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time His Majeſty is willing that neither ſide ſhall be bound or limited by this
Ceſſation in any other wiſe, or to any other purpoſe, than is hereafter expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>I. That all manner of Arms, Ammunition, Mony, Bullion and Victuals paſſing for

may be ſtaied and ſeized on, as if no Ceſſation were agreed on at all.</p>
                     <p>II. That all Officers and Soldiers of either Army, paſſing without ſuch licence or
ſafe Conduct as aforeſaid, may be apprehended and detained, as if no ſuch Ceſſation were

as likewiſe to and from any other parts of His Majeſty's Dominions, without
any ſearch, ſtay, or impriſonment of their perſons, or ſeiſure and detention of their
goods or eſtates; and that all manner of Trade, Traffick and Commerce, be free and
open between all His Majeſty's Subjects, excepting, as aforeſaid, between the Officers
and Soldiers of either Army, or for Arms, Ammunition, Mony, Bullion or Victuals,
for the uſe of either Army, without a paſs or ſafe Conduct as aforeſaid, which may
be a good beginning to renew the Trade and Correſpondence of the Kingdom, and
whereby His good Subjects may be reſtored to that liberty and freedom they were
born to, and have ſo happily enjoyed till theſe miſerable Diſtractions, and which even
during this War His Majeſty hath to His utmoſt laboured to preſerve, opening the
way by moſt ſtrict Proclamations to the paſſage of all Commodities even to the City
of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>III. That His Majeſty's Forces in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> ſhall advance no nearer to <hi>Windſor</hi>

 Articles of Ceſſation ſent to His Majeſty.</head>
                     <p>HIS Majeſty hath ſent a ſafe Conduct for the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pierre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Armyne,</hi> Sir <hi>John Holland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitelocke,</hi> but hath not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Lord <hi>Say</hi> to attend Him, as being excepted againſt by name in His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
at <hi>Oxford</hi> of the third of <hi>November,</hi> and by Writ to the Sheriff proclaimed then
in that County, in which His Majeſty's Intention is declared to proceed againſt him
as a perſon guilty of High-Treaſon, and ſo falling to be within the caſe of Sir <hi>John
Evelin,</hi> who upon the ſame Exception was not admitted to attend His Majeſty with
the reſt of the Committee at <hi>Colebrook</hi> in <hi>November</hi> laſt: But His Majeſty doth ſignifie,
that in caſe the Houſe ſhall think fit to ſend any other perſon in the place of the Lord
<hi>Say</hi> that is not included in the like Exception, His Majeſty hath commanded all His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Soldiers and other Subjects, to ſuffer Him as freely to paſs and repaſs as if His
Name had been particularly compriſed in this ſafe Conduct.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty is content that His Propoſition concerning the Magazines, Forts, Ships
and Revenue, and the Propoſition of both Houſes for the disbanding of the Armies,
ſhall be firſt Treated of, and agreed of before the proceeding to treat upon any of the
other Propoſitions, and that after, the ſecond of His Majeſty's and the ſecond of theirs
be treated on, and agreed of, and ſo on in the ſame order; and that from the beginning
of the Treaty the time may not exceed Twenty days; in which He hopes a full Peace
and right underſtanding may be eſtabliſhed throughout the Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>THE Lords and Commons in Parliament being ſtill carried on with a vehement
deſire of Peace, that ſo the Kingdom may ſpeedily be freed from the Deſolation
and Deſtruction wherewith it is like to be overwhelmed if the War ſhould continue,
have with as much expedition as they could conſidered of the Articles of Ceſſation,
with thoſe Alterations and Additions offered by His Majeſty, unto which they are
ready to agree in ſuch manner as is expreſt in theſe enſuing Articles (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>I. That all manner of Arms, Ammunition, Victual, Mony, Bullion and all other
Commodities, paſſing without a ſafe Conduct from the Generals of both Armies, as well
of His Majeſty's as of the Armies raiſed by the Parliament, may be ſtayed and ſeized
on, as if no ſuch Ceſſation were agreed on at all.</p>
                     <p>II. That all manner of perſons paſſing without ſuch a ſafe Conduct as is mentioned
in the Articles next going before, ſhall be apprehended and detained, as if no ſuch Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were agreed on at all.</p>

                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:60710:176"/>
III. That His Majeſty's Forces in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> ſhall advance no nearer to <hi>Windſor</hi> than <hi>Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> no nearer to <hi>Ailesbury</hi> than <hi>Brill,</hi> and that in <hi>Berkſhire</hi> the Forces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
ſhall not advance nearer the one to the other than they ſhall be at the day to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on for the Ceſſation to begin; and that the Forces of the other Army raiſed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhall advance no nearer to <hi>Oxford</hi> than <hi>Henley,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> no nearer
to <hi>Oxon</hi> than <hi>Ailesbury;</hi> and that the Forces of neither Army ſhall advance their Quarters nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to each other than they ſhall be upon the day agreed on for the Ceſſation to begin.</p>
                     <p>IV. That the Forces of either Army in <hi>Glouceſterſhire, Wilts</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as likewiſe in
the Cities of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Berkly,</hi> ſhall be guided by
the Rule expreſt in the latter part of the precedent Article.</p>
                     <p>V. That in caſe it be pretended on either ſide that the Ceſſation is violated, no act of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is immediately to follow, but firſt the party complaining is to acquaint the Lord General
on the other ſide, and to allow three days after notice given for ſatisfaction, and in caſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
be not given or accepted, then five days notice to be given before Hoſtility begin;
and the like to be obſerved in the remoter Armies by the Commanders in chief.</p>
                     <p>VI. That all other Forces in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> not before
mentioned, ſhall remain in the ſame Quarters and places as they are at the time of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of this Ceſſation, and under the ſame Conditions as are mentioned in the Articles
before: and that this Ceſſation ſhall not extend to reſtrain the ſetting forth or employing of
any Ships for the defence of His Majeſty's Dominions.</p>
                     <p>VII. That as ſoon as His Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to disband the Armies, which both
Houſes earneſtly deſire may be ſpeedily effected, and to diſarme the Papiſts according to Law,
the Subjects may then enjoy the benefit of Peace in the liberty of their Perſons, Goods,
and Freedom of Trade; in the mean time the Generals and Commanders of the Armies of
both ſides ſhall be enjoyned to keep the Souldiers from plundering, which the two Houſes
of Parliament have ever diſliked and forbidden.</p>
                     <p>And for the ſpeedy ſettling of this ſo-much-deſired Peace, they have thought good to ſend
their Committees with Inſtructions, that if His Majeſty be pleaſed to conſent to a Ceſſation
ſo limited and qualified, they may forthwith proceed to treat upon the Propoſitions; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the time is ſo far elapſed in theſe preparations, they deſire the Ceſſation may begin the

to be given to all the Forces in the ſeveral and remote parts, and the Commanders, Officers &amp;
Souldiers are enjoyned to obſerve this Ceſſation accordingly, to which they hope and pray
that God will give ſuch a bleſſing, that thereupon Peace, Safety and Happineſs may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and confirmed to His Majeſty and all His People.</p>

                     <p>You ſhall declare, That the two Houſes of Parliament have not made uſe of His Majeſty's
own Revenue but in a very ſmall proportion, which for a good part hath been employed in
the maintenance of His Majeſty's Children, according to the allowance eſtabliſhed by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;

                     <p>That ſome Officers of both Armies may ſpeedily meet to agree of the manner of the disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

                     <p>That all other Towns, Forts and Caſtles, where there have been formerly Garriſons before
theſe Troubles, be committed to the charge of ſuch Perſons to be nominated by His Majeſty

                     </opener>
                     <p>HIS Majeſty hath immediately upon their arrival admitted the Committee ſent to
Him from both Houſes of Parliament (as the Meſſengers of Peace) to His Royal
Preſence, and received the Articles of Ceſſation brought by them, which are in effect the
ſame His Majeſty formerly excepted to, though their expreſſion in the Preface to theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
of their readineſs to agree to thoſe Alterations and Additions offered by His Majeſty
in ſuch manner as is expreſſed, made Him expect to have found at leaſt ſome of the real
Alterations and Additions made by Him admitted, which He doth not diſcover.</p>
                     <p>I. His Majeſty deſired that Proviſion might be made, and Licence given to His good
Subjects for their freedom of Trade, Traffick and Commerce (though in matters which
concerned Himſelf more immediately, as in Arms, Ammunition, Mony, Bullion and
Victual, for the uſe of His Army, and the Paſſage of all Officers and Souldiers of His
Army, He was contented the reſtraint ſhould be in ſuch manner as was propoſed) of
which His Majeſty is ſo tender, that as he hath provided for the ſame by His gracious
Proclamations, ſo He doth daily releaſe and diſcharge ſuch Merchandize and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as are contrary to thoſe Proclamations ſtayed by any of His Majeſties Forces.</p>
                     <p>To this Freedom and Liberty of His good Subjects there is not the leaſt admiſſion given
by theſe Articles, ſo that they have not any eaſe or benefit by this Ceſſation; which His
Majeſty deſires both Houſes to conſider of, and whether, if His Majeſty ſhould take the
ſame courſe to ſtop and interrupt the Trade of the Kingdom as the other Army doth,
a general Loſs and Calamity would not ſeize upon His good Subjects.</p>
                     <p>II. His Majeſty, to the end that a full Ceſſation might be as well at Sea as at Land,
and He might be ſecured, that the Ships propoſed to be ſet forth for the Defence of His
Majeſties Dominions ſhould be employed only to that end and purpoſe, deſired, that they
might be put under the Command of Perſons to be approved of by His Majeſty; which
is not conſented to by theſe Articles, but their former, to which His Majeſty excepted,
ſtrictly and entirely inſiſted on, by which (beſides that part of Hoſtility remains) the
conveying of any number of Forces from any part to any other by that means remains
free to them.</p>
                     <p>III. For the prevention of any Inconveniences which might ariſe upon real Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or Miſtakes upon the latitude of Expreſſions (as if His Majeſty ſhould now conſent
to theſe Articles propoſed in the Terms propoſed, He muſt confeſs the Army of which
He complains to be raiſed by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and either Himſelf to be no part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Himſelf to have raiſed that Army) and for prevention of that Delay which He
foreſaw could not otherwiſe be avoided, if upon every Difference the Queſtions muſt
be remitted to <hi>London,</hi> His Majeſty deſired that the Committee (for whom He then
ſent a ſafe Conduct) might have liberty to debate any ſuch Differences and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and reconcile the ſame, that all poſſible Expedition might be uſed to the main
Treaty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="340" facs="tcp:60710:178"/>
In this point of ſo high Concernment no power is given in theſe Articles, and the
Committee confeſſed to His Majeſty they have no Power given, but are ſtrictly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
bound to the very words of the Articles now ſent, and that before theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to by Us, they cannot enter into any Treaty concerning the other Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>IV. His Majeſty deſired, that during the Ceſſation none of His good Subjects might
be impriſoned, otherwiſe than according to the known Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>This is in no degree conſented to, but the priviledge and liberty, to which they were
born, reſerved from them till the disbanding of both Armies (though they are no part
of either Army) and ſo have no benefit by this Ceſſation.</p>
                     <p>V. His Majeſty deſired, that during this Ceſſation there ſhould be no Plundering or
Violence offered to any of His Subjects.</p>
                     <p>In the Anſwer to which, His deſire againſt Violence is not at all taken notice of, nor
is His deſire againſt Plundering any ways ſatisfied; His Majeſty not only intending by it
the robbing of the Subject by the unrulineſs of the uncommanded Souldier (which their
Clauſe of requiring the Generals and Officers to keep them from it ſeems to imply, and
the aſſertion, that the two Houſes of Parliament had ever diſliked and forbidden it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
plainly to be their only meaning) but particularly the Violence and Plundering
uſed to His Subjects by forcibly taking away their goods, for not ſubmitting to Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Taxes required from them by Orders or Ordinances of one or both Houſes of
Parliament, which are contrary to the known Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>VI. Beſides that there is no conſent given to thoſe Alterations and Additions offered
by His Majeſty, (whatſoever is pretended) ſo where an abſolute Conſent may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
becauſe the very words of His Majeſties Article are wholly preſerved, yet by
reaſon of the Relation to ſomewhat going before that is varied by them, the ſenſe of
thoſe words is wholy varied too; as in the Fourth Article, that part of the Third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
to which that did refer being wholly left out. So that upon the matter all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
made by His Majeſty (which did not in Terms agree with thoſe preſented to
Him) are utterly rejected.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Reaſons, and that this Entrance towards a bleſſed Peace and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which hath already filled the hearts of the Kingdom with Joy and Hope) may
be improved to the wiſhed end, His Majeſty deſires, that the Committee now ſent may
ſpeedily have liberty to treat, debate, and agree upon the Articles of Ceſſation in which
they and all the World ſhall find, that His Majeſty is leſs ſollicitous for His own Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Greatneſs than for His Subjects Eaſe and Liberty. And He doubts not upon ſuch
a Debate all differences concerning the Ceſſation will be eaſily and ſpeedily agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the benefit of a Ceſſation be continued and confirmed to His People, by a ſpeedy
disbanding of both Armies, and a ſudden and firm Peace, which His Majeſty above all
things deſires.</p>
                     <p>If this ſo reaſonable, equal and juſt Deſire of His Majeſty ſhall not be yielded unto,
but the ſame Articles ſtill inſiſted upon, though His Majeſty next to Peace deſires a
Ceſſation, yet that the not-agreeing upon the one may not deſtroy the hopes of nor ſo
much as delay the other, He is willing however to Treat (even without a Ceſſation,
if that be not granted) upon the Propoſitions themſelves, in that order as is agreed, upon
(and deſires the Committee here may be enabled to that effect.) In which Treaty He
ſhall give all His Subjects that ſatisfaction, that if any ſecurity to enjoy all the Rights,
Privileges and Liberties due to them by the Law, or that Happineſs in Church and
State which the beſt times have ſeen, with ſuch farther acts of Grace as may agree with
His Honour, Juſtice and Duty to His Crown, and as may not render Him leſs able to
protect His Subjects according to His Oath, will ſatisfie them, He is confident in the
Mercy of God, that no more precious blood of this Nation will be thus miſerably ſpent.</p>

                     <opener>To the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty.</opener>
                     <p>THe Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled do with all humble thankfulneſs
acknowledge Your Majeſty's Favour in the ſpeedy admiſſion of their Committee
to Your Royal Preſence, and the expedition of Your Exceptions to their Articles, that
ſo they might more ſpeedily endeavour to give Your Majeſty ſatisfaction: and although
they were ready to agree to the Articles of Ceſſation in ſuch manner as they expreſt in
their Preface, they cannot agree to the Alteration and Addition offered by Your Majeſty
without great prejudice to the Cauſe, and danger to the Kingdom, whoſe Cauſe it is:
The reaſons whereof will plainly appear in the Anſwer to the particulars preſt by Your
Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>I. They do deny that they have reſtrained any Trade, but to ſome few of thoſe places
where Your Majeſty's Forces are inquartered, and even now in the heat of War do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Carriers to go into all the parts of the Kingdom with all ſorts of Commodities
for the uſe of the Subjects, except Arms, Ammunition, Mony and Bullion: But if they
ſhould grant ſuch a free Trade as Your Majeſty deſired to <hi>Oxford</hi> and other places, where
Your Forces remain, it would be very difficult, if not impoſſible, to keep Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
Mony and Bullion from paſſing into Your Majeſty's Army, without very ſtrict
and frequent Searches, which would make it ſo troubleſome, chargeable and dangerous
to the Subjects, that the queſtion being but for twenty days for ſo few places, the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and Inconveniences to the whole Kingdom would be far greater than any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which that ſmall number of Your Subjects (whom it concerns) can have by it.</p>
                     <p>The caſe then is much otherwiſe than is expreſt by Your Majeſty's Anſwer: for
whereas they are charged not to give the leaſt admiſſion of this liberty and freedom of
Trade during the Ceſſation; the truth is, that they do grant it as fully to the benefit of the
Subject even in time of War; and that Your Majeſty in preſſing this for the Peoples
good, doth therein deſire that which will be very little beneficial to the Subjects, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
advantagious to Your Majeſty, in ſupplying Your Army with many neceſſaries,
and making Your Quarters a ſtaple for ſuch Commodities as may be vented in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Counties, and ſo draw Mony thither, whereby the Inhabitants will be better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by Loans and Contributions to ſupport Your Majeſty's Army. And as Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Army may receive much Advantage, and the other Army much Danger, if ſuch
freedom ſhould be granted to thoſe places: ſo there is no probability that the Army raiſed
by the Lords and Commons ſhall have any return of Commodities and other Supplies
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60710:179"/>
from thence, which may be uſeful for them. And they conceive, that in a Treaty for a
Ceſſation thoſe demands cannot be thought reaſonable which are not indifferent, that is,
equally advantagious to both parties.</p>
                     <p>As they have given no interruption to the Trade of the Kingdom, but in relation to
the ſupply of the contrary Army, which the reaſon of War requires; ſo they beſeech
Your Majeſty to conſider, whether Your Souldiers have not robbed the Carriers in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts where there hath been no ſuch reaſon, and Your Ships taken many Ships, to the
great damage not only of particular Merchants, but of the whole Kingdom; and whether
Your Majeſty have not declared Your own purpoſe, and endeavoured by Your Miniſters
of State to embarque the Merchants goods in Forein parts, which hath been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
executed upon the Eaſt-land Merchants in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and is a courſe which will much
diminiſh the Wealth of the Kingdom, violate the Law of Nations, make other Princes
Arbiters of the Differences betwixt Your Majeſty and Your People, break off the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
betwixt this and other States, and like to bring us into quarrels and diſſentions
with all the neighbour-Nations.</p>
                     <p>II. To demand the approving of the Commanders of the Ships, is to deſire the ſtrength
of one party to the other before the difference be ended, and againſt all Rules of Treaty:
To make a Ceſſation at Sea, would leave the Kingdom naked to thoſe Forein Forces
which they have great cauſe to believe have been ſollicited againſt them, and the Ports
open for ſuch ſupplies of Arms and Ammunition as ſhall be brought from beyond the
Seas. But for conveying any number of Forces by thoſe means from one part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they ſhall obſerve the Articles of the Ceſſation by which that is reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>III. As for the expreſſion of [<hi>the Army raiſed by the Parliament,</hi>] they are contented
it ſhould be altered thus [<hi>raiſed by both Houſes of Parliament,</hi>] as not deſiring to differ
upon words: But to give any concluſive Power in this caſe to the Committee upon ſuch
Differences as may ariſe, wherein the Houſes have given no expreſs direction, is neither
ſafe for the Committee to undertake, nor fit for the two Houſes to grant; yet to debate
and to preſs the reaſon of their deſires, whereby an Agreement from Your Majeſty may be
procured, is granted to them. And although the two Houſes did think it moſt proper the
Ceſſation ſhould be firſt agreed on, and that it was unfit to Treat in blood; yet to ſatisfie
the World of their earneſt longing after Peace, they have given power to the Committee
to enter into the Treaty upon the two firſt Propoſitions, notwithſtanding the Ceſſation
be not yet aſſented to: and thoſe being agreed, they hope the foundation will be laid,
not only of a ſuſpenſion, but a total abolition of all Hoſtility in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>IV. If the nature of War be duly conſidered, it muſt needs be acknowledged, that it is
incompatible with the ordinary rules of a peaceable Government. Your Majeſty would
have them commit none but according to the known Laws of the Land; whereby they
conceive Your Majeſty underſtands, that it muſt be by the ordinary Proceſs of Law: which
being granted, it will follow, that no man muſt be committed by them for ſupplying
Your Majeſty with Arms, Powder, Ammunition; for by the Law of the Land the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
may carry ſuch goods from <hi>London,</hi> or any other place, to <hi>Oxford:</hi> the Souldiers muſt
not be committed if they run from their Colours and refuſe any duty in the Army: no
man ſhall be committed for not ſubmitting to neceſſary ſupplies of Mony. So that if this
be yielded in Your Majeſty's ſenſe, they ſhall be diſabled to reſtrain ſupplies from their
Enemies, and to govern or maintain their own Souldiers. It cannot be thought reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that under the diſguiſe of a Ceſſation, they ſhould admit that which will neceſſarily
produce the diſſolving of the Army, and deſtruction of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems not probable that Your Majeſty doth intend, that if any be taken with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
for this Army, or mutining in Your own, ſuch perſons ſhall not be committed, but
according to the known Laws of the Land, that is, by proceſs of Law: but rather that
Your Majeſty will ſo interrupt this limitation of known Laws, that though it lays ſtreight
bonds upon the two Houſes, yet it leaves Your Generals as much liberty as before. For
it hath been denied by Your Majeſty, that theſe known Laws, give any Power to the two
Houſes of Parliament to raiſe Arms, and ſo conſequently their General cannot exerciſe
any Martial Law in thoſe caſes: and it is not unlike but that it will be affirmed, that the
Generals conſtituted by Your Majeſtys Commiſſion have that power by the ſame known
Laws. So that this Article, under the ſpecious ſhew of Liberty and Law, would altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſable them to defend their Liberties and Laws, and would produce to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
an abſolute Victory and Submiſſion, under pretence of a Ceſſation and Treaty.</p>
                     <p>V. Being by neceſſity inevitable on their part enforced to a defenſive War in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Breach between Your Majeſty and them, and that they are therein warranted
both by the Laws of God and Man, it muſt needs follow, that by the ſame Law they are
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60710:180"/>
enabled to raiſe means to ſupport that War; and therefore till it ſhall pleaſe God to incline
Your Majeſty to afford them ſuch a Peace as may ſecure them, they cannot relinquiſh
the power of laying Taxes upon thoſe who ought to joyn with them in that Defence, and
the neceſſary ways of levying thoſe Taxes upon them, in caſe of refuſal, for otherwiſe
their Army muſt needs be diſſolved. But if Your Majeſty ſhall conſent to disband the
Armies, the Cauſe of the War being taken away, the Conſequences will likewiſe be
removed, and the Subject reſtored to the benefit of thoſe Laws which the neceſſity of
Arms hath in ſuch caſes ſuſpended.</p>
                     <p>VI. They deny any pretence of conſenting to thoſe Alterations and Additions offered
by Your Majeſty; only in the Preamble they ſay they have conſidered of thoſe Articles,
with ſuch Alterations and Additions, unto which Articles they profeſt they were ready
to agree, not as they were accompanied with thoſe Alterations and Additions, but in
ſuch manner as they expreſſed. As for the Clauſe left out in the third Article, it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a freedom of paſſage and communication of Quarters, which is contrary to the nature
of a Ceſſation, whereby matters ſhould be preſerved in the ſtate they are, and neither
party have liberty ſo much to advantage himſelf, as it is evident Your Majeſty might do,
if your Forces in the North and Weſt might joyn with thoſe at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and bring thoſe
ſupplies of Treaſure or Arms thither which were brought out of <hi>Holland;</hi> or at leaſt it
ſhould be ſo indifferent, as to give a proportionable advantage to the other ſide, which
this doth not: For the Forces under the power of both Houſes are ſo diſpoſed, that they
have an eaſie paſſage from one to the other; but Your Majeſty's Forces are ſevered the
one from the other by many large Counties, ſtrong Paſſes, and competent Armies: and
if they had admitted this Clauſe, they had bereaved themſelves of one of the greateſt
Advantages, and freed Your Majeſty's party of one of the greateſt Inconveniences which
Your Majeſty or they have in this War.</p>
                     <p>For the Reaſons already alledged, they cannot agree to the alterations and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Ceſſation propounded, or to transfer any ſuch power to the Committee, of
treating, debating and agreeing upon thoſe Articles in any other manner than the Houſes
have directed: but that a fair and ſpeedy paſſage may be opened to a ſecure and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Peace, they have enabled their Committees to treat and debate upon the two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
concerning His Majeſty's own Revenue, the delivery of His Towns, Caſtles,
Magazines and Ships, and the disbanding of the Armies; which being agreed upon, a
preſent Peace and Security will follow, and the Treaty upon the other Propoſitions be
facilitated without fear of interruption by the confuſion of War, or exaſperation of either
party by the bloody effects thereof.</p>
                     <p>In which Treaty the two Houſes will deſire and expect nothing but what doth ſtand
with Your Majeſty's Honour and the Truſt repoſed in You, and is neceſſary for your
Majeſty's good Subjects, that they may enjoy the true Religion, and their Liberties and
Privileges, and that they may freely and in a Parliamentary way concur with Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in thoſe things which may conduce to the Glory of God, the Safety and Happineſs
of Your Majeſty and Your Poſterity and People, and preventing the like miſerable effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood for the time to come. For the effecting whereof their moſt earneſt

His Majeſty's Meſſage concerning the Ceſſation.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <signed>CHARLES R.</signed>
                     </opener>
                     <p>HOW His Majeſty hath ſpent His time ſince the Committee from His two Houſes
of Parliament came hither, how willing He hath been (during the four days al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to them) to expedite the Treaty it ſelf, by the free and diligent diſquiſition of
the particulars comprized in thoſe two firſt Articles, and how intent He hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ceſſation (which He thinks ſo neceſſary, and ſo much deſires) ſince the laſt
Meſſage concerning the ſame came to Him, the Committee themſelves cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:
And though no concluſion could be made within the two days (a time limited
with much ſtrictneſs in a buſineſs of ſo great moment, where all words and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt be carefully and exactly weighed) His Majeſty cannot doubt but both Houſes
will be willing to give and receive ſatisfaction in any particulars which are neceſſarily
to be conſidered in concluding the ſame, though the two days are expired. And if
His Majeſty enlarges Himſelf in His Replys more than may ſeem neceſſary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and Differences in debate, it muſt be remembred, by what unneceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
expreſſions in this laſt Meſſage from His two Houſes He is not only invited,
but compelled thereunto; which He could heartily have wiſhed might upon this occaſion
have been forborn.</p>
                     <p>I. For the Freedom of Trade, His Majeſty hath great reaſon to require, and the two
Houſes to admit, that Freedom to His good Subjects He deſired. For what concerns
the ſupply of the Army with Arms, Ammunition, Money, Bullion and Victuals, He
conſented to the very terms propoſed by the two Houſes; and that they may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is contented that ſearches may be made, which being but the trouble of particular
perſons, is not conſiderable, in reſpect of the Publick benefit and advantage. But why
all other liberty of Traffick and Commerce ſhould not be granted to His good Subjects,
He cannot underſtand; for that His Majeſty's Army ſhould receive much Advantage
thereby, and the contrary Army none, is in no degree confeſſed. For (beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
is to places where no part of His Majeſty's Army is, and indeed the whole Trade
of the Kingdom interrupted) 'tis as great a ſupport (if not a greater) to the contrary
Army, to maintain and keep up the Trade of <hi>London,</hi> from whence that receives its
ſupply and relief, as to His Majeſty's Army to continue the Trade of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or any
other place where His Forces reſide; and to ſtop and ſeize the Cloth, Kerſies, and other
Weſtern Commodities (which his Majeſty can daily do from <hi>Reading</hi>) would be as
great diſturbance to the Trade of <hi>London,</hi> as the ſeizing of any Commodities (which
may be done by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from <hi>Windſor</hi> or <hi>Wickham</hi>) can be to the Trade of
<hi>Oxford.</hi> And therefore His Majeſty hath great reaſon to preſs, that mutual and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Freedom to all His good Subjects may be granted: Otherwiſe, He muſt either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that Licence to His Army, to ſeize the goods of His People in their paſſage to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and to interrupt and break the Trade and Correſpondence of the Kingdom (which
both out of publick conſideration and private compaſſion His Majeſty is moſt averſe
from) or elſe muſt grant that evident Benefit and Advantage to thoſe who deny the
ſame to Him, and to His People for His ſake. And it cannot be denyed but this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is ſo very beneficial to His Subjects, and ſo wholly conſiderable to His Majeſty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Notion, that their very ſubſiſtence depends upon it, and by this means Trade
may be continued; which, if a little more ſuppreſſed by theſe Diſtractions, will not
be eaſily recovered, even by a ſettled Peace. His Majeſty believes that ſome Carriers
have been robbed by His Majeſty's Souldiers: But 'tis as true, that no Complaint hath
been made to Him of that kind, which He hath not received to the relief and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Petitioners. And 'tis therefore His deſire, that both Houſes would joyn with
Him (at leaſt during the Ceſſation) that there might be no more ſuch Violences and
interruptions offered to His good Subjects by either ſide.</p>
                     <p>For the embarquing the Merchants Goods in Forein parts, His Majeſty denys that
any endeavour hath yet been made by His Miniſters of State to that purpoſe: But 'tis
true, His Majeſty hath declared His Reſolution, which He ſhall purſue, that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who abſolve themſelves from their Obedience to Him, and aſſiſt or conſent to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Diſloyalty to Him here, ſhall be deprived of thoſe advantages, and muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that Protection from Him abroad which is due, and which He always hath and
will allow to His good Subjects. And this is not to make other Princes Arbiters of the
Differences betwixt His Majeſty and His People; but to uſe the mutual Amity and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with other Princes, for the maintenance and ſupport of that Dignity for
which it is made and entred into.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:60710:181"/>
II. His Majeſty did not demand the approving of the Commanders of Ships only
witli reference to His preſent Right, for then He would have demanded not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the Commanders, but the Ships themſelves; but this Demand was and is
a thing moſt neceſſary for His Majeſty: for the ſetting out the preſent Fleet is pretended
to be for the defence of His Majeſties Dominions, and which cannot conveniently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any alteration in Commanders, if the Ceſſation and Peace ſhould be fully and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed upon; and therefore 'tis moſt neceſſary for His Majeſty both to know the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and to approve of the Commanders, who will not be ſo fit to be altered when
once they are ſent out.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty cannot ſee how a Ceſſation at Sea between His Majeſty and His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhould leave the Kingdom naked to Forein Forces (a continuance of War may
well do it:) And His Majeſty is willing to concurr in the reſiſtance of all ſuch of
what kind ſoever, and expects that, during the Ceſſation, the conveying of all Forces
from one part to another by Sea for the aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> be reſtrained;
which both Houſes ſeem now to conſent to, which was not at all expreſſed in their
former Articles.</p>
                     <p>III. His Majeſty's opinion, how unfit it was to Treat in blood, ſufficiently appears,
this debate concerning a Ceſſation ariſing firſt from His Majeſty's motion (it being left out
in the Anſwer to His Meſſage for a Treaty.) In order to which He had and hath great
reaſon to deſire, that the Committee may have Liberty to debate and conclude any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and expreſſions in the Articles of the Ceſſation, that the ſame may be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and removed, without remitting all queſtions to <hi>London.</hi> For as thoſe now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to might in much leſs time have been agreed here if there had been that liberty;
ſo there can hardly be a right and clear underſtanding of intentions without expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of words, and knowing the meaning from each other: as in the Conſent which
His Majeſty now underſtands to be given by both Houſes, that no Forces ſhall during
the Ceſſation be ſent by Sea for the relief of any place now held by them, the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is not ſo clear, but referreth to Articles, in which if it was not compriſed before (as
His Majeſty doth not conceive it was) no alteration is made by what now ſeems to be
conſented to, and the liberty which to all underſtandings may ſeem to be given, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
out of one Quarter to another within the Precincts propoſed, is not yet ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable;
the Committee having no power to anſwer what they underſtand in that
point, which is moſt neceſſary to be known, that the Peace be not broken during that
Ceſſation. And His Majeſty wonders that it ſhould be thought unſafe or unfit to give
ſuch a concluſive power of ſuch Differences and Doubts to the Committee here, when 'tis
notoriouſly known, that the very Liberty and Property of the Subject is committed not
only to other Committees of the Houſes without reporting to the Houſes, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are employed by them, unintereſted in and unacquainted with the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of either or both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>IV. It was no part of His Majeſty's intention, that His Article againſt Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Subjects, otherwiſe than according to the known Laws of the Land, ſhould
extend to the deſtruction of the Military Diſcipline of either Army: But this is a very
ſufficient inſtance of the neceſſity of enabling ſome perſons to conclude upon theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
without which (through inanimadvertence or doubtfulneſs in the expreſſions) they
who are neareſt of a mind will hardly ever come to conclude, if every Punctilio muſt
be forced to be ſent forwards and backwards a hundred miles: and (if this authority had
been given to the Committee here, as for ſuch cauſes was deſired) a limitation of half a
dozen words (which would have been as ſoon agreed to as propoſed) would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
moſt of this fourth Reaſon. And he that deſires any thing neceſſary to the ſpeed
of this Ceſſation, gives a good argument of deſiring the Ceſſation it ſelf; and whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is averſe to the one, can hardly be thought inclinable to the other.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch of His Subjects as are not concerned in the diſcipline of the Army, are not
concerned in this Objection; and His Majeſty hath reaſon to inſiſt, that the ſame liberty
may be reſtored to them in which they were born, and the care and defence of which is
ſo much and ſo meerly pretended by thoſe who deny it to them.</p>
                     <p>V. Though it grieves His Majeſty to the Soul to ſee the preſent miſerable condition
of His Subjects, groaning under ſo many viſible Preſſures becauſe of an inviſible Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and plundered and impriſoned to maintain ſuch a defenſive War, as was begun
to be raiſed againſt Him before His Majeſty had granted one Commiſſion to raiſe a man;
yet He cannot but be pleaſed with the ingenuity of this confeſſion, that the implicite faith
of His ſeduced Subjects begins to wear out ſo faſt, that the authority of Declaring
new, unknown Fundamental Laws, doth not now ſo work with them, to believe that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60710:182"/>
theſe Taxes are laid according to the Laws of God and Man, nor the many pretences
of imminent Dangers and inevitable ruine of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, ſo
perſwade them to believe this Cauſe to be the Cauſe of the Kingdom, but that if their
Cauſe, Authority and Eloquence were not aſſiſted by force and Rapine, their Army
muſt needs be diſſolved for want of being thought fit, much leſs neceſſary, to be pay'd
by thoſe who have equal right to judge of the Neceſſity and Danger, and for whoſe
ſakes, intereſts and concernments only it was pretended to be raiſed, and who are
defended by it againſt their wills. Nor is it ſtrange that His Majeſty cannot receive
theſe Charges upon Him, as a reaſon to make Him contented and acquieſce with theſe
Injuries to His Subjects; or that they who ſaw His Majeſties condition the laſt year
(till continued Violence againſt Him opened the eyes and hearts of His Subjects; to His
aſſiſtance) ſhould not believe that He began that War which they ſaw Him ſo unlikely
to reſiſt; or that they, who could never find nor hear from them who uſe not too modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conceal what is for their advantage, that from the beginning of the world to this
preſent Parliament ever one man was raiſed before by Commiſſion from both Houſes,
ſhould not believe the raiſing of that their Army to be ſo warranted as is pretended, and
any more approve of their Law than of their Neceſſity; or that they who know that
His Majeſty (in whom the power of making War and Peace was never denyed to be, till
theſe new Doctrines, which make it unlawful for Him to do any thing, and lawful
to do any thing againſt Him, were of late diſcovered) though he can legally raiſe
an Army, is not allowed to be legally able to raiſe money to maintain it, will not
allow of the Argument, from the power of Raiſing to the power of Taxing, and are as
little ſatisfied with their Logick as with their Law, and extreamly troubled to pay an
Army they do not deſire, for a Neceſſity they cannot ſee, by a Law they never heard of;
and that other men, without their conſent, muſt be jealous, fearful and quickſighted
at their Charges: and they have great reaſon to be apt to ſuſpect that thoſe made moſt
haſte to make a War, and have leaſt deſire of making Peace, who in time of War
pretend their legal power to be ſo vaſtly inlarged. His Majeſty therefore hath great
reaſon to inſiſt, that no Violence or Plundering be offered to His Subjects for not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the illegal Taxes of one or both Houſes, which in it ſelf is equal; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
being willing to be obliged from the like courſe, and relying wholly upon the
known Juſtice of His Cauſe, and the Affection of His People, and in which (if the
Kingdom be of their mind, and believe the Cauſe of the contrary Army to be really
their own) the advantage will be wholly theirs, and this Judgment will be beſt given
when the People is left to their liberty in this deciſion.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty's real deſire of disbanding the Armies may fully appear by His often
ſeeking, and earneſt endeavours to continue and conclude this Treaty in order to that
disbanding.</p>
                     <p>VI. His Majeſty leaves their Preamble to all the world to conſider and to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any man by their ſaying they were ready to agree to His Majeſty's Articles in the
manner as was expreſt, would not have expected to have found after that expreſſion,
that they had agreed at leaſt to ſome one thing material in them, and had not only
meant by agreeing as was expreſt, to expreſs they would not agree at all.</p>
                     <p>For the Clauſe of Communication of Quarters ſo quietly left out, His Majeſty looks
upon it as of moſt infinite importance, the leaving out of that having diſcompoſed the
whole, many things having in the reſt been aſſented to, which were therefore only
yielded, becauſe the Inconveniences growing by theſe Clauſes, if they were alone,
were ſalved by that Addition; and ſome things, in the other very dark and doubtful,
were by that interpreted and cleared. And His Majeſty is ſufficiently informed how
highly it concerns Him that every thing be ſo clear, that after no differences may ariſe
upon any diſputable point, ſince they whoſe Union, Induſtry, Subtilty and Malice
could perſwade any of His People that in the buſineſs of <hi>Brainceford</hi> He had broken a
Ceſſation before any was made or offered, would have a much eaſier work to lay the
breach of a made Ceſſation to His Majeſty's charge, if the ground of that Breach
would bear the leaſt diſpute.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty doth agree, that to preſerve things in the ſame ſtate on both ſides with as
little advantage or diſadvantage to either as the matter will poſſibly bear, is truly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Ceſſation, and is willing this Principle ſhould be made the Rule, and never
intended any thing that ſhould contradict it; but cannot ſee the inequality in this which
is pretended: For could Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> come by this
means to the King, and not the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> and Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex?</hi> Nor can His Majeſty find any ſtronger Paſſes or Forces to hinder His Armies
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60710:182"/>
from joyning with Him, than hinders theirs from joyning with them. If the Forces be
unequal, theirs will hardly hinder the paſſage of His, without a Ceſſation; if they be
equal, their coming in time of Ceſſation will be of equal uſe and advantage to their ſide,
ſomewhat in point of Supplies to come with them excepted; and ſome advantage to
one ſide will be, poize it how you will. But on the other ſide; if this clauſe be not in,
how much greater is the diſadvantage the other way by ſome Clauſes? and how are
His Forces (principally the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s) cooped up in old and eaten-up Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or neceſſitated to retire to ſuch as are more barren and more eaten? So that if this
were yielded to under the diſguiſe of a Ceſſation, He muſt admit that which will much
endanger the diſſolving of the Army and deſtruction of the Cauſe; which is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
as is againſt the nature of a Ceſſation formerly agreed and ſtated.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, His Majeſty, to ſhew His extraordinary and abundant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Peace, and to prevent the effuſion of blood, is contented, if both Houſes ſhall
refuſe to conſent to His Propoſitions, which are ſo much for the benefit and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the publick Trade and advantage of His good Subjects, to admit a Ceſſation
upon the matter of their own Articles (excepting that liberty be given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
to word it according to the real meaning and intention; and that the remove of
Quarters within their own bounds, which is intended, may be ſo expreſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that no miſtakes may ariſe) ſo that His Majeſty may not be underſtood
to conſent to any impoſing upon, levying, diſtraining, or impriſoning His good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to force them to contribute or aſſiſt againſt Him (which He ſhall always
continue to inhibit, requiring all men to reſiſt thoſe Illegal acts of Injuſtice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
againſt which He doth abſolutely proteſt;) and ſo that there may not be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
for any Rapine, Plundering, or ſeizing upon His Subjects by any of the Soldiers
of that Army, for not ſubmitting to ſuch Illegal Impoſitions as aforeſaid: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they may during this Ceſſation (beſides what is already impoſed) impoſe new
Taxes, not only to the Nineteenth part, but, if they pleaſe, (for their pleaſure is all their
bound) to the half of, or all their Eſtates, upon His good Subjects in His City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and all Counties within their reach; and their Army would then be at leiſure
to be employed as Collectors as well of the old Impoſitions, (which in moſt places
without their Army they cannot levy) as of any ſuch new one, and vaſt ſumms would
and might by this means be raiſed to the deſtruction of His Subjects, extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to them, and great diſadvantage to His Majeſty, who can neither obtain His
own Conſent to take the like courſes, nor in caſe He could, is He ſo quartered as to
have within the power of His Army, without breach of the Ceſſation by drawing
nearer to their Forces, any ſuch City, or ſo many, ſo rich and ſo freſh Counties, as
they have, to retire into to that purpoſe. So that as nothing is more juſt in it ſelf and
for His People than ſuch a limitation; ſo nothing can be more unequal to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
or more advantagious to them, than the admiſſion of or connivance to any ſuch
practices upon His People. This Ceſſation to begin on the 9. of <hi>April,</hi> and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to the end of 20. days from the 25. of <hi>March.</hi> And His Majeſty deſires that the
Treaty may proceed upon the Propoſitions in order, upon which His Majeſty hath an
earneſt deſire that a firm and ſtable Peace may be agreed on, and both Armies ſpeedily
disbanded: otherwiſe, if during this Ceſſation (in the Articles of which His Majeſty
in order to Peace hath yielded to things manifeſtly unreaſonable and prejudicial to His
Army) the Treaty be not diſpatched, His Majeſty cannot without manifeſt ruine to
His Army (principally that of the North) be able to contain Himſelf beyond this
time now limited for the Ceſſation in the Quarters in which He hath ſo long been, and
now is, and which will hardly be able to hold out ſo long, but muſt be forced to remove
as He ſhall find agreeable for His Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>And in caſe any delay be made in conſenting to theſe His Majeſty's limitations, or
that the Houſes ſhall reject this His offer of Ceſſation, His Majeſty, as He hath lately
deſired (by a Propoſition to both Houſes, delivered to their Committee, to which He
hath yet received no Anſwer) ſo He doth earneſtly continue to deſire, that the Treaty
it ſelf may not be delayed or interrupted by it, but that their Committee may be enabled
to proceed upon it in the mean while.</p>

which reflect much upon the Honour and Juſtice of the Houſes, and might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
particular Replies; yet at this time they deſire to decline all Conteſtation, their
wiſhes and endeavours being earneſtly bent upon the obtaining a ſpeedy Peace: For
which cauſe they do not think good to conſume any more of that time allowed for the
Treaty in any farther debates upon the Ceſſation; concerning which they find His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
expreſſions ſo doubtful, that it cannot be ſuddenly or eaſily reſolved; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the time for the whole Treaty being but ſeven days, if the Ceſſation were
preſently agreed, it would not yield any conſiderable advantage to the Kingdom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſhall deſire His Majeſty, that He will be pleaſed to give a ſpeedy and poſitive
Anſwer to their firſt Propoſition concerning the Disbanding, that ſo the People may not
have only a Shadow of Peace in a ſhort time of Ceſſation, but the Subſtance of it, in ſuch
manner as may be a perpetual Bleſſing to them, by freeing the Kingdom from thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
effects of War, the effuſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood, and Deſolation of many parts of the
Land.</p>
                        <p>For the obtaining of which Happineſs, the Lords and Commons have reſolved to
enlarge your Power, That if you ſhall not have fully agreed upon the two firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

treat upon them according to the Inſtructions formerly given you, although the Articles
of the Ceſſation are not agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>And thoſe two firſt Propoſitions being concluded, the two Houſes will thereupon give
you further Inſtructions to proceed to the other Propoſitions, that ſo the whole Treaty
may be determined within the twenty days formerly limited, to be reckoned from the 25

                        <p>IF the Committee, according to His Majeſty's deſire, had had but power to agree in
the wording of Expreſſions in the Articles of Ceſſation, His Majeſty's (which are as
clear as the matter would bear, and as He could make them) had not appeared ſo
doubtful to any, but that the Ceſſation might have been ſuddenly and ſpeedily reſolved,
and that long before this time. And if the expreſſions of both Houſes in their Reaſons
had not neceſſitated His Majeſty in His own defence to give ſuch Anſwers, as could not
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60710:183"/>
upon thoſe points deliver Truth without ſome ſhew of Sharpneſs, no Expreſſion of
that kind in His Majeſty's Anſwer had given any pretence for the rejection of, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo much as to treat upon this Ceſſation, which (though it were at preſent for no
long time) yet was from the day named by themſelves, the 25 of <hi>March;</hi> whereas
His Majeſty firſt moved for a Ceſſation and Treaty without any limitation at all in the
time of either, and His Majeſty was moſt ready to have enlarged the time, (ſo that in
the mean while the point of Quarters might be ſo ſettled as that His Armies might
ſubſiſt) and which might have been (if they had pleaſed) a very good and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
earneſt and fore-runner of that great bleſſing of Peace; for the obtaining of which
the wiſhes and endeavours of all good men being earneſtly bent, a farther debate in
order to ſo great a Benefit did not deſerve to be ſtyled a conſumption of time. And His
Majeſty cannot but conceive Himſelf to be in a ſtrange condition, if the doubtfulneſs
of Expreſſions (which muſt always be whilſt the Treaty is at ſuch a diſtance, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is denied to thoſe upon the place to help to clear and explain) or His neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to charges laid upon Him (that He might not ſeem to acknowledge what was
ſo charged) or the limitation of the time of ſeven days for the Treaty (which was not
limited by His Majeſty, who ever deſired to have avoided that and other limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have given great interruptions to it) ſhould be as well believed to be the
grounds, as they are made the arguments, of the rejection of that which (next to
Peace it ſelf) His Majeſty above all things moſt deſires to ſee agreed and ſettled, and
which His Majeſty hopes (if it may be yet agreed on) will give His People ſuch a taſte
of ſuch a Bleſſing, that after a ſhort time of conſideration, and comparing of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conditions in War and Peace, and what ſhould move them to ſuffer ſo much by a
Change, they will not think thoſe their friends that ſhall force them to it, or be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ready to contribute to the renewing of their former Miſeries, without ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
evidence of Neceſſity than can appear to them, when they ſhall have ſeen (as they
ſhall ſee, if this Treaty be ſuffered to proceed) that His Majeſty neither asks nor denies
any thing, but what not only according to Law He may, but what in Honour and
care of His People he is obliged to ask or deny. And this alone (which a very ſhort
Ceſſation would produce) His Majeſty eſteems a very conſiderable advantage to the
Kingdom; and therefore cannot but preſs again and again, that whatever is thought
doubtful in the expreſſions of the Articles, may (as in an hour it may well be done) be
expounded, and whatſoever is excepted at may be debated and concluded, and that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Inſtructions may be given to the Committee to that end; that the miſerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of War, the effuſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood, and deſolation of <hi>England</hi> (until they
can be totally taken away) may by this means be ſtayed and interrupted.</p>
                        <p>His Majeſty ſuppoſes, that when the Committee was laſt required to deſire His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to give a ſpeedy and poſitive Anſwer to the firſt propoſition concerning Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
His Anſwers in that point (to which no Reply hath been made, and which He
hopes by this time have given ſatisfaction) were not tranſmitted and received: but
wonders the Houſes ſhould preſs His Majeſty for a ſpeedy and poſitive Anſwer to the
firſt part of their firſt Propoſition concerning Disbanding, when to the ſecond part of
the very ſame Propoſition, concerning His Return to both Houſes of Parliament, they
had not given any Power or Inſtructions to the Committee ſo much as to treat with His
Majeſty; and when His Majeſty (if His deſire of Peace, and of ſpeeding the Treaty
in order to that, had not been prevalent with Him) might with all manner of Juſtice
have delayed to begin to treat upon one part, until they had been enabled to treat upon
the other: In which point, and for want of which power from them, the only ſtop
now remains; His Majeſty's Anſwers to both parts of their firſt Propoſition being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                        <p>To which until the Houſes ſhall be at leiſure to make Anſwer, that as little delay in

Magazines, Ships and Forts, in which He deſires nothing but that the juſt, known,
Legal Rights of His Majeſty (devolved to Him from His Progenitors) and of the

Him and unto them, unleſs any juſt and legal exceptions againſt any of the Perſons truſted

ſent them, and having been voted from them for adhering to His Majeſty in theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions;
His Majeſty not intending that this ſhould extend either to the Biſhops,
whoſe Votes have been taken away by Bill, or to ſuch in whoſe places upon new Writs
new Elections have been made:</p>

aſſemblies as, to the great breach of the Priviledges and the high diſhonour of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
have formerly aſſembled about both Houſes, and awed the Members of the

deſires of that Houſe to the Houſe of Commons to joyn in a Declaration againſt them,
the complying with which deſire might have prevented all theſe miſerable Diſtractions
which have enſued; which ſecurity His Majeſty conceives can be only ſettled by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing

choice of which His Majeſty leaves to both Houſes:</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will moſt chearfully and readily conſent that both Armies be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disbanded, and give a preſent meeting to both His Houſes of Parliament at the time
and place at and to which the Parliament ſhall be agreed to be adjourned.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being moſt confident that the Law will then recover the due credit and
eſtimation, and that upon a free debate in a full and peaceable convention of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch proviſions will be made againſt ſeditious Preaching and Printing againſt
His Majeſty and the eſtabliſhed Laws, which hath been one of the chief cauſes of the
preſent Diſtractions; and ſuch care will be taken concerning the legal and known
Rights of His Majeſty, and the Property and Liberty of His Subjects, that whatſoever
hath been publiſht or done in or by colour of any illegal Declaration, Ordinance or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of one or both Houſes, or any Committee of either of them, and particularly the
power to raiſe Arms without His Majeſty's Conſent, will be in ſuch manner recalled, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and provided againſt, that no ſeed will remain for the like to ſpring out of for the
future, to diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom, and to endanger the very Being of it.</p>
                     <p>And in ſuch a Convention His Majeſty is reſolved by His readineſs to conſent to
whatſoever ſhall be propoſed to Him by Bill for the real good of His Subjects, (and
particularly for the better diſcovery and ſpeedier conviction of Recuſants, for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in the Proteſtant Religion, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of practices of Papiſts againſt the State, and the due execution of the Laws,
and true levying of the Penalties againſt them) to make known to all the World how
cauſleſs thoſe Fears and Jealouſies have been which have been raiſed againſt Him, and
by that ſo diſtracted this miſerable Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And if this Offer of His Majeſty be not conſented to (in which He asks nothing
for which there is not apparent Juſtice on His ſide, and in which He defers many things
highly concerning both Himſelf and People, till a full and peaceable convention of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which in Juſtice He might now require) His Majeſty is confident that it
will then appear to all the World, not only who is moſt deſirous of Peace, and whoſe
default it is that both Armies are not now disbanded, but who hath been the true and
firſt cauſe that this Peace was ever interrupted, or theſe Armies raiſed; and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

neither of which is yet done. And He is very ſorry that both Houſes of Parliament

the Treaty beyond the twenty days, which (by Meſſages and attending the Inſtructions
of the Houſe) are ſo near ſpent, notwithſtanding all poſſible readineſs in His Majeſty,

been given to the perſons imployed to debate and conclude. Neither can His Majeſty
underſtand why an Alteration or Inlargement in the point of time cannot be admited

                        <p>We did, according to our Inſtructions, humbly deſire Your Majeſty that the Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,

be hoped for, except there be a cure for Fears and Jealouſies, for which an apparent
Remedy is, to disband all Forces, and the ſame to be ſo mutually done, as neither part to
have any Force remaining of which the other may be jealous or in fear. But if for other
cauſes not concerned in theſe unhappy Differences, Forces are to be retained, as in the
Cinque-ports, and in ſome Forts, Towns and Caſtles, for the Defence of the whole
Kingdom againſt forein Enemies, that then the ſame may remain in the hands of ſuch
perſons, with ſuch powers, as both parts might believe themſelves ſecure: for if the
ſame places were conſidered in relation only to theſe unnatural Deſtempers, and to

                        <p>AS His Majeſty was and is very deſirous to receive any Reaſon from both Houſes or
their Committee, which might induce His Majeſty to give other Anſwers, if
what He hath or ſhall give do not ſatisfie; ſo He rather expected thoſe Reaſons ſhould
have had their foundation in the Law of the Land, and have ſhewed Him that by Law
He had not the Right He pretended, or that by that, or by ſome fundamental Law,
they had a Right ſuperiour to His in what was now in queſtion, or have ſhewed Him
ſome Legal Reaſon why the Perſons truſted by Him were incapable of that truſt, than
only have inſiſted upon Fears and Jealouſies, of which as He knows not the Ground,
ſo He is ignorant of the Cure. But this His Majeſty knows, that if readineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
retract and provide againſt for the future any thing of errour that hath hapned
againſt Law, and having actually paſſed more important Bills, and parted with more of
His known Rights for the ſatisfaction of His Subjects, than not only any one, but all His
Predeceſſors, would have been thought a ſufficient Remedy for Fears and Jealouſies, the
Kingdom might ſtill have injoyed a ſafe, firm and laſting Peace, and thoſe would not firſt
have been made a reaſon to ſeize upon His Rights, and then after have been made an
Argument to perſwade Him to part with them. And His Majeſty wonders the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
ſhould not ſee that this Argument might extend to the depriving Him of, or at
leaſt ſharing with Him in, all His juſt Regal Power (ſince Power as well as Forces may
be the object of Fears and Jealouſies, and there will be always a power left to hurt,
whileſt there is any left to protect and defend;) and that if thoſe Rights which He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from His Predeceſſors were really ſo formidable, that would have been more
feared before which is now feared ſo much, and His Forts and Caſtles would either
not have been attempted, or at leaſt have enabled Him to defend and keep them, and
have kept this from being a Queſtion now between them. Which ſince they could not
do, His Majeſty (if He had as much inclination, as He hath more right, to Fears and
Jealouſies) might have more reaſon to inſiſt upon ſome adition of Power, as a ſecurity
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60710:189"/>
to enable Him to keep His Forts when He hath them, than they to make any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to reſtore them to Him in the ſame condition they were before. But as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
contents Himſelf with, ſo, He takes God to witneſs, His greateſt deſire is always
to obſerve and maintain the Law of the Land, and expects the ſame from His Subjects,
and believes the mutual obſervance of that Rule, and neither of them to fear what the
Law fears not, to be on both parts a better Cure for that dangerous Diſeaſe of Fears
and Jealouſies, and a better means to eſtabliſh a happy and perpetual Peace, than for
His Majeſty to deveſt Himſelf of thoſe Truſts which the Law of the Land hath ſettled
in the Crown alone, to preſerve the Power and Dignity of the Prince, for the better
Protection of the Subject and of the Law, and to avoid thoſe dangerous Diſtractions
which the intereſt of any Sharers with Him would have infallibly produced.</p>

had been done, and the matter of fact being ſuch as it ſeems could not be repeated but

His Ships from Him contrary to Law, to be a Cenſure, they will either produce that
Law by which they took them, or free themſelves from ſo juſt and unconfutable a
Cenſure by a ſpeedy and unlimited Reſtauration. Upon which Demand His Majeſty's
care of His ancient and undoubted Rights doth oblige Him to inſiſt. And when His

which they find Your Majeſty's expreſſions ſo doubtful, that it cannot be ſuddenly or
eaſily reſolved, and the remainder of the time for the whole Treaty being but ſeven

                        <p>HIS Majeſty had great reaſon to expect, that as He anſwered to every part of the
firſt Propoſition of both Houſes, ſo the Committee ſhould likewiſe have had
power and Inſtructions to Treat with His Majeſty concerning both parts of the ſame:
nor had the Houſes any reaſon to ſuppoſe their courſe agreeable to His Majeſty's ſenſe,
for His Majeſty in declaring His conſent to the order of the Treaty, indeed mentioned
their firſt Propoſition by the ſtyle of the firſt Propoſition which concerned Disbanding,
but did not ſtyle it that part of the firſt Propoſition which concerned Disbanding, as,
if He had meant to have excluded any part of that Propoſition from being treated on,
He would and ought to have done. But though His Majeſty's Anſwers in the point
of Disbanding and Return to His Parliament were as particular and as ſatisfactory as
His Majeſty had cauſe to make, or could well give, till this latter part were conſented
to be treated upon; yet out of His great deſire of Peace, and of complying with both
Houſes,<note place="margin">In His Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>April</hi> 12. pag. 353.</note>
 His Majeſty hath made a full and particular Anſwer and Offer to both Houſes

the Committee, as that upon which they have yet no power to Treat, though His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

conceiving it in vain to diſcourſe, and impoſſible to Treat upon that with

 His Majeſty addreſt that Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

will appear to all indifferent Perſons to be agreeable to their Duty and Allegiance
(thoſe Tumults, which drove Him from thence, and what followed thoſe Tumults, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>SAturday and Sunday laſt I received two from Thee, of the 29 of <hi>December,</hi> 9 of
<hi>January,</hi> both which gave Me ſuch Contentment, as Thou mayeſt better judge
than I deſcribe: the which that Thou mayeſt the better do, know I was full three
weeks, wanting but one day, without hearing from Thee; beſides ſcurvy <hi>London</hi> news
of Thy ſtay and lameneſs, which though I did not believe, yet it vext Me ſo much the
more, that I could not prove them liars. So now I conjure Thee by the Affection Thou
beareſt Me, not only to judge, but likewiſe participate with Me in the Contentment
Thou haſt given Me by aſſuring Me of Thy health and ſpeedy return. Concerning
45. 31. 7. 4. 132. 300. I will anſwer Thee in Thy own words, <hi>Je le remetteray a
vous reſpondre per bouche,</hi> being confident that way to give Thee contentment: In the
mean time aſſure Thy ſelf, that I neither have, nor will loſe any time in that buſineſs,
and that I have not contented My Self with Generals. And though I hope ſhortly to
have the happineſs of Thy company, yet I muſt tell thee of ſome particulars, in
which I deſire both Thy opinion and aſſiſtance. I am perſecuted concerning Places,
and all deſire to be put upon Thee, for the which I cannot blame them; and yet
Thou knoweſt I have no reaſon to do it. <hi>Newark</hi> deſireth <hi>Savil</hi>'s place, upon condition
to leave it when his Father dieth; <hi>Carenworth</hi> the ſame, being contented to pay for it, or
give the profit to whom or how I pleaſe: <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Dunſmore</hi> for to be Captain of the
Pentioners; <hi>Hartford</hi> once looked after it, but now I believe he expects either to be
Treaſurer, or of My Bed-chamber; I incline rather to the latter, if Thou like it, for I
abſolutely hold <hi>Cottington</hi> the fitteſt man for the other. There is one that doth not yet
pretend, that doth deſerve as well as any, I mean <hi>Capel;</hi> therefore I deſire Thy aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to find ſomewhat for him before he ask. One place I muſt fill before I can have
Thy opinion; it is the Maſter of the Wards. I have thought upon <hi>Nicholas,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that Thou wilt not miſlike My choice: and if he cannot perform both, <hi>Ned Hyde</hi>
muſt be Secretary, for indeed I can truſt no other. Now I have no more time to ſpeak
of more, but to deſire Thee not to engage Thy Self for any. So I reſt,</p>

A Declaration of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament upon the Proceedings
in the late Treaty, and the aforeſaid Letters.</head>
                     <p>THE Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, being deeply afflicted with a
ſorrowful ſenſe of the miſerable Diſtractions of this Kingdom, overwhelmed
with the Calamities of the worſt kind of War, have by ſeveral Petitions and many hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Addreſſes to His Majeſty beſought Him, by removing the Cauſes thereof, to put an
end thereunto: And although all their endeavours have not only proved fruitleſs, but
ſome of their Petitions received a denial even of Audience, (a favour not denied to the
Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi>) which might very well juſtify them before God and Man to decline
any further proſecution that way, eſpecially in a caſe where themſelves and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are the parties injured and oppreſſed; yet their bowels did ſo much yearn after a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Peace, that they reſolved, notwithſtanding their former diſcouragements, to break
through all difficulties, and yet once more moſt humbly to repreſent to His Majeſty
the Miſerable Diſtempers of His two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and if poſſibly
they could, to encline His Royal heart, really to act what He hath ſo often verbally
profeſſed, <hi>To compoſe thoſe unhappy Diſtractions, and reſtore His People to a bleſſed and
laſting Peace.</hi> And for that purpoſe, about the firſt of <hi>February</hi> laſt, they in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
preſented their Deſires to His Majeſty, digeſted into Fourteen Propoſitions: and
how reaſonable and indifferent thoſe Propoſitions were, they expoſe them to the view of
the World to judge, reſting aſſured, that no indifferent Man that ſhall duely weigh them,
with the time and circumſtance, will find any thing contained in them, but what was
neceſſary for the maintenance and advancement of <hi>the true Proteſtant Religion, the due
execution of Juſtice, the preſervation of the Liberty and Property of the Subject,</hi> and <hi>the
eſtabliſhment of the Kingdoms Peace and Safety.</hi> And becauſe they might with all ſpeed
take off the Burthen under which this Kingdom did principally groan, and ſtop the
ſpring from whence moſt of theſe Calamities did flow; they in the firſt place propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>That the Armies and Forces raiſed on both ſides might be disbanded,</hi> which being
effected, the Kingdom might with the more eaſe and ſecurity expect the iſſue of the
Treaty; and therefore they were very careful, that no Propoſition or Circumſtance
touching the Treaty ſhould precede this.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having received and conſidered theſe Propoſitions, He not long after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
His Anſwer, wherein He profeſſeth to have <hi>given up all the faculties of His Soul
to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and Reconciliation with His People,</hi> and deſires a ſpeedy
time and place might be agreed upon, for the meeting of ſuch perſons as His Majeſty
and both Houſes ſhould appoint to diſcuſs thoſe Propoſitions, and ſix other Propoſitions
made by His Majeſty, and ſent with that Anſwer; whereof one was, <hi>That to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the Treaty might not ſuffer interruption by any intervening accidents, that a Ceſſation of
Arms and free Trade might be firſt agreed upon:</hi> which Anſwer the Lords and Commons
did take into their conſideration. And becauſe His Majeſty did deſire that a Ceſſation
might be firſt agreed upon, they did accordingly ſubmit thereunto, though they
had purpoſely avoided it before; being unwilling to waſte the time about the Shadow,
that would of it ſelf vaniſh with the disbanding, which they deſired might be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>But they were willing to give all ſatisfaction to His Majeſty's Deſires, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to incline Him the more readily to conſent to their juſt Requeſts. And according to
their reſolution, they prepared ready the Articles of Ceſſation, and that with as much
equality and indifferency to both ſides as poſſibly they could. They likewiſe agreed to
treat upon the Propoſitions before the Disbanding; in which Treaty, ſo much of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Propoſitions as concerned His Majeſty's Revenue, Magazines, Forts and Ships,
and the Propoſitions of both Houſes for the Disbanding, ſhould be firſt treated of and
concluded, before the proceeding to treat upon any other: and that this Treaty ſhould
begin the fourth of <hi>March,</hi> or ſooner, if it might be; and that from the beginning of the
Treaty, the time might not exceed twenty days. They further reſolved, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of both Houſes ſhould be appointed to attend His Majeſty, if His Majeſty ſhould
ſo pleaſe, to endeavour to give Him all humble and fit ſatisfaction concerning the ſaid
Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>All which their reſolutions they forthwith by a Meſſenger diſpatched for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
preſented to His Majeſty, and not long after ſent a Committee to attend Him.
And though they hoped for a ready concurrence from His Majeſty to the Articles of Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
the Propoſition proceeding from Himſelf, yet they received a return much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60710:194"/>
to their expectation, where they found many ſcruples raiſed, and other Articles
propounded, which being aſſented unto by them, would inevitably deſtroy the Forces
raiſed by them for <hi>the Defence of themſelves, their Religion and Liberty,</hi> and ſtrengthen
the Malignant and Popiſh Army raiſed againſt them; which they made appear by their
humble Anſwer to thoſe Alterations and Articles, which are herewith at large publiſhed,
and therefore do refer themſelves thereunto. And in the interim, while His Majeſty
was conſidering of this their humble Anſwer, they gave power to their Committee to
treat upon the two firſt Propoſitions for four days, which afterwards they enlarged to
the end of twenty days. And within ſome diſtance of time afterwards they received a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long Meſſage from His Majeſty, which (indeed) carried not with it the face or ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of a Treaty, but in plain down-right language, was <hi>a bitter Invective againſt the
two Houſes of Parliament and their Proceedings;</hi> ſo that by this time it might very well
appear, <hi>That the enemies of the Kingdoms Peace, ſo really proſecuted, and likely to be effected
by the earneſt endeavours of both Houſes, thought it high time to caſt in their tares of Sedition,
to prevent the growth of ſo bleſſed a fruit.</hi> In this Meſſage, after very heavy Taxes and
unjuſt Scandals and Accuſations laid to their charge, forced in quite beſides the queſtion,
His Majeſty condeſcended to the Ceſſation in manner as was agreed on by both Houſes,
to continue only for five days, expecting a liberty notwithſtanding to be given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<hi>to word it according to the real Intention,</hi> and ſo that His Majeſty might not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
to conſent to any Impoſing upon, Levying, Diſtraining, or Impriſoning of
His Subjects, to force them to Contribute, expreſly proteſting againſt it, and inhibiting
His Subjects, to ſubmit thereunto, and requiring them to reſiſt; and ſo that there might
not be a liberty for Seizing upon His Subjects by any Soldiers of the Army for not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to ſuch Impoſitions. Which offer of His Majeſty's, being but a Ceſſation only
for five days, and ſome part of that time to be firſt ſpent by the Committee in wording
of it, and limited with a Proteſtation againſt, and a Command to reſiſt that Power
whereby their Forces muſt be paid and ſupported, which if not anſwered and juſtified,
would by a conſent to His Majeſty's offer imply a declining of that power, which might
indanger the Disbanding of their Army; and if anſwered, would neceſſarily have enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to ſome ſharpneſs of language, which the enemies of this Treaty would eaſily
take occaſion to quarrel at, and perſwade His Majeſty to break off, which the Lords and
Commons, out of their hearty zeal to bring it to a happy concluſion, did purpoſely avoid:
therefore they did not only paſs by theſe Scandals and unjuſt Accuſations laid to their
charge by that Meſſage, but purpoſely declined to enter into any diſpute of their power,
for maintaining the Forces raiſed for their own neceſſary defence; and therefore thought
it beſt to ſpend the remainder of the time in Treating upon the Propoſitions, and for that
end enjoyned their Committee, as much as in them lay, to haſten it, eſpecially that
part touching the Disbanding, which being concluded, would not only produce a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Ceſſation, but an abſolute abolition of all acts of Hoſtility. The proceedings
and iſſue of which Treaty the Lords and Commons think it neceſſary to publiſh to the
Kingdom, to the end the ſincerity of their endeavours, to procure a happy ſettlement of
theſe miſerable Diſtractions, may appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When they perceived that the moſt part of the time preſcribed for the Treaty was
like to be ſpent about the Ceſſation, they gave power to their Committee in the mean
time to treat upon the Propoſitions in order as they had formerly Voted: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with His Majeſty's firſt Propoſition, whereby His Majeſty demanded,</hi> That his
own Revenue, Magazines, Towns, Forts and Ships, which had been taken or kept from Him
by force, ſhould be forthwith reſtored unto Him, <hi>the Lords and Commons by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
made Him this humble Anſwer; Firſt,</hi> That as to his Revenue, they had not made
uſe of it but in a ſmall proportion, and a good part of that was employed for the maintenance
of His own Children, according to the allowance eſtabliſhed by Himſelf; That what ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
due to His Majeſty they would ſatisfy, and would leave the ſame to His Majeſty for the
time to come. <hi>They likewiſe thereupon propounded to His Majeſty,</hi> That He would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
what had been taken for His uſe, upon any of the Bills aſſigned to other purpoſes, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acts of Parliament, as out of the proviſion made for the Wars of <hi>Ireland. Which offer
of theirs, after ſome debate thereupon with the Committee, was thought reaſonable, and
in effect concluded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And as to the Demand of the Towns, Forts and Ships, they in ſubſtance gave this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Anſwer;</hi> That they would deliver up ſuch as remained in their hands, into the hands of ſuch
perſons of worth, quality and truſt, to be nominated by His Majeſty, as the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould confide in, none of which perſons to be removed during three years next enſuing
without juſt cauſe to be approved of by both Houſes; That the Warden of the Cinque-Ports,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:60710:195"/>
and all Governours and Commanders of Towns, Forts and Caſtles, ſhould keep the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
for the Service of His Majeſty and the Safety of the Kingdom, and that they ſhould
not admit into them any Forein Forces, or any other Forces raiſed without His Majeſty's
Authority and Conſent of the two Houſes of Parliament; and they ſhould uſe their uttermoſt
endeavours to ſuppreſs all Forces raiſed without ſuch Authority and Conſent, and ſeize all
Arms and Ammunition provided for any ſuch Forces.<note place="margin">April 5.</note>
                        <hi>Unto which Offer of theirs His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
gave this concluſive Anſwer;</hi> That His Majeſty did not intend that both Houſes of
Parliament ſhould expreſs their Confidence of the perſons to whoſe truſt the Cinque-Ports, or
other His Majeſty's Towns and Forts, were or ſhould be committed, but that they ſhould have
liberty to proceed againſt them according to Law; <hi>His Majeſty claiming the nomination
and free election to belong to Him of right. And to the Clauſe concerning the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Forces into thoſe Forts, Caſtles and Towns, His Majeſty would conſent no
further than theſe general terms; that is,</hi> That no Forces raiſed or brought in contrary to
Law ſhould be admitted, and that all Arms and Ammunition ſhould be ſeized upon which by
the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom they ought to ſeize.</p>
                     <p>They made the like Anſwer concerning the Ships, <hi>That they ſhould be delivered into the
hands of ſuch a Noble Perſon as His Majeſty ſhould nominate to be Lord High-Admiral of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>and the two Houſes of Parliament confide in.</hi> To which Offer his Majeſty refuſed
His Conſent, declaring His Reſolution to inſiſt upon what by Law, was His own (as
His Majeſty was pleaſed to expreſs it,) and taken from Him, ſhould be reſtored unto Him
without any conditioning, or new limitations to be put upon Him or His Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>And now the Lords and Commons will refer it to the World to judge, whether
their Demands were not ſuch, and ſo moderate, as was fit and neceſſary for them to
make, and juſt and reaſonable for His Majeſty to aſſent unto: wherein they may be
pleaſed to conſider, that this was a Treaty for the disbanding of two Armies, and Forces
raiſed in oppoſition each to other; that the Towns, Forts and Ships, are a great part of
theſe Forces, and of the ſtrength of that ſide that poſſeſſeth them; that for any one ſide
to demand the poſſeſſion and power thereof, and the other ſide to disband their Forces,
and quit themſelves of all their ſtrength, is in effect a total disbanding of that ſide, and
a continuing the Forces of the other, which muſt be granted to be moſt unequal; and
therefore the Lords and Commons did think it juſt and honourable, that the remaining
ſtrength ſhould be put into ſuch hands as both ſides might truſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That their demand to have the Forts and Caſtles into the hands of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as both Houſes ſhould confide in, was a Propoſition warranted by the frequent<note n="*" place="margin">

 Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
of former times, whereby it appeareth that many other Parliaments have made
the like and greater demands, and His Majeſty's Predeceſſors have aſſented thereunto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:60710:195"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly, It was a Propoſition which His Majeſty Himſelf in ſeveral Declarations of
His own affirmed to be reaſonable and juſt; for in His Majeſty's Anſwer to a Petition of
the Houſe of Commons,</hi> January 28. 1641. <hi>He expreſſeth thus,</hi> For the Forts and Caſtles
of the Kingdom, His Majeſty is reſolved, they ſhall be in ſuch hands, and only in ſuch, as
the Parliament way ſafely confide in, <hi>&amp;c. And in another Anſwer to two Petitions of
the Lords and Commons, delivered the ſecond of</hi> February 1641. <hi>His Majeſty uſeth
theſe words,</hi> That (for the ſecuring you from all Dangers, or Jealouſies of any) His
Majeſty will be content to put in all the places both of Forts and <hi>Militia,</hi> in the ſeveral Counties,
ſuch perſons as both Houſes of Parliament ſhall either approve or recommend unto Him; ſo
that you declare before unto His Majeſty the names of the perſons whom you approve or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend:
unleſs ſuch perſons ſhall be named, againſt whom He ſhall have juſt and unqueſtionable
exception. Which being declared by His Majeſty Himſelf, they had no cauſe to ſuſpect
a Denial, being confident that His Majeſty did intend what He ſpoke; and if any ill
Counſel could prevail to make Him recede from His Word, it muſt be admitted, the
Kingdom hath more cauſe to be further ſecured.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, For that to our ſad experience it is well known, that His Majeſty's Power
in this and other things is too much ſteered and guided by the advice of theſe ſecret
and wicked Counſellors that have been the Inſtruments of our preſent Miſeries; and
though His Majeſty carrieth the Name, yet they will have the diſpoſing of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And the Lords and Commons thought it the more reaſonable and neceſſary to
inſiſt thereupon, becauſe that in the time when they were preparing their Propoſitions
to His Majeſty, it did appear unto them by a Letter written by His Majeſty to the
Queen, (which they have cauſed to be herewith Printed) that the great and eminent
places of the Kingdom were diſpoſed by Her Advice and Power; and what Her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is, and conſequently how prevalent the Counſels of Papiſts and Jeſuites will be
with Her, may be eaſily conjectured: and it is to be obſerved who the Perſons deſigned
for preferment were, even during the ſitting of a Parliament; the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
in Parliament for High Treaſon, and moſt, if not all the reſt, impeached in
Parliament, and ſuch as bear Arms againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, admitting that theſe demands touching the Ships and Forts had been made
even in a time of Peace and Tranquillity: yet conſidering the attempts of Force and
Violence made and practiſed againſt the Kingdom and this preſent Parliament, as
the Deſigns many years ſince to bring to this Kingdom the <hi>German</hi> Horſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the Subject to ſubmit to an arbitrary Government; the endeavour to bring up the
late Northern Army, by force and violence to awe the Parliament; His Majeſty's
coming in perſon to the Houſe of Commons, accompanied with many Armed Men,
to demand their Members to be delivered up; and the Treaſon of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
to bring over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Army to conquer the Kingdom; they might very well
juſtify, nay they were in duty bound (in diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them by the
Commonwealth) to make that demand, and expect the performance thereof, to the
end the People might be ſecured from any ſuch Violence hereafter. Yet (to their
inexpreſſible ſorrow they muſt ſpeak it) neither the Reaſonableneſs, the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Juſtneſs of the Requeſt, nor the Peace of the Kingdom (which probably
would enſue thereupon) could be Arguments prevalent enough to induce His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Conſent thereunto. And His Majeſty's offer of thoſe Commanders that ſhall
offend, to leave them to Juſtice and Trial of the Law, is an Anſwer more to ſhew His
Power to protect Delinquents, than ſatisfaction, to a Parliament, being the due and
right of the meaneſt Subject, and yet intituled here as a Favour done to both Houſes of
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And though His Majeſty is pleaſed to juſtifie His Denial with the Allegation, <hi>That
it is His Right by Law;</hi> they muſt appeal to the judgment of all indifferent Men,
whether that be a ſatisfactory ground of refuſal: for admitting His Majeſty's Power
of diſpoſing the Ships, Forts and Caſtles, and committing them into what hands He
pleaſe, to be by Law abſolutely veſted in His Majeſty (which they by no means can
admit, He being only truſted with them for <hi>the Defence and ſafety of the Kingdom</hi>)
as He Himſelf is pleaſed to aſſume; yet would that be no ground or reaſon for the
King to refuſe His Conſent to alter that Law, when by circumſtance of time and
affairs that Power becomes deſtructive to the Commonwealth and ſafety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the preſervation whereof is the chief end of the Law. And though the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Parliament, being the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom, are the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges thereof; yet in this Cafe they do not proceed only upon an implicite Faith,
but demonſtrate it both by Reaſon and Experience, <hi>That their Demand is not only neceſſary
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60710:196"/>
to ſecure the Kingdom from Fear and Jealouſie, but to preſerve it even from Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſurely had this Argument, of being <hi>Their Right by Law,</hi> been prevailing with
His Majeſty's Predeceſſors, this Nation ſhould have wanted many an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which now they have, that was neceſſary for thier being and ſubſiſtence. And
they could heartily wiſh that the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom might be <hi>The
Rule of what is, and what is not to be done;</hi> acknowledging with His Majeſty, that
the ſame is the only Rule between Him and His People, the aſſurance of the free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
whereof is their only aim: but how little fruit the People hath gathered
from this tree, let the woful experience of theſe laſt eighteen years judge, where, in a
time of Peace and Plenty, the power of iſſuing out Commiſſions to compel Loans,
a power in the King at His pleaſure to impoſe a Charge upon the People to provide
Ships, without limitation of time or proportion, a power in the Council-Board to
commit Men and determine buſineſs, without diſtinction of perſons or cauſes, the
power of laying Impoſitions both upon Forein and Domeſtick Commodities, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Acts of Oppreſſions, was, under the name and colour of a <hi>Legal Right</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
practiſed and put in execution; againſt which the Subject had no help of relief,
but was neceſſitated to ſubmit and lie under the burthen. And when at any time a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was called (being the only cure and remedy for theſe griefs) it could no ſooner
touch upon theſe ſores, but it was daſhed in pieces by a ſudden Diſſolution. And now
that a remedy is provided for that miſchief by the Act for continnance of this Parliament,
it is attempted by the force and power of an Army to effect that which formerly could
have been done with more eaſe and readineſs.</p>
                     <p>And now they refer it to the cenſure of any honeſt Man, whether they have
not the warrant of Reaſon and Neceſſity, to demand ſome ſecurity to enjoy that
which His Majeſty confeſſeth to be the Peoples right: and in reference to that,
whether their Demand of having the Forts, Caſtles and Shipping to be put into ſuch
hands as both Houſes ſhall have cauſe to confide in, was not both moderate and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                     <p>And touching their Demand, and His Majeſty's Anſwer to the Clauſe concerning
the admiſſion of Forces into thoſe Forts, Caſtles and Towns, they muſt ſtill ſubmit it
to all indifferent judgments, how much Reaſon and Juſtice was comprehended in
their Demand, and how little ſatisfaction they received therein. His Majeſty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>That no Forces raiſed or brought in contrary to Law ſhould be admitted;</hi> which
they could heartily wiſh heretofore had, or hereafter would be really performed:
but they deſire it may be conſidered, what ſecurity this will be to the Kingdom, to
prevent the raiſing or bringing in of Forces contrary to law; who ſhall be Judges
of the Law, when thoſe Forces are once raiſed and once brought in? Surely His
Majeſty will not acknowledge the two Houſes of Parliament to be; for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by ſeveral Declarations hath expreſly denied them any ſuch Power: For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Declarations, fortified with Law and Reaſon, His Majeſty publiſhed
and affirmed the Legality of the Commiſſion of Array, and put the ſame in execution
in moſt parts of the Kingdom; hath authorized the Papiſts of the Kingdom to take
Arms to oppoſe the Parliament and their Proceedings, and to rob, ſpoil, and deprive
the Proteſtants of this Kingdom of their Eſtates and lives; hath by divers Proclamations
and Declarations publiſhed the raiſing of Forces, and taking up of Arms by the two
Houſes of Parliament, and ſuch as therein obey their Commands, for their own defence,
and the defence of their Religion and Liberty aſſaulted by an Army of Papiſts and their
adherents, to be Rebellion and Treaſon, and the taking up of Arms by the Papiſts and
their adherents, to be acts of Duty and Loyalty; and all this urged and pretended to be
warranted by the Law of the Land. And they do not doubt but by the ſame Law,
perſons legally impeached and accuſed in Parliament of high Treaſon, as the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Percy,</hi> Maſter <hi>Jermyn,</hi> Maſter <hi>Oneale,</hi> and others, are by the power of an
Army protected from the Juſtice of the Parliament: and yet all this while the People
have not only His Majeſty's Promiſe, but His Oath, to govern and protect them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of the Land. And now they appeal to the World, whether ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Anſwer, <hi>That no Forces raiſed or brought in contrary to Law,</hi> without admitting
them ſo much as to declare their confidence in the perſons that are to be entruſted with
the Power, be juſt or reaſonable: What is it otherwiſe in effect, than to make thoſe
perſons that are the Inſtruments to violate the Law, Judges of that Law? which, to
our ſad experience, is the woful and miſerable preſent condition of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:60710:196"/>
And though, by what had hitherto paſſed, they had little cauſe to ſuſpect ſuch a
happy iſſue to the Treaty as they heartily wiſhed and moſt earneſtly laboured for, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
not the leaſt inclination of compliance to their juſt Demands, but all, or moſt
of them, anſwered with a Denial, and that not without ſome ſharpneſs and acrimony;
yet reſolving to be wanting in nothing of their parts, they enjoyned their Committee
to preſs on the Propoſition for Disbanding, and humbly deſire His Majeſty's poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Anſwer thereunto, which (if aſſented unto by His Majeſty) would, though
not wholly take away the cauſe, and perfectly cure the Diſtractions of this Kingdom,
yet at leaſt take off the ſmart and pain under which both Church and State do moſt
miſerably languiſh, and ſo better enable them to endure the expectation of a through
Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Committee applied themſelves to His Majeſty accordingly: and after ſome
endeavour to protract the debate of this Propoſition, and deſire that it might be deferred
to the concluſion of the Treaty, and that the time of the Treaty might be enlarged,
His Majeſty being earneſtly importuned to a poſitive and ſpeedy Anſwer, to the end
the Kingdom might know what they might truſt to, His Majeſty was pleaſed to
return this Anſwer, That as ſoon as His Majeſty were ſatisfied in His firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
concerning His own Revenue, Magazines, Ships and Forts; ſecondly, as ſoon
as all the Members of both Houſes ſhall be reſtored to the ſame capacity of ſitting
and voting in Parliament as they had upon the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1641. not intending
to extend it to the Biſhops Votes, or to ſuch in whoſe places upon new Writs new
Elections have been made; thirdly, as ſoon as His Majeſty and both Houſes might be
ſecured from ſuch tumultuous aſſemblies as formerly aſſembled about both Houſes,
which ſecurity His Majeſty explains can be only ſettled by adjourning the Parliament
to ſome place twenty miles from <hi>London;</hi> His Majeſty would conſent that both the
Armies ſhould be disbanded, and come to the Parliament. Which in terms plain
enough is as much as to ſay, That until both Houſes ſhall conſent to thoſe Demands,
He will not Disband His Army, He will continue the War. And what Reaſon or
Juſtice is either in the matter or manner of thoſe demands, or what hope or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the People can have to ſee an end of their preſent Calamities, they leave it to
themſelves to judge. His Majeſty in the beginning of the Treaty, in His Anſwer to
the Propoſitions of both Houſes, was pleaſed to expreſs how unparliamentary it was
by Arms to require new Laws: but how to apply that to the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they muſt confeſs they are to ſeek; they never having demanded any new Laws
by Arms, endeavouring only (what in them lieth) to preſerve and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
their Religion and Laws, from the violence of an Army firſt raiſed againſt
them; which being laid down and disbanded, they offer to Disband theirs, without
any other condition. But they are well aſſured, that by this His Majeſty's Anſwer here is
not only a requiring of new Laws, but a repealing of the old, by Arms: for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
muſt have this Parliament adjourned to another place, which by a Statute made
this preſent Parliament cannot be done without the conſent of both Houſes. He muſt
have the Members diſabled to ſit there by the reſpective judgment of both Houſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to their former capacity of ſitting and voting, or He will not conſent to Disband.
And how deſtructive to the Liberties of the Parliament and dangerous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
theſe Conditions required by His Majeſty to precede the Disbanding are, any man
that hath an eye to ſee may eaſily diſcern. As firſt, to ſatisfie His firſt Propoſition, in
yielding up the Magazines, Ships and Forts, into the hands of ſuch perſons as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhall appoint to receive the ſame, without any admiſſion to the two Houſes to
expreſs their confidence in thoſe perſons: which being performed, were to yield up the
principal part, if not all the ſtrength they have, and expoſe themſelves, Religion, and
the Kingdom, to the mercy of a powerful Popiſh Army raiſed againſt them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to them, and to the will and pleaſure of thoſe Counſellors whoſe intereſt with
His Majeſty hath brought this Kingdom to this deſolate condition, whether they
would Disband or not. Secondly, to ſatisfie Him in His Propoſition touching His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
wherein He demands a reſtitution of what hath been taken from Him; which
though it would prove no conſiderable Summ, yet the time that the examination
and agreement upon the account would neceſſarily take up, would prove ſuch as
might very well make the Kingdom ſink under the burthen of two Armies before it
came to a concluſion. And touching His Majeſty's requiring a reſtitution of the
Members to their ſitting and Votes, it is obſervable, that the Demand is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction of perſons or offences; ſo that be the perſons never ſo criminous,
or the offences never ſo notorious, and ſo the Judgment never ſo juſt, yet all muſt be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60710:197"/>
reſtored, or no conſent to Disbanding. And the reaſon and ground of the Demand is
as obſervable; becauſe they adhered to His Majeſty in theſe Diſtractions: An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they muſt confeſs, much uſed by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in defence of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who would have juſtified the moſt notorious Crimes laid to his charge by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Commands derived from His Majeſty, and his zeal to advance His Majeſty's
Service and Profit. And no doubt the ſame reaſon may be uſed for the Judges in caſe
of Ship-mony, and moſt of the Monopoliſts and Projectors, who by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
had not only His Majeſty's Command and Authority for the doing what they
did, but brought in great Summs of Mony to His uſe and benefit, and that perhaps
in times of neceſſity and want thereof: and ſo conſequently, becauſe theſe adhered to
His Majeſty, (for what they did was for His Profit) with the like reaſon it may be
required that all Impeachments and Proceedings againſt them ſhould be repealed and
laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely nothing can be more deſtructive and dangerous both to Parliament
and Kingdom than the conſenting to that Demand: for what can be more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to both Houſes, than to reſtore thoſe perſons to have their former ſuffrage
and Votes in Parliament over the Lives and Liberties of the People and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament, who have not only deſerted the Parliament, diſobeyed and
contemned their Authority, neglected the Truſt repoſed in them by thoſe that
ſent them thither, in whoſe behalf they were to attend and ſerve there, but by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
practices and open hoſtility have endeavoured to deſtroy both Parliament and
People?</p>
                     <p>And it would be an Objection of difficulty to anſwer, whether in giving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to this Demand, the People, who are to chuſe theſe Members, ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their intereſt and freedom of choice and election now devolved unto them,
by putting out the Members already ſent. And to this they might add the danger of
the Precedent, and the reflection of diſhonour that would fall upon both Houſes, ſhould
they conſent to this, which would be with the ſame breath, as it were, to give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
their Judgment, and pronounce ſentence of injuſtice and raſhneſs againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But they will not inſiſt thereupon in a caſe otherwiſe ſo full of danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to the publick.</p>
                     <p>And touching the Propoſition of Adjourning the Parliament twenty miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from <hi>London,</hi> they ſhall not need in a caſe ſo apparent to ſpend many words
to diſcover the inconvenience and unreaſonableneſs thereof: for, ſhould they aſſent unto
it, to paſs over the inconveniences that would happen to ſuch perſons that ſhould have
occaſion to attend the Parliament, by removing it ſo far from the reſidency of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Courts of Juſtice, and the places where the Records of the Kingdom remain
(whereof there is frequent uſe to be made) it would not only give a tacite conſent to
thoſe Scandals ſo often preſſed and affirmed in ſeveral Declarations, that is, That His
Majeſty was forced for the Safety of His own Perſon heretofore to withdraw, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
to abſent Himſelf from the Parliament, which both Houſes can by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
but muſt ſtill deny; but likewiſe to that high and dangerous Aſperſion of awing
the Members of this Parliament, raiſed without doubt purpoſely to invalid the Acts
and proceedings thereof; and by that engine, in caſe the Popiſh Army ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt the Parliament, (which they truſt God in his goodneſs will never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
to overturn and nullifie all the good Laws and Statutes made this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>And it would give too much countenance to thoſe unjuſt Aſperſions laid to
the charge of the City of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe unexampled zeal and fidelity to the true
Proteſtant Religion and the Liberty of this Kingdom is never to be forgotten, <hi>That
His Majeſty and the Members of both Houſes cannot with ſafety to their perſons reſide there;</hi>
whenas they are well aſſured, that the Loyalty of that City to His Majeſty and their
Affections to the Parliament is ſuch, as doth equal, if not exceed, any other place or
City in the Kingdom. And with what ſafety the two Houſes can ſit in any other
place, when even in the place they now reſide the Houſe of Commons was in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
danger of Violence, when His Majeſty accompanied with ſome hundreds of armed
Men came thither to demand their Members, let the World judge.</p>
                     <p>And now the Lords and Commons muſt appeal to the judgment of all impartial
men, whether they have not uſed their utmoſt and moſt faithful endeavours to put an
end to the Diſtractions of this Kingdom, and to reſtore it to a bleſſed and laſting
Peace; and whether their Propoſitions (being the way thereunto) were not ſuch as
were reaſonable and neceſſary for them to make, and juſt and honourable for His
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60710:197"/>
Majeſty to grant; and whether His Majeſty's Anſwers to theſe Propoſitions are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
or correſpondent to His Expreſſion, to have <hi>given up all the faculties of His Soul
to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and Reconciliation with His People.</hi> But they muſt
confeſs, that they had juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that this would be the happy iſſue of the
Treaty; for the prevalency of the enemies thereof, who like that evil Spirit, do moſt
rage when they think they muſt be caſt out, was ſuch, that they would not proceed
therein one ſtep, without ſome attempt or provocation laid in the way to interrupt and
break it off: for after they had reſolved to preſent their humble Deſires and Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to His Majeſty, their Committee muſt not without a ſpecial ſafe Conduct and
Protection from Him have acceſs to Him, (a liberty incident to them not only as they
are Members of the Parliament, and employed by both Houſes, but as they were free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Subjects;) and yet when they paſſed over this, His Majeſty refuſed a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> being one of the Committee appointed by
both Houſes to be employed upon that occaſion, ſuch a breach of Priviledge that they
believe is not to be parallel'd by the example of former times; and yet their deſire
was ſuch to obtain the end they drive at, (that is, a happy and laſting Peace)
that they reſolved not to interrupt the Treaty for that time by inſiſting upon it. And
then they had no ſooner entred upon the Treaty, but a Proclamation dated at
<hi>Oxon</hi> the 16 of <hi>February</hi> 1642. entituled <hi>His Majeſty's Proclamation, forbidding all
His loving Subjects,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Kent, Surrey, Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> to
raiſe any Forces, &amp;c. and another Proclamation dated the 8 of <hi>February,</hi> forbidding
the aſſeſſing and payment of all Taxes by vertue of an Ordinance of both Houſes,
and all entring into Aſſociations, were publiſhed in His Majeſty's Name, containing
moſt bitter invectives and ſcandals againſt the proceedings of both Houſes, by
ſtyling them and ſuch as obeyed them Traitors and Rebels, charging them
under the name of <hi>Browniſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> to endeavour to take away
the Kings Life, and to deſtroy His Poſterity, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws
of the Kingdoms, with many other ſuch ſcandals and aſperſions; and even at this
time were many deſigns practiſing againſt the Parliament, which in all probability
were the grounds and reaſons of His Majeſty's confidence and denial of their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
Inſomuch that His Majeſty in a Letter ſent from Him to the Queen, and
read in the Houſe of Commons, did declare, That He had ſo many fine deſigns laid
open to Him, that He knew not which firſt to undertake. One whereof probably
was the moſt bloody and barbarous deſign upon <hi>Briſtol</hi> attempted (though by God's
infinite mercy prevented) during the Treaty, And whether that of Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley's</hi>
in betraying of <hi>Scarborough</hi> Caſtle, wherewith he was entruſted by the Parliament, to
the Queens hands, and acted likewiſe during the Treaty, and that of <hi>Killingworth</hi>
Caſtle, which ſhould have been likewiſe betrayed, and a deſign diſcovered by a Letter
found in the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s pocket, ſlain near <hi>Stafford,</hi> written to Him from
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> were ſome of the other deſigns mentioned in His Majeſty's Letter, they
cannot certainly affirm, but conjecture. And when theſe collateral provocations and
attempts could not prevail to make them deſert the Treaty, then comes in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Meſſage of the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> which they have mentioned before, charging
them to abuſe the people with imaginary Dangers and pretended Fears, to uſe Force
and Rapines upon His good Subjects, with publiſhing new doctrines, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for the King to do any thing, and lawful to do any thing againſt Him; with
Malice and Subtilty to abuſe the People, that their Pleaſure is all their bounds; with
many other ſuch bitter expreſſions, that no Man could think ſuch an Anſwer could
be any part of a Treaty, or at leaſt to proceed from a heart that deſired a happy iſſue
thereunto. Notwithſtanding all which, the Lords and Commons were ſo reſolutely
fixed to proſecute that Treaty, and (if poſſibly they could) to bring it to a bleſſed
and happy concluſion, that they were content to lie under all theſe Scandals, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
all theſe wounds, ſo they might make up the breaches of the Commonwealth;
and therefore they did forbear the returning of an Anſwer to any of theſe provocations.
And then when the Malignant and Popiſh party (too-too prevalent with his Majeſty)
perceived their conſtancy, not to be provoked to break that Treaty of their part, they
found it neceſſary to ſeduce His Majeſty to refuſe His Conſent to their moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and juſt Deſires, and to propound ſuch things as could not with the peace
and ſafety of the Church and State be yielded to, and ſo effected their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="380" facs="tcp:60710:198"/>
All which the Lords and Commons thought it their duty to publiſh to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to the end that they may ſee that what hath been long endeavoured by ſubtile
and ſecret practices, is now reſolved to be effected by open Violence and Hoſtility,
that is, the deſtruction of our Laws and the Proteſtant Religion, and introducing of
Popery and Superſtition; and that there is little or no hope by any endeavour of a
Treaty to procure the Peace of this Church and Kingdom, unleſs both be expoſed to
the will and pleaſure of the Popiſh party, until the Army and Forces now raiſed and
continued by them be firſt deſtroyed or ſuppreſſed. And therefore the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
do hope, that not only ſuch as are already convinced of their Deſign and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
but even thoſe that by their ſubtile and falſe pretences have been ignorantly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to joyn with them, that love their Liberty and the Proteſtant Religion, will
now with one heart and mind unite together, to preſerve their Religion and Liberty:
in the defence whereof the Lords and Commons are reſolved to offer up themſelves,
their lives and fortunes, a willing Sacrifice.</p>

                     <p>THough His Majeſty be aſſured, it cannot but be of great Advantage to Him to
have ſuch an occaſion as is now given Him by the late Declaration of both
Houſes, to ſhew to all His good People who it is that is really in fault, that the laſt
Treaty, ſo much deſired by His Majeſty, and only begun upon His Deſire, broke
off ſo abruptly (as He doubts not to do, if thoſe who govern in the remaining part
of both Houſes have but ſo much ingenuity left, as to ſuffer what He ſays to be
equally freely publiſhed to His People;) yet His Majeſty cannot without great
grief of Soul ſee that Treaty, which He hoped and expected ſhould have begot
the ſettled Peace and Happineſs of His Subjects, in ſtead thereof beget nothing but
Diſputes and Declarations: yet it will be ſome Cordial to Him, when He ſhall be
forced to ſee the Deſolation of this Kingdom and the Miſery of His People, that
not only it is not He that hath made that Deſolate and them Miſerable, but that
He is able to demonſtrate to all the World, that He hath uſed His utmoſt and moſt
earneſt endeavours to prevent it, as will appear at large by the following ſtate of the
Caſe.</p>
                     <p>After that the Conſpiracy of ſome Perſons againſt the preſent eſtabliſht Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil had made means to infuſe into part of the People
(by publiſhing unheard-of Declarations, obtain'd and paſt in a new and unheard-of
manner, ſometimes but by eleven Voices after ſeventeen hours ſitting, and that but in
one Houſe) ſtrange Fears and Jealouſies of the other Houſe and of His Majeſty, and
by them given the Riſe to thoſe inſufferable Tumults and Seditious unparliamentary
Petitions at once to and againſt the Lords, which they afterwards avowed publickly to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:60710:198"/>
protect and encourage, and forced the Lords Houſe, by fearing them, to ſeem to fear
with them, and to joyn with them firſt in requiring, and next in forcing no leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for thoſe Fears from His Majeſty (who was then in condition to have moſt
real Cauſe of Fear Himſelf) than almoſt all that Power which the Law had tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to Him for the ſecurity of the Crown and the Protection of His People; after
that His Majeſty and moſt of the Members were forced away from the Parliament;
and that His ſhare in making new Laws was denyed to Him in any caſe in which
they would pretend Neceſſity, and every Subject that would not ſubmit to any new,
extravagant, extemporary, legiſlative Declaration or Order of one or both Houſes, againſt
the antient known Law of the Land, was become ſent for up, and impriſoned as a
Delinquent, and whoſoever would aſſiſt them, againſt the known Law, was not only-protected
by them in that, but in any other Caſe (although they were of them who
had been moſt apparently active in thoſe former Preſſures upon the People, which
they now afreſh impute to His Majeſty) ſo that to be of their ſide was now become
a known Sanctuary; after that nothing was left undone or unſaid that might render
His Majeſty both weak and odious, and that all that He could ſay or do to clear
Himſelf was either ſuppreſt, or interpreted in a contrary and impoſſible ſenſe (ſo
that His very offer to venture His Royal Perſon againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels was voted to
be an Encouragement to that Rebellion;) after that from declaring of Law they
came to declaring of Thoughts, and forgetting that the Hearts of Kings are inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
preſumed to dive into His, and without Apparence, and contrary to Truth,
had declared that He meant to make War upon His Parliament, and made that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
a ground to levy a real War againſt Him, and then made that War a ground
to begin to make War upon His People, forcing away the Arms and Money of all
ſuch as they pleaſed to ſuſpect of the Crimes of Allegiance and Loyalty; after that
they had ſo far expreſt and diſcovered the true end of all theſe Actions, as to propoſe
the total Change of the preſent Government, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, in the
Nineteen Propoſitions, as the only way to Peace; and that His Majeſty might by all
this have been ſufficiently perſwaded, that it was impoſſible for Him to obtain Peace
from them but either by Submiſſion or by the Sword: yet after all this His Majeſty
was ſo averſe to the latter Courſe, as to deſcend to ſo great a degree of the former,
as from <hi>Nottingham</hi> to propoſe to and deſire from them a Treaty for Peace; and
being there twice openly and abſolutely refuſed it, yet did then declare, that He
would notwithſtanding be ready to receive it whenſoever they would propoſe it.
And to ſhew that theſe Offers proceeded not from His Condition but from His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
after His Victory at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> and after that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had ſo
far forgot his Errand, as to return to <hi>London</hi> alone, in ſtead of bringing up His
Majeſty, and thoſe His good Subjects whom they call'd Delinquents; His Anſwer
at <hi>Colebrook</hi> will ſhew to all the World, that He was ſtill of the ſame mind as when
He ſent His Meſſages from <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and His Meſſage ſo carefully ſent from <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
to prevent all miſ-conſtruction of that march of His which they had neceſſitated
to <hi>Brainceford,</hi> and His preſſing ſtill that a Treaty might go on in that and ſeveral
other Meſſages, all ſlighted and neglected, ſhewed ſufficiently who really was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of, and who were averſe to Peace. But when the Petition of ſo many Citizens,
that a Treaty might be accepted, finding ſo little countenance or acceptance from the
Houſe of Commons, and the Injuries and Impriſonments which the Petitioners ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for it from Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> and others, finding ſo much countenance from
them, did ſo far begin to open the eyes of the People, that the Averſion to Peace began
to be imputed to them who were truly guilty, and that they found this Diſcovery
made men generally unwilling to part with their money to make themſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that again encouraged many of the Members to appear for Peace too, and that
conſequently their too open and avowed deſire of War would but render them unable
to continue it, they thought it neceſſary to make ſome Propoſitions which might deceive
the People ſo far as to make them believe they deſired Peace, and yet reſolved to make
them ſo unreaſonable, as they might notwithſtanding be ſure to be out of all danger of
effecting Peace by them, and ſent thoſe down to His Majeſty. Which though they pretend
now to be ſuch as no indifferent man will find any thing contained in them but what was
neceſſary for the maintenance and advancement of the true Proteſtant Religion, the due
execution of Juſtice, the Preſervation of the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and
the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdoms Peace and Safety; yet His Majeſty is confident that
even thoſe who are not very indifferent are yet able to ſee, that no Propoſitions could
be more unreaſonable than thoſe Fourteen, except the former Nineteen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:60710:199"/>
To paſs by the Preamble, (in which moſt unneceſſarily they lay moſt heavy and moſt
unjuſt Charges upon His Majeſty, and yet draw an Argument of His Averſion to Peace
from thoſe known Truths which either His defence or the matter in queſtion, Crimes
being impoſſible to be ſpoken of but as Crimes, did after extort from Him) would not
any man have expected, that had obſerved with what violence this War was begun and
proſecuted againſt His Majeſty, to have found in the Propoſitions for Peace the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of at leaſt ſome, and thoſe very important, Rights which were withheld from
them before the War, and ſo had given ſome colour for it? But of theſe there appears
not ſo much as one: and yet till all theſe are granted and performed, they do as much
as ſay in Terms plain enough in their Concluſion, that they have not any hope, nor
will uſe any endeavours, that His Majeſty and His People may enjoy the Bleſſings of
Peace and Juſtice; which was certainly by terrour of Arms to demand new Laws, and
as great a Proof that they did ſo, as they ſeem to confeſs it unparliamentary if they had
done it. Is not the taking away of the Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, and indeed the
whole eſtabliſht Eccleſiaſtical frame of Order and Government, a new Law? yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
His Majeſty will yield to take it away (though there were but five Lords preſent
when the Bill paſt, and though no other form be yet offered or ſhewed to Him, but
the Presbyterians and Independents are left to fight it out among themſelves what ſhall
ſucceed in the place,) His Majeſty is told, He muſt not hope for Peace. And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
likely to enſue between different Parties, what ſhall after be introduced, ſhews
ſufficiently what hope there ſhould be of Peace if He ſhould paſs it.</p>
                     <p>Are not the Bill againſt Scandalous Miniſters (in which moſt of their own Faction
are appointed Commiſſioners, that they may make way for and introduce a new Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of their own;) the Bill againſt Pluralities, (which makes no difference of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or merits of Perſons, or of value of Livings, and looks not only forwards, but
extends to the immediate diſpoſſeſſing of preſent Incumbents of what is veſted in them
for their Lives by the Law of the Land;) the Bill for the Conſultation of Divines
(Perſons of their own choice, and moſt of them of their Faction, and of no eſteem
but with themſelves, hardly at all bounded as to the matter, and abſolutely unlimited
as to the time of their conſultation,) all news Laws? Is not the ſettling of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
both by Sea and Land, and the Forts and Ports, in ſuch a manner as ſhall be
agreed on by both Houſes (in which His Majeſty is expected with a blind implicite
Faith to truſt them with the whole Power of the Kingdom, and with His only means
of defending Himſelf and protecting His Subjects, though into what hands or for
what time or in what manner they will order or diſpoſe of it is ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to Him, that it doth not yet appear that both Houſes know themſelves, and
how they have already uſed that Power is known to all the World) both a new
and a ſtrange Demand? Are the Earl of <hi>Briſtoll</hi>'s Removal and Excluſion from all
poſſibility of Employment, (a Perſon uncondemned, unimpeacht and unſummoned,
no crime or error either proved or but named againſt him,) or the choice of the Judges
and Maſter of the Rolls, the change of Commiſſioners of the Peace and <hi>Oyer</hi> and
<hi>Terminer,</hi> or the reſtoring of Members of the Houſes, even to ſuch menial places of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as required a perſonal attendance, and who had yet refuſed to attend upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or the aſſenting to whatſoever Acts He ſhall be adviſed for paying of Debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
upon the publick Faith, that is, by the Authority of both Houſes (by which
His Majeſty muſt allow Himſelf to be no no part of the publick, and muſt directly
allow, and, as it were, ratifie that Rebellion which this Money was raiſed to foment)
either due to them by Law, or reaſonable in themſelves? Doth the directing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
with whom and how far to make Alliances belong to them? (or was that at all
neceſſary, His inclination to the ſtricteſt bands with Princes and States of the Proteſtant
Religion being by the Match of His Daughter ſufficiently expreſſed?) And yet till all
this be done, and unleſs He will pardon all that have born Arms againſt Him, and
leave thoſe that have aſſiſted Him to their Mercy who have none, they will not promiſe
any hopeful endeavours for Peace and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>But is there any thing elſe that is due by Law, which was before denied and is here
demanded, that can in any degree juſtifie or extenuate that ever Peace was broken and
Juſtice deſtroyed? Not ſo much as one tittle. Did His Majeſty give any Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
till they had muſtered many men? Or did He ſo much as take any Guard to Him,
till both they had a much greater many months, and had of their own Authority orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Serjeant-Major-General of their City Forces, and till His Magazine and Town
were by Arms kept againſt Him, though He were provoked to it before by all the
other Indignities and Injuries which Inſolence and Injuſtice could deviſe? Was not
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:60710:199"/>
Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> for all his known Treaſon refuſed to be left by them to Juſtice and
the trial of the Law, before ever any that was but call'd a Delinquent was protected
by His Majeſty? And was not His Majeſty then denied that which themſelves confeſs to
be the due and right of the meaneſt Subject, and do ſo far expect, as to look upon it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a ſcorn than a ſatisfaction now His Majeſty offers it to them? Was any one Papiſt
armed by His Majeſty before many of that Religion (and multitudes of perſons againſt
whoſe Recuſancy the Law is as ſevere as againſt theirs) were armed againſt Him; or
than either, until their mere being of that Religion made them without colour of Law
be plunder'd and impriſon'd in all parts, and ſome of them fly into His Army for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?
Did not His Majeſty before of himſelf often offer to vindicate the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of Parliament from any imaginable breach of them in the buſineſs of the Lord
<hi>Kimbolton</hi> and Five Members? and did He not offer to wave their Charge, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſubmitting it to the publick Peace? So that the obtaining that demand, or the
disbanding of the Army, or the diſarming of Papiſts, or the trial of Delinquents,
though they make ſome ſuch ſhew as they are ſet in this place, yet not any of them
were any grounds of this their War: And all that is due in theſe Demands having been
offered before the War, or occaſioned or neceſſitated by it, and being ſtill to be had
without it, the whole People cannot but ſee, that nothing but Fears and Jealouſies
have been the fumes with which they have ſo intoxicated His ſeduced Subjects, as to
contribute to their own Miſery, to obtain no one Right, how ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſoever, denied to them by His Majeſty, and that the maintenance and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, Juſtice, Liberty, Property and Peace, are really but their Stalking-Horſes,
and neither the Ground of their War nor of theſe Demands; which will appear
to any indifferent Man that ſhall duly weigh them, as far from being moderate as from
being neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuch was His Majeſty's moſt earneſt deſire to catch at any thing that by producing
a Treaty might ſettle a Peace, and ſo far were any ſuch Enemies of it (as are ſuppoſed by
this Declaration (from being prevalent with Him againſt this deſire, that His Majeſty
propoſed that perſons ſhould be appointed by His Majeſty and both Houſes to Treat even
upon theſe very Propoſitions, and ſuch other as His Majeſty propoſed, which were only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
according to or in behalf of the Law eſtabliſht, and which more concerned His
Subjects than Himſelf. And His Majeſty cannot but appeal to all the World, whether
not only any of their Propoſitions did, but whether any other Propoſitions that could be
deviſed could expreſs more deſire of the maintenance and advancement of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion than His Majeſty's Fourth Propoſition, (in which His readineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the execution of all Laws made, and to any good Laws to be made, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of Popery, His deſire that the Laws already made to preſerve the Common-Prayer
from the ſcorn and violence of Sectaries be backt and fortified, and His Offer at
the ſame time that tender Conſciences be eaſed by it, are ſo clearly and carefully expreſt
and united;) or of the due execution of Juſtice than His Majeſty's Fifth Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which refers all ſuch Delinquents as ſhould by the Treaters be excepted in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
to the uſual courſe and known Law of the Land;) or of the preſervation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Liberty and Property, (for His Majeſty conceives that He hath a Property too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
maintaining of which He will be never able to defend His Subjects) than His Firſt,
Second and Third; or of the Peace of the Kingdom, than His Sixth Propoſition, which
by reſtoring His Subjects by a Ceſſation to a ſhort Trial of the quiet and benefit of Peace,
would have rendered them ſo far in love with that almoſt-forgotten Happineſs, that ſeeing
nothing demanded by them that was worth a War, they would have had a hard work to
have engaged them again into ſo unprofitable a Madneſs. And His Majeſty is ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of His advantage in all theſe, that He conjures His Subjects ſeriouſly to read, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and compare what He and what they demanded, and by their indifferent Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to judge of their ſeveral Intentions.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, the violent party both in the City and the Houſes (which, for all the
publick Fears and Jealouſies they pretend, inwardly and really are fearful and jealous of
nothing ſo much as of Peace) diſlike nothing more in His Majeſty's Propoſitions than the
Moderation; and ſuſpecting that the reaſonableneſs and unreaſonableneſs of what His
Majeſty and what they askt would but too generally appear by the Diſcuſſion of both in
a free and open Treaty, and ſo might in deſpight of them produce a Peace, earneſtly and
openly oppoſe the Treaty, and ſo far oppoſe His Majeſty's Propoſition of Ceſſation, that
it ſufficiently appeared by their averſion to the Shadow of Peace (as themſelves call it)
how much and how heartily they were averſe to the Subſtance it ſelf. But when they
found that they could perſwade no Man to joyn with them in rejecting all imaginable
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60710:200"/>
manners of Treaty and Ceſſation, that did not joyn with them in abhorring any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
manner of Peace, they reſerved their Authority to enable them to break off both,
upon ſomewhat more plauſible difference in the Circumſtances and Conditions.</p>
                     <p>A ſafe Conduct is demanded by the Houſes, and their firſt Art is to get the Lord
<hi>Say</hi> named in that Demand for a Treater, which they knew certainly (he having born
Arms againſt His Majeſty, and been excepted in one of His Proclamations of Pardon)
His Majeſty muſt except againſt: but when they could not perſwade even both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
(who well remembred an example of no elder date than ſince His Majeſty was at
<hi>Colebrook,</hi> when the ſame exception at the perſon of. Sir <hi>John Evelyn</hi> was made by His
Majeſty, and not excepted at by both Houſes) that this exception was ſo unparallel'd a
breach of Priviledge, as to deſerve to hinder the Treaty from going on, their next
Arts are ſo to bound and limit their Committee, both in the Matter, Manner, Time and
Power as might wholly render it uneffectual: And to that end they firſt obtain that
their Committee ſhould Treat with none but with His Majeſty, (a Courſe which
how lofty, how advantagious, and how unreaſonable ſoever, yet His Majeſty, out
of His earneſt deſire of Peace, contrary to their hopes and expectations, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to admit;) and next obtain that they ſhould not Treat upon any point but
of the Ceſſation, till that were concluded, and for that allowed but four days, and that
at twice, (in hope that ſome matter of Advantage might happen in the time of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay)
and allow them no Power (without ſtill ſending to the Houſes upon every occaſion)
to conclude farther than the Papers they brought down or delivered, or ſo much as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
or new-word any thing in them, (a new and a ſtrange way of Treating, and by
which at that diſtance it was wholly and plainly impoſſible that any thing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:)
and when His Majeſty had quitted all wherein Himſelf or His Army were
ſolely concerned, and yielded almoſt to all that they propoſed, and at laſt inſiſted upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that they might not make uſe of the leiſure of their Army, occaſioned by this
Ceſſation, to force what Sums they would from what Countries they pleas'd, (for they
neither would nor could name any other bound of their Taxes than their pleaſure, when
they imputed that aſſertion to His Majeſty) and ſo extremely burthen His Subjects, and
advantage and enable themſelves againſt His Majeſty, (in contradiction to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
lay'd down by themſelves, and approved of by His Majeſty, That by the very
nature of a Ceſſation, matters ſhould be preſerved in the ſtate they are in, and neither
party have liberty much to advantage himſelf;) nor yet inſiſted any further upon that
neither, than to leave room ſtill for ſatisfaction (if any Reaſon could be offered againſt
ſo reaſonable a Limitation) by a continuance of the Treaty concerning it; they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
Him no offer of any ſuch Reaſon, nor allowed their Committee any farther Time
or Power to Treat concerning it, without expreſſing any better cauſe for ſo abrupt an
end of ſo important a Debate, than to avoid the Waſt of Time: though His Majeſty
could not conceive that could be called a Waſt, or how time could be better ſpent, than
to ſettle ſuch a degree of publick Peace, as might reduce the minds of all Men to ſuch a
Temper as might make a full Peace much more probable.</p>
                     <p>Nor did His Majeſty find in the Treaty it ſelf that the Committee were any better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
(though to avoid delay, and that a Concluſion might be made poſſible) His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
often deſired it. They were limited twice to four days, and once to ſeven: they were
bounded to two Propoſitions, and to their bare narrow Inſtructions concerning thoſe: nor
had they ſo much as any Power or Inſtructions at all concerning that moſt important
part of their own Propoſition, ſo often preſt by themſelves, His Majeſty's Return to His
Parliament. So that reſolving (as it will be afterward ſhewed they did) to yield no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to His Majeſty's Propoſition than with ſuch Limitations as would in effect retain
what they ſeemed to give up, they expect that His Majeſty ſhould entirely yield to theirs
without any Limitation, and (to invert their own words upon another occaſion) ſhould
yield to that which would have produced to them an abſolute Victory and Submiſſion,
under pretence of Agreement and Peace: It being evident to all Men, that His Rights
forced from Him by Violence being not abſolutely reſtored, His Army being disbanded,
and He returned to <hi>London,</hi> the Members of both Houſes for diſſenting from them and
aſſiſting of Him remaining expelled, no ſecurity from Tumults for the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
being given, and all good Subjects being totally diſcouraged by ſo abſolute a Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Factious and Rebellious, His Majeſty were as much in the diſpoſal of the Five
Members as if they had him in the Tower, and He ought His Crown wholly to their
Grace and Favour if they did not Depoſe Him. And yet they would be thought to deſire
nothing, in deſiring that the Armies ſhould be upon theſe Terms disbanded, but only
that the Kingdom might be eaſed of their Burthen, and the ſpring of theſe Calamities
might be ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="385" facs="tcp:60710:200"/>
His Majeſty demands, That His own Revenue, Magazine, Towns, Forts and Ships,
taken by Force, be reſtored to Him. The Revenue (which they could eaſily pay back
out of other Mens Purſes) they eaſily agree about; but to part with ſuch ſtrengths which
had and did help to enable them to leave no Subject any more of his Right, than they
had to the detaining of theſe, they can by no means endure. And therefore they propoſe
ſuch Limitations as in effect limit away all, and yet may ſeem to the vulgar or to the
careleſs not to ſignifie much: to wit, That theſe Strengths may be put into ſuch hands
as they will confide in, and that no leſs than three years; That the Commanders may,
during that time, not admit of any Forces upon whatſoever occaſion without Conſent
of the Houſes, and they, and all Generals and Commanders of the Armies on either ſide,
may ſwear to preſerve the Peace of the Kingdom againſt all Forces raiſed without conſent
of both Houſes, and this for no limited time. His Majeſty, who had asked nothing but
what was His by Law, and who in order to Peace had not asked ſo much, as by Law
was due to Him, (to wit, the puniſhment of thoſe who had taken theſe things from
Him) could not but wonder to ſee ſuch things asked of him, to which by Law there
was no Pretence: He therefore endeavours to limit their Limitations to the Law of the
Land; He names thoſe Perſons to this Cuſtody whom the Law had named firſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
Himſelf moſt willing that they ſhould be put out at the ſame door they came in at;
that the Law, which had veſted them, might eject them, if they had offended againſt it:
But expected not that the Injury done Him, of taking theſe things from Him and them
contrary to Law, ſhould be a reaſon why any new conditions or Limitations ſhould be
laid upon Him or His Miniſters, which the Law laid not. To this the Committee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
not denying what the King asked to be legally His, or to have been illegally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from Him, nor making any legal, or ſo much as colourable, or at all any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
againſt the Perſons legally veſted in thoſe Places, (and without any Cauſe ſhewed,
it would have ill become His Majeſty to have deveſted His Servants of their Rights, in
the inſtant when ſome of them are venturing their Lives for his Service) but retire to
their old inacceſſible Fort of Fears and Jealouſies. To this His Majeſty rejoyns, ſhews
what he had done to prevent and deſtroy Fears and Jealouſies in them, intimates what
they had done to create Fears and Jealouſies in Him; that having by Force taken theſe
things from Him when He had them, He had more Reaſon to have inſiſted upon further
Security to inable him to keep them, than ſimply to deſire them to be returned to Him,
(and much more than to grant them more hold of them, to enable them the better to
wreſt them from Him again:) repreſents to them, that by the ſame Reaſon, upon the
ſame ground, they may ask Him all His Legal Power, ſince all the Power veſted in
Princes, for the neceſſary Protection of their Subjects, may poſſibly be employed for
their hurt; and concludes, in His Opinion, with a very wholeſome Advice againſt that
dangerous (and now too Epidemical) Diſeaſe of Fears and Jealouſies, and preſcribes
to them to make the Law their Rule and Meaſure, as the beſt Antidote and Cure for
that Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>This inſiſting upon this Anſwer, as His Majeſty for theſe Reaſons thought to be moſt
reaſonable, ſo He likewiſe thought it moſt neceſſary; Firſt, becauſe themſelves having
told Him in the Debate about Ceſſation in the point of Ships, that for them to allow
Him the Approbation of Commanders, was to give Him up the Strength, He could not
want Logick ſo much as not to draw this Concluſion from theſe Premiſes, That for Him
to allow them the Approbation of the Commanders, both of Magazines, Towns, Forts
and Ships, was in that to give all back to them, which they would ſeem to reſtore to
Him. Secondly, becauſe his Majeſty by now conſenting upon the ground of Jealouſies to
ſuch Demands, as exceed thoſe (which before they had joyned the injuſtice of forcing theſe
things from Him, to the unreaſonableneſs of demanding them) His Majeſty in His
weakeſt Condition denied to them, He muſt appear to juſtifie thoſe Jealouſies, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of thoſe Demands and of that Injuſtice, and to condemn Himſelf as guilty of the
woful effects of that Contention, for not having ſooner conſented to them. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
He muſt condemn the Lords Houſe of the ſame Crime, for having twice refuſed
to joyn in that demand, and having had no Jealouſies as long as they had no Tumults.
Fourthly, becauſe He muſt either quit, during the lives of theſe ſeveral Perſons required
to be ſworn, and at leaſt for three years (when the <hi>Militia</hi> in their own Bill was asked
but for two) His known Right of ſole raiſing Men, and without the conſent of both
Houſes (even although no Parliament were ſitting, for the Bill that ſays it may continue,
does not ſay it muſt) He muſt neither be able to diſcharge His Duty to Himſelf by His
own Defence, nor make good His Oath, by the protecting of his Subjects againſt any
ſudden, dangerous Rebellion or Invaſion; or the Commanders of all His Ships, Towns,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60710:201"/>
Forts and Magazines, and all the Commanders of both Armies (that is, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) muſt according to this new Oath oppoſe any oppoſition
He ſhall make, and muſt be equally obliged by it to fight againſt His Forces, as againſt
thoſe of the Rebels or Invaders. Fifthly, becauſe if He ſhould give them ſo a great a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
for ſo long a time, as this ſhare in the choice of men to places of ſo high Power
and Truſt, the Dependance of Subjects upon the Crown would be much diverted and
He could never expect to be faithfully ſerved, when no other Crime of theirs appearing
to Him, He ſhould ſo farr deveſt the preſent Proprietaries of their legal Right, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it a new to the Arbitrarineſs of their Confiding, who have given His Majeſty no greater
Cauſe to confide in their Choice. Sixthly and laſtly, becauſe if He ſhould allow them
that power for that time upon that Reaſon, He cannot doubt but againſt that time were
ended, the Sweetneſs of Power being once taſted, they would be ſo unwilling to quit it,
that the ſame powerful violent party would not want the like Fears to beget the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the ſame or greater intereſt, in the choice of the ſame or greater Places; and the
ſame Conſequences would not likewiſe fail to follow, if theſe Demands were not conſented
to, and even His good Subjects ſeeing it the moſt proſperous, might be induced to think
Faction and Sedition the wiſeſt Courſe; and when they ſaw His Majeſty give ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Rebellion, might think it pity He ſhould ever be without one. And His
Majeſty conceives, Fear and Jealouſie may be a good reaſon to make Him cautious how
He parts with His Right, though a very inſufficient juſtification of their forcing that from
Him, to which they could pretend none.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill His Majeſty hoped that they only inſiſted upon ſuch Limitations of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
till they ſaw what Limitations he would offer to theirs; and therefore to reduce
them to Moderation by His Example, He propoſes to the Houſes (for the Committee
had no Power or Inſtruction to treat of the principal point of it) no other Limitations
than were both due by Law and neceſſary in themſelves, and offers as ſoon as he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in His firſt Propoſition, (to which if they would have put Him in mind of any ſuch
Objection in the Treaty,<note place="margin">In His Meſſage of <hi>April</hi> 12.</note>
 He would never have required that the exact Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Revenue taken from Him ſhould be agreed on before Disbanding, which is
now objected to Him, not as an Injuſtice, but as a purpoſed Delay) as ſoon as the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were reſtored to that Condition in which they were before the Tumults, and theſe
Diſtractions forced the Members from thence, and as ſoon as He and thoſe Houſes were
ſecured from Tumults (only adding His own opinion, That adjourning twenty miles
from <hi>London</hi> could only effect it, and offering them the choice of any place at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in His whole Kingdom) He would immediately disband, and return to His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and expected much more that this Meſſage when it was received at <hi>London</hi>
ſhould have met with Bells and Bone-fires, than have received neither Approbation nor
Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>But that violent Party which looks upon Peace like a Monſter, fearing leſt if the Treaty
ſhould any longer continue, ſo fair an approach to Peace might by degrees ſteal it on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them before they were aware, prevail to return no other Anſwer, than immediately
to ſend for their Committee from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to ſend the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to <hi>Reading.</hi>
His Majeſty waits awhile,<note place="margin">His Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>May</hi> 5.</note>
 and again in a Meſſage He had occaſion to ſend to the Houſes
concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> He takes occaſion to put them in mind of that former Meſſage, and
to renew the expreſſions of His Deſire of Peace: But this Meſſage had no better luck than
the other, for no Anſwer hath been ſent to it, only in ſtead of an Anſwer, the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Party makes a ſhift to go a ſtep or two higher, and to prevail in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to vote Exciſes upon Commodities, and the making of a new Great Seal, though
the making of it will be Treaſon by the Statute of the five and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third (and an Order of the Houſe of Commons will be but an inſufficient Plea againſt
that Statute) and though they might have remembred, that it is by the old one that both
moſt of them hold their Lands, and all of them are called to that Houſe. But ſince His
Majeſty would not allow them a ſhare in making of Peers (as they ask'd him in their
Nineteen Propoſitions) nor allow of their choice of Juſtices of the Peace (as they ask'd
Him in their Fourteen) and did ſtill pretend to making of Sheriffs (which they have
denied Him by their Votes) it ſeems they thought it neceſſary to make that which (if
it could be made legal by Voting) would make all thoſe, and to end the Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
His Majeſty's Negative Voice, by paſſing by Commiſſion what new Bills they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and ſo to obtain as abſolutely an unlimited Power over their fellow-Subjects as over
their Sovereign Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yet His Majeſty would take no notice of all this,<note place="margin">Meſſage of <hi>May</hi> 19.</note>
 but ſends once more, a third Meſſage,
to deſire an Anſwer to His firſt (which had then lain in their hands above a Month.)
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60710:201"/>
This preſſing for Peace appears ſo intolerable to them, that the Houſe of Commons (as
the beſt way to make a final end of all ſuch Meſſages, and indeed to cut off all Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
is prevailed with by theſe men to commit the Meſſenger, and the next day to
impeach His Majeſties Royal Conſort of High Treaſon, as if they would give Him a fair
warning how He trouble them about Peace again, leſt His turn be next, and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
him too. But though they vouchſafe His Majeſty no Anſwer, yet the People is
ſtill thought worthy of ſome ſatisfaction: and that produces this Declaration, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
fully and ſufficiently to ſhew, that in the Treaty their Demands were ſuch and ſo
moderate, as was fit and neceſſary for them to make, and juſt and reaſonable for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to aſſent unto; and His Majeſty's were ſuch as had neither Reaſon nor Juſtice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the matter or manner of them, and ſuch as left the People no hope or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſee an end of their preſent Calamities; and charge the King through His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
in many Circumſtances, before it and during it, to have laboured to interrupt the
Treaty, and to have appeared averſe to Peace: and in this Queſtion His Majeſty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to accept of the Arbitrator they themſelves have choſen, and to refer it to the People
to judge.</p>
                     <p>Their Firſt Argument is, That this Treaty is for the disbanding of the Armies and Forces
in oppoſition to each other; that theſe Towns, Forts and Ships are a great part of their
Forces, ſo that for them to reſtore them abſolutely to the King, would be for them to
disband totally, and for His Majeſty's Forces to continue. To this His Majeſty anſwers,
That this Treaty was intended by Him to be in order to a firm and ſettled (that is a juſt)
Peace, and never to be ſuch wherein a pretended Equality ſhould exclude evident Juſtice.
Let Equality determine the manner of the disbanding of the Armies raiſed upon theſe
Diſtractions, but let Juſtice reſtore what Violence hath taken, and determine of known
undoubted Rights; ſince by this Argument, if any Prince ſeize upon any Strength that
belongs to His ſtronger Neighbour, and Arms be taken up upon it, the ſtronger muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in a Treaty, when the Armies are to be disbanded, expect to have His Strength reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him, leſt the other return to be what He was and what He ought to be, that is, the
weaker of the two. Secondly, His Majeſty anſwers, That by the ſame reaſon of Security,
other Power and Prerogatives being Strength as well as Forces, and neither more veſted
in Him, nor leſs poſſible to be uſed for the Peoples hurt, they may as well require a ſhare
and intereſt in thoſe too, and, that things may be made ſufficiently equal between the
ſides, may expect to be as much Kings as He. Thirdly, in their own opinion and by their
own confeſſion (as it appears by their Argument uſed in the Ceſſation in the point of
Ships) if they be but allowed the Approbation of Commanders, His Majeſty gives up
this ſtrength to them, and not they to Him, and it will be their Forces, and not His,
which are to continue undisbanded, and that that they ſay to be contrary to Equality,
and (as they came by theſe Forces) it is evident to be contrary to Juſtice. Fourthly, His
Majeſty anſwers, that theſe Forces are not ſo great, or ſo great a Strength of the ſide that
ſhall poſſeſs them, but that the Arts, Union, Induſtry and Violence of that Party was ſo
much too ſtrong for His Majeſty when He had that Strength, as to take that Strength from
Him; and therefore His Majeſty wonders they ſhould make any difficulty to reſtore
what it may appear by ſo freſh experience that they are ſo able to reſume: and therefore
His Majeſty hopes His People will attribute it to His great Deſire of Peace, that He did
not demand ſome farther ſecurity to enjoy that which is not denied to be His Majeſty's.
And His Majeſty obſerves that both this and the ſecond Anſwer were given by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to the ſame Arguments made upon the ſame occaſion by their Committee in the
Treaty, and yet this Declaration repeats the ſame Arguments without replying to thoſe
Anſwers. Fifthly, His Majeſty deſires that the Difficulty with which His Majeſty raiſed
His Army, and the Eaſe with which they raiſed theirs, may be conſidered; how impoſſible
it would have been for Him to have raiſed Forces, if they had not raiſed firſt, and how
much ſlowlier (this Army being disbanded) He could raiſe a new one, and how quick
and ready their Body of fierce, eager Sectaries and Schiſmaticks would be to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Army upon the leaſt Call, and how conveniently they inhabit for ſo ſpeedy a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being to continue moſt of them in or ſo near <hi>London,</hi> that their Quarters in War were
uſually much more diſtant than their Dwellings in Peace: and then His Majeſty doubts
not but it will appear, that in this reſpect too the real and total Disbanding is of His
Majeſty's part only, and that in effect the Continuance of Forces is ſtill of theirs.</p>
                     <p>Their Second Argument, why His Majeſty ſhould admit of their Limitations, is a
bundle of Precedents. To which His Majeſty replies, Firſt, that the Records which are
here quoted for theſe are now in the ſame hands as his Majeſty's Magazines, Towns, Forts
and Ships, and therefore knows not how He can either have their Truth ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:60710:202"/>
and examined, or without it conſide in their Quotations. Secondly, all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Circumſtances both of matter and time, what induced it, and what followed it,
do not herein appear (though very neceſſary to be known, that they may be poſſible to
be anſwered.) But this His Majeſty can find upon view, That ſome of them concern
not any part of what is now demanded, but one of them concerns a Chancellor, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
and Privy-Seal, and another concerns Privy-Councillors, and another the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip,
another the choice of ſome without whoſe Advice, or of four of them, nothing
ſhould be done by the King, (which it ſeems they have an eye upon demanding too,
which made them run ſo much in their heads who collected theſe as to put them in
here:) That ſome concern not the Perſons now demanding, but conclude only for the
Merchants to chuſe an Admiral, and not for the Houſes to confide in him; which Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
may be of ſome uſe to the Common-Council, but of none to the Parliament: That
ſome are of no concern at all, as only about appointing of Clarks for payment of Wages
(yet put in to encreaſe the bulk:) That hardly any of the Precedents that concern any of
the things in Queſtion, concern any more than part of thoſe which are altogether deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Limitations deſired; ſome concerning only the Command of Ships (and thoſe
too not granted by Act, but by Commiſſion, and that, for ought appears, only during
pleaſure;) ſome extending but to one Town or Place, as <hi>Berwick</hi> or <hi>Jerſey:</hi> That moſt
of theſe Precedents appear to have been when the Kings were in Minority and under
Protectors, ſome when they were in extreme Age and Impotency, ſome in the Reign
of a King who was ſhortly after depoſed, in Parliament too, (an unlikely Circumſtance
to invite His Majeſty at this time to follow that Example) others in His Reign who
ſucceeded Him, and (having no Right to the Crown but the Criminal Conſent of both
Houſes) had Reaſon to deny them nothing who had given Him All. And of ſome of
the Precedents now quoted, the Inconveniences are known to have been ſo great and ſo
ſuddenly found, that they were ſo ſpeedily revoked in Parliament (with no leſs a Brand
than as being contrary to the Cuſtoms of the Realm, and to the blemiſhing of the Crown)
that if they had ingenuouſly added thoſe Circumſtances, theſe Precedents would more
have juſtified His Majeſty for not yielding, than them for either asking any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe, or but for quoting them at all. But doth any of theſe Precedents tell us
that theſe Parliaments claim'd any Right in any of theſe, or that any King yield any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Power in any one of theſe Points to both Houſes, when they had firſt taken them
from Him by Force, and rais'd an Army by Ordinance againſt Him, and He was in a
condition to reſiſt what they had raiſed? And if either any of theſe Kings were ſo much
in their Power, that his Conſent was as much forced from Him as theſe Particulars were
forced from His Majeſty, or if they were ſo far out of Danger of any farther Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon their Power, that He could have no cauſe of Fears and Jealouſies, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of theſe to them; nay that their advice in the Choice aroſe wholly from His
Majeſty's Deſire, and not their Demand, then the Precedents fit not this Caſe, and ſo
make nothing for their purpoſe. But now that the Perpetuity of this Parliament hath ſo far
encouraged thoſe, who by Arts and Violence have gotten Power over it, that they may
probably hope to make this Power as perpetual as it, and have given ſo ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
what further uſe they would make of any Power, His Majeſty ſuppoſes Himſelf to
have more reaſon to be cautious in that Point than any of His Predeceſſors, who were
content to ſhare any part of this Power but for once, with but a temporary Aſſembly;
eſpecially ſince their ſeveral Propoſitions have ſhewed how much more they wiſh, and
M. <hi>Prinne</hi>'s Books (printed by Order of a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by Warrant under M. <hi>White</hi>'s hand) have ſhewed how much more they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to; and ſince any Grant of His is deſired by theſe Men, but to enable them to obtain
the reſt of their pretences or deſires; what he yielded to them concerning my Lord of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>John Conyers</hi> being Lieutenants of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and the Tower, being preſt
in theſe very Precedents as an Argument to Him, why he ſhould grant all they ask
now. On the other ſide, if his Majeſty ſhould make uſe of their own kind of Weapon,
and do the ſame or as great things, or make them the like or as great demands, as their
Predeceſſors have tacitely approved of, or directly aſſented to, when they were done or
made by His, (as in the juſt Famous time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Stanhope</hi>
and <hi>Savile,</hi> or in the ſame time in <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Caſe, or in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
in the Power given to Him to diſpoſe of the Kingdom by His Will and Teſtament, and
others of the like and near as high kinds) He believes both Houſes would think what
others then did, to be no Argument to perſwade them either to approve or conſent, but
would rather for ever wave all Arguments from Precedents, than direct themſelves by
the ſame Rule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:60710:202"/>
Their third Argument is, That His Majeſty had formerly expreſt that His Forts and Caſtles
ſhould be only in ſuch hands as both Houſes might ſafely confide in. And His Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
ſtill as much; and till ſome juſt legal cauſe be ſhewed him why the Perſons now in
thoſe Commands cannot be ſafely Confided in by them, He conceives they might ſafely
confide in them if they pleas'd. But His Majeſty did likewiſe once ſay, He would put all
thoſe places, both of the Forts and <hi>Militia,</hi> into ſuch hands as both Houſes ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
or recommend, unleſs ſuch were named againſt whom He had juſt and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Exceptions. To which His Majeſty replies, That His Offer not giving them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
then, (for they would then limit no time for the <hi>Militia,</hi> which was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that Offer of His Majeſty's) and ſince it ſeems it would give none yet, (for
they now ask no leſs for the Ships than for thoſe, and more for both, as to the time
and other Circumſtances, than He then offered for theſe) and they, by forcing thoſe
Places from Him ſince, and ſome of the Perſons legally veſted in thoſe Places, by their
faithfulneſs to him in this War, having given Him ſo much more cauſe not to yield to it
now, He conceives the caſe to be ſo altered by all theſe differences, that though, out of His
earneſt deſire to ſatisfie them as long as He thought them capable of ſatisfaction by it,
He then intended what He ſpoke, yet He may inſiſt upon what He now inſiſts, without
being ſaid to have receeded from His Word. Did not they refuſe to accept of four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
named in His Majeſty's Bill concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> which themſelves had but newly
offered Him in their Ordinance concerning it? And had thoſe Perſons in that time given
them ſo great cauſe for that refuſal as His Majeſty hath had given Him for this? And yet
will they confeſs that ill Counſel prevail'd with them to recede from their Words, and
that therefore His Majeſty had the more cauſe to be farther ſecured?</p>
                     <p>Their fourth Argument is, That unleſs theſe Limitations be granted, thoſe ſecret
and wicked Councellors, that have been Inſtruments of the preſent Miſeries, will
have the diſpoſing of thoſe Places, and His Majeſty carry but the Name. To this His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
replies, That knowing who have been the Inſtruments of theſe Miſeries, He ſhould
by that believe the ſecret and wicked Councellors ſpoken of, to be the active part of the
cloſe Committee; for if He have any wicked Councellors about him, He confeſſeth they
have cauſe to call them Secret as well as Wicked, ſince they have not only wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
themſelves from Him, but He having often preſs'd to have ſome named, could
never obtain from them the Name ſo much as of one, nor ſince hath heard ſo much as
one proof or charge either of being wicked Councellors, or of any Legal Crime againſt
any of His Servants whom they have named, though they have publiſht them withal
to be incapable of Pardon: However He finds, that if what they ſay were true, the ends
of theſe Councellors and of their violent Party is but juſt the ſame, that is, to diſpoſe of
theſe Places, and that His Majeſty may only carry the Name.</p>
                     <p>But they have found a Letter of His Majeſty's to the Queen, which ſhews that the
great and eminent Places of the Kingdom are diſpoſed of by Her Advice, (and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from Her Religion, that they are by conſequence diſpoſed of by the advice of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and Jeſuits) and that the Perſons there named, even during the ſitting of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are either all impeacht by them, or bear Arms againſt them. To this His Majeſty
replies, Firſt, That He cannot but deplore the condition of the Kingdom, when Letters of
all ſorts, of Husbands to Wives, even of His Majeſty to His Royal Conſort, are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
read, brought in Evidence, and publiſht to the World. Secondly, That if they
will remember how far many of thoſe Perſons of both Sexes, who have received moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
marks of Favour from Her Majeſty, are, even in their own Opinion, from ſo much
as inclining to Popery, they muſt confeſs her Favours and Recommendations not to be
diſpoſed of by Prieſts and Jeſuits. Thirdly, That the Places there named, in which
Her Majeſty's Advice may ſeem to be deſired, are not places (as they call it) of the
Kingdom, but private menial places, a Treaſurer of the Houſehold, a Captain of the
Penſioners, and a Gentleman of the Bed-chamber: That concerning the other more
publick Places, His Majeſty abſolutely declares Himſelf, without leaving room for Her
Advice; which ſeems to prove the contrary to that which by this they intend to prove.
Fourthly, That of the Perſons there named there is not one that either is a Papiſt, or ſo like
one, that a Jeſuit may be thought to have recommended him, nor any one (except the
Lord <hi>Digby</hi>) that was either impeacht or otherwiſe taxt, or that could appear to His
Majeſty to have ever been in any degree diſlik'd by both or either Houſe, before aſſiſting
His Majeſty againſt a Rebellion did lately become Treaſon; and whoever conſiders the
Time and other Circumſtances even of that Impeachment, and that their Eyes were
then ſo dazled with Fears and Jealouſies as to take a Coach and ſix Horſes for an Army
raiſed againſt them, will hardly look upon that Impeachment with that reverence which
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60710:203"/>
hath uſually been paid to Accuſations of that kind. And for their bearing of Arms in
ſuch a Time wherein all His Majeſty's Subjects do either bear or aſſiſt Arms, either for
or againſt Him, He ſuppoſes that it will not be thought ſtrange, if He chuſe Perſons
for ſuch Places as are in His own Diſpoſal, rather out of the firſt Sort than out of the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>And as His Majeſty hath fully anſwered their Obſervations upon His Letters, ſo He
believes that one thing more (though unobſerved by this Declaration) cannot but be
obſerved out of them by His People; and that is, That in His Majeſty's moſt private
Letters to the Perſon neareſt to Him, wherein He cannot (as by ſome in His publick
Declarations He is) be ſuſpected to ſay any thing out of Deſign or Policy, His own clear
perſwaſion that the Rebels, and not He, have been the cauſe, and are the foſterers of
this War and univerſal Diſtraction, and His Senſe of it, and His Deſire of the end of it,
are ſo plainly expreſt, that they will by this Accident be much ſatisfied with His Majeſty's
Innocence and Reality, and believe that the reading this in ſuch a Letter, is the very
next Degree to reading it in His Heart.</p>
                     <p>Their fifth and laſt Argument is, The attempts of Force and Violence againſt the
Kingdom and this Parliament, and they inſtance in four. The firſt is, a Deſign many
years ſince to bring into this Kingdom the <hi>German</hi> Horſe, to compel the Subjects to
ſubmit to an Arbitrary Government. And to this His Majeſty replies, That He eſteems
His Condition more miſerable than that of any of His Subjects, when He ſees a few Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
perſons have obtained that power, as to be able to publiſh to all His People, in the
name of both Houſes, a Charge which (coming forth with the ſemblance of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)
may much work with them againſt Him, and yet do not (which is certainly
becauſe they cannot) tell any one proof or particular either whence, whether, when,
by whom, or by whoſe Deſign theſe Horſe ſhould have been brought. They confeſs it
is many years ſince, and it ſeems it is ſo many that theſe particulars are all worn out of
the memory of man.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, the endeavour to bring up the Northern Army by Force and Violence
to awe the Parliament. To this His Majeſty hath ſo often anſwer'd, and received ſo
little Reply, that He will only now briefly ſay, that according to the Evidence they have
publiſh'd themſelves, (and that before hearing the perſons concern'd in it, after ſo long
a time of the Houſes leiſure and their attendance, whoſe Anſwer it was perhaps feared
would have cleared it more) it doth not appear that there was ever any Endeavour uſed
in it, nor any thing further than a mere motion, which died as ſoon as it was conceived;
and it doth appear that His Majeſty abſolutely diſlik'd it as ſoon as by way of Diſcourſe
it was but named to Him: But if it had been really endeavoured, it had been but an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
towards that which was directly put in Execution by the Tumults, and thoſe
countenanc'd by the Refuſal of the Houſe of Commons, not only to puniſh them, but ſo
much as to joyn with the Lords in a Declaration againſt the like for the future, and by
the ſtopping the legal Proceedings againſt Riots by a ſingle Order of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>The third is, His Majeſty's coming in Perſon to the Houſe of Commons with many
armed men to demand their Members to be delivered up. His Majeſty confeſſeth He
came; He denies that (to His knowledge) He came accompanied with any men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
armed than with His Guard and Penſioners, in the ſame manner as He uſually
came to the Houſe of Lords, and with ſome Gentlemen (as His Train when He goes
to any publick place is always ſo waited on) with their uſual Weapons, their Swords.
And if they had been as careful to publiſh what Perſons of Quality (as Serjeant-Major
<hi>Aſhly</hi> for one) teſtified upon their knowledge and Oath, as what mean, unknown and
unſworn Perſons delivered upon their bare Credit or upon hear-ſay, it would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to His People how little Violence was intended by any who came with Him how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
armed, and what Care He took, and what Orders He gave to be ſure to prevent
any that poſſibly might have happened. His Majeſty likewiſe confeſſes, that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Members He had accuſed of High Treaſon; but puts them withal in mind,
that the Houſe of Commons had hardly left him any other Courſe, having by their ſingle
Order, the night before, intercepted all ordinary proceedings of Juſtice againſt them,
forbidding all Officers to attach any Member for any Crime without the Conſent of the
Houſe, and encouraging the People in that caſe to aſſiſt them againſt any Officer;
though their Privileges had been confeſs'd by a late Petition of both Houſes not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Treaſon; and though this Order were as illegal and unjuſtifiable, as not only His
Majeſty's coming to the Houſe, but even as any thing they would have had the People
believe that He intended when He came. But whatever Breach of Privilege there was in
this, His Majeſty did not offer to juſtifie it by their preceding breach of Law, but offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them often Reparation and Satisfaction for it: but it ſeems nothing but the Ships,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60710:203"/>
Forts, Ports, Magazine and <hi>Militia</hi> of the whole Kingdom would appear to them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for a ſingle, and (this Circumſtance conſidered) perhaps a diſputable, Breach
of Privilege.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is, the Treaſon of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to bring over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to conquer the Kingdom. To this His Majeſty replies, That whatever the Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi> could have ſaid (for this Army He is ſure was never brought, nor, that He ever
heard, was ever endeavoured to be brought over, either to that or any other purpoſe)
His Majeſty cannot ſee why it might not have remained buried with him, or why any
other ſatisfaction ſhould be given for it, or other ſecurity againſt the like, than the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
he hath already undergone.</p>
                     <p>Having given what Reaſons they can to juſtifie their Limitations of His Majeſty's
Propoſitions, this Declaration in the next place attempts to ſatisfie that Reaſon inſiſted
on by His Majeſty, <hi>That it is His Right by Law,</hi> (to which they ſhould have added,
<hi>and contrary to Law forced from Him;</hi>) and not being able to deny that, and yet being
willing to deny ſomething, they quarrel at the Phraſe, and deny that this Power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
theſe Commands is by Law <hi>abſolutely</hi> veſted in His Majeſty, and that becauſe He is
truſted with them for the Defence and Safety of the Kingdom. His Majeſty ſtill juſtifies
what He ſaid Himſelf, and yet confeſſes all that they ſay too, but only denies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
for no Man is abſolutely veſted in any thing, if being truſted with it to ſome
end hinder him from being ſo. The Houſe of Commons is truſted with a Preparatory,
the Houſe of Lords is truſted with a Judicatory, the King, Lords and Commons are
truſted with a Legiſlative Power, and all theſe have thoſe Truſts veſted in them for the
publick Good; and are not yet all theſe Truſts abſolute, that is, ſubject to the Control
of no other Power? Is no Man abſolutely veſted in his Goods, becauſe all we have we
are truſted with for the Glory of God? His Majeſty meant only that this was ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
veſted in Him by Law, as nothing but a new Law could without Breach of Law take
or hold it from Him.</p>
                     <p>But the Declaration is content to admit that too, only denies it to be a Reaſon why
His Majeſty ſhould deny to alter that Law, when by Circumſtance of Time and Affairs
that Power becomes deſtructive to the Commonwealth and Safety of the People, the
Preſervation whereof is the chief End of the Law. And His Majeſty is equally ready to
confeſs that it is no Reaſon, but doth abſolutely deny that this is the Caſe, (inſiſting that
the circumſtances of Time and Affairs hare made this Power more neceſſary than ever to
remain in His Majeſty for the protection and ſafety of His People;) and He claims
Himſelf to be as abſolutely truſted by Law with the final Judgment, whether it be the
Caſe or no, and with a Power of rejecting any ſuch Alteration upon any ſuch Pretence,
if it appear but a Pretence to Him, as either Houſe is truſted to propoſe any ſuch Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to the other, or both to Him, if it appear to them neceſſary and convenient.</p>
                     <p>But, ſays this Declaration, the two Houſes of Parliament being the Repreſentative
Body of the Kingdom, are the moſt competent Judges thereof: And ſays his Majeſty,
the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom is indeed, and that is the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
elſe either the Head is no part of the Body, or at leaſt will be no longer than the
Body pleaſe. Indeed the two Houſes in ſome ſenſe repreſent the Kingdom, in any
Action which the Law (which is the Rule of the Kingdom) hath intruſted and enabled
them to do; but either one Houſe or His Majeſty do equally repreſent it in any thing
which the ſame Law hath entruſted and enabled Him or them to do: And for thoſe
Actions in which the Law requires the Conſent of all three, every one is to be allowed
their own ſeveral diſtinct Judgment, for themſelves only, and any one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two have as much Right as any two without the third, to repreſent the Kingdom,
and to be competent Judges of the Caſe. And His Majeſty cannot be take notice
how much Reaſon He had, not to yield to this Demand, ſince the grant of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
would be received as an Admiſſion of this Caſe, and it would Logically enough
follow, That if His People cannot be ſafe and He retain this Power, He doth not
deſerve to retain any: And if their Demands were granted, and the Armies upon their
Demands disbanded, this Conſequence in all Probability would ſoon be both perceived
and preſt.</p>
                     <p>But His Majeſty may without Prejudice admit both Houſes to be the moſt competent
Judges in this particular, and then put them in mind, that before ſo many things had
been done by the violent Party to turn the Tide of Fears and Jealouſies, before they had
involved the King and Subject in a common Suffering, and equally deſtroyed all the
Property of the one and Prerogatives of the other by Orders and Ordinances, and ſo
there then appeared leſs neceſſity that this Power ſhould remain in the Crown, either
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60710:204"/>
for the preſervation of it Self, or of the People, and little danger appeared to the People
if this Power were thus ſhared; the Houſe of Lords did then twice deliver their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That this Power in His Majeſty was not become deſtructive to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
and Safety of His People, nor the Alteration of this Law neceſſary, by twice
denying to joyn with the Commons in their deſire, That part (for the Ships and the
Time were not then named) of this Power might be ſhared, and of this Law altered:
by which denial the Commons were forced to Petition for it by themſelves. Nor did
they only deny it, but both times in full Houſes, after long and free debates, it was
carried upon the Queſtion above Twenty Voices, and that at a time when all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
Lords had left the Town, and hardly any Biſhops were left uncommitted (Twelve
being at once clapt up upon an Accuſation of Treaſon, which they themſelves have ſince
been aſhamed of enough to wave) who were then the Perſons uſually repreſented to
the People to be the evil Councellors of the Lords Houſe, and to whoſe prevalence it
was imputed in the firſt Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons, that their good and
neceſſary Motions did not paſs in that Houſe. And as they denyed it twice, ſo they
would have denyed it till now, if the Petition of many thouſand poor People about
<hi>London</hi> (who certainly did not then believe the Lords to be competent Judges) and
the Demand of the Houſe of Commons joyned to it, to be told the Names of thoſe Lords
who denyed it, and the direct Threats of ſo many Petitioners (to which the former
Tumults gave ſufficient credit that they would be really executed upon them) had not
made many of the Lords to be of his Mind, who would not diſpute with him who
commanded thirty Legions, and give way to the potent Minor part to appear the
Major, by abſenting themſelves, and ſuffering them to paſs what they pleaſed. So that
neither the Votes which then paſt to deſire theſe particulars, nor the Execution of theſe
Votes and ſeizing theſe particulars with a Violence yet greater than obtained the Votes,
nor the multitude of Conſequences of the ſame kind built upon that Foundation, can
at all be ſaid to have had the Authority of both Houſes; though moſt of thoſe Actions
have been ſuch, as the Authority even of both Houſes, how full and free ſoever, would
not be ſufficient to juſtifie. And this Opinion of the neceſſity of altering the Law in
theſe points, was even then at moſt but the Opinion of the Houſe of Commons, awed
by a few Members aſſiſted by the Common People, and together with them awing the
Lords.</p>
                     <p>They next pretend heartily to wiſh, that the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom may
be the Rule of what is or what is not to be done; but how little fruit hath been gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from this Tree, they ſay let the Experience of the laſt Eighteen years judge. To
this His Majeſty replies, That it is true in ſome ſenſe, they are willing theſe Laws
ſhould be His Rule, that is, that He go no farther (though they will by no means
allow Him to go near ſo far) but almoſt all their Actions, and moſt of their Demands,
and particularly theſe, do ſufficiently ſhew, that they will not admit of theſe Laws and
Statutes to be any Rule to them. And how much better fruit they have graffed than
they found growing, and whether they have not made uſe of the Cure and Remedy of
Grievances, a Parliament, to impoſe more of all kind of Grievances upon the People in
eighteen Months, than can be objected to his Majeſty or Miniſters upon the breach and
in the Intermiſſion of Parliaments during thoſe eighteen years, let Experience be Judge.
And it cannot but appear ſtrange to His Majeſty (if any thing could ſtill appear ſtrange
to Him) that the Illegalities under which His Subjects ſuffered by ſome of His Miniſters
in ſome part of His Reign, ſhould be now, and by them, laid as a Charge upon Him,
when not only the People have ſuffered far greater Illegalities and Preſſures upon the
ſame, if not leſs, pretences, by thoſe who charge Him, with them; but when He hath
by His Acknowledgments, by His ample Satisfactions, by the ſubmitting the Offenders
to Puniſhment, how great or near ſo ever to Him, and by His many and ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
given ſecurity to His People that they ſhall never ſuffer the like under Him;
and when they on the other ſide as good as profeſs to the People, that they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to maintain (and conſequently are likely to continue) what they have
done, becauſe they have done it, and that their Actions ſhall not be retracted, leſt ſome
reflection or diſhonour fall upon both Houſes, and leſt they may ſeem to pronounce a
ſentence of injuſtice and raſhneſs againſt themſelves: This being one of the Reaſons
given by them, why they cannot re-admit the Members they have expelled. And His
Majeſty is confident that His People, when they ſhall conſider both His Miniſters
Actions and theirs, and after compare His Ingenuity with their Principles, will eaſily
conceive under whoſe Government they are moſt likely to return to the known Rule of
the Law, and to find that eaſe, and to be continued in thoſe Rights in and to which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:60710:204"/>
they were born, and of the Exorbitance of whoſe Power they have moſt reaſon to have
any Fears and Jealouſies, and againſt whom they have moſt reaſon to deſire to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
that they ſhall enjoy their Rights.</p>
                     <p>Nor do they with more colour oppoſe His Majeſty's Limitations and Conditions than
they defend their own. They object againſt His Majeſty's Demand or Limitation of
being ſatisfied in His firſt Propoſition, That if His Ships, Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before disbanding, it muſt after be left to the pleaſure of the Papiſts, and other evil
Councellors about His Majeſty, whether thay would disband or not. But His Majeſty
replies, That He made not His Limitation in theſe terms, As ſoon as His firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
ſhould be wholly granted to Him, but, As ſoon as He ſhould be ſatisfied in
His firſt Propoſition; which left room enough upon debate, to have agreed either
upon the time of delivery, or upon ſufficient caution, that after the delivery the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
ſhould unavoidably follow. Nor can His Majeſty look upon this Objection
otherwiſe than as a jeſt, ſince if after the performance of part of the Conditions He had
refuſed to perform the reſt, He is perſwaded that ſo open a breach of Faith would
have given them a far greater ſtrength than they had parted with in the Ships, and
Forts, and have raiſed againſt Him a far greater Army than He ſhould have refuſed to
disband.</p>
                     <p>They object againſt His Demand of the reſtitution of Members, that in His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
no diſtinction is made of Perſons or Offences; when the reaſon thereof is, that
really no diſtinction can be made, they being all equally innocent, and all equally inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
expelled, not only for committing no Crime, but for that Duty and Loyalty
which deſerves both approbation and reward. And if they could make any diſtinction
in this point, or any Objection in any other, which might poſſibly have ſatisfied His
Majeſty, why did they not continue the Treaty, and there offer it to and debate it with
His Majeſty, rather than break off the Treaty without giving any Anſwer to any part of
His Majeſty's Meſſage, and to turn themſelves wholly to the People, from whom no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
could poſſibly be made that might be in order to Peace?</p>
                     <p>They object againſt the Reaſon of this Demand, [That theſe Members have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
only for adhering to His Majeſty] That the ſame Reaſon may be uſed for the
Judges who adhered to Him, by furniſhing Him with great Sums by Illegal Judgments
about Ship-Money and Monopolies; and that He may as well require the Houſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the Impeachments and Proceedings againſt them. To which His Majeſty replies,
That by never having appeared at all in the favour, excuſe, or extenuation of the fault
of thoſe Judges (who are to anſwer for any unjuſt Judgment, in all which His Majeſty
left them wholly to their Conſciences, and whenſoever they offended againſt that, they
wronged His Majeſty no leſs than His People) and by His being yet ſo careful of theſe
Lords and Gentlemen, it may appear that His Majeſty conceives, that thoſe only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to Him, who adhere to Him according to Law. And whether the remaining part of
the Houſes be not more apt to repeal their own Impeachments and Proceedings againſt
thoſe Judges (if they conceive they may be made of uſe, and brought to adhere to them)
then His Majeſty is to require they ſhould, may appear by their requiring in their Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Propoſitions, that Sir <hi>John Brampſton</hi> (impeacht by themſelves of ſo gret Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors)
may be made Chief Juſtice, and by their freeing and returning Juſtice <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
(accuſed by themſelves of High Treaſon) to ſit upon the Bench, rather than free
and imploy Juſtice <hi>Mallet,</hi> who was not legally committed at firſt, but fetcht from the
Bench to Priſon by a Troop of Horſe, and who after ſo many Months Impriſonment
remains not only unimpeacht, but wholly without any knowledge of what Crime he
is ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>They next object againſt the Perſons in whoſe behalf the Demand is made. And to
this His Majeſty replies, That to ſhew how far He was from having raiſed this Army, or
from intending to imploy it to deſtroy this Parliament, or the Act for the continuance
thereof, as is falſely and maliciouſly charged upon him; to avoid the Objection made
againſt him, as if He only pretended to deſire to rule by Law, but would really be the
only Judge of Law Himſelf, and deny all Judgment to both Houſes; to ſhew how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
He was that both Houſes ſhould be the Judges of what belonged to them to Judge,
whenſoever they might be in that full and free condition in which it belonged to them
to be; and to avoid the Deſtruction of the Kingdom, which would be occaſioned by the
delay of Disbanding, if that were not ended before all the preſent Differences; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
propoſed this way of a full and free Meeting in Parliament, and to refer thoſe many
Differences between Him and the remaining part of both Houſes (on which He might
with Juſtice have inſiſted, and which in themſelves were neceſſary to be ſettled) till
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:60710:205"/>
they might be ſettled in that Meeting, and inſiſted for the preſent only upon that
which was neceſſary for the ſetling of ſuch a Meeting. And in ſuch a Convention, if
the Perſons now in queſtion ſhould upon debate have appeared guilty of ſuch Crimes
wherewith this Declaration charges them, as to have deſerted the Houſe, (when into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Tumults and unjuſtifiable Votes drove them from it) to have diſobeyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the Authority of the Houſe, (for not having ſubmitted their Allegiance to that
Authority) to have neglected the Truſt repoſed in them, (for ſtaying no longer where
they could not with freedom diſcharge it) and to have by Practices and Hoſtility
endeavoured to deſtroy both Parliament and People, (for having aſſiſted His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and defended His Perſon againſt an Army raiſed and fighting againſt Him;)
His Majeſty would have been very well contented, if the Houſes ſhould then judge ſo,
that they ſhould have been finally expelled, and that the People might enjoy their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and freedom of Choice and Election, when it ſhould have been juſtly devolved to
them. But by their declining of this courſe, it is evident that they well know, in ſuch
a full and free Meeting, who would appear by moſt voices to be the innocent, and who
the guilty, who the deſerters, and who the drivers, and that then and there they would
as little be able to juſtifie their own Votes as to condemn theſe Perſons; and therefore
having by Force got ſole poſſeſſion of the Place, are wiſely reſolved to admit none to
judge there of what is Law, but only ſuch of the major part of whoſe Judgments they
are ſecure, as having been made inſtruments to violate it.</p>
                     <p>To His Majeſty's demand of ſecurity from ſuch Tumults as formerly awed the Houſes,
they only anſwer, That what is ſaid of awing the Members is a high and dangerous
aſperſion, raiſed without doubt to invalid the Acts and Proceedings of Parliament; but
to the known Particulars urged by His Majeſty they are wholly ſilent; and neither deny
ſuch Tumultuous aſſemblies to have been, nor the Lords to have twice in vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of them, and deſired the Houſe of Commons to joyn with them in a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt them; nor can they deny but the Lords added this Reaſon, <hi>Leſt ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
might be derogatory from the good Acts made and to be made in this Parliament;</hi>
all which Acts nevertheleſs that Houſe undoubtedly did not intend to invalid, either by
that deſire or by that reaſon. Nor can any Man, that hath ſeen what Proteſtations His
Majeſty hath taken, (all which He doth now again renew) for maintaining of the Laws
conſented to by His Majeſty this Parliament, but ſufficiently free His Majeſty from the
aſperſion of having rais'd this to invalid thoſe. But if they mean by their Proceedings,
the Votes, Orders, Ordinances and Declarations, wherewith they have almoſt dayly
oppreſt His Subjects and defamed His Majeſty ſince thoſe Tumults, if they mean the
countenance they have given by perſonal Contributions, by Oaths, by Commiſſions of
Generalſhip and the like, to the preſent Rebellion raiſed againſt Him; He then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
not that He raiſed this Aſperſion, but that He declared this Truth, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the more evident invalidity of their preſent Proceedings, which thoſe Tumults,
(and apprehenſions of the like, and of an Army now in the City to boot) rather than
the inclination of both Houſes, may appear to have produced. And this appears to be
no leſs their Opinion too, by their being ſo infinitely unwilling to ſuffer the Members to
meet in ſo ſecure a manner, that they may be hindred by no awe from declaring to all
the World whether they were awed before or no; and thence the World may judge of
theſe Mens averſion from all Agreement, when in order to ſo bleſſed a thing as Peace,
they refuſe ſo juſt a demand as Security.</p>
                     <p>They next Object againſt adjourning twenty Miles from <hi>London:</hi> And in the firſt place
they object againſt it, That in making that a Condition of Disbanding to which by Law
they are not bound to conſent, His Majeſty requires a new Law by Arms. In which
they are wholly deceived, for His Majeſty never made it a condition: To have Security
for Himſelf and both Houſes from Tumults (which they cannot deny to have been, and
againſt which notwithſtanding they do not offer any other kind of Security) His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
did demand as a Condition, (and Security is undoubtedly His Majeſty's due by
Law) but the Adjournment was only expreſſed as that which His Majeſty only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be the only Security; not but if they could find a better or but another way, His
Majeſty would as readily approve of it. But His Majeſty appeals to the World, whether
His Majeſty ought to have done leſs for His Safety and that of the Members, and the
freedom of their Votes, than to demand Security againſt Tumults; whether He could
do more for Peace, than to be ready to accept any ſufficient Security that they ſhould
offer, and withal to be induſtrious to find out a fit means for that Security Himſelf, and to
propoſe it in ſo large a manner to them, as to leave them to chuſe their own place out of
all the reſt of <hi>England;</hi> and whether on the other ſide they could do leſs toward either,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:60710:205"/>
than not to grant the Security, when they cannot deny the Danger, and not only not
to ſeek after and offer any one way that might ſecure, but ſo abſolutely to refuſe that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
way of Security which is offered to them; whether the inconvenience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
Records twenty miles ought to be in any balance with the Miſeries of a War;
whether the avoiding of this (but tacite) confeſſion of that Truth, (which they call a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
but can never prove one) that His Majeſty was forced for His Safety to withdraw from
His Parliament, (of which the Army raiſed without His conſent, to bring in triumph to
the Houſes Perſons accuſed of High Treaſon by Him, were alone a ſufficient teſtimony)
and that the Members were awed (when their Names were ſometimes demanded, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
poſted, their Perſons laid hands on, and the Tumultuous multitude neither puniſh'd
nor diſcountenanc'd ſo much as by a Declaration;) whether the fear leſt <hi>London</hi> (in which
and by a part of which all this was done) ſhould ſeem to ſuffer under a Charge; and laſtly,
whether the Doubt, leſt in any place out of <hi>London</hi> His Majeſty ſhould again come to
the Houſe of Commons with armed men, (upon what appearance of Right, after what
orders againſt his known Right, and with how little either intention, offer or colour of
Violence He came thither, having been ſhewed before) can appear a ſufficient Reaſon
for their Reſolution againſt ſuch an Adjournment, in order to the publick Peace: and
whether, although there were no neceſſity of it but His Majeſty's Deſire, (Who out of
compliance with them hath put the abſolute Power out of His own hands, not only of
Adjourning the Parliament whither, but of Diſſolving it when He pleaſed) it might not
ſeem no unreaſonable Requeſt after ſo large a Grant.</p>
                     <p>Their third part is, to prove His Majeſty's averſion to Peace by ſeveral Circumſtances.
The firſt is, His having denied to receive their Petitions: which His Majeſty never did.
For if they mean (which was all He ever did towards any refuſal) His refuſing to
receive any from or by any Perſon accuſed of High Treaſon by Him, (when
they had other and more direct ways of ſending to Him (as they did then by the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> if they had not gone out of their way out of deſire to have it refuſed) they
may as well ſay, He hath refuſed all that have ever ſince come to Him from them, for
He continued always to make that Exception: and if their hope of preſent and total Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
had not made them inſiſt upon that before <hi>Edge-hill</hi> which they quitted after, the
Petition offered to have been ſent from my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from the head of his Army
had been then received too by any other kind of hand; though, if His Majeſty were
rightly informed of the Contents of that Petition, neither their offer of ſuch a Petition
could ſhew any inclination to Peace in them, nor could His abſolute reſuſal have ſhewed
any averſion to it in His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, That their Committee muſt not, without a ſpecial ſafe Conduct and
Protection from Him, have Acceſs to Him; a Liberty incident to them not only as
Members of the Parliament, and employed by both Houſes, but as they were free-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
To this His Majeſty replies, That He never denied their Committee to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to Him without a ſafe Conduct, nor did He ever ſo much as mention any to them.
The firſt motion concerning a ſafe Conduct, was in a Letter from the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi>
Speaker <hi>pro tempore</hi> of the Lords Houſe, to either of His Majeſty's Secretaries, dated the
third of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1642. deſiring one for that Committee, which after attended His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
at <hi>Colebrook;</hi> and the ſame was again deſired for the Committee appointed to treat
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> Speaker of the ſame Houſe, to the
Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> dated the 28. of <hi>February.</hi> And muſt it not ſeem ſtrange to all the
World, that His Majeſty's granting of that which both Houſes in order to the Treaty ask'd
of Him, ſhould be after charged upon Him as a provocation laid in the way to interrupt
or break off the Treaty? And ſince undoubtedly (and that reaſonably) it would have
been interpreted averſion in His Majeſty from Peace, if He had denied this when it was
as'd; His condition was very hard, when, it ſeems, He could not either way have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
this imputation, whether he had denied or granted it. But His Majeſty deſires
His Subjects to conſider the great difference between what His Majeſty hath cauſe to
complain of, and what they do. Maſter <hi>Alexander Hampden,</hi> imployed by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
with an Olive-branch, a Meſſage for Peace directed to both Houſes, incloſed in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Speaker of the Lords Houſe, having His Majeſty's paſs, teſtifying that He was ſo
employed, having delivered this Meſſage to the Lords Houſe, and that Houſe having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it as a gracious Meſſage, is committed by the Houſe of Commons (notwithſtanding
the liberty of acceſs ſaid to be incident to all free-born Subjects) for not having a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
from their General, upon pretence of an Order of that Houſe but lately made, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
paſt the Lords, nor publiſh'd by themſelves: and notwithſtanding that the Lords at a
Conference deſired the Meſſengers releaſe upon the aforeſaid reaſons, and that he was ſent
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60710:206"/>
to them, and that their own Meſſengers had divers times of late gone to <hi>Oxford</hi> in the ſame
manner, and none of His Majeſty's had come otherwiſe, yet the only Anſwer returned was,
<hi>That they would ſtand to their own Order.</hi> Upon which His Majeſty cannot but obſerve,
Firſt, that how great Authority ſoever both Houſes expect to have with His Majeſty, yet
one Houſe hath but a little with the other: Secondly, That the Privilege of that Houſe
is as little conſidered as their Interceſſion, ſince undoubtedly, if the Lords (who in many
caſes have power to commit, which the Houſe of Commons hath not over more than their
own Members, in any caſe but of breach of Privilege) had committed a Meſſenger ſent
to the Houſe of Commons (eſpecially from any to whoſe Meſſengers they paid half that
reſpect which they owe to His Majeſty's) upon an Order only of their own Houſe, and
having committed him without their conſents, ſhould not releaſe him at their deſire, it
would have been look'd upon by them as no leſs a breach of Privilege than His Majeſty's
coming to their Houſe: Thirdly, That by this His Majeſty hopes that the Violent party
doth now ſee better times are not far off, ſince He is told by this very Declaration, That
<hi>evil Spirits do then rage moſt, when they think they muſt be cast out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The grounds of their third and fourth (for ſuch as have been taken notice of by the
bye, and replied to before, need not to be repeated) are theſe. During the Treaty two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
iſſued at <hi>Oxford</hi> againſt Aſſociations, and raiſing of Forces and Taxes by virtue
of Ordinances, in which His Majeſty charges a Traitorous and Rebellious Army of <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> (but not both Houſes, as, for want of being charged,
they charge themſelves) to endeavour to take away His Life, and the Religion and Laws
of the Kingdom. And ſome Letters were intercepted, by which, they ſay, it probably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to them, that His Majeſty had then deſigns upon <hi>Killingworth, Scarborough</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol.</hi>
But His Majeſty thinks it ſtrange that it ſhould be expected, that this Treaty
ſhould have ſo much influence on one ſide, and ſo little on the other; that during the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Taxes may be illegally laid and levied, and His Majeſty may not legally forbid them;
that Souldiers of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army daily rail againſt Epiſcopacy, break into
Churches, pull down Organs and Monuments, tear Surplices and Common-Prayer-Books,
and His Majeſty may not call them <hi>Browniſts;</hi> that that Army may go on daily during the
Treaty in overt acts of Rebellion and Treaſon, and it muſt be an Interruption of the Treaty
in His Majeſty to call them Rebels and Traytors; that He may not ſay they endeavour to
take His Life, who have ſhot at Him as often as He hath come within Cannon-ſhot of them;
and that the Treaty ſhould not oblige them from taking any Town or Caſtle of His Majeſty's
from Him, and yet His Majeſty be obliged by it neither to regain any of His Towns, nor
receive any of His own Caſtles; that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> may really take <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and
<hi>Tukesbury,</hi> and His Majeſty muſt not ſo much as think of <hi>Scarborough</hi> or <hi>Briſtol;</hi> upon which
City as His Majeſty doth avow to have had a Deſign to recover it from the Rebels, ſo He
abſolutely denies it to have been either bloody or barbarous, Epithets which they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give it, but for what reaſon He cannot imagine, His Majeſty abhorring all thought
of what is printed at <hi>London,</hi> That it was intended, Man, Woman and Child ſhould have
been all killed in that Town, that had not ſuch a Word or wore not ſuch a Ribband:
though ſome Word or Mark might well be agreed on, not with intention to kill all that
had it not, but that more particular care might be taken of their protection that had it,
not only from all danger, but from all diſreſpect. But the execution upon cold blood of
ſome of the principal Citizens of that City for their Loyalty to His Majeſty upon a ſingle
Order, without the leaſt colour of any Legal proceedings, will appear to all men moſt
barbarous and bloody, and ſuch a Murther as His Majeſty muſt not leave unrevenged, nor
can His Subjects look upon otherwiſe, than as purpoſely now committed to make Peace
yet more impoſſible, and as an earneſt of that intolerable Arbitrary Government, which they
muſt always expect to ſuffer under, if that Violent party ſhould prevail.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore, notwithſtanding theſe frivolous Objections, His Majeſty's Deſire of
Peace (by His earneſtneſs for it both before, and during, and after the Treaty) doth ſo
fully appear; and ſince their inclination to the contrary, (by their moſt earneſt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
endeavours to hinder both the beginning, continuance, and renewing of the Treaty)
is no leſs evident; ſince in the Treaty His Majeſty's main aim was the immediate disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Armies, and that Differences might be debated in a full and free Convention
in Parliament, and that to that end the Parliament might be reſtored to the natural and
genuine Condition, and all things only reſtored into that ſtate wherein they were when
the Houſes were full and free; ſince His Majeſty ask'd nothing that they could deny to
be due to Him by Law, and His Majeſty denied nothing that themſelves could claim
by Law to belong to them, nor any one thing of that publick neceſſity or value as
deſerves the ſhedding of one drop of that Sea of Blood, which will be ſpent in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60710:206"/>
natural Quarrel; ſince His Majeſty made the laſt moſt reaſonable Propoſition, and they
will never ſuffer it to be granted nor debated, and three Meſſages of His Majeſty's can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
obtain one Anſwer; His Majeſty hopes that the ſcales will now fall from the eyes of
His moſt blindly-ſeduced Subjects, and they will now be able do diſcern both their
Duty and their Intereſt by ſo clear a Light, that it will be no longer in the power of
this Violent party to ingage them to be Wicked that they may be Miſerable, and by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Juſtice to deſtroy Peace. And His Majeſty doth moſt earneſtly conjure thoſe
whoſe fault hath hitherto proceeded rather from want of heat than want of light, who
out of too much care of their private ſafety have been either lookers on, or have at once
diſlik'd and countenanc'd theſe Courſes, that they at laſt rouze up their Courage to take
part with their Conſcience, and fear to be Damned more than to be Plundred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that if they will deſert and oppoſe that Party whom their Tameneſs only makes
conſiderable, and unite themſelves with but half that induſtry to defend His Majeſty, and
the Religion and Law eſtabliſht, which the others uſe to deſtroy them all, they may avoid
the One, and be in no danger of the Other, their numbers being ſuch, that if they once
but knew one another, by meerly joyning to appear to think as they do they might
ſpeedily end this (truly ſtyled by them) the worſt kind of War, both as it is of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
againſt <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of Subjects againſt their Prince. But if they ſhall ſtill ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be carried away with the Stream, they will by that ſuffer the Power of the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
party to take ſo deep a root (by being ſeized of all the Arms, Ships, and ſtrong
places of the Kingdom) that if they ſhould happen to prevail in this War againſt His
Majeſty, they will (in deſpight not only of them, but of their preſent Rulers, if they
ſhould be willing to divert them) extirpate the Law Root and Branch, alter the whole
frame of Government, introduce Democracy, Independence and Parity, and leave nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King, Church nor Gentleman: And (beſides that they will then appear to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
guilty of this intolerable Innovation which they have not timely enough oppoſed)
this Party will then forget that they did not oppoſe them at all, and remember that they
did aſſiſt them but a little, will diſtinguiſh between thoſe who aſſiſted them out of Zeal
and out of fear; and who are now call'd Moderate, they will then call Malignant, and
the Inequality, Injuſtice and Oppreſſion they will then indure, will too late diſcover to
them to their Coſts, that they have undone themſelves with too much Diſcretion, and
obtain'd nothing by their unjuſtifiable cautious Compliance but to be deſtroyed laſt.</p>

deſperate Counſels and Actions, and have forborn to cenſure or charge the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Members remaining, by whoſe Orders and Authority the evils have been
pretended to be done, well hoping that the Senſe of the miſerable Diſtractions of the
Kingdom, would at length have brought them to diſcern where they had erred, and
Our often Meſſages and Complaints of the Violence offered to Us, and to the Members
of both Houſes, would have procured Juſtice and Redreſs, and that the Power and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

Force and Violence ſo taken away and ſuppreſſed, that We might in a full and peaceable
Convention of Parliament, with the Advice of that Our great Council, have ſo ſetled
the preſent Diſtempers, that there might be no fear left of the like for the future. But
finding to Our great grief, that the Power of thoſe Seditious Perſons who firſt contrived
theſe deſperate and bloody Diſtractions continues ſo great, That as they have driven
and now keep Us and the much greater part of both Houſes from being preſent at that
Council, ſo they ſo far awe thoſe who remain there, that they cannot with freedom
give their Votes and Reſolutions according to their Conſciences, and the Laws and
Conſtitutions of the Kingdom: That the Members of both Houſes have been compelled
to make Proteſtations to live and die with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the General of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Army, and other unlawful and Treaſonable Proteſtations, and that ſuch who

wholeſome Government of that City, and have promiſed themſelves the deſtruction of

what Concluſions and Reſolutions they pleaſe; That they take upon them to juſtifie
this Rebellion againſt Us, and have preſumed, under pretence of the Order of both
Houſes, to invite Foreign Forces to invade this Kingdom; to ſend Agents to Foreign
Princes, to negotiate and treat with them in their own Names; to impriſon Our good
Subjects contrary to Law, prohibiting Our Judges to grant <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> according to
Law; to introduce a new Clergy throughout the Kingdom, by diſplacing Godly
Learned Divines, without the leaſt colour of Law or judicial Proceedings, and putting
ignorant Seditious Preachers in their Places, to poiſon the hearts of the People; to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the vilifying of the Book of Common-Prayer eſtabliſhed by the Law of the
Land; to ſeize, levy, and take away what they pleaſe of the Eſtates and Fortunes of
Our Subjects, by diſpoſing of the Twentieth Part of their Eſtates, by exhauſting them
with inſupportable Weekly Taxes, for the maintainance of their Rebellious Army, and
by endeavouring to lay odious Exciſes upon Victuals, Goods and Merchandize of Our
People for the ſame purpoſe, whilſt they ſuffer Our poor Proteſtant Subjects of Our
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe defence was undertaken by Our two Houſes, and that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

or neceſſitated to deſert that Kingdom for want of Money, Victual and ſuch
other neceſſaries as were to be provided for them by Act of Parliament, out of thoſe
Moneys, which they have ſpent to deſtroy Us and this Kingdom; by exacting from
Merchants Tonnage and Poundage, and other Impoſitions upon Merchandizes as well
Native as Foreign, contrary to an Act made this preſent Parliament, with a penalty of
<hi>Praemunire,</hi> on thoſe who ſhall pay or receive it it: And laſtly, that they have (after
the breaking of the late Treaty by a peremptory recalling the Committee, who in truth
during their abode with Us had no Power to Treat, by reaſon of their ſtrict Limitation)
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:60710:207"/>
ſo far rejected all poſſible means and Overtures of Treaty and Accommodation, that
inſtead of anſwering our gracious Meſſages, the Houſe of Commons hath impriſoned
Our Meſſenger ſent by Us to them to invite both Houſes to an Accommodation, and
eſpecially to move them to take ſuch a courſe for the freedom of Parliament, that We
might ſafely adviſe with that Our great Council for the ſetling thoſe miſerable Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
and have maliciouſly and in contempt of Us (and after an attempt to Murther
Her at <hi>Burlington</hi>-Road, the place of Her Landing) impeached Our Royal Conſort of
High Treaſon, for aſſiſting Us with Arms and Ammunition to defend Us from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:
'Tis time now to let Our good Subjects know, that they may no longer look
upon the Votes and Actions of the Perſons now remaining as upon Our two Houſes of
Parliament, Freedom and Liberty to be preſent, and of Opinion and Debate there, being
eſſential to a Parliament; which Freedom and Liberty all Men muſt confeſs to be taken
away from this Aſſembly, when they remember the great Tumults brought down to
awe and terrifie both Houſes, and that they were then brought down when any great
Debate was in either Houſe, and not like to be ſo carried as ſome Seditious Perſons who
governed thoſe Tumults did deſire; that in the greateſt heat and fury of thoſe Tumults
the principal Governors amongſt them directed the unruly People to go to <hi>White-hall,</hi>
where Our own Perſon then was, and deſigned by Force to have ſurpriſed the Perſon of
Our Son the Prince; that when it was deſired that a Declaration might be made againſt
ſuch Tumults, inſtead of conſenting thereunto, the Tumults themſelves were juſtified,
and when a Legal courſe was preſcribed by the Lords, and taken by the proper Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Juſtice, to ſuppreſs and prevent ſuch Tumults and Riots, that Legal courſe
was ſuperſeded by thoſe who were then preſent of the Houſe of Commons, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Juſtice puniſhed and impriſoned for executing the Law; when they remember
that ſeveral Members of either Houſe have been threatned and aſſaulted in thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and their own Names proſcribed as Perſons diſaffected, becauſe they freely uſed to
ſpeak their Conſciences in both Houſes; that the Houſe of Peers have been ſo far threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and menaced, that the Names of thoſe have been with Threats demanded by the
Houſe of Commons at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, who refuſed to conſent to this or
that Propoſition which hath been in debate before them, and Tumultuous Petitions coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
which have been preſented to that ſame purpoſe; that the Members of both
Houſes have been impriſoned and forbid to be preſent at thoſe Councils, for no Reaſon
but becauſe their Opinions have not been liked; that Our Negative Voice (Our
greateſt and moſt ſoveraign Privilege) is boldly denied; that a preſumptuous Attempt
hath been made by the major part of the remaining part of the Houſe of Commons to
make Our Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> the making of which by the expreſs Letter of the
Law is High-Treaſon, and would ſubvert the ancient and fundamental Adminiſtration
of Juſtice; that at this time We and the major part of both Houſes are kept by a ſtrong
and Rebellious Army from being preſent at that Council, and that thoſe who are preſent
are by the ſame Army awed and forced to take unlawful and Treaſonable Proteſtations
to engage their Votes; and that ſuch Reſolutions and Directions which concern the
Property and Liberty of the Subject are tranſacted and concluded by a few Perſons
(under the Name of a Cloſe Committee, conſiſting of the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Say,</hi> Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hampden,</hi> Maſter <hi>Stroud,</hi> Maſter <hi>Martin,</hi> and others, the
whole number not exceeding ſeventeen Perſons) without reporting the ſame to the
Houſes, or having the ſame confirmed by the Houſes, contrary to the expreſs Law
and Cuſtoms of Parliament. All which for the matter of Fact We are ready to make
proof of, and deſire nothing but to bring the Contrivers of all the aforeſaid Miſchiefs to
their Tryal by Law; and till that be ſubmitted to, We muſt purſue them by Arms
or any other way, in which all our good Subjects ought to give Us aſſiſtance to
that purpoſe: The imagining the Death of Us, Our Royal Conſort, or Our Eldeſt
Son, the Levying War againſt Us in Our Realm, or adhering to Our Enemies in Our
Realm, giving to them Aid or Comfort, the counterfeiting Our <hi>Great Seal</hi> or Money,
being by the expreſs Words of the Statute of the 25 Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the J. Chap. 2.
High Treaſon. And how applicable this is to thoſe who have actually born Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Us, and to thoſe who have conſented that ſuch Arms be born, to thoſe who have
promiſed to live and die with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and thoſe who every day conſent to
ſome Act for the ſupport and encreaſe of that Army, We ſhall leave to all the World to
judge; and hope that this gracious Warning and Information now given by Us will
make that impreſſion in the Hearts of Our People, that they will no longer ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be miſ-led from their Duty and Allegiance upon any pretences whatſoever. And
We do declare, That We ſhall proceed with all ſeverity againſt all Perſons whatſoever
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60710:208"/>
who ſhall henceforward aſſiſt, vote or concur in any kind toward the maintaining
or countenancing ſuch Actions and Reſolutions, which by the known and expreſs Laws
of the Land are High Treaſon, and againſt all thoſe who ſhall adhere to them who are
in Rebellion againſt Us, as againſt Rebels and Traitors, in ſuch manner as by the Laws
and Statutes of the Realm is directed and appointed. And ſince by the Power of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Perſons We and both Houſes are kept from being ſecured againſt Tumultuous
Aſſemblies, and both Houſes from Adjournment to ſome place of Safety, which being
done might quickly make an end of theſe miſerable Diſtractions, whereby We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from the benefit and advice We expected from that Our great Council, the
Members thereof being ſcattered into ſeveral places; therefore that the whole Kingdom
may ſee that We are willing to receive Advice from thoſe who are truſted by them,
though We cannot receive the ſame in the place to which they were called, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
aforeſaid, nor intend to receive Advice from them elſewhere in the capacity of
Houſes of Parliament, We do hereby declare, that ſuch of the Members of both Houſes,
as well thoſe who have been by the Faction of the Malignant Party expelled for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their Duties to Us, and into whoſe Rooms no Perſons have been ſince choſen
by their Countries, as the reſt who ſhall deſire Our Protection, ſhall be welcome to Us
at Our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> until by the Adjournment of the Houſes to ſome fit and free
place, or otherwiſe due courſe be taken for the full and free Convention in Parliament of
Us and all the Members of both Houſes. And for their better encouragement to reſort
to Us, We do hereby Will and Command all the Officers and Souldiers of our Army, to
ſuffer all ſuch Perſons who are Members of either Houſe, with their Attendants and
Servants, to come to Us to this Our City of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And that none of Our good
Subjects may believe that by this Our neceſſary Declaration againſt the Freedom and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of that preſent Aſſembly, We may have the leaſt intention to violate or avoid any
Act or Acts paſſed by Us for the good and benefit of Our People this Parliament, we
do hereby declare to all the World, That We ſhall, as We have often promiſed, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerve all thoſe Acts, as if no ſuch unhappy Interruption had happened of the
Freedom and Liberty in that Council; and deſire nothing more than to have ſuch a free
Convention in Parliament, that we may add ſuch further Acts of Grace as ſhall be
thought neceſſary for the Advancement of the true Proteſtant Religion, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the preſervation of the Liberty,
Freedom and Privileges of Parliament. And that all the World may ſee how willing
and deſirous We are to forget all the Injuries and Indignities offered to Us by ſuch who
have been miſled through Weakneſs or Fear, or who have not been the principal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of the preſent Miſeries, We do offer a free and general Pardon to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of either Houſe, (except <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick, Edward</hi>

The Grounds and Motives inducing His MAJESTY to
agree to a Ceſſation of Arms for one Year with the Roman
Catholicks of IRELAND.</head>
                     <p>AS there hath been no Argument with which the Minds and Affections
of Our People have with more Subtilty and Malice been infected and
corrupted, by the great Authors and Contrivers of this unnatural and
odious Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> than with the groſs and ſenſeleſs Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Our neglect of Our poor Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo there
is no Calumny of theirs againſt which We can with more Confidence,
Clearneſs and Integrity juſtifie Our Self and all Our Actions before God and Man.
We will not now trouble Our Self with the remembring Our ſeveral Meſſages and
Importunities to Our two Houſes of Parliament in that buſineſs; Our offer to engage
Our own Royal Perſon in that War, and the ſcornful rejection of that offer; Our
conſenting to all Propoſitions and Acts propoſed to Us for the raiſing of Men or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of Money for that Service, till it was evident that Men and Money being raiſed
under pretence of quenching the Rebellion there, were both imployed in kindling and
maintaining the Rebellion here; Our granting a Commiſſion to Perſons named by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
for the managing the Affairs of that Kingdom, according to Inſtructions drawn by
themſelves, not one of which have been obſerved by them: We ſhall have occaſion of
publiſhing all theſe particulars in a full and clear Narration to the World, that all Our
good Subjects may ſee that the ſame Men (and only they) who have brought all theſe
Miſeries and Calamities upon them here, have been the Promoters (if not the Contrivers)
of the Miſeries of their Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by preventing thoſe Remedies, and diverting
that Aſſiſtance which, being ſeaſonably applyed, might have eaſed that poor People of
many of thoſe Calamities they have ſince endured. But for the preſent We ſhall
only (being to publiſh the Articles of Ceſſation agreed on Our behalf by the Perſons
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60710:209"/>
truſted by Us in that Kingdom) let Our good Subjects brieſty know the Grounds and
Circumſtances of that Treaty and Concluſion.</p>
                     <p>About the Month of <hi>November</hi> laſt (after We had been advertiſed, as well by Our
Council-board of that Kingdom, as ſeveral Petitions and Remonſtrances of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Commanders and Officers of Our Army, of the miſerable condition of Our Forces
there, by the extream want of Money, Victuals and Ammunition; of which they were
ſo far from being like to receive ſupply from Our two Houſes here, who had undertaken
to defray thoſe Charges, that We had had too ſad experience, that both the Money raiſed
by Act of Parliament, and the Men raiſed by Our own Commiſſion for that purpoſe,
were imployed againſt Us in that Rebellious Army, which not long before had given Us
Battle) a ſhort Petition was ſent to Us by the Lords Juſtices and Council of that Kingdom,
which they had received in the name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
directed to Us, in which nothing was deſired of Us, but that We would appoint ſome
Perſons to hear what they could ſay for themſelves, with many expreſſions of Duty
and Submiſſion to Us. Shortly after, in the end of that Month, or beginning of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
the Committee for <hi>Ireland</hi> attended Us at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſet forth by their Petition,
<hi>That all paſſages by which Comfort and Life ſhould be conveyed unto that gaſping Kingdom
ſeemed totally to be obſtructed, and that unleſs timely Relief were afforded, Our Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there must yield their Fortunes a prey, their Lives a ſacrifice, and their Religion a
ſcorn to the mercileſs Rebels.</hi> Hereupon We granted a Commiſſion to ſome Perſons of
Honour and Truſt to meet and confer with ſuch Perſons as the Rebels ſhould imploy,
but without power to conclude any thing, or with other Authority than only to receive
ſuch Propoſitions as they ſhould make, and to derive the ſame to Us. The meeting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Commiſſion produced little effect, in ſo much that the Lieutenant-General of
Our Army there (whom We truſted principally in that Commiſſion) being <hi>unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Cavils and Proceedings of the Rebels,</hi> in <hi>February</hi> marched out with 2500.
Foot and 500. Horſe, to force Victual and Proviſion from them for the ſubſiſtance of
Our Army; in which Expedition he performed thoſe good ſervices which are known to
moſt men: ſo that all men may obſerve, the diſcourſe or expectation of a Treaty
cauſed Us not to omit any opportunity which was offered for Our advantage.
No ſucceſs of Our Army there (though God bleſſed it then with a very great
Victory) could ſupply thoſe extreme wants they ſuffered, by not having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any Relief either of Money or Victual in above four Months from hence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords, Juſtices and Council by their Letter of the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> ſignified unto
Us, <hi>That the State and Army there were in very terrible want of means to ſupport a War,
and that unleſs ſupplies of Money, Munition, Arms, Cloaths, and other Abiliments of
War were ſpeedily ſent thither, there was little hope to eſcape utter Deſtruction and Loſs
of the Kingdom.</hi> And by their Letter of the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> after mentioning how often
and how much in vain they had recommending their condition to the Two Houſes, they
told Us plainly, that unleſs the ſupplies then mentioned in their Letters to the Speaker
of the Houſe of Commons, (a Copy of which was ſent to Us) were forthwith ſent to
them, <hi>That Our Army would be forced through wants to disband or depart the Kingdom,
and that there would be nothing to be exſpected there but the inſtant Loſs of the Kingdom,
and the destruction of the remnant of Our good Subjects yet left there.</hi> In ſtead of any
redreſs or relief according to theſe Letters, ſuch Ships as were by the care and charity
of well-affected Perſons provided to tranſport Cloths and Victual to them, were in their
Voyage thither ſeized, and taken by the Ships under the Command of the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
and in ſtead of endeavours to ſend more Forces thither, attempts were made
to draw the <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces from thence into this Kingdom. So that We
thought Our Self bound in Duty and Conſcience, ſince it was not in Our power
otherwiſe to preſerve that Kingdom from utter Ruine, at leaſt to admit any Expedient,
which with God's bleſſing might be a means to preſerve that People; and therefore We
directed the Lord Marqueſs <hi>Ormond</hi> (whom for his Courage, Affection and Loyalty, We
had made Our Lieutenant-General of that Our Army, and who having gotten ſo many
notable Victories upon the Rebels, was very well approved of by the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
to agree on Our behalf to ſuch a Ceſſation of Arms with the Rebels, as upon
his underſtanding and knowledge of the condition of Our affairs there ſhould be thought
reaſonable. This Ceſſation was concluded on the 15. day of <hi>September</hi> for one whole
year; and the Articles thereof, printed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> were ſent to Us by Our Lords Juſtices
and Council, and arrived here on Saturday laſt, with a Letter from them to one of Our
Secretaries, expreſſing the <hi>great ſufferings of Our Army there, through want of relief out
of</hi> England. We have thought fit with this true and plain relation to publiſh the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:60710:209"/>
according to the Copy ſent Us, that all Our good Subjects may ſee how We have
proceeded herein. What opinion the principal Perſons as well of Our Council as the Officers
of Our Army there have of this Ceſſation, may appear by the Teſtimony which We have
cauſed to be Printed after the Articles, with their names who have ſet their hands to the
ſame. And let all Our good Subjects be aſſured, that as We have for theſe Reaſons, and
with this Caution and deliberation, conſented to this Preparation to Peace, and to that
purpoſe do continue Our Parliament there; ſo We ſhall proceed in the accompliſhing
thereof with that care and circumſpection, that We ſhall not admit even Peace it ſelf,
otherwiſe than as it may be agreeable to Conſcience, Honour and Juſtice.</p>

By the King A Proclamation for the Aſſembling the Members of both Houſes at Oxford,
upon occaſion of the Invaſion by the Scots.</head>
                     <p>VVHereas We did by our Proclamation, bearing date the twentieth day of <hi>June</hi>
laſt, upon due conſideration of the Miſeries of this Kingdom, and the true
Cauſe thereof, warn all Our good Subjects no longer to be mis-led by Votes, Orders,
or pretended Ordinances of One or Both Houſes, by reaſon the Members do not
enjoy the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament, which appears by ſeveral inſtances of
Force and Violence, and by the courſe of their Proceedings mentioned in Our ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
and ſeveral of Our Declarations; ſince which time Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi>
have made great and Warlike preparations to enter and invade this Kingdom with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and have already actually invaded the ſame, by poſſeſſing themſelves by force of
Arms of Our Town of <hi>Berwick,</hi> upon pretence that they are invited thereunto by the
deſires of the two Houſes: the which as We doubt not all Our good Subjects of this
Kingdom will look upon as the moſt inſolent Act of Ingratitude and Diſloyalty, and
to the apparent breach of the late Act of Pacification ſo ſolemnly made between the
Kingdoms, and is indeed no other than a deſign of Conqueſt, and to impoſe new Laws
upon this Nation, they not ſo much as pretending the leaſt Provocation or Violation
from this Kingdom; ſo We are moſt aſſured that the major part of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
do from their Souls abhor the leaſt thought of introducing that Foreign Power,
to increaſe and make deſperate the Miſeries of their unhappy Country: And therefore
that it may appear to all the World how far the major part of both Houſes is from ſuch
Actions of Treaſon and Diſloyalty, and how groſsly thoſe few Members remaining at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have and do impoſe upon Our People, We do Will and require ſuch of the
Members of both Houſes, as well thoſe who have been by the Faction of the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
party expelled for performing their Duty to Us, and into whoſe rooms no Perſons
have been ſince choſen by their Country, as the reſt who have been driven thence, and
all thoſe who being conſcious of their want of Freedom now, ſhall be willing to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from that Rebellious City, to aſſemble themſelves together at our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
on Munday the twenty ſecond day of <hi>January,</hi> where care ſhall be taken for their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Accommodations, and fit places appointed for their meeting, and where all Our
good Subjects ſhall ſee how willing We are to receive Advice for the Preſervation of the
Religion, Laws and Safety of the Kingdom, and, as far as in Us lyes, to reſtore it to its
former Peace and Security, (Our chief and only end) from thoſe whom they have
truſted, though We cannot receive it in the place where We appointed. And for the
better encouragement of thoſe Members of either Houſe to reſort to Us, who may be
conſcious to themſelves of having juſtly incurred Our Diſpleaſure by ſubmitting to or
concurring in unlawful Actions, and that all the World may ſee how willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
We are to forget the Injuries and Indignities offered to Us, and by an Union of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Hearts, to prevent the laſting Miſeries which this Foreign Invaſion muſt bring
upon this Kingdom, We do offer a free and General Pardon to all the Members of either
Houſe, who ſhall at or before the ſaid twenty ſecond day of <hi>January</hi> appear at Our City
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and deſire the ſame, without Exceptions: which conſidering the manifeſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
committed againſt Us, and the Condition We are now in, improved, by God's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
bleſſing, to a better degree than We have enjoyed at any time ſince theſe Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is the greateſt inſtance of Princely and Fatherly Care of Our People that can be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and which malice it ſelf cannot ſuggeſt to proceed from any other Ground. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
We hope and are confident, that all ſuch who upon this our gracious Invitation will not
return to their Duty and Allegiance, ſhall be no more thought Promoters of the Religion,
laws and liberty of the Kingdom, (which this way may be, without doubt, ſetled and ſecured)
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:60710:213"/>
but Perſons engaged from the beginning, out of their own Pride, Malice and Ambition,
to bring Confuſion and Deſolation upon their Country, and to that purpoſe (having
long ſince contrived the Deſign) to invite and joyn with a Foreign Nation to ruine and
extinguiſh their own, and ſhall accordingly be purſued as the moſt deſperate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Enemies of the Kingdom. And Our pleaſure is, That this Our Proclamation
be read in all Churches and Chapels within this Our Kingdom, and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>

and not ſate ſtill while our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> were tranſported with a dangerous
and fatal miſ-underſtanding, that the Reſolution now taken among them for an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into <hi>England</hi> is agreeable to their obligation by the late Treaty, and to the
Wiſhes and Deſires of this Kingdom, expreſſed by the two Houſes of Parliament; we
have thought it neceſſary to let your Lordſhips know, That if we had diſſented from
that Act, it could never have been made a Law: And when you have examined and
conſidered the Names of us who ſubſcribe this Letter (who, we hope, are too well
known to your Lordſhips, and to both Kingdoms, to be ſuſpected to want Affection to
Religion, or to the Laws and Liberties of our Country, for the Defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of which we ſhall always hold our Lives a cheap Sacrifice,) and when you are
informed that the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Thanet,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Stafford, Stanhope, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,
Goring,</hi> and <hi>Craven,</hi> are in the parts beyond the Seas, and the Earl of <hi>Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
Westmorland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> of <hi>Boughton,</hi> under reſtraint at <hi>London</hi> for
their Loyalty and Duty to His Majeſty and the Kingdom; your Lordſhips will
eaſily conclude how very few now make up the Peers at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there being in
truth not above five and twenty Lords preſent or privy to thoſe Councils, or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſent, conſenting or concurring with them; whereas the Houſe of Peers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of above one hundred, beſides Minors and Recuſant Lords, neither of which
keep us company in this Addreſs to your Lordſhips. How we and the major part
of the Houſe of Commons come to be abſent from thence, is ſo notorious to all the
World, that we believe your Lordſhips cannot be ſtrangers to it; How ſeveral times
during our ſitting there, Multitudes of the meaneſt ſort of People, with weapons not
agreeing with their condition or cuſtom, in a manner very contrary and deſtructive
to the privilege of Parliament, fill'd up the way between both Houſes, offering Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
both by words and actions to, and laying violent hands upon, ſeveral Members,
and crying out many Hours together againſt the eſtabliſhed Laws, in a moſt tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and menacing way; How no remedy would be ſubmitted to for preventing thoſe
Tumults: After which, and other unlawful and unparliamentary Actions, many things

Threats and Menaces reſumed, altered and determined, contrary to the Cuſtom
and Laws of Parliaments; and ſo, many of us withdrew ourſelves from thence, where
we could not Sit, Speak and Vote with Honour, Freedom and Safety, and are now
kept from thence for our Duty and Loyalty to our Sovereign. And we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Lordſhips by our common Allegiance and Subjection under one gracious Sovereign, by
the Amity and Affection between the two Nations, by the Treaty of Pacification,
which by any ſuch Act is abſolutely diſſolved, and by all Obligations both Divine and
Humane which can preſerve Peace upon earth, to uſe your utmoſt endeavours to prevent
the effuſion of ſo much Chriſtian blood, and the Confuſion and Deſolation which muſt follow

the unjuſt Invaſions of this Kingdom, which we and, we are confident, all true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
men muſt interpret as a Deſign of Conqueſt, and to impoſe new Laws upon us.
And therefore your Lordſhips may be aſſured we ſhall not ſo far forget our own Intereſts
and the Honour of our Nation, as not to expoſe our Lives and Fortunes in the juſt and
neceſſary defence of the Kingdom. But if your Lordſhips in truth have any doubts
or apprehenſions that there now is, or hereafter may be, a purpoſe to infringe your
Laws or Liberties from any Attempt of this Kingdom; we do engage our Honours
to your Lordſhips, to be our ſelves moſt religious obſervers of the Act of Pacification,
and if the Breach and violation do not firſt begin within that Kingdom, we are moſt
confident you ſhall never have cauſe to complain of this. And having thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Our ſelves to your Lordſhips, we hope to receive ſuch an Anſwer from you as
may be a means to preſerve a right underſtanding between the two Nations, and lay an
Obligation upon us to continue</p>

A Declaration of the Lords and Commons of Parliament aſſembled at Oxford, of their
Proceedings touching a Treaty for Peace, and the Refuſal thereof; with the ſeveral
Letters and Anſwers that paſſed therein.</head>
                     <p>IF our moſt earneſt Deſires and Endeavours could have prevailed for a Treaty, our
Proceedings therein, without this Declaration, would have manifeſted to all the
World the clearneſs of our Intentions for the reſtoring the Peace of this Kingdom: But
ſeeing all the means uſed by Us for that purpoſe have been rendred fruitleſs, we hold
our ſelves bound to let our Countries know, what in diſcharge of our Duty to God
and to them we on our parts have done ſince our coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to prevent the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effuſion of Chriſtian blood, and the Deſolation of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having by His Proclamation, upon occaſion of the Invaſion from <hi>Scotland</hi>
and other weighty reaſons, commanded our attendance at <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the 22. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
laſt, there to adviſe Him for the preſervation of the Religion, Laws and Safety of
the Kingdom, and to reſtore it to its former Peace and Security; theſe Motives, with
the true ſenſe of our Countries Miſeries, quickned our duty to give ready obedience
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60710:214"/>
to thoſe His Royal Commands, hoping (by God's bleſſing) to have become happy
Inſtruments for ſuch good Ends. And upon our coming hither, we applyed our ſelves
with all diligence to adviſe of ſuch means as might moſt probably ſettle the Peace of this
Kingdom, (the thing moſt deſired by His Majeſty and our ſelves:) And becauſe we
found many gracious offers of Treaty for Peace by His Majeſty had been rejected by the
Lords and Commons remaining at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> we deemed it fit to write in our own
names, and thereby make tryal, whether that might produce any better effect for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
our deſires and our Countries Happineſs. And they having (under pain
of Death) prohibited the addreſs of any Letters or Meſſage to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but by their
General, and we conceiving him a Perſon who (by reaſon of their truſt repoſed in him)
had a great influence into and Power over their Proceedings, reſolved to recommend it
to his Care, and to engage him in that Pious Work, with our earneſt deſire to him to
repreſent it to thoſe that truſted him, (to prevent all exceptions and delay:) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the 27. of the ſame <hi>January,</hi> diſpatched a Letter away under the hands of the
Prince His Highneſs, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and of 43. Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts
and Barons of the Houſe of Peers, and 118. Members of the Houſe of Commons there
preſent, (many others of us by reaſon of diſtance of place, ſickneſs and imployments in
His Majeſty's Service, and for want of timely notice of the Proclamation of Summons;
not being then come hither:) which Letter we cauſed to be incloſed in a Letter from the

                           <p>HIS Majeſty having by His Proclamation of the 22. of <hi>December</hi> (upon the occaſion
of the Invaſion threatned, and in part begun, by ſome of His Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi>)
ſummoned all the Members of both Houſes of Parliament to attend him here at <hi>Oxford;</hi>
we, whoſe Names are under-written, are here met and Aſſembled in obedience to thoſe His
Majeſty's Commands. His Majeſty was pleaſed to invite us in the ſaid Proclamation by
theſe gracious expreſſions. [<hi>That His Subjects ſhould ſee how willing He was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Advice for the preſervation of the Religion, Laws and Safety of the Kingdom, and,
as far as in Him lay, to reſtore it to its former Peace and Security, (His chief and only
end,) from thoſe whom they had truſted, though He could not receive it in the Place
where He appointed.</hi>] This moſt gracious Invitation hath not only been made good
unto us, but ſeconded and heightned by ſuch unquestionable Demonstrations of the deep
and Princely ſenſe which poſſeſſes His Royal Heart of the Miſeries and Calamities of His
poor Subjects in this unnatural War, and of His most entire and paſſionate Affections to
redeem them from that ſad and deplorable condition, by all ways poſſible conſiſtent either
with His Honour or with the future Safety of the Kingdom, that, as it were Impiety to
queſtion the Sincerity of them, ſo were it great want of Duty and Faithfulneſs in us, (His
Majesty having vouchſafed to declare, that He did call us to be Witneſſes of His Actions,
and privy to His Intentions,) ſhould we not teſtifie and witneſs to all the World the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
we have of the Piety and ſincerity of both. We being moſt entirely ſatisfied of this
truth, we cannot but confeſs that, amidſt our higheſt afflictions in the deep and piercing
ſenſe of the preſent Miſeries and Deſolations of our Country, and thoſe farther Dangers
threatned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> we are at length erected to ſome chearful and comfortable
thoughts, that poſſibly we may yet (by God's Mercy, if his Juſtice have not determined this
Nation for its Sins to total Ruine and Deſolation) hope to be happy Inſtruments of our
Countries Redemption from the Miſeries of War, and reſtitution to the Bleſſings of Peace.
And we being deſirous to believe your Lordſhip (howſoever ingaged) a perſon likely to be
ſenſibly touched with theſe conſiderations, have thought fit to invite you to that part in this
bleſſed Work, which is only capable to repair all our miſfortunes, and to buoy up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Ruine; that is, by conjuring you by all the Obligations that have Power upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Conſcience or publick Piety, that laying to heart as we do, the inwardly-bleeding
condition of your Country, and the outward more menacing Deſtruction by a Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the very point of invading it, you will co-operate with us to its Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by truly repreſenting to, and faithfully and industriouſly promoving with thoſe
by whom you are trusted, this following most ſincere and most earnest deſire of ours;
That they joyning with us in a right ſenſe of the past, preſent, and more threatning
Calamities of this deplorable Kingdom, ſome perſons be appointed on either part, and
a place agreed on, to treat of ſuch a Peace as may yet redeem it from the brink of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>

are met, moſt graciouſly proclaiming Pardon to all without exception, is evidence enough
that His Mercy and Clemency can tranſcend all former Provocations, and that He hath
not only made us witneſſes of His Princely Intentions, but honoured us alſo with the name

                           <opener>May it pleaſe Your MAJESTY,</opener>
                           <p>WE the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> taking into
our Conſideration a Letter ſent from Your Majeſty, dated the third of <hi>March</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and directed to the Lords and Commons of Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
(which by the Contents of a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> unto the Lord General, the Earl
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> we conceive was intended to our ſelves) have reſolved, with the concurrent advice
and conſent of the Commiſſioners of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to repreſent to Your Majeſty
in all humility and plainneſs as followeth:</p>
                           <p>That as we have uſed all means for a juſt and ſafe Peace; ſo will we never be wanting
to do our utmost for the procuring thereof: But when we conſider the Expreſſions in that
Letter of Your Majesty's, we have more ſad and diſpairing thoughts of attaining the ſame
than ever; becauſe thereby thoſe Perſons now aſſembled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who, contrary to their
Duty, have deſerted Your Parliament, are put into an equal Condition with it; and this
preſent Parliament, convened according to the known and Fundamental Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
(the continuance whereof is establiſhed by a Law conſented unto by Your Majeſty,) is
in effect denied to be a Parliament: The Scope and Intention of that Letter being to make
proviſion how all the Members (as is pretended) of both Houſes may ſecurely meet in a full
and free Convention of Parliament: Whereof no other concluſion can be made, but that this
preſent Parliament is not a full nor free Convention, and that to make it a full and free
Convention of Parliament, the preſence of thoſe is neceſſary who, notwithſtanding that they
have deſerted that great Truſt, and do levy War againſt the Parliament, are pretended to
be Members of the two Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                           <p>And hereupon we think our ſelves bound to let Your Majeſty know, That ſeeing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of this Parliament is ſettled by a Law (which, as all other Laws of Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Your Majesty hath ſworn to maintain, as we are ſworn to our Allegiance to Your
Majesty, theſe obligations being reciprocal,) we muſt in duty, and accordingly are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with our Lives and Fortunes, to defend and preſerve the Just Rights and full
Power of this Parliament: And do beſeech Your Majeſty to be aſſured, that Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Royal and hearty Concurrence with us herein will be the moſt effectual and ready
means of procuring a firm and laſting Peace in all Your Majeſty's Dominions, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
a perfect underſtanding between Your Majeſty and Your People; without which
Your Majeſty's moſt earneſt Profeſſions and our moſt real Intentions concerning the ſame
muſt neceſſarily be fruſtrated. And in caſe Your Majeſty's three Kingdoms ſhould, by
reaſon thereof, remain in this ſad and bleeding Condition, tending, by the continuance of
this unnatural War, to their Ruine; Your Majeſty cannot be the leaſt, nor the laſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.
God in his goodneſs incline Your Royal Breaſt, out of pity and compaſſion to thoſe
deep Sufferings of Your Innocent People, to put a ſpeedy and happy iſſue to theſe deſperate
Evils, by the joynt Advice of both Your Kingdoms now happily united in this Cauſe by their
late ſolemn League and Covenant. Which as it will prove the ſureſt Remedy, ſo is it the
earneſt prayer of Your Majeſty's Loyal Subjects, the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the
Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>Whoſoever conſiders that this ſhould be a Letter from Subjects, might well think it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unbeſeeming Language in them, to call His Majeſty's earneſt endeavours for Peace but
<hi>Profeſſions,</hi> and their own feigned pretence <hi>moſt real Intentions,</hi> but much more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing
Language, that <hi>is Majeſty cannot be the leaſt, or laſt Sufferer;</hi> which expreſſions
from Subjects in Arms to their Soveraign, what dangerous Conſtruction they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
we are unwilling to mention.</p>
                     <p>But we need not wonder at the manner of their expreſſions, when we ſee in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Parliament it ſelf, as far as in them lies, deſtroyed, and thoſe who here ſtyle
themſelves the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> not to
reſolve upon their Anſwer to their King, without the concurrent advice and conſent of
the Commiſſioners, as they call them, of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If they had only taken the Advice of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners, they had broken the
Fundamental Conſtitution of Parliament; the very Writs of Summons, the Foundation
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60710:217"/>
of all Power in Parliament, being in expreſs terms for the Lords to treat and adviſe with
the King and the Peers of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and for the Commons to <hi>do and
conſent</hi> to thoſe things which by that Common-Council of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ordained,
thereby excluding all others.</p>
                     <p>But their <hi>League,</hi> it ſeems, is gone further; the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt <hi>conſent</hi> as well as adviſe,
ſo that they have gotten a negative voice, and they, who in the former Letter would
be the Kings only Council, are now become no Council without the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners:
The truth is, they have (beſides the ſolemn <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> with the
<hi>Scots,</hi> which their Letter mentions, a ſtrange and traitourous preſumption, for Subjects
to make a <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>League</hi> with Subjects of another Kingdom without their Prince)
made private bargains with the <hi>Scots</hi> touching our Eſtates, and a private agreement not
to treat without their conſent, as ſome of themſelves being afraid of a Treaty openly
declared to the Common-Council of <hi>London:</hi> And therefore 'tis no wonder, that being
touched to the quick with the apprehenſion that they are not, nor can be in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
a full and free Convention of Parliament, they charge us with deſerting our Truſt,
and would have us to be no Members of the Parliament. They may remember it was
our want of freedom within, and the ſeditious Tumults without, their many multiplied
Treaſons there, and impoſing traitourous Oaths, which inforced our abſence: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that and the want of freedom in Parliament we ſhall ſay no more here, (that
being the Subject of another Declaration) only we wiſh them to conſider by what Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws of the Kingdom (which they have lately wreſted to ſerve all turns) they
can exclude us from our Votes in Parliament, who were duely ſummoned, choſen and
returned Members of Parliament, and take in thoſe of another Kingdom to their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
who are not bound by our Laws.</p>
                     <p>But what violation ſoever they make of the Laws, they are forward to put the King in
mind of His Duty; and therefore tell Him, That He is ſworn to maintain the Laws,
as they are ſworn to their Allegiance to Him, theſe Obligations being reciprocal. It
is true in ſome ſenſe, that the Oath of the King and Subjects is reciprocal, that is, each
is bound to perform what they ſwear, the King as well as the Subjects; but he that
will well weigh their Letter, and make one part have connexion with the other, and
examine that part of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereby they ſwear they will defend the Kings
Perſon and Authority no further or otherwiſe than in preſervation of their Religion and
Liberties, may eaſily find another conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Subjects Allegiance
is no longer due than the King performs His Duty, nay, no longer than He in their
opinion obſerves His Duty, whereof they themſelves muſt be Judges; and if He fail
in His Duty, they may take up Arms againſt Him: A Principle which as it is utterly
deſtructive to all Government, ſo, we believe, they themſelves dare not plainly avow
it, leſt as they now make uſe of it againſt the King, ſo the People finding their failure
of Duty and breach of Truſt, ſhould hereafter practiſe it by taking up Arms againſt
them, and ſo ſhake of that yoak of Tyranny impoſed by their fellow Subjects which
lies ſo heavy upon them. It were well as they ſtill preſs upon the King maintenance
of the Laws, they would alſo know that their Obligation to obſerve the ſame is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal;
and while they here reſolve to defend and preſerve the full Power of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
(which in their ſenſe can be no other than the Power they have exerciſed this
Parliament) they would take notice that they are therein ſo far from obſervation of the
Laws, that they deſperately reſolve an utter ſubverſion of them: For what can more
tend to the deſtruction of the Laws, than to uſurp a Power to themſelves without
the King, and againſt His will to raiſe Arms, to attribute to their Orders or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Ordinances the power of Laws and Statutes, to inforce Contributions, Loans
and Taxes of all ſorts from the Subject, to impriſon without cauſe ſhewed, and then
prohibit Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for their enlargement, to lay Exciſes upon all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
to command and diſpoſe of the Lives and Eſtates of the free-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Kingdom at their pleaſure, to impoſe Tonnage and Poundage; contrary
to the Law declared in the late Act for Tonnage and Poundage; and all this done
and juſtified as by a legal civil Power founded and inherent in them? All which
are manifeſt breaches of the Petition of Right and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the great Evidence of
the Liberties of <hi>England;</hi> which Charter by expreſs words binds them and us, though
aſſembled in Parliament, as well as the King: And though it be not now, as heretofore
it hath been, taken by ſolemn Oath on the Peoples part as well as on the Kings, nor a
Curſe, as heretofore, pronounced on the Violators; yet they having taken a Proteſtation
to maintain the Laws, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, and incluſively
that Charter, let them take heed, whilſt they make uſe of this their pretended Power
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60710:217"/>
to the deſtruction of the Law, leſt a Curſe fall upon them and upon their Poſterity.
God knoweth, and it is too certain a truth, that our ſelves and many other good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in this Kindom, even under the Power of the Kings Army, have ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
in Liberty and Eſtates, during this preſent Rebellion, by many heavy Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
the ſad conſideration whereof makes our hearts bleed, becauſe we can ſee no way
for relief, ſo long as this unnatural Rebellion continues: But as theſe things were firſt
practiſed by them, and thereby neceſſitated upon the Kings Army; ſo it was never yet
pretended that they were done by virtue of a Law, but either by Conſent, or by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and unavoidable exigences of War, and to expire with the preſent Rebellion,
which God in mercy haſten. For our parts, we have the inward comfort of our own
Conſciences witneſſing with us, that we have improved all opportunities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
for the reſtoring of this Kingdom to its former Peace; and we muſt witneſs for
His Majeſty His moſt hearty deſires thereof: And though both His Majeſty
and our endeavours therein have been made fruſtrate, yet God in his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath raiſed up our ſpirits, not to deſert our Religion, our King, our Laws, our
Lives, the Liberties of us <hi>Engliſh</hi> free-born Subjects; and, by God's aſſiſtance and His
Majeſty's concurrence, we do reſolve to unite our ſelves as one Man, and cheerfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
our Lives and Eſtates for the maintenance and defence of the true Reformed
Proteſtant Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (of which we profeſs our ſelves to be,)
for the defence of the Kings Perſon and Rights of His Crown, for the regaining and
maintaining the Rights and Privileges of Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subjects
Perſon and Property of his Eſtate, according to the known Laws of the Land, to repel
thoſe of the <hi>Stotiſh</hi> Nation, that have in a warlike manner entred this Realm, and to
reduce the Subjects thereof now in Rebellion to the Kings Obedience. And we doubt
not but the ſame God will enlighten the eyes of the poor deceived People of this Land,
like true-hearted honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, to joyn unanimouſly with us in ſo juſt and pious
a work. And the God of Heaven proſper us, according to the goodneſs of the Cauſe
we have in hand.</p>

                     <head>The Declaration of the Lords and Commons of Parliament aſſembled at Oxford
according to His MAJESTY'S Proclamation, Concerning their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
ſince they came thither for the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Reaſons, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
their Abſcence from Weſtminſter.</head>
                     <p>VVE the Lords and Commons of Parliament, being upon juſt and important
reaſons abſent from the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whither we were Legally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or ſent by the Power and Authority of His Majeſty's Writ, when He ſummoned
His Parliament, and being by His gracious Proclamation of the two and twentieth day
of <hi>December</hi> convened at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with full liberty to preſent our humble Advice to His
Majeſty, for the preſervation of the Religion, Laws and Safety of the Kingdom; thought
it moſt agreeable to our Duty to God, our zeal and tenderneſs of His Majeſty's Honour
and Safety, and our Affection and Compaſſion of the bleeding condition of our miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Country, to uſe our utmoſt and earlieſt endeavours to prevent the effuſion of more
Chriſtian <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood, and to cloſe thoſe Wounds through which this Kingdom is in
danger, in a ſhort time, to languiſh even to Deſolation. And finding the ill ſucceſs which
had attended all the Overtures of Treaty and Accommodation made by His Majeſty;
His Majeſty's moſt gracious Meſſage from <hi>Nottingham</hi> being with ſo much contempt
rejected, which being ſent by Members of both Houſes, thoſe Meſſengers were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to deliver it as Members, or to ſit in the Houſe whilſt the ſame was debated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Privilege of Parliament; and that to the two laſt Meſſages ſent by Him, of
the twelfth of <hi>April,</hi> and nineteenth of <hi>May,</hi> (in both which are moſt gracious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of His Princely and paſſionate inclinations to Peace, as may appear by thoſe Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
herewith again re-printed,) there hath not been the leaſt Anſwer returned to His
Majeſty;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Hampden.</note>
 but on the contrary His Meſſenger impriſoned, and to this day detained, and
an Order that on pain of Death none ſhould preſume to come thither from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
upon what buſineſs ſoever, without leave from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> in purſuance of
which Order,<note place="margin">Dan. Kniveton.</note>
 though the ſame paſſed only the Commons, a ſworn Meſſenger of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
hath been barbarouſly put to death for carrying a Legal Writ to <hi>London:</hi> we thought
any addreſs for Peace would moſt ſucceſsfully paſs through His hands, and that when
<note n="*" place="margin">He.</note>
 we had conſidered how unhappily he had been made an Inſtrument of ſo much Blood
and Devaſtation, he would with great chearfulneſs have interpoſed in a buſineſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and at leaſt have met us half way in ſo bleſſed a Work; and therefore, with
His Majeſty's leave, (which He moſt readily and graciouſly gave us, and for which we
doubt not He ſhall receive the Thanks and Prayers of all His good Subjects) we direct
a Letter to that purpoſe to him, ſigned under our hands. Whoſoever reads that Letter
(and we hope it will be read by all men) will bear us witneſs (and it will be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt thoſe who have rejected it,) that we have done our parts. In ſtead of
vouchſafing us any Anſwer, or propoſing us any other way towards Peace, (if that
which we propoſed was not thought convenient,) he writes a ſhort Letter to the Earl
of <hi>Forth,</hi> General of His Majeſty's Army, acknowledging the receipt of ours, but ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>it neither having Addreſs to the two Houſes of Parliament, nor therein there
being any acknowledgement of them, he could not Communicate it to them;</hi> whereas the
Addreſs was in the way preſcribed, (preſcribed under pain of Death, no Addreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allowed, as aforeſaid, but by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>) and he being deſired to repreſent
to and promove with thoſe by whom he is truſted our moſt ſincere and earneſt deſire
of a Treaty: ſo that if there had been the leaſt inclination to or enduring of an
Overture of Peace, he might have as eaſily communicated it to all thoſe by whom he is
inſtruſted as to a Committee, by whoſe Advice ('tis well known) his Anſwer
was ſent, and with it, and as part of it, a Paper intituled, <hi>The Declaration of
the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, and, <hi>A Declaration of the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland,
and another, <hi>A ſolemn League and Covenant;</hi> the Declarations and Covenant being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King of both Kingdoms, without the conſent of and againſt the major part of
the Nobility, and we are confident the Gentry and Commonalty, of This. And if his
Lordſhip would make good his own Letter, and <hi>ſpend his Blood,</hi> or but uſe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
for the maintenance of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> being indeed the foundation
whereupon all Our Laws and Liberties are ſupported, we ſhould not Treat at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
at leaſt a Treaty would not have been rejected. We ſuffered not Our Selves to
be diſcouraged with this refuſal, but a ſafe Conduct was deſired for two Gentlemen
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60710:219"/>
(againſt whom there neither was nor could be the leaſt exception) to go to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
to preſent ſuch Propoſitions as might beſt conduce to the Peace of the Kingdom;
conceiving that by ſuch means our meaning and intentions might beſt appear, and all
formalities and unneceſſary inſiſting and miſtakes upon words might be removed.
This ſafe Conduct (which hath never been denied by His Majeſty, or His Generals,
to any perſon who hath deſired to have admittance to Him,) was likewiſe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſed by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> yet with ſome expreſſions, <hi>That if any Propoſitions
ſhould be ſent to thoſe by whom he was intruſted, he would uſe his utmoſt endeavours
to advance the Peace:</hi> which though it ſeem'd nothing agreeable to his former An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
obtained yet ſo much credit with us, that we beſought His Majeſty once
more in His own Royal Name to preſs and deſire a Treaty, and to direct His
Meſſage under ſuch a Title, that they who call themſelves the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
could not take any Exception, but ſhould be compelled to return ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
or other. And an Anſwer it hath drawn from them, but ſuch an one as will
ſufficiently inform the World (if there could yet have remained any doubt of it)
how much they are Enemies to Peace. Thoſe <hi>Anſwers, Declarations,</hi> and that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
are likewiſe publick to all men: God and the World muſt judge between us.
In the mean time we muſt, without bitterneſs or ſharpneſs of Language, (to which
neither example or provocation ſhall tranſport us) tell theſe men, That moſt of us
are too well known, even to themſelves, to be ſuſpected to incline to be either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
or Slaves, or that we can poſſibly be made Inſtruments to advance either Popery
or Tyranny. And ſince the defence of the Religion, Laws and Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſeems to be (and in truth is on our part) the Argument of this bloody Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and that we are endeavouring all ways to deſtroy one another in the behalf
of that we all do or all pretend to deſire; we think our ſelves obliged to Truth, to
the preſent Age, and to Poſterity, to let the World know, That as we are much
more tender of the Religion, Laws and Liberty of the Kingdom, than of our Lives and
Fortunes; ſo the uneaſie Condition wherein we are, and the heavy Judgments and
Proſcriptions impoſed on us by our Equals, have proceeded and been cauſed from that
Conſcience, Loyalty and Duty in which we have been Born and Bred, and from which
we could not ſwerve without the manifeſt breach of our Allegiance, and thoſe civil
Oaths we are obliged by: As, we hope, will appear to all men by this our enſuing
Declaration.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall paſs over (only acknowledging His Majeſty's abundant care and favour
to His People) thoſe excellent Laws made this Parliament for the vindication and
removal of thoſe Miſchiefs and Inconveniences which ſeemed to threaten our
Rights and Liberty, to all which there are very few amongſt us who concurred not
fully, (however we are now traduced with the negligence of both;) and that moſt
gracious Offer of His Majeſty, to conſent to an Act for the eaſe of tender Conſciences
in matters indifferent, which if it had been accepted, would have prevented many of the
Miſeries have ſince beſallen this poor Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Name and Privilege of Parliament is pretended in defence of thoſe
Actions which are done contrary to the known Laws, (by which only Right and
Wrong can be meaſured and determined,) and by that venerable Name many of our
Companions and Friends have been led into unwarrantable Actions; before we come
to conſider the ſtate and condition of the Religion, Laws and Liberty of the Kingdom
by theſe Diſtractions, we ſhall let the World know, how much the inherent and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Privileges of Parliament have been violated; how we (being called by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and truſted by our Country with their Suffrages in that Council) hath been driven,
and are now kept from the place whither we were firſt called by His Majeſty, and
where ſome Members ſtill ſit; and laſtly, how far this miſerable and (to ſay no more)
this unjuſtifiable Civil War, and this deſperate and odious Invaſion of a Foreign Power
to invade this Kingdom, is from having the Countenance, Authority and Approbation
of the two Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The great Induſtry and ill Arts uſed by thoſe who have ſince been principal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the preſent Rebellion, to bring in Perſons of their Faction into the Houſe of
Commons; the admitting and receiving ſuch who were neither lawfully choſen nor
lawfully returned by their Country, and the putting and keeping out others whoſe
Opinions were not liked; the reprehending, reproaching and impriſoning of Members
for ſpeaking freely according to their Conſciences in matters in debate; the poſting
and ſetting up mens Names in publick places, and proſcribing them as Enemies to their
Country, who diſſented in the Houſes in opinion in matters debated, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60710:220"/>
plained of, no reparation granted; the ſitting at unparliamentary hours, thereby wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
and tiring many Members from attendance, and ſo in a thin Houſe altering and
reverſing the reſolution taken in a full Houſe; the refuſing to receive and ſuppreſſing
Petitions againſt Perſons in favour, though in point of Bribery and corruption in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory,
and the like of other Petitions from whole Counties for the preſervation of the
Government of the Church,<note place="margin">As in the caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> Lord Privy-Seal.</note>
 as from <hi>Notinghamſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſeſhire,</hi> whilſt others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it were received with great countenance and approbation, from mean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
People; the getting with great labour and Faction ſeveral hands to Petitions from
Counties, and then framing new Petitions at <hi>London,</hi> and annexing the hands former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gotten in the Country to thoſe Petitions, of which they who ſubſcribed their hands
know nothing, as in the Petition of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and the ſetting names in <hi>London</hi>
to Petitions in the name of, as if they had been ſubſcribed in remote Counties; the
uſurping of Juriſdictions to ſuperſede Acts of Parliament, and to diſpenſe with the
breach of Laws in force; the ſuffering undutiful and diſloyal language againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Perſon of the King, without ſo much as Reprehenſion, and the denying His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Negative Voice; we inſiſt not ſo much on, (though very prejudicial and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to the Privileges and Honour of Parliament) as on thoſe Acts of Force and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
which are contrary and deſtructive to the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after His Majeſty returned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being a very long debate
in the Houſe of Commons concerning an unparliamentary <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the People <hi>of the State of the Kingdom,</hi> (which many of us then thought might
prove prejudicial to the Peace thereof) Captain <hi>Venne,</hi> then a Member of the Houſe
of Commons, (who had before bragged of having brought down the People upon
the two Houſes, and ſo drawn Reſolutions from them,) ſent Notes in writing under
his Hand into the City, that the People ſhould come down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for that
<hi>the better part of the Houſe was like to be over-powered by the worſer part:</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both at that time and ſome days after, Multitudes of the meaneſt ſort of people,
with weapons not agreeing with their condition or cuſtom, in a manner very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and deſtructive to the Privilege of Parliament, filled up the way between both
Houſes, offering Injuries both by words and actions to, and laying violent hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſeveral Members, proclaiming the Names of ſeveral of the Peers, as <hi>evil and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Lords,</hi> crying out many hours together againſt the eſtabliſhed Laws in a moſt
tumultuous and menacing way. This action of Captain <hi>Venne</hi>'s was complained of to
the Houſe of Commons, and Witneſſes offered to prove it; a fellow who had aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and reproached a Member of the Houſe of Commons in thoſe Tumults was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, and ſhewed to the Houſe, in the number of thoſe who brought a Petition
to the Bar: and yet in neither of theſe caſes Juſtice, or ſo much as an Examination,
could be obtained. Upon a ſuggeſtion and pretence of Danger, and ſuit made to His
Majeſty, a Guard was allowed and appointed by Him for the Security of both Houſes:
ſhortly after this Guard was refuſed and diſcharged by themſelves, and a new Guard ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by them without His Majeſty's Conſent, thereby to awe all thoſe who concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not with them. A legal Writ iſſuing out by the direction of the Houſe of Peers
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to prevent thoſe Tumults which daily infeſted both
Houſes, the Juſtices of the Peace, for executing that Writ according to their Oaths,
were impriſoned by the Houſe of Commons. A Commiſſion under the Great Seal of
<hi>England,</hi> for enquiry after Riots committed in <hi>Southwark,</hi> was likewiſe ſuperſeded by
an Order of the Houſe of Commons: and when the Lords deſired by ſeveral Meſſages,
that the Houſe of Commons would joyn with them in a Declaration againſt Tumults,
they refuſed, or neglected to joyn with them, it being ſaid by Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> in the Houſe
of Commons, <hi>God forbid we ſhould diſhearten our Friends who came to aſſiſt us.</hi> And
albeit ſome of the Lords profeſſed, that if the People were again drawn down in that tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
manner, they would no more come to the Houſe; and albeit an Order was
made, that in ſuch a caſe the Houſe ſhould be preſently adjourned; yet thoſe Tumults
again appearing, that Order, though urged by ſeveral Lords, was not ſuffered to be executed.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Commons having deſired the Houſe of Peers to join with them in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
His Majeſty that the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdom might be put into ſuch hands as both
Houſes did confide in, and this deſire having been put to the Queſtion, and carried nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
by much the major part of the Lords; it being again reſumed at another time (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the courſe of Parliament) the debate was begun with a Declaration made by ſeveral
of thoſe Lords againſt whom that Queſtion was twice carried by Votes, (and that by
much the major part) that <hi>whoſoever refuſed in this particular to joyn with the Houſe of
Commons, were in their opinions enemies to the State;</hi> words deſtructive from the Liberty
and Freedom of debate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="425" facs="tcp:60710:220"/>
During the time that this buſineſs of the <hi>Militia</hi> was in debate, (that is, before it had
the approbation and conſent of the Houſe of Peers) a Petition in a tumultuous manner
was delivered to the Houſe of Lords, in the name of the <hi>Knights, Gentlemen, Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and others the Inhabitants of the County of</hi> Hartford, reckoning up the cauſes of
the preſent Fears, Troubles and Diſtractions, and amongſt them the want of Compliance
in that Honourable Houſe with the Houſe of Commons, in entertaining thoſe many good
motions, and paſſing thoſe neceſſary Bills preſented to them from that Houſe for the
publick good, and deſiring liberty to proteſt againſt all thoſe as Enemies to the publick
who refuſed to joyn with the Honourable Lords whoſe endeavours were for the publick
good, and with the Houſe of Commons, for the putting the Kingdom into a poſture of
Safety under the Command of ſuch perſons as the Parliament ſhould appoint. Several
Petitions of the ſame nature, particularly one under the Title of the <hi>Knights, Gentlemen,
Free-holders, and other Inhabitants of the County of</hi> Surrey, directed to the Houſe of
Peers, concluded with this cloſe, <hi>That they ſhould be in duty obliged to mantain their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
ſo far as they ſhould be united with the Houſe of Commons in their juſt and pious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;</hi>
ſufficiently intimating that if they joyned not with the Houſe of Commons,
they then meant as much as others had plainly profeſſed. About the ſame time, a Citizen
ſaying at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>That they heard there were Lords who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to conſent and concur with them, and that they would gladly know their names,</hi> or words
to that effect: a Petition in the name of many thouſand poor People, in and about the City
of <hi>London,</hi> was directed to the Houſe of Commons, taking notice of <hi>a malignant Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that made abortive all their good motions which tended to the Peace and Tranquillity
of this Kingdom,</hi> deſiring that <hi>thoſe noble Worthies of the Houſe of Peers, who concurred
with them in their happy Votes, might be earneſtly deſired to joyn with that Honourable
Houſe, and to ſit and Vote together as one entire body;</hi> and profeſſing that <hi>unleſs ſome ſpeedy
remedy were taken for the removing all ſuch Obſtructions as hindred the happy progreſs of their
great Endeavours, their Petitioners ſhould not reſt in quietneſs, but ſhould be forced to lay
hold on the next remedy which was at hand, to remove the diſturbers of the Peace, and</hi>
(Want and neceſſity breaking the bounds of Modeſty) <hi>not to leave any means uneſſayed
for their relief;</hi> laſtly, adding, <hi>that the cry of the poor and needy was, that ſuch Perſons
who were the obſtacles of their Peace, and the hinderers of the happy proceedings of this
Parliament, might be forthwith publickly declared, whoſe removal they conceived would put
a period to thoſe Diſtractions.</hi> And this Petition was brought up to the Houſe of Lords
by the Houſe of Commons at a Conference: And after, the ſame day, Maſter <hi>Hollis,</hi> a
Member of the Houſe of Commons, in a Meſſage from that Houſe, preſſed the Lords at
their Bar to joyn with the Houſe of Commons in their deſire about the <hi>Militia;</hi> and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with many other expreſſions of like nature, deſired in words to this effect, <hi>That if
that deſire of the Houſe of Commons were not aſſented unto, thoſe Lords who were willing
to concur, would find ſome means to make themſelves known, that it might be known who were
againſt them, and they might make it known to thoſe that ſent them.</hi> After which Petition
ſo ſtrangely framed, countenanced and ſeconded, many Lords thereupon withdrawing
themſelves, the Vote in order to the <hi>Militia,</hi> twice before rejected, was then paſſed.</p>
                     <p>After theſe and other unparliamentary Actions, many things rejected and ſettled, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſolemn debate, were again, after many Threats and Menaces, reſumed, altered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
contrary to the Cuſtom and Laws of Parliament. And ſo many of us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
our ſelves from thence, where we could not Sit, Speak and Vote, with Honour,
Freedom and Safety, and are now kept from thence for our Duty and Loyalty to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.
And though ſome of us Sate and continued there long after this, hoping that
we might have been able to have prevented the growth and progreſs of farther Miſchief;
yet ſince the Privilege of Parliament is ſo ſubſtantial and entire a Right, that as the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Liberties of either Houſe is an injury to the other and the whole Kingdom, ſo
the Violence and Aſſaults upon any of our fellow-Members, for expreſſing their opinions
in matters of debate, were inſtances to us what we were to look for when we ſhould be
known to diſſent from what was expected; and under that conſideration every one of our
juſt Liberties ſuffered violation.</p>
                     <p>Many of us for theſe and other reaſons, after His Majeſty Himſelf was by many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
and Force driven from <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> have been, contrary to the Right and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Parliament, Voted out of the Houſe, without committing any Crime, and ſome
of us without hearing, or ſo much as being ſummoned to be heard; and ſo our Countries,
for which we were and are truſted, have been without any Proxies or Perſons truſted on
their behalf. An Army hath been raiſed without and againſt His Majeſty's Conſent; and a
Proteſtation enjoyned to live and die with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> their General of that Army;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Gamul.</note>

                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:60710:221"/>
and a Member now amongſt us, refuſing to take that Proteſtation, was told, That if <hi>he
left not the Town ſpeedily, he ſhould be committed to the Tower, or knocked on the head
by the Souldiers.</hi> All Perſons, even the Members of both Houſes, have been and now
are forced or injoyned to contribute for the maintenance and ſupport of that Army. A
trayterous <hi>Covenant</hi> is ſince taken by the Members who remain, and impoſed upon the
Kingdom, <hi>That they will to their power aſſiſt the Forces raiſed and continued by both
Houſes of Parliament, against the Forces raiſed by the King,</hi> with many other Clauſes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to their Allegiance; and another for the alteration of the <hi>Covenant of
the Church</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law: and ſuch Members as have refuſed, according to their
Duty and Conſcience, to take thoſe Covenants, have been impriſoned or expelled; ſo
as they have ſuffered none to reſide with them, but thoſe who are engaged with them in
their deſperate courſes.</p>
                     <p>The whole Power and Authority of both Houſes is delegated, againſt the Law and
nature of Parliament, to a cloſe Committee, which aſſumes and uſurps the Power of
King, Lords and Commons, diſpoſes of the Perſons, Liberties and Eſtates of us and our
fellow-Subjects, without ſo much as communicating their Reſolutions to thoſe that ſit
in the Houſes. And when an Order hath been reported, to be confirmed by them, it
hath been only put to the Queſtion, no debates being ſuffered, it having been ſaid in
the Houſe where the Commons ſit to thoſe who have excepted againſt ſuch an Order
when preſented, <hi>That they were only to Vote, not to diſpute;</hi> and thereupon all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and contradiction hath been taken away. And to ſhew how impoſſible it is to
contain themſelves within any<note n="*" place="margin">Bound.</note>
 bond of civility and humanity, when they have forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Allegiance, after the attempt in a moſt barbarous manner to murther the Queens
Majeſty at Her landing at <hi>Burlington,</hi> by making many great ſhot at the houſe where
She lodged for Her repoſe after a long Voyage by Sea, where by God's bleſſing it was
diſappointed, they impeached Her of High Treaſon, for aſſiſting the King Her Husband
and the Kingdom in their greateſt neceſſities. All Petitions and Addreſſes for Peace have
been with great Art and Vehemence diſcountenanced and ſuppreſſed; whilſt others for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Diſcord have with no leſs induſtry and paſſion been promoted. And when the
Members of the Houſe of Commons, in <hi>August</hi> laſt, had agreed, upon a long and ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
to joyn with the Lords in ſending Propoſitions of Peace to His Majeſty, the next
day printed Papers were ſcattered in the Streets, and fix'd upon the publick places both
in the City and Suburbs, requiring <hi>all Perſons well-affected to riſe as one man, and to
come to the Houſe of Commons next Morning, for that</hi> 20000 Iriſh <hi>Rebels were landed;</hi>
which direction and information was likewiſe that day given in Pulpits by their Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers: and in ſome of thoſe Papers were ſubſcribed, <hi>That the Malignant Party
had over-voted the good, and if not prevented there would be Peace,</hi> (the Propoſitions
for Peace being the day before carried by nine and twenty Voices.) A Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was called late at night, though Sunday, and a Petition there framed againſt Peace,
which was the next morning brought to the Houſe, countenanc'd by Alderman <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi>
(a known Promoter and Governour of thoſe Tumults,) and attended with a
multitude of mean Perſons, who uſed Threats, Menaces and Reproaches to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houſes. Their Petition took notice of <hi>Propoſitions paſſed by the Lords for
Peace, which if allowed, would be deſtructive to Religion, Laws and Liberties;</hi> and
therefore deſired an Ordinance according to the Tenor of an Act of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>council
the night before. Thanks was given them by the Commons, whilſt the Lords
complained of the Tumults, and deſired a concurrence to ſuppreſs them, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the like; many of the People telling the Members of both Houſes, <hi>That if they
had not a good Anſwer, they would be there the next day with double the number.</hi> By
theſe Threats and Violence the Propoſitions formerly received were rejected, and all
thoughts of Peace laid aſide. Shortly after, great numbers of Women reſort to the
Houſe where the Commons ſate, with a Petition for Peace. Troops of Horſe were
hereupon ſent for, who wound and kill ſeveral of the Women, and diſperſe the reſt.
Then ſpecial notice was taken of thoſe Members who ſeemed moſt importunate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of Peace; and thereupon the late Covenant eagerly and ſeverely preſſed upon
them. By reaſon whereof and the other miſcarriages, whereby their freedom was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
taken from them, divers of both Houſes withdrew themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And we muſt now appeal to all our fellow-Subjects of this Kingdom, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, who have any knowledge of the Rights,
Cuſtoms and Privileges of Parliament, or of the Frame and Conſtitution of this Realm,
whether we or they have failed in our Duty to our King or Country; and whether we
have not in diſcharge of a good Conſcience undergone the evils we have born. And
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60710:221"/>
then we doubt not, we ſhall not be thought leſs Members of Parliament, though we
are not at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> than if that City were in the poſſeſſion of a Foreign Enemy.
Yet we confeſs the Place to be ſo material, that if there were that Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which is due to the Members, and indeed is the life of Parliament, the Act of
thoſe in the Houſe (being a lawful Act) is the Act of the Houſe, though there
were a greater number abſent, all who were of another opinion: but in our caſe, when
we are by force driven away, and by force kept away, and when nothing can be ſaid
to juſtifie the Actions which are done, but the Reputation and Number of the Actors,
we rely ſo much upon the underſtanding and honeſty of our Country-men, that they
will believe, when they ſee our concurrence and unanimity in Reſolutions and Counſel
for their Peace, welfare and ſecurity, (as we are confident the number of thoſe who
concur in this Declaration is greater than hath concurred in moſt, if not in any of
thoſe things of which we complain,) that it will be better for them to be adviſed by
us at <hi>Oxford</hi> than by thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> from whence we are abſent only by reaſon
of thoſe Outrages and Violence offered to our Perſons or our Conſciences, which takes
away all Freedom and conſequently all Authority, from thoſe Councils, and where indeed
theſe men ought not to undertake to act any thing, till that Freedom and Liberty be
reſtored to us, who as long as this Parliament ſhall continue (notwithſtanding all
the Votes of thoſe who are guilty of Treaſon and Rebellion) muſtaccount our ſelves,
and ſhall be accounted by our Country, the true and lawful Members of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid thus much to undeceive our Brethren, and that our fellow-Subjects may
be no longer ſeduced to unlawful actions by colour and pretence of Parliament, we
ſhall briefly preſent to their view and conſideration the danger and condition of His
Majeſty's Perſon, His Honour and Rights, the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom,
the defence and maintenance of which thoſe Perſons with whom we cannot agree ſeem
and pretend to undertake. For their Care of the Honour and Safety of His Majeſty's
Perſon, (to the which we are ſo abſolutely obliged and ſo ſolemnly ſworn) we ſhall
need only to mention (which we mention with great ſadneſs of Heart and Horrour)
the taking by force His Majeſty's Forts, Towns, Navy, the aſſuming a power over
the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, the denying his Majeſty's Negative Voice, the uncomely,
inſolent and diſloyal mentioning of His Majeſty's Perſon, the neglect, contempt and
violation of Leagues made by His Majeſty with Foreign Princes, in the Injuries and
Affronts done to their publick Miniſters and otherwiſe, the tranſcendent preſumption of
ſending Agents to Foreign Princes, and in the Name of the States of <hi>England,</hi> the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourcus
diſtinction between the Perſon of the King and His Office, and declaring that an
attempt upon His Life is not High-Treaſon; (which Doctrine is ſo much countenanced,
that Perſons who have threatned to Kill the King, having been complained of, have
been left unpuniſhed, and the Witneſſes and Proſecutors threatned or diſcountenanced)
the raiſing an Army againſt Him, and therewith giving Battle to His Perſon: All which
are known to be very unagreeable with the Affection, Duty and Loyalty of Subjects, and
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-men.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Religion, we cannot but with bleeding Hearts and trembling Souls
conſider the unheard-of Impieties and Prophanations exerciſed in Churches and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
places; the Countenance and licence given to ſcandalous, deboſh, ignorant Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons
to Preach and exerciſe the Office of the Miniſtry; the ſuppreſſing and cruel
uſing and impriſoning in Gaols and on Ship-board Godly, Learned, Orthodox Divines,
famous and exemplary in their Lives and Doctrine, the moſt eminent Aſſertors of the
Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery and Innovations; the ſcurrilous and ſcandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
ſcoffing and ſuppreſſing the Book of Common-Prayer, compiled by glorious
Martyrs for the Proteſtant Religion, eſtabliſhed by Law, and ſo long and ſo publickly
uſed and acknowledged as an excellent and unparallel'd form of Devotion and Divine
Service; the ſuſpending the execution of the Act of Parliament made in the firſt year
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, for Uniformity of Common-Prayer, by an
Order under the hand of a private Member of the Houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pym.</hi>
                        </note>
 and that during
the receſs of both Houſes; the ſtirring up and inciting the People to Rebellion in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
and (which is the greateſt Scandal and Reproach to the Proteſtant Religion
that can be imagined) the making Religion it ſelf the ground and cauſe of Rebellion;
laſtly, after having lived ſo many years in the moſt glorious and moſt unblemiſhed
Church of Chriſtendom, the total defacing and pulling down the whole Fabrick of
it, cenſuring and reproaching the Doctrine, and deſtroying the Diſcipline, and
(as if we were caſt aſhore in ſome uninhabited Climate where the Elements of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
were not known) the calling (without the leaſt ſhadow or colour of Law
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60710:222"/>
or Lawful Authority, againſt His Majeſty's expreſs Conſent, manifeſtly againſt the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 25<hi>th.</hi> year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) <hi>an aſſembly of Divines,</hi> compoſed of ſome
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Miniſters, (all under the ſtyle of Godly and Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines)
moſt of which are not otherwiſe known than by their Schiſm and Separation
from that Church in which they were born, and to which they have ſubſcribed; and
theſe Men now muſt new-make and mould the Religion by which we muſt all be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
God in his good time we hope will vindicate his own Cauſe, and repair the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which have been lately made.</p>
                     <p>For the Laws of the Land and the Liberty of the Subject, ſo ſpeciouſly urged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the end of thoſe who have diſturbed our Peace, we need ſay little; every place
and every perſon is an ample evidence and teſtimony of the bold and avowed violation
of either. The Charter of our Liberties, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſo induſtriouſly and Religiouſly
preſerved by our Anceſtors, and above Thirty ſeveral times confirmed in Parliament,
that Rampire and Bulwark of all the precious Privileges and Immunities which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this Kingdom could boaſt of, and which diſtinguiſhes them from all the Subjects of
Chriſtendom, is levelled and trampled under foot, ſcorned, deſpiſed and ſuperſeded by
Votes and Orders; Men of all ſorts, Clergy and Laity, impriſoned without the leaſt
charge that by the Law is called a Crime, and their Eſtates are ſequeſtred by Perſons
of whom the Law can take no notice; Committees made by Committees, Rob, Baniſh,
and Impriſon the Lords and Commons of <hi>England;</hi> Men committed by Perſons of no
Authority, for no cauſe, to Priſon, have by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> (the good old Remedy and
Security for our Liberty) been brought to the Kings Bench, and by command of thoſe
who firſt committed them remanded, and Commands given to the Judges that they
ſhould grant no <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> (which they were ſworn to grant) to any Perſons commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them, or by thoſe to whom they grant Authority to commit, which themſelves
have not Power to do. Neither can we paſs over the motion made by Mr. <hi>Rigby,</hi> a
Member of the Houſe of Commons, to tranſport thoſe Lords and Gentlemen who were
Priſoners, and by them accounted Malignants, to be ſold as Slaves to <hi>Argiers,</hi> or ſent to
the new Plantation in the Weſt-<hi>Indies;</hi> urged the ſecond time with much earneſtneſs,
becauſe the Propoſer had contracted with two Merchants to that purpoſe: the which
though it took no effect at that time, may awaken thoſe who have obſerved ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to paſs and be ordered long after they have been once or twice denied
and rejected. And who ſees the new and inhumane way of impriſoning Perſons of
Quality under Decks on Ship-board, by which cruel uſage many of our Country-men
have been murthered, may have reaſon to fear they may be hereafter carried a longer
voyage than is yet avowed. The twentieth part of our Eſtates is at once taken, and if
we are not willing to obey that Order, the other Nineteen are taken from us as Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
a term unknown and undefined, and yet crime enough to forfeit our Lives and
all that we have. Our fellow-Subjects have been executed in cold blood, for doing that
which by the Laws of God and Man they were bound to do;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>M.</hi> Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>&amp; M.</hi> Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier <hi>of</hi> Briſtol. <hi>M.</hi> Tomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, <hi>M.</hi> Chaloner, <hi>at</hi> London, <hi>and divers others.</hi>
                        </note>
 and after their Murther,
their Eſtates ſeized, and their Wives and Children expoſed to Miſery and Famine. Laws
made, and Penalties impoſed by Laws this Parliament are ſuſpended, diſpenſed withal,
and thoſe things done by Order againſt which thoſe Laws were made. And that there
may be no face of Juſtice over the Land, the Judges are prohibited to ride their Circuits,
for the adminiſtration of that Juſtice which the King owes His People, and they are
bound to execute. And after all this, and after the mercileſs ſhedding ſo much <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Blood, after the expending ſo much Money (much of which was given for relief of our
poor Proteſtant Brethren of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and diverted for the improving the Diſtractions at
home) after the tranſportation of ſuch vaſt ſums of Money and great Treaſure into
Foreign parts, to the unſpeakable impoveriſhing this Poor Kingdom; to make our
Miſery laſting and our Confuſion compleat, a Foreign Enemy is invited and brought
into the Bowels of this Kingdom, to drink our blood, to divide our Poſſeſſion, to give us
new Laws, and to Rule over us. And the better to make way to thoſe horrid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
by confounding and making void all civil Rights and Proprieties, and the
better preparing the Kingdom to be ſhared by Strangers, a New Great Seal (the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Enſign of Monarchy, and the only way by which Juſtice is derived and diſtributed
to the People) is counterfeited and uſed, albeit it be by the expreſs letter of the Statute
of the 25<hi>th.</hi> year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third declared to be High Treaſon.</p>
                     <p>Having now made this clear plain Narration to the Kingdom, (the truth and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
whereof are known to moſt Men) that when Poſterity ſhall find our names in the
Records of theſe times, as Members truſted by our Country in that great Council
by whoſe Authority and Power the preſent Alteration and Diſtraction ſeems to be
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60710:222"/>
wrought, it may likewiſe ſee how far we have been and are from conſenting to theſe
deſperate and fatal Innovations; we cannot reſt ſatisfied without Declaring and Publiſhing
to all our fellow-Subjects and to the whole World, that all our Intentions and Actions
have been, are, and ſhall be directed to the defence of His Majeſty's Perſon and juſt
Rights, the preſervation of the true Proteſtant Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdom
eſtabliſhed by Law: That as we do with all humility to God Almighty, and as a great
Bleſſing from him, acknowledge His Majeſty's happy and Religious Reign and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over this Kingdom, and eſpecially the excellent Laws and Statutes made in His
time, and particularly thoſe in this Parliament; ſo we do with all duty and ſubmiſſion
Declare, That His Majeſty is the only Supream Governour of this Realm in all Cauſes,
Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal; That His Natural Perſon is not to be divided from His
Kingly Office, but that our natural Allegiance, and the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
do bind us and all His other Subjects to Loyalty and Allegiance to His Natural
Perſon; That His Majeſty's Negative Voice (without which Monarchy is diſſolved) is
an inherent Right of His Crown, and that no Orders of one or both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without His Majeſty's expreſs Conſent, can make a Law to bind the Subjects ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their Property or Liberty; That we do from our Souls abhor the preſent Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
raiſed in this Kingdom againſt His Majeſty, and that all His Majeſty's Subjects are
bound by their natural Allegiance, and the Oaths lawfully taken by them, to the utmoſt
of their power to reſiſt and repreſs the ſame, and particularly the Army now under the
Command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and all other Armies raiſed or to be raiſed without His
Majeſty's Conſent, under pretence of the two Houſes of Parliament. And we do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
all Votes, Orders and Declarations in countenance or maintenance of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and Declare, That no Oath or Covenant voluntarily taken, or inforced, doth or
can bind or diſpenſe with the breach of thoſe other Oaths formerly and lawfully taken to
His Majeſty; and that all thoſe who aid, aſſiſt or abett this horrid and odious Rebellion,
are and ought to be accounted and purſued as Traitors, by the known Laws of the Land;
That we utterly deteſt and diſclaim the Invitation which hath been made to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> to enter this Kingdom with an Army, the ſame being as
much againſt the Deſires as againſt the Duty of the Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi>
and all true-hearted <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men. And we do Declare and publiſh to the World, That
as any ſuch Invaſion or Hoſtile entry into the Kingdom by the Rebellious Subjects of
<hi>Scotland</hi> is a direct and peremptory breach of the late <hi>Act of Pacification</hi> between the
two Kingdoms; ſo that we and all the Subjects of this Kingdom are bound by our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and by that very Act, to reſiſt and repreſs ſuch Invaſion: And whoſoever is or
ſhall be abetting, aiding or aſſiſting to thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Hoſtile Invaſion of this
Kingdom, ought to be looked upon as betrayers of their Country, and are guilty of High
Treaſon by the known Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And that our weak, miſled and ſeduced Country-men may no longer pay an implicite
regard and reverence to the abuſed name of Parliament, (which theſe guilty Perſons
uſurp to themſelves) and ſo ſubmit to thoſe Actions and Commands which two Houſes
of Parliament (never ſo legally and regularly conſtituted) have not Authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
or enjoyn; and ſince theſe Men will not ſuffer their poor Country to be reſtored
by a Treaty to the benefit of a Parliament, which would with Gods bleſſing eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
theſe Miſeries, and prevent the like for the time to come; we muſt and do declare
to the Whole Kingdom, That as at no time either or both Houſes of Parliament can by
any Orders or Ordinances impoſe upon the People without the Kings Conſent; ſo by
reaſon of the want of Freedom and Security for all the Members of Parliament to meet
at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and there to Sit, Speak and Vote with Freedom and Safety, all the
Actions, Votes, Orders, Declarations, and pretended Ordinances, made by thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
who remain ſtill at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> are void and of none effect; and that as many of
the Lords and Commons aſſembled at <hi>Westminster</hi> as have at any time conſented to
the raiſing of Forces under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or to the making and
uſing of the new Great Seal, or to the preſent coming of the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>England</hi> in a
warlike manner, have therein broken the Truſt repoſed in them by their Country, and
are to be proceeded againſt as Traitors. And yet we are far from diſſolving or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſſolution of this Parliament, or the violation of any Act made and confirmed
by His Majeſty's Royal Aſſent this Parliament, which we ſhall always maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend:
Acts of Parliament are only in danger to be deſtroyed by thoſe who undervalue and
deſpiſe the Authority and Power of Acts of Parliament, who therefore deny the Kings
Negative Voice and neglect His Concurrence, that their own Reſolutions may be reputed
as Acts of Parliament, to the Ruine and Confuſion of all Laws and Intereſt. It is our
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60710:223"/>
grief in the behalf of the whole Kingdom, that ſince the Parliament is not diſſolved, the
Power thereof ſhould, by the Treaſon and Violence of theſe Men, be ſo far ſuſpended,
that the Kingdom ſhould be without the fruit and benefit of a Parliament, which cannot
be reduced to any Action or Authority, till the Freedom and Liberty due to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
be reſtored and admitted; and they who oppoſe this, muſt be only looked upon as
the Enemies to Parliament: In the mean time we neither have nor ſhall attempt any
thing for the Adjourning, Diſſolving or Proroguing thereof, otherwiſe than as it may
ſtand with the Act in that caſe provided.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we Declare, That our endeavours, actions and reſolutions tend and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and ſhall always be directed, to the maintenance of God's true Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Law within this Kingdom, to the defence of His Majeſty's Sacred Perſon,
His Honour and juſt Rights, to the preſervation of the Liberty and Property of the
Subject, ſettled and evident by the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms of the Realm, and the
juſt Freedom, Liberty and Privilege of Parliament; and that what we ſhall do for the
defence and maintenance of all theſe, proceeds from the Conſcience of our Duty to God,
our King and Country, without any private and ſiniſter ends of our own, and out of our
ſincere love to Truth and Peace, the which as we have, ſo we ſhall always labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
as the only bleſſed End of all our Labours. And we do therefore conjure all our
Country-Men and fellow-Subjects, by all thoſe precious obligations of Religion to God
Almighty, of Loyalty towards their Soveraign, of Affection towards one another, and
of Charity and Compaſſion towards their bleeding Country, to aſſiſt and joyn with us
in the ſuppreſſing thoſe Enemies to Peace, who are ſo much delighted with the Ruine
and Confuſion they have made, that they will not ſo much as vouchſafe to Treat with
us, that all ſpecious Pretences might be taken away, and the grounds of this bloody Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
clearly ſtated to the World. If theſe Men, with a true ſence and remorſe of
the ill they have done, ſhall yet return to their Duty and Loyalty, they ſhall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
find us of another temper towards them, than they have been towards us: And if
the Conſcience of their Duty ſhall not draw all our fellow-Subjects and Country-Men to
joyn with us in aſſiſting His Majeſty, we hope that the prudent conſideration, That 'tis
impoſſible to Reaſon for our miſerable Country ever to be reſtored to Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but by reſtoring all juſt and legally-due Power and Authority into His Majeſty's
hands again, will direct them what is fit to be done by them. And if any yet ſhall be
ſo unskilful, and, to ſay no worſe, vulgar-ſpirited, to hope by a Neutrality and odious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
to reſt ſecure in this Storm, though we ſhall not follow the examples of other
Men, in telling them, that their Eſtates ſhall be forfeited and taken from them, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
and publick Enemies, (God be thanked, the Law is not ſo ſuppreſt, but that it
proceeds in Attainders and Forfeitures, and all Men know an Eſtate eſcheated to His
Majeſty by High Treaſon is as much, as legally His Majeſty's, or his to whom His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
grants it, as ever it was the unhappy Perſons who hath ſo forfeited it) yet we muſt
let them know, that their Condition is like to be very dangerous; and that as they (for
reſiſtance of whom His Majeſty's Armies are raiſed) have declared to them what they
are to expect at their hands, that is, to be dealt with as pernicious and publick Enemies,
ſo they have reaſon to believe, that His Majeſty cannot look upon them as Perſons who
have performed that Duty they are obliged by their natural Allegiance and their Oaths
enjoyned by Law, which is, <hi>to defend the King to the utmoſt of their Power against all
Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoever which ſhall be made againſt His Majeſty's Perſon,
His Crown and Dignity, and to do their beſt endeavours to diſcloſe and make known to
Him all Treaſons and Conſpiracies which ſhall be againſt Him, to their power to aſſist all
Juriſdictions, Privileges, Preheminencies and Authorities belonging to Him, or united to
the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> The juſt and pious conſideration and weighing of
which Oath and Obligation muſt ſtir up all Men of Loyalty and Conſcience, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
and active on His Majeſty's behalf againſt this horrid and odious Rebellion,
and againſt the Authors and Fomenters of the ſame. And we are confident it will not
a little encreaſe the Indignation of all good true <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, to find theſe Diſturbers of
their Peace, who have ſo ſpeciouſly pretended the defence of the Rights and Privileges
of Parliament, unite themſelves with and govern their Actions by the concurrent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Conſent of Commiſſioners of another Kingdom, whoſe buſineſs is to alter our
Laws, and confound our Government. And if all the other particulars ſo plainly ſet
down in this Declaration, and ſo publickly known to moſt Men, were wanting, there
could not be a greater inſtance of deſerting the Dignity and Right, and, as much as in
them lies, cancelling all the Liberties and Privileges of Parliament, than for theſe Men
to break the Truſt repoſed in them by their Country, and to ſubmit themſelves to the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60710:223"/>
Advice, and oblige themſelves to the Conſent of Agents of another Kingdom, who have
caſt off their Allegiance, and united themſelves together againſt their natural and native
King, and againſt the Laws of both Kingdoms, and have given an ample teſtimony to
all thoſe they have miſled, how far they are from ſubmitting or intending to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Parliament, or by thoſe who would yet be thought the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by joyning four <hi>Scotch</hi>-Men (Agents for the Rebellious Army which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
this Kingdom) in equal Power and Authority with ſeven Lords and fourteen
Commons, by whoſe ſole and uncontrolled managery and conſent all buſineſs of Peace and
War, which doth or may concern this languiſhing Kingdom, muſt be governed: And
yet theſe Men take it very heinouſly that His Majeſty ſhould move them, in order to
Peace, to agree that all the Members of both Houſes may ſecurely meet in a full and
free Convention of Parliament; becauſe (they ſay) <hi>from thence no other Concluſion can be
made, but that this preſent Parliament is not a full nor free Convention, and that to make
it ſuch the preſence of us is neceſſary.</hi> We muſt appeal to all the World, whether in truth
that Concluſion be not very apparent from the truth of their Proceedings, and even to
the Conſciences of theſe Men themſelves; whether whilſt we were amongſt them, we
enjoyed that Liberty and Freedom which was due to us; and whether (if there were
no danger or breach of Duty in being willingly and conſtantly preſent where Actions of
Treaſon are plotted and concluded) we could now be with them without engaging our
ſelves in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which as it takes away all freedom and liberty of Council, ſo
cannot be taken without the violation of our Duty and Allegiance. For the deſerting
the great Truſt repoſed in us, we cannot with the leaſt colour be accuſed; we wiſh it
had not been or were not now broken on their parts; on ours we are ſure it is not;
except obſervation of our Oaths lawfully taken and enjoyned, and ſubmiſſion to the
known eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land, the preſervation of which is our greateſt Truſt,
be to deſert the Truſt repoſed in us. What they have done, who have broken through
all theſe, and will not at laſt conſent to the binding up the wounds they have made, we
muſt leave to the World to judge. In the mean time, ſince 'tis apparent they uſe their

in the aſſiſtance of His Majeſty with their Perſons and their Fortunes, which is the
only means, with God's bleſſing, to reſtore and preſerve the Religion, Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Kingdom, and the very Being of Parliaments: The which if theſe Men
have any mind to do (it being not ſo eaſily to be done any other way) they will
at laſt be willing that all the Members of both Houſes may meet in a full and free

His Majeſty not intending that this ſhould extend either to the Biſhops, whoſe Votes have
been taken away by Bill, or to ſuch in whoſe places upon new Writs new Elections have been
made.</p>
                     <p>3. As ſoon as His Majeſty and both Houſes may be ſecured from ſuch tumultuous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
as, to the great breach of the Privileges and the high Diſhonour of Parliaments, have
formerly aſſembled about both Houſes, and awed the Members of the ſame, and occaſioned
two ſeveral complaints from the Lords Houſe, and two ſeveral deſires of that Houſe to the
Houſe of Commons, to joyn in a Declaration againſt them, the complying with which deſire
might have prevented all theſe miſerable Diſtractions which have enſued; which Security
His Majesty conceives can be only ſettled by Adjourning the Parliament to ſome other
place, at the leaſt twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> the choice of which His Majeſty leaves to
both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will moſt chearfully and readily conſent that both Armies be immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,

at and to which the Parliament ſhall be agreed to be Adjourned.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being most confident that the Law will then recover the due credit and
eſtimation, and that upon a free debate in a full and peaceable Convention of Parliament,
ſuch Proviſions will be made againſt Seditious Preaching and Printing againſt His Majeſty
and the eſtabliſhed Laws, which hath been one of the chief cauſes of the preſent Diſtractions,
and ſuch care will be taken concerning the Legal and known Rights of His Majeſty, and the
Property and Liberty of His Subjects, that whatſoever hath been publiſhed or done in or
by colour of any illegal Declaration, Ordinance, or Order of one or both Houſes, or any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of either of them, and particularly the Power to raiſe Arms without His Majeſty's

remain for the like to ſpring out of for the future, to diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom,
and to endanger the very Being of it.</p>
                     <p>And in ſuch a Convention His Majeſty is reſolved, by His readineſs to conſent to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall be propoſed to Him by Bill for the Real good of His Subjects, (and particularly
for the better diſcovery and ſpeedier conviction of Recuſants, for the Education of the
Children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in the Proteſtant Religion, for the prevention of practices

then appear to all the World, not only who is moſt deſirous of Peace, and whoſe fault
it is that both Armies are not now disbanded, but who have been the true and firſt cauſe

His Meſſage, which gives ſo fair a Riſe, to end theſe unnatural Diſtractions. And His

that it muſt be confeſſed, that nothing but the Tenderneſs and Love to His People,

                        <p>AS We ſhall always acknowledge the great Comfort and Aſſiſtance We have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Petition of your Confidence in Us, and for the Care you have therein taken, that all
Our good Subjects may receive ample ſatisfaction in thoſe things upon which the Good

                        <p>We have long obſerved (though not without wonder) the ſly, ſubtile, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Inſinuation infuſed and diſperſed amongſt our People by the diſturbers of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace, of Our favouring and countenancing of Popery: And therefore as in Our
conſtant, viſible practice We have to the utmoſt of Our Power, (and We hope, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently)
manifeſted the groſs falſhood of thoſe Imputations and Scandals, ſo We have
omitted no opportunity of publiſhing to all the World the clear Intentions and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Soul in that point. We wiſh from Our heart that the true Reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion may not receive greater Blemiſh by the Actions and Practices of theſe
Men, than it doth or ſhall by any Connivence of Ours. We will take the beſt care We
can (and We deſire your aſſiſtance in it) to publiſh to all Our good Subjects that Our
<hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Declarations</hi> you mention: And We do aſſure you, there is not
an Expreſſion in either of them, for the maintenance and advancement of Our Religion,
with which Our Heart doth not fully concur; and in which We ſhall be ſo conſtant, that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60710:225"/>
if it ſhall not pleaſe God to enable Us by Force to defend it, We ſhall ſhew Our Affection
and Love to it by dying for it. We may without vanity ſay, It hath pleaſed God to
enlighten Our Underſtanding to diſcern the clear Truth of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, in
which We have been born and bred, from the Miſts and Clouds of <hi>Popery,</hi> the which (if
it hath made any growth or progreſs of late within the Kingdom, as We hope it hath
not) is more beholding to the unchriſtian Rage and Fury of theſe Men than to any
Connivence or Favour of Ours.</p>
                        <p>For a National Synod, We have often promiſed it, and when God ſhall give ſo much
Peace and Quiet to this Kingdom, that regular and lawful Conventions may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhall gladly perform that Promiſe, as the beſt means to re-eſtabliſh Our Religion,
and make up thoſe Breaches which are made: And We ſhall then willingly recommend
unto them a ſpecial care of the eaſe of tender Conſciences of Our Proteſtant Subjects, as
We have often expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>For the Laws of the Land, We can ſay no more than We have ſaid in that Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you mention, and We thank you for being ſatisfied with it; in which God knows
Our Reſolution to be ſo firm and ſtedfaſt, that We will give any Security under Heaven
for the obſervation of it. And as Our greateſt deſire at this preſent is to meet in a full
and free Convention of Parliament, which We are confident would quickly put an end
to all theſe Troubles: So, when it ſhall pleaſe God to reſtore that Bleſſing to Us, We
ſhall value and eſteem that Council, and frequently conſult with it, and be adviſed by
it, as the beſt means to make both King and People truly happy; and We ſhall then
by an Act given wipe out the footſteps of theſe extraordinary Supplies, which nothing
but this real viſible Neceſſity which oppreſſes us all could have compelled Us to make
uſe of, and which ſhall never be mentioned or remembred by Us to the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of your Rights and Liberties. And in the mean time, We ſhall leave nothing
undone for the preſervation of particular Contracts, and prevention of the diſorder
and licence of the Souldier, which is in Our Power to do, no particular Perſon endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
half that ſadneſs of heart for thoſe Breaches and Preſſures which We Our Self do:
For the prevention and ſuppreſſion whereof We ſhall proceed with all Rigour and
Severity.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, as the ſupport and maintenance of the Religion, Laws and Privileges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is (as you well know) the only Argument of Our defenſive Arms; ſo thoſe
being ſecured, We ſhall with all imaginable Joy lay down thoſe Arms: And as you
have been Our Witneſſes and Our Aſſiſtants in Our earneſt deſires of Peace, ſo We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you, We ſhall not only with the ſame earneſtneſs always embrace it, if it ſhall be
offered, but purſue and preſs it upon the leaſt likelihood of Opportunity. And this Our
Reſolution, by God's Bleſſing, ſhall never be altered by any Advantages or proſperous
Succeſs.</p>

                     <p>Whereas We are given to underſtand, that many falſe Rumors and Scandalous Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

inclination to recede from that Orthodox Religion which We were born, baptized and
bred in, and which We have firmly profeſſed and practiſed throughout the whole courſe
of Our Life to this moment, and that We intend to give way to the introduction and
publick Exerciſe of Popery again in Our Dominions: Which Conjecture or rather moſt
deteſtable Calumny, being grounded upon no imaginable foundation, hath raiſed theſe
horrid Tumults and more than barbarous Wars throughout this flouriſhing Iſland, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext of a kind of Reformation, which would not only prove incongruous, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with the Fundamental Laws and Government of this Kingdom: We deſire
that the whole Chriſtian World ſhould take notice and reſt aſſured, that We never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
in Our Imagination the leaſt thought to attempt ſuch a thing, or to depart a
jot from that holy Religion, which when we received the Crown and Sceptre of this
Kingdom, We took a moſt Solemn and Sacramental Oath to profeſs and protect. Nor doth
Our moſt conſtant practice and quotidian viſible preſence in the exerciſe of this ſole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

beſides divers other undeniable Arguments, only demonſtrate this; but alſo that happy
Alliance of Marriage We contracted betwixt Our Eldeſt Daughter and the Illuſtrious
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> moſt clearly confirms the reality of Our Intentions herein; by which
Nuptial Engagement it appears further, that Our endeavours are not only to make a
bare Profeſſion thereof in Our Own Dominions, but to inlarge and corroborate it abroad
as much as lyeth in Our Power. This moſt holy Religion of the <hi>Anglicane</hi> Church, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd

a good Accommodation, and an Invitation to all His Loyal Subjects to joyn
together for His Aſſiſtance therein.</head>
                     <p>AMongſt the many Troubles wherewith (for more than two years laſt
paſt) We have been involved, nothing hath more afflicted Us than
the real ſenſe of Our Subjects Sufferings, occaſioned by this moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
War; and the chief of Our Care hath been (and by God's
aſſiſtance ſhall ſtill be) to ſettle them in a happy Peace, with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of enjoyning the exerciſe of their Religion, Rights and Liberties,
according to the Laws of this Kingdom, as they or any of their Anceſtors
enjoyed the ſame in the beſt times of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or Our Royal Father.
And as we have always profeſt in the ſincerity of Our Heart, That no Succeſs ſhould
ever make Us averſe unto Peace; ſo have We always, when God hath bleſſed Us with
any eminent Victory, ſollicited the Members of both Houſes of Parliament remaining
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by frequent Meſſages, for a Treaty conducing thereunto: and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60710:231"/>
upon Our late Victory over the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army in <hi>Cornwal</hi> (which We
wholly attribute to the immediate hand of God) We preſently diſpatch'd a Meſſage
to them to deſire a Treaty for Peace and Accommodation; of which, as likewiſe of
that former Meſſage for Peace which We ſent them from <hi>Eveſholm</hi> the fourth of <hi>July</hi>
laſt, We have yet received no Anſwer; and therefore have reſolved with Our Army to
draw preſently towards <hi>London</hi> and Our Southern and Eaſtern Counties, not looking
upon thoſe parts as Enemies to Us, and ſo to ſuffer by the approach of Our Army or
the diſorders thereof, (which We will uſe all poſſible means to prevent) but as Our
poor Subjects oppreſſed by Power, (of which We reſt aſſured the greater part remain
Loyal to Us) and ſo deſerving Our Protection. And We hope that at a nearer diſtance
of place there may be begot ſo right an underſtanding between Us and Our People, that
at length We may obtain a Treaty for Peace, and a full, free and peaceable Convention in
Parliament, and therein make an end of theſe unhappy Differences by a good Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.
In which We hereby aſſure all Our People upon Our Royal Word, and the
Faith of a Chriſtian, (which is the greateſt Security We can give them) that We will
inſiſt only upon the ſetling and continuance of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion,
Our own undoubted known Rights, the Privileges of Parliament, and Our Subjects
Liberty and Property, according to the Laws of the Land, and to have all theſe ſettled
in a full and free Parliament, whereby the Armies on both ſides may be preſently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,
this Kingdom may be ſecured from the danger of a Conqueſt by Foreign Forces,
all Strangers now in Arms may return to their own Countries, and Our poor Subjects
be freed of thoſe grievous burthens, which by reaſon of the late Diſtractions have (much
againſt Our Will) too much preſſed them. And to the end Our Subjects may no longer
be miſled be falſe pretences, We do deſire all of them, as well in Our own Quarters as
where the Rebels have uſurped a Power, to take into ſerious conſideration the Duty and
Loyalty which by the Law of God and their Oath of Allegiance they owe unto Us,
and more particularly that part thereof which concerns the Defence of Our Perſon, and
Aſſiſtance of Us againſt Rebels and ſuch as riſe in Arms againſt Us; which they may
find plainly ſet down in the Statute of the II. year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.
And We do hereby require Our Subjects within Our own Quarters through or near
which We ſhall paſs, by that Duty they owe to Us and their Country, that they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
prepare themſelves, with the beſt Arms they can get, to be ready, and joyn, and
go along with Us in this preſent Expedition, (We reſolving to take ſpecial care to place
them under the Command of Gentlemen of Quality of their own Countries, to their
good content and ſatisfaction.) And we likewiſe require and authorize all Our good
Subjects, as well the Trained Bands as others, of Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and Our Southern
and Eaſtern Counties, to chuſe their own Commanders and Leaders amongſt thoſe
Gentlemen and Citizens that are of approved Loyalty to Us, and Lovers of the Peace of
their Country, and upon Our approach towards thoſe parts to put themſelves into Arms,
and march in warlike manner to aſſiſt Us in this good Work, and free themſelves from
the Tyranny of their fellow-Subjects under which they groan; commanding and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing
them to ſeize ſuch places of Strength in thoſe Southern and Eaſtern Counties as
the Rebels have poſſeſſed themſelves of, to oppoſe with force of Arms ſuch Perſons as
ſhall reſiſt them in obeying theſe Our Commands, and to apprehend and ſecure the
Perſons of all ſuch as ſhall endeavour to continue this Rebellion, and to hinder
the ſettling of the Peace of this Kingdom in a full and free Convention of Parliament,
(the only viſible means leſt, by bleſſing of God, to redeem this Nation from utter
Ruine;) wherein We will afford Our utmoſt Protection and Safety unto all Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that ſhall give Obedience to theſe Our Commands. And as We doubt not but
that all Our good Subjects will come chearfully to Our aſſiſtance for ſo good an end
(beyond which We do not require it;) ſo We truſt that God, who hath hitherto won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
preſerved Us, will crown this Action with happy Succeſs, for his Glory, and

 Clauſe in the Bill His Majeſty's ancient and
undoubted power of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> is wholly taken away; beſides, it

Church of Chriſt, till within theſe few years, without intermiſſion or interruption;
and then how perilous a thing it muſt be, and prejudicial to the publick Peace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
and deſtroy a Form of Government ſo long exerciſed in this Kingdom, and under
which we have enjoyed as great a meaſure of Happineſs (to ſay no more) as any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Chriſtendom, and which your Lordſhips have not pretended to be unlawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we particularly ſee the Model of that Government and Juriſdiction which is to be
eſtabliſhed in the place thereof, that thereby we may be aſſured that it be ſuch, to
which as well thoſe who like, as all thoſe who diſlike the preſent Government, will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
otherwiſe Peace, which is the main end and pretence for Alterations, cannot be
eſtabliſhed: And therefore we very earneſtly beſeech your Lordſhips to conſider and
weigh, whether, without ſhaking Foundations, it be not much better, and more
agreeable to Chriſtian Prudence and Charity, to remove thoſe particulars from the
preſent Government, and make ſuch Alterations therein as may moſt probably give
ſatisfaction to all perſons ſeriouſly diſturbed or afflicted in their Conſciences, than by
deſtroying the whole, to give juſt Offence and Scandal to very many Pious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

were we from conſenting that Epiſcopacy hath continued from the Apoſtles times by

we know no reaſon why your Lordſhips may not give an Anſwer to thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Writing. For as it is not agreeable to the uſage of Parliaments, for the two
Houſes to give His Majeſty Reaſons why he ſhould paſs any Bill preſented by them; ſo
it is no more agreeable to the ſame uſage, for His Majeſty to give Reaſons why He doth
not paſs Bills ſo preſented But we deſire your Lordſhips to conſider that we are now in a
Treaty, and we conceive the proper buſineſs thereof to be, for your Lordſhips to give
us Reaſons why His Majeſty ſhould conſent to the Propoſitions made by you, or for us
to give Reaſons to your Lordſhips why we cannot conſent to thoſe Propoſitions; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would be only a Demand on your Lordſhips part, and no Argument of Treaty
between us. And we muſt profeſs to your Lordſhips, that as we conceived in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Paper the Succeſſion of Epiſcopacy, by Succeſſion from the Apoſtles time, was
conſented to on all parts; ſo we cannot remember that the contrary thereof was ſo much
as alledged, much leſs that the Unlawfulneſs thereof was proved, the Queſtion of the
Lawfulneſs thereof having never yet come in debate. And we ſhall be very ready to
receive any aſſertion from your Lordſhips to that purpoſe, not doubting but we ſhall
give your Lordſhips full ſatisfaction in that point. And we conceive the Alterations
propoſed by us to your Lordſhips to be a very proper Anſwer to your Lordſhips Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and moſt agreeable to the end for which thoſe Propoſitions ſeem to be made.
And that ſince it appears, that the utter aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy in the manner propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is viſibly inconvenient, and may be miſchievous, the Regulating of Epiſcopacy,
being moſt conſonant to the Primitive Inſtitution, will produce all theſe good effects

in your Power (as you ſay) to do, and being a ſure way to put an end to this debate

other Propoſition, that the Government intended to be introduced by your Lordſhips is
the only Government that is agreeable to the Word of God, can be evinced, we hope
your Lordſhips will reſt ſatisfied with the Reaſons we have given your Lordſhips in

made and inſiſted on by your Lordſhips, and that we have offered your Lordſhips a

from the Jealouſies and Apprehenſions they may have of Danger, we do conſent, that all
the Forces of the Kingdom, both by Sea and Land, ſhall be put into the hands of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of known faithfulneſs to the Religion and Peace of the Kingdom, in ſuch manner

Lordſhips, ſuch greater or leſſer number as ſhall be agreed upon between us; and that
His Majeſty may name half the perſons to be ſo entruſted, and the two Houſes the
other half.</p>
                        <p>That ſuch Forts and Towns in which Garriſons have been before theſe Troubles,
and ſuch other as ſhall be agreed upon between us to be neceſſary for a time to be

to receive orders from them and no others: And all other places which have been
fortified ſince the beginning of theſe Troubles ſhall be left as they were before, and
the Fortifications and Works ſlighted and demoliſhed; and all Forces with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expedition to be disbanded, that the Kingdom may be eaſed of that intolerable
burthen.</p>
                        <p>That an Act of Parliament ſhall be paſſed for the raiſing of ſuch Moneys for the
maintenance of the Navy and Sea-Forces, as His Majeſty and both Houſes ſhall think
fit.</p>
                        <p>That when any of the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall dye who was nominated by His

one nor the other to be removed, but by the joynt conſent of His Majeſty and both
Houſes; except it ſhall be deſired by your Lordſhips, that His Majeſty and the two
Houſes reſpectively may remove the reſpective perſons named by them as often as they
ſhall ſee occaſion, to which (if it ſhall be inſiſted on) we ſhall conſent.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Commiſſioners, or the major part of them, or ſuch other number of them as
ſhall be aggreed upon, ſhall have Power by Act of Parliament to ſuppreſs any Forces
raiſed ſitting a Parliament, without the joynt conſent of His Majeſty and both Houſes
of Parliament, or in the Intervals of Parliament, without conſent of the ſaid Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

and to ſuppreſs any Forces that ſhall invade the Kingdom. And it ſhall be high Treaſon
in any who ſhall levy any Forces without ſuch Authority or conſent, to the diſturbance
of the publick Peace.</p>
                        <p>That they ſhall have like Power to preſerve the Peace now to be ſettled, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all diſturbances of the publick Peace that may ariſe by occaſion of the late Troubles:
And if any Forces ſhall be brought into the Kingdom without the joynt Conſent of the
King and the two Houſes of Parliament, it ſhall be lawful for any four of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
to levy Forces for the ſupppreſſing, reſiſting and deſtroying of the ſaid Forces
ſo brought in.</p>
                        <p>We are content that this Power to ſuch Perſons ſhall continue for the ſpace of three
years, which we doubt not but, by the bleſſing of God, will be abundantly ſufficient to
ſecure all Perſons from their Doubts and Fears, and in which time ſuch a mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may be begot betwixt His Majeſty and all His People, that the Peace will be firm
and laſting.</p>
                        <p>That the Commiſſioners, before their entrance upon the ſaid Truſt, ſhall take an Oath
for the due execution of the ſaid Commiſſion; and that after the expiration of the ſaid
term of three years from the time of the iſſuing the ſaid Commiſſion, they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to continue any execution of the ſaid Authority, and it ſhall be high Treaſon in any
of them to execute the ſaid Authority after the expiration of the ſaid three years. And
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:60710:249"/>
all the Commanders in chief of the Garriſons, Forts, and His Majeſty's Ships, ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
take an Oath for the due execution of their Truſt.</p>
                        <p>That the Commiſſioners ſhall have Power to prevent the violation of the Articles of
Peace, or any Troubles ariſing in the Kingdom by breach of the ſaid Articles, and to
hear and determine all differences that may occaſion the ſame.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall be willing that any juſt Privileges and Immunities be granted by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to the City of <hi>London,</hi> as being the chief City of this Kingdom, and the place His
Majeſty deſires to honour with His moſt uſual and moſt conſtant Reſidence: But we
conceive it too envious a thing, and may prove very prejudicial to the Happineſs of that
great City, to diſtinguiſh it in a matter of ſo high importance as the buſineſs of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi>
from the Authority that the whole Kingdom is to ſubmit to.</p>
                        <p>If your Lordſhips ſhall not conſent to the election of perſons in that manner as we
have propoſed, half by His Majeſty and the other half by the two Houſes, we do then
propoſe to your Lordſhips, that the ſaid perſons who ſhall have the ſaid Powers in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and form above mentioned, may be named by mutual conſent upon Debate between
us; in which conſideration may be taken of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of thoſe who ſhall be
named: And in caſe that any of them who ſhall be thus agreed upon ſhall die within
the ſaid term of three years, the ſurvivers, or the major part of them, ſhall nominate
and chuſe another in his place who ſhall be deceaſed. This way we ſhould moſt have
deſired, but in regard the conſideration of perſons may take up a long time in debate,
which neither the time allotted for the Treaty nor the preſent Diſtractions will permit,
we do propoſe the former as the moſt expedite and certain way, but leave the election
to your Lordſhips.</p>
                        <p>And whatſoever ſhall be found deficient in the ſettling this according to the preſent
Agreement, or ſhall be thought fit to be added to it upon any inconveniencies or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that ſhall be hereafter diſcovered, the ſame ſhall be mended or ſupplyed in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as ſhall be thought reaſonable by the joynt Conſent of His Majeſty and the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

 Anſwer delivered by us to your Lordſhips on the

from your Lordſhips concerning the Powers to be given to the Commiſſioners of both
Kingdoms, and the other particulars mentioned in our Papers ſince delivered to your
Lordſhips, wherein we are not as yet ſatisfied by any Papers delivered by your
Lordſhips to us. Our further Anſwer to thoſe Propoſitions concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> is,
That we are willing and do agree, that the like courſe ſhall be taken and obſerved
touching the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> as is offered in our ſaid Paper of the
ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> and as ſhall be hereafter agreed on for the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>
which we conceive to be a full ſecurity for the performance and obſervation of all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which ſhall be agreed upon between us in order to a bleſſed Peace; which we are
ſo deſirous may be punctually and exactly obſerved, that we are willing that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
be deſired to take a moſt ſolemn ſtrict Oath for the full obſervation thereof; and
likewiſe that all perſons of any immediate truſt by office or attendance on His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and any other whom you ſhall think fit, ſhall take ſuch Oath for the due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the ſame, with ſuch reaſonable Penalties, as ſhall be propoſed by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and agreed to by us: in which we believe we ſhall not differ with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
being willing that whoſoever ſhall in the leaſt degree infringe the Agreement
which ſhall be made between us, may be looked upon and accounted as moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Enemies to King and Kingdoms. And if it ſhall be thought neceſſary to make any
additional ſettlement of the <hi>Militia,</hi> with a general reference to the good of the Kingdoms
reſpectively, we deſire the ſame may be done, after the Peace eſtabliſhed, by the joynt
conſent of His Majeſty and the two Houſes of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and His
Majeſty and the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſpectively. And as we
ſhall deſire and endeavour to remove all occaſions that may interrupt the Peace
and Tranquillity of that Kingdom, and a perfect Amity with them, and ſhall not deſire
any change of, or to intermeddle in their Laws or Government, or give them cauſe to
apprehend any diſturbance or violation of them from this Kingdom; ſo are we obliged
with all tenderneſs to preſerve the Honour, Dignity and Conſtitution of this Realm.
And therefore as we are yet ſatisfied, we cannot conſent that any Perſons authorized by
the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any advice from thence, ſhall have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdom, or further interpoſe in the affairs of this
Kingdom than is already provided by the Act of Pacification. And we offer to your
Lordſhips conſiderations, whether unleſs there could be an union of the Laws of both
Kingdoms, ſuch a mixture of Power as is now propoſed, and the influence thereof both
upon Martial and Civil affairs, may not prove very inconvenient and prejudicial to both
Kingdoms, and give cauſe of Jealouſies to each other, to the diſturbance of that mutual
Amity ſo much deſired. But if this intermingling of Power in both Kingdoms ſhall be
further inſiſted on by your Lordſhips, we propound that the ſame may be ſettled as
(after a Peace eſtabliſhed) ſhall be agreed by the joynt conſent of His Majeſty and
both Houſes of Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and of His Majeſty and the Eſtates of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and if your Lordſhips ſhall inſiſt on any thing further for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Security, we ſhall apply our ſelves to the conſideration thereof, if we ſhall have
further time ſo to do, according to our deſires grounded upon His Majeſty's Letter.</p>

in all you deſired to know concerning the Powers of the Commiſſioners
of both Kingdoms, and the other particulars mentioned by your Lordſhips: And what
your Lordſhips now offer concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the
like courſe ſhall be taken in it as is expreſſed in your Lordſhips Paper of the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi>
to be obſerved for the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdom, your Lordſhips may remember, that
in our Anſwer to that Paper we told your Lordſhips it was differing from what we had
propoſed, and unſatisfactory to our juſt and neceſſary deſires for ſecuring the Peace of
the Kingdoms; and it cannot be expected that what was ſo then for the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> ſhould now be thought other for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And though both
Kingdoms be now united in the ſame Cauſe, and labouring under the ſame Dangers,
and therefore neceſſitated to a mutual and reciprocal Aſſiſtance of each other, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a joynt remedy and ſecurity by that Commiſſion deſired in our 17<hi>th.</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
we find your Lordſhips ſay, that (as yet you are ſatisfied) you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto it. To which we anſwer, That we believed we had given your Lordſhips
ſuch convincing Reaſons as might have ſatisfied you, and we doubt not but they may,
if you will recollect your memories concerning them, and rightly weight them. This
being the laſt day we are to Treat upon this Subject, it cannot be expected, and, as
we conceive, it is altogether needleſs to uſe any more Arguments; we do therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
your Lordſhips will be pleaſed now at the laſt to give us your full and poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to our Demands, as we have often already preſſed your Lordſhips. And whereas
your Lordſhips do propound, that if we ſhall further inſiſt upon the uniting of the
Powers of both Kingdoms, it may be done after the Peace eſtabliſht; we deſire your
Lordſhips to conſider, that it is demanded by us in order to a Peace, and a chief and moſt
neceſſary means for the attaining and eſtabliſhing of it. And we further obſerve, that
your Lordſhips have given us no Anſwer at all to our 15<hi>th.</hi> Propoſition; which we do
likewiſe inſiſt upon, and deſire your Anſwer.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CXXX"/> IF your Lordſhips had punctually, or in any degree, ſatisfied us in what we deſired
to know concerning the Powers of the Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms, and the
other particulars mentioned by us, we had not troubled your Lordſhips with ſo many
Queſtions, to moſt of which we could receive no other Anſwers, than the referring us
to the Propoſitions themſelves upon which we grounded our Queſtions. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that your Lordſhips Propoſitions upon the <hi>Militia,</hi> upon which you ſtill inſiſt,
have in truth appeared upon Debate to be moſt unreaſonable in many particulars: As
that the Perſons to be entruſted with the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be nominated only by the two
Houſes, and that His Majeſty, who is equally to be ſecured that the Peace ſhould not be
broken, ſhould name none; that the Power given to the Commiſſioners ſhall be framed
and altered as occaſion ſerves by the two Houſes only, and that His Majeſty, who is ſo
much concerned therein, ſhall have no Negative Voice as to ſuch Powers, but is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
excluded; and that the Time ſhould be unlimited, ſo that His Majeſty for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and His Poſterity ſhould for ever part with their peculiar Regal Power of being able
to reſiſt their Enemies, or protect their good Subjects, and with that undoubted and
never-denied Right of the Crown, to make War and Peace, and in no time to come,
His Majeſty or His Poſterity ſhould have power to aſſiſt their Allies with any ſupplies
of Men, though Voluntiers, or ever more to have any Juriſdiction over Their own
Navy or Fleet at Sea, and ſo conſequently muſt loſe all eſtimation and confidence with
Foreign Princes. And many other expreſſions in the ſaid Propoſitions do either ſignifie
what we find your Lordſhips do not expect or intend, or at leaſt are ſo doubtful, that
the clear ſenſe thereof is not evident to all underſtandings: As by the literal ſenſe of
your Propoſitions, neither the Sheriffs of Counties nor Juſtices of Peace and other Legal
Miniſters may raiſe Forces by the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> or otherwiſe to ſuppreſs Riots, and
remove forcible Entries, or to perform the other neceſſary Duties of their places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:60710:255"/>
out being liable to the interpretation of the Commiſſioners for the <hi>Militia,</hi> that ſuch
Forces are raiſed or Actions done for the diſturbance of the publick Peace; as likewiſe all
Civil Actions and Differences may be comprehended within thoſe Propoſitions to be
tryed before the ſaid Commiſſioners: neither of which we believe your Lordſhips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>And therefore we have in our Anſwers propoſed what we thought would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the matter and end of thoſe Propoſitions, that is, a reaſonable and full Security
for the obſervation of the Articles of the Treaty, which, according to what we have
offered, cannot be broken on either part, without evident prejudice and danger to that
part which ſhall endeavour the breaking thereof; and that the memory of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Diſtractions may be forgotten as ſoon as may be, that the time of this ſettlement
may be limited to three years, which, by the bleſſing of God, will be ſufficient to beget
a good underſtanding between His Majeſty and all His People; and that the Fifteenth
Propoſition, and all the other parts of your Lordſhips Propoſitions, being not at all
neceſſary to the preſent Union and Reconciliation, may be deferred till after the Peace
eſtabliſhed, to be ſettled by His Majeſty and the two Houſes of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi>
and His Majeſty and the Eſtates of the Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſpectively. But if your
Lordſhips ſhall not think this way of nomination of Perſons to be Commiſſioners, or
the other propoſed likewiſe by us in our Paper of the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> for the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Commiſſioners between your Lordſhips and us, to be equal; we ſhall glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive any more equal way from your Lordſhips, ſince it is apparent that that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
propoſed by your Lordſhips, and which you inſiſt upon <hi>in terminis,</hi> is not fit to
be conſented to for the Quiet and Peace of the Kingdom, preſuming that you will think
the Security ought to be mutual, as the Fears and Jealouſies are mutual. And we are
moſt confident that His Majeſty ſo much deſires to give all reaſonable and fit ſecurity on
His part, that the Agreement and Peace to be now made ſhall be inviolably obſerved:
That as He will name no Man for this great Truſt againſt whom there can be juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
(if the Perſons are named equally between Him and you;) ſo if the whole
nomination were left to Him, He would pitch only upon ſuch as both Kingdoms might
have great cauſe to confide in, and we believe might give full ſatisfaction to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.
And therefore we hope your Lordſhips will believe that the Reaſon we conſent
not to your Propoſitions, is, becauſe we conceive them deſtructive to the End for which
they are propoſed, Juſtice, Peace and Unity; and not that we deny to conſent to any
reaſonable Security for obſervance of the Agreement to be made, of which we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be moſt tender, with regard to all perſons concerned.</p>

and no Anſwer to ours thereupon; and it being very neceſſary for us to know, whether
the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> have a negative voice, and whether
they have not power to conclude without farther powers to be granted from the Eſtates
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Upon the Anſwer to which we muſt the rather inſiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Lordſhips laſt Paper gives the reaſon of the diſtinct Paper delivered to us from
the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be, becauſe the limitation of Time
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:60710:256"/>
now offered differs from the Propoſitions agreed on by both Parliaments, in which the
Time is indefinite; which ſeems to us to intimate, that your Lordſhips who are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> have not power to conſent to any alteration
from the ſaid Propoſition without firſt acquainting the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> although
the other joynt Paper delivered upon that Subject be ſigned by both your Secretaries;
and thereby it is evident, that it much concerns us to know whether the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
have a negative voice in this Treaty.</p>
                        <p>For the matter of your Lordſhips Paper concerning the limitation of time for the
<hi>Militia</hi> to ſeven years, it is not poſſible, by reaſon of this ſhortneſs of time for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(it being ten of the clock this night when your Paper was delivered) to give your
Lordſhips a full Anſwer, it being neceſſary for us to receive ſatisfaction from your
Lordſhips in writing, or by Conference, whether by the words, [<hi>and not otherwiſe</hi>]
your Lordſhips intend that after the expiration of the time limited, His Majeſty ſhall
not exerciſe the Legal Power which He now hath over the <hi>Militia,</hi> before the ſame be
agreed upon by His Majeſty and the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and by
His Majeſty and the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſpectively: For which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and debate we heartily wiſh the time were ſufficient, being very willing to
give your Lordſhips all reaſonable ſatisfaction. And therefore we do propoſe to your
Lordſhips, that if the Treaty may not now continue, it may be adjourned for ſuch time
as you ſhall think fit, and not totally diſſolved, but again reſumed; which we propoſe
as the beſt Expedient now left us for the procuring of a bleſſed Peace, and by it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CXXXVI"/> VVE conceive, if your Lordſhips would weigh our Demands concerning the Power
of the Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms, you will be ſatisfied with our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to your ſeveral Queſtions: Where any Doubts were of the expreſſions, we did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them; and where the Propoſitions were ſo clear as they could bear no doubtful
ſenſe, we did refer your Lordſhips to the Propoſitions themſelves. And we conceive our
Demands concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> to be moſt reaſonable, and all Objections made againſt
them to be by us removed. And why your Lordſhips ſhould inſiſt that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſhould not be nominated by the two Houſes only, and His Majeſty, who is to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſecured, ſhould name none, we much marvel at, when you may well conſider this
Power was not to be exerciſed by the Commiſſioners until a Peace had been concluded
upon this Treaty, and then His Majeſty had been fully ſecured by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and by the Duties and Affections of His Subjects; neither could the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do any thing in violation of the Peace to the prejudice of His Majeſty, contrary to
the Truſt repoſed in them, they having a Rule preſcribed which they were not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
and being removable by both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> and the Eſtates
of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> reſpectively, and being lyable for any miſcarriage to ſevere
puniſhment. And as for their ſecurity who have been with His Majeſty in this War,
an Act of Oblivion is deſired to be paſſed, whereby all His Majeſty's Subjects in both
Kingdoms would have been put in one and the ſame condition and under the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
with ſome exceptions mentioned in thoſe Propoſitions. And if the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had been ſeverally choſen, the memory of theſe unnatural Diviſions muſt needs
have been continued, and probably being ſeverally named, would have acted dividedly
according to ſeveral Intereſts, and the War thereby might be more eaſily revived: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the ſcope of the Propoſitions we have tendred was to take away occaſions of future
Differences, to prevent the raiſing of Arms, and to ſettle a firm and durable Peace.
And to your Lordſhips Objections, that the Commiſſioners were to continue without
any limitation of Time, although the reaſonableneſs thereof hath been ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
to your Lordſhips, yet out of moſt earneſt deſires of Peace we have propoſed to
your Lordſhips a time of ſeven years, as is expreſſed in our Paper delivered to your
Lordſhips the 21<hi>ſt.</hi> of this inſtant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="487" facs="tcp:60710:256"/>
And for the peculiar Royal Power which your Lordſhips mention to reſide in His
Majeſty concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to make Peace and War, we cannot admit thereof,
or that it is otherwiſe exerciſed than by Authority from His Majeſty and both Houſes
of Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> reſpectively;
neither are the Commiſſioners to have power to make Peace or War, but that is referred
to the 23<hi>d.</hi> Propoſition to be Treated upon in due time.</p>
                     <p>And for the Navy and Fleet at Sea, the principal means to maintain them is to be
raiſed by the free gift of the Subjects out of Tonnage and Poundage, and other pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon Merchandice; and the Navy and Fleet being a principal means of our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the reaſons are the ſame for them as for the <hi>Militia</hi> by Land.</p>
                     <p>And for what your Lordſhips alledge concerning Sheriffs and Juſtices of Peace and other
legal Miniſters, not to raiſe the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> or Forces to ſuppreſs Riots, without
being lyable to the interpretation of the Commiſſioners; we ſay this is no part of the
<hi>Militia</hi> to be exerciſed by the Commiſſioners, but in executing of Juſtice and legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
nor can be intended to be any diſturbance, but for the preſervation of the Peace;
nor can their power of hearing and determining Civil Actions and differences be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
further than preſervation of the Articles of the Peace to be made, and as is clearly
and plainly expreſt in the 27<hi>th.</hi> Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>And whereas we ſeek the <hi>Militia</hi> to be ſetled in the 15<hi>th.</hi> Propoſition, and the other
parts of our Propoſitions, in order to and for procuring of a Peace, and which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to a preſent Union, your Lordſhips defer them until the Peace ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Which delay, we hope, upon ſecond thoughts your Lordſhips will not judge to be
reaſonable.</p>
                     <p>And when your Lordſhips do take into ſerious conſideration the great Calamities, and
how occaſioned, (to ſay no more) you cannot think but that we ought to be moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of preventing the like for the future.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing all we deſire for theſe ſo important ends is limited to a few years, we ought
to inſiſt upon ſuch a remedy as may be a fitting cure, and in ſo doing we hope we ſhall
be juſtified before God and Man.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we again moſt earneſtly deſire your Lordſhips, as you tender the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Eſtates of theſe bleeding Kingdoms, the ſetling of Religion, the Honour of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and the compoſing theſe miſerable Diſtractions, that your Lordſhips will give
your full and clear Anſwer to our Demands concerning the <hi>Militia.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CXLIV"/> WE have received no ſatisfaction or information in your Lordſhips Debate, to alter
our opinion of his Majeſties Power to make the Ceſſation in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and having
carefully peruſed and conſidered the Statute alledged by your Lordſhips, we cannot find
any particular clauſe in that Statute, neither have your Lordſhips mentioned any, (though
often deſired by us ſo to do) whereby His Majeſties Power to make a Ceſſation there
is taken away: and therefore we are ſtill of opinion, that His Majeſty had full Power
to make and conſent to that Ceſſation. And we conceive that we have given your
Lordſhips an account of very juſt grounds to induce His Majeſty to do the ſame,
it appearing to His Majeſty by the Letters and Advice from the Lords Juſtices and
Council of that Kingdom, and of the Officers of His Majeſties Army there (which we
have read to your Lordſhips, and of which Letters and Advices we now give<note n="*" place="margin">Copies of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Advices were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly delivered. [In the <hi>Appendix.</hi>]</note>
 Copies
to your Lordſhips) That his Majeſties good Proteſtant Subjects of that Kingdom were in
imminent danger to be over-run by the Rebels, and His Army to be disbanded for want
of neceſſary Supplies; and that there was no ſuch probable way for their Preſervation,
as by making a Ceſſation. Neither have your Lordſhips given us any ſatisfying Reaſons

have been preſerved without a Ceſſation; and therefore we cannot apprehend how His

all your Lordſhips have alledged, that it was unfit for His Majeſty to agree unto
that Ceſſation, being deſtructive to His good Subjects, and to the Proteſtant Religion
there, and only for the advantage of the Popiſh Rebels, to the high Diſhonour of God,

 ſo your Lordſhips in
your whole Debate have not inſiſted or mentioned one clauſe in that Statute (though
often deſired) which makes it good, neither have your Lordſhips given us any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Common-Law, other than by telling us, <hi>That it is againſt the Common-Law,
becauſe the private Intereſt of the Subſcribers for Money, was concerned in it.</hi> To
which we give this Anſwer, That their Intereſt was conditional upon Payment of their
Moneys for the maintenance of the War, which was not performed; and that if they
had paid their Moneys, yet this Ceſſation was rather for the advance of that Intereſt,
there being (as it appears by the<note n="*" place="margin">See the Letters and Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Appendix.</hi> num. 9.</note>
 Papers) no other viſible means of preſervation of the
Army in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that the Statute which gave that private Intereſt, doth not take
away the Kings Power of making a Ceſſation; and we conceive that Argument of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
was waved. But if your Lordſhips ſhall inſiſt upon it, we again deſire, as we did
formerly, that a Caſe may be made of it, and that the Debate may be again reſumed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we know that any Argument was uſed by your Lordſhips from the Proceedings
in Parliament; and if you ſhall give any, we ſhall be ready to anſwer it. And we conceive
that the Advice given to his Majeſty from the Lords Juſtices and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
the Teſtimony of the Officers of the Army, expreſſing the miſerable condition of that
Kingdom, and inability to bear the War, ſhould appear to your Lordſhips to be juſt grounds
for His Majeſties aſſenting to the Ceſſation. One of the Letters delivered by us to your
Lordſhips, bearing date the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1643. was ſent by the Lords Juſtices and
Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in which was incloſed their Letter to the
Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, of which your Lordſhips have likewiſe an Extract,
and a Remonſtrance of the Officers of the Army to the Lords Juſtices and Council there;
and the other Letter of the fifth of <hi>May</hi> 1643. to His Majeſty, was from the Lords Juſtices
and Council of that Kingdom: All which (if your Lordſhips pleaſe) ſhall be examined
by you, with the Originals. And we are therefore of opinion, that our Anſwer formerly
delivered, is a good Anſwer to the point of Ceſſation in queſtion, and that it was not unfit
for His Majeſty to agree to that Ceſſation, nor deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion, nor
for the advantage of the Popiſh Rebels; but much for the advantage of the Proteſtant
Subjects there, who were in apparent hazard of Deſtruction by Force and Famine, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the want of Supplies which had been promiſed to them, as we have formerly
ſaid. And we ſhall give your Lordſhips a further Anſwer to your other Propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

ſatisfied your Lordſhips; and if any Doubts yet remain, we are ready by Conference to
clear them. Your Lordſhips may well call to mind the ſeveral Clauſes we inſiſted upon
in the Statute, and the Arguments we have given from the Common-Law, and other
Proceedings in Parliament: And we do affirm that ſeveral great Sums of Money were
paid by particular Perſons and by Corporations, who, according to the true intent of
the Statute, ought to have the benefit of the ſame, according to divers other Acts of
Parliament in purſuance thereof; and upon failer of Payment by any particular Perſons,
the Forfeiture was to accrue to the common benefit of the reſt, not failing; and we
do deny that the Argument of Intereſt was at all waved by us. And we conceive
thoſe Wants alledged by your Lordſhips (if any ſuch were) in juſtifying the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:60710:258"/>
were ſupplied from time to time by the Houſes of Parliament, until His Majeſties
Forces were ſo quartered in and about the common Roads to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Proviſions going
thither, were intercepted, and neither Money, Cloaths, Victuals, or other things could
paſs by Land with ſafety to be tranſported. And when that both Houſes of Parliament
were deſirous further to ſupply thoſe Wants, and for that purpoſe did tender a Bill to His
Majeſty, it was refuſed. And we will ſtill alledge, that we have no reaſon to be ſatisfied
concerning the Ceſſation by any Arguments uſed by your Lordſhips, or by any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Extracts of the Letters and Papers delivered to us by your Lordſhips, as from
the Lords Juſtices and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Officers of the Army; nor (though
deſired by us) have your Lordſhips afforded us liberty to compare thoſe Extracts with
the Originals, whereby we might have the Names of the Perſons by whom they were
written, which we now again deſire. We are therefore ſtill clearly of opinion as is

who in all probability would have periſhed by Famine and the Sword, if that Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

upon which you intend to inſiſt. And for the ſeveral great Sums of Money that were

we are ſorry that we are compelled, by your Lordſhips inſiſting thereon, to inform
your Lordſhips, that His Majeſty had clear Information, that not only much of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
raiſed by the Act for the four hundred thouſand Pound, which was paſſed for the
better ſuppreſſing that moſt wicked and execrable Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Debts of this Kingdom, but alſo of the Money raiſed by the Statute (on which
your Lordſhips inſiſt) for the ſpeedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.
and other Moneys raiſed by Contribution and Loan for the relief of His Majeſties diſtreſſed
Subjects of that Kingdom, were expended contrary to the intent of the Acts by which the
ſame were levied, and of the Perſons who lent and contributed the ſame, towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Forces in this Kingdom under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and
that many Regiments of Horſe and Foot, levied for the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kerry,</hi> Sir <hi>Faithful Forteſcue,</hi> and others, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
imployed in that Army under the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> and therefore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
refuſed to conſent to the Bill preſented to His Majeſty after this, for the levying
more Money for <hi>Ireland,</hi> juſtly fearing that the ſame might be uſed as the former had been.
And for the few Cloaths (for there were no Moneys) intercepted by his Majeſties Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in His Majeſties Quarters, which are ſaid to be intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſame were
intercepted near <hi>Coventry,</hi> and going thither, after that City had refuſed to receive His
Majeſty, though at the Gates. But His Majeſty never refuſed to give any ſafe Paſs through
His Quarters for any Goods or Proviſions which were intended or prepared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was the ſame ever deſired. For the Extracts and Copies of the Letters delivered by us

having now ſatisfied your Lordſhips in the matter of the Ceſſation, we ſhall gladly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:60710:259"/>
offered, if any other Doubts yet remain, by Conference to clear them, which ſtill we
are ready to do; and we have heard nothing juſt or reaſonable for that Ceſſation. It will
be made evident, that the Neceſſities which by your Lordſhips were made Excuſes for
the Ceſſation, were created on purpoſe to colour the ſame; and we are compelled by your
Lordſhips Paper to let you know, that the Committees of Parliament ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> to
endeavour to ſupply their Neceſſities, were diſcountenanced by the principal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for that Ceſſation, and when they had taken up 2000 <hi>l.</hi> upon their perſonal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the Army there, they were preſently after commanded from the Council by a
Letter brought thither from His Majeſty by the Lord <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Secretary: and when the
Officers of the Army were contented to ſubſcribe for Land in ſatisfaction of their Arrears,
it was declared from His Majeſty, that He diſapproved of ſuch Subſcriptions, whereby
that courſe was diverted. And we do affirm, that whatever Sums of money raiſed for
<hi>Ireland</hi> were made uſe of by both Houſes of Parliament, were fully ſatisfied with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and, as we are informed, before the Bill mentioned in our former Paper was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
by His Majeſty. And for the Regiments of Horſe and Foot mentioned by your
Lordſhips to be raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imployed otherwiſe by the Houſes of Parliament;
it is true that Forces were ſo deſigned, and when the Money, Arms, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
were all ready, and nothing wanting but a Commiſſion from His Majeſty for
the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> who was to command them, the ſame could not be obtained, which
was the cauſe thoſe Forces did not go thither: and when twelve Ships and ſix Pinnaces
were prepared with a thouſand or more Land-Forces for the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
nothing deſired but a Commiſſion from His Majeſty, the Ships lying ready and ſtaying for
the ſame, were three Weeks together at three hundred Pound a day charge; yet the
ſame was denyed, though often deſired. And where your Lordſhips ſeem to imply,
that the Proviſion ſeized by His Majeſties Forces, were going for <hi>Coventry,</hi> it was made
known to His Majeſty, that the ſame were for <hi>Ireland.</hi> And your Lordſhips muſt needs
conceive, that the Papers you delivered to us being but Extracts, and for that you deny
us ſo to compare them with the Originals, as to have the Names of the Perſons by
whom they were written, it is altogether unreaſonable for us to give any credit to
them, it being manifeſt by this and our former Papers and Debates, that the Ceſſation
with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is both unjuſt and unlawful. We therefore inſiſt on our

which induced his Majeſty ſo to do, it being very evident, that by the Ceſſation, there
His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects have been preſerved and ſubſiſted, which without it they
could not have done, the two Houſes forbearing to ſend any relief or ſupply to them, and
His Majeſty not being able. And we deſire your Lordſhips to conſider how impoſſible it
was, whilſt the War continued in <hi>England</hi> with ſuch fierceneſs and animoſity, by Arms to
reduce the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to His Majeſties Obedience; and therefore His Majeſty
had great reaſon to preſerve that by a Ceſſation which he could not reduce by a War:
And we are moſt confident that the Neceſſities (which are not offered as excuſes for, but
were the real grounds of the Ceſſation) were very viſible to all thoſe in that Kingdom,
whoſe Advices His Majeſty ought in reaſon to follow, and whoſe Intereſts were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,

Majeſties directions, that Perſons who were not of His Privy Council there ſhould not be
preſent at thoſe Councils, cannot be interpreted a diſcountenance to them in any thing
they ought to do. And we are moſt aſſured, that His Majeſty ſent no Meſſage or Letter to
divert the courſe of the Officers ſubſcribing for Land in ſatisfaction of their Arrears, but
the Soldiers were meerly diſcouraged from the ſame, by diſcerning that for want of Supplies
they ſhould not be able to go on with that War. And we do aſſure your Lordſhips, that
His Majeſty doth not believe that the Sums of Money raiſed for <hi>Ireland</hi> (which your
Lordſhips do admit to have been made uſe of by both Houſes of Parliament otherwiſe
then was appointed) are yet ſatisfied in any proportion, the greateſtpart of the Money
raiſed upon the Bill for 400000 l. and of the Moneys raiſed upon the charitable Collections,
as well as the Adventurers Moneys, being imployed upon the War here; and if the ſame
were ſince ſatisfied, it doth no ways excuſe the diverting of them, when in the mean time
that Kingdom ſuffered by that diverſion: and that the fear that other Moneys ſo raiſed
might likewiſe be miſimployed, was a great reaſon (amongſt others) that made His
Majeſty not conſent to that Bill mentioned by your Lordſhips. And for the Regiments
of Horſe and Foot, which your Lordſhips in your Paper of the 18. of this Month ſay
were deſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> (though they were imployed otherwiſe, becauſe a Commiſſion
could not be obtained for the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> who was to command thoſe Forces; it is well
known that thoſe Forces were raiſed before His Majeſties Commiſſion was ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and then the Commiſſion that was deſired ſhould have been independent upon His
Majeſties Lieutenant of that Kingdom, and therefore His Majeſty had great reaſon not to
conſent to ſuch a Commiſſion, and ſo the damages of keeping thoſe ſix Pinnaces and the
1000 Land-Forces (if any ſuch were) proceeded not from any default of His Majeſty.
And for the Proviſions ſeized by His Majeſties Forces, it is notorious that they were ſeized
in the way to and near <hi>Coventry,</hi> and that it was not made known to His Majeſty that the
ſame were for <hi>Ireland</hi> till after the ſeizure thereof, when it was impoſſible to recover the
ſame from the Soldiers who had taken them; whereas if a ſafe Conduct had been deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="*" place="margin">of</note>
 by His Majeſty, as it ought to have been, the ſame being to paſs through his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there would have been no Violence or Interruption offered. For the giving the
Names of the Perſons who ſubſcribed the Letters delivered to your Lordſhips (the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of which have been ſhewed to you by us) we have given your Lordſhips a full and
reaſonable Anſwer: and if your Lordſhips will aſſure us, that the giving their Names to you
ſhall be no prejudice to the Perſons who did ſubſcribe, if at any time any of them ſhall be
found within your Quarters, we will forthwith deliver their Names to you; otherwiſe we
conceive your Lordſhips cannot but give credit to that we have ſaid and ſhewed to you.
All which, we hope, hath clearly ſatisfied your Lordſhips, that the Ceſſation with the
Rebels was neither unjuſt nor unlawful, and that you will proceed to ſatisfie us by what
means the War may be managed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with probable hope of the preſervarion of
His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects there; we being very willing to concur with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
in any juſt and honourable way for the good and ſettlement of that miſerable
Kingdom.</p>

ſay, That it appears by the other Papers delivered to us by your Lordſhips, as the Articles of
the Treaty of the ſixth of <hi>August,</hi> and the Ordinances of the eleventh of <hi>April</hi> and ninth
of <hi>March,</hi> and otherwiſe, That the intent is, that that War ſhall be managed by a joynt
Committee of both Kingdoms, and that the Committee of each Kingdom ſhall have a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
voice, and conſequently it is very probable that upon difference of Opinion between
them that War may ſtand ſtill, or, to the utter Ruin of His Majeſties good Subjects there,
be abſolutely diſſolv'd. For whereas your Lordſhips ſay, That in caſe of ſuch Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may proſecute the War as they ſhall
think fit, obſerving the Treaty of the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1642. and the Ordinance of the 11. of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:60710:261"/>
                           <hi>April,</hi> your Lordſhips well know, that by that Treaty and that Ordinance the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> alone cannot proſecute that War, that Ordinance of the
11. of <hi>April</hi> expreſly making the Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> General, Commander in chief
of all Forces in that Kingdom, both <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> without any reference unto His
Majeſty or His Lieutenant of that Kingdom, and directing that the War ſhall be managed
by the Committee of both Kingdoms, without any other reference to the two Houſes of

be paſſed for the confirmation of that Treaty, or the Ordinance of the 11 of <hi>April,</hi> as
your Lordſhips propoſe, by reaſon that thereby all His Majeſties Authority would be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken away in that Kingdom, and in truth that whole Kingdom be thereby delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of His Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which we conceive is neither juſt,
prudent, nor honourable to be done. And we are of Opinion, that it is not agreeable to
His Majeſties Honour, or the Juſtice and Protection which He ows to His Subjects of His
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to put the nomination of His Lieutenant and Judges of that
Kingdom out of Himſelf, and to commit the whole Power of that Kingdom to others,
and to bind Himſelf to paſs all ſuch Acts of Parliament as any time hereafter ſhall be
preſented to Him for raiſing of Moneys, and other things neceſſary for the proſecution
of the War in that Kingdom, which your Lordſhips ſay, in your Paper the 9. of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
you intend by thoſe words [<hi>His Majeſty to aſſiſt,</hi>] in your firſt Paper. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it cannot be expected that His Majeſty ſhould conſent to an Act of Parliament for
proſecution of the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be managed by the Advice of the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <p>For theſe and many other Reaſons, we conceive it doth appear to your Lordſhips that
the Propoſitions, as they are delivered to us by your Lordſhips, are by no means fit to be
conſented to; and therefore we deſire your Lordſhips to make other Propoſitions to us,
which may be for the preſervation and relief of His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects there,

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CLXXIII"/> VVE expected that your Lordſhips would have been fully ſatisfied by what we have
alledged againſt His Majeſties Power to make the Ceſſation with the Rebels in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and we cannot find thoſe important Reaſons which your Lordſhips mentioned to
have induced His Majeſty ſo to do, or that thereby His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects there
have been preſerved or ſubſiſted: but we have made it evident that this Ceſſation tended
to the utter Deſtruction of the Proteſtants in that Kingdom, as we conceived was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by thoſe who adviſed His Majeſty thereunto. And we obſerve, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
urge that this Ceſſation was the only means for the ſubſiſtence of the Proteſtants
there; when it cannot be denied but that very many of the Proteſtants in <hi>Vlſter,
Munſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught</hi> have yet ſubſiſted, although they have refuſed to ſubmit to the
Ceſſation, and oppoſed the ſame as the means intended for their Ruin. And we do
affirm unto your Lordſhips, that the two Houſes of Parliament have been ſo far from
failing to ſupply His Majeſties good Subjects in that Kingdom, that although His
Majeſties Forces have, as much as lay in their power, endeavoured to prevent the
ſame, and have taken to themſelves that which was provided for thoſe whom your
Lordſhips mention to have been in ſo great Want and Extremity, yet the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
not diſcouraged thereby, have conſtantly ſent great proportions of all neceſſary
Supplies unto the Proteſtants there, whereby they have ſubſiſted, and have very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent thither, and have already provided to be ſpeedily ſent after, in Money, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
Cloaths, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries to the value of ſevenſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds: and they have not deſired any other Proviſion from His Majeſty but
what He was well able to afford herein, only His aſſiſtance and Conſent in joyning with
His two Houſes of Parliament, for the better enabling them in the proſecution of that
War. And we are ſo far from apprehending any impoſſibility of reducing that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
during the unhappy diſtractions here, that although many of the Forces provided
by the two Houſes for that end were diverted and imployed againſt the Parliament, to
the increaſing of our Diſtractions, yet the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> have ſubſiſted, and do
ſtill ſubſiſt, and we have juſt cauſe to believe, that if this Ceſſation had not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Rebels (and that in the time of their greateſt Wants) and that theſe Forces
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:60710:262"/>
had not been withdrawn, they might in probability have ſubdued thoſe bloody Rebels,
and finiſhed the War in that Kingdom. For the pretended Neceſſities offered as grounds
of this Ceſſation, we have already given your Lordſhips (we hope) clear information.
For the Perſons whoſe Advice His Majeſty followed therein, your Lordſhips have not
thought fit to make them known unto us, and we cannot conceive their Intereſt in that
Kingdom to be of ſuch conſideration as is by your Lordſhips ſuppoſed: But we know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, that many Perſons of all ſorts have forſaken that Kingdom rather then they
would ſubmit unto this Ceſſation, and great numbers of conſiderable Perſons and other
Proteſtants yet remaining there have oppoſed, and ſtill do oppoſe, that Ceſſation, as the
viſible means of their Deſtruction. The two Houſes ſent their Committees into <hi>Ireland</hi>
for the better ſupplying and encouraging of the Armies there, and to take an account of
the ſtate of the War to be repreſented hither, that what ſhould be found defective might
be ſupplied. What Warrants they iſſued we are ignorant of; but are well aſſured that
what they did was in purſuance of their Duty, and for advancement of the publick
Service, and ſuppreſſing of that horrid Rebellion: and we cannot but ſtill affirm they
were diſcountenanced and commanded from the Council there where the proſecution of
that War was to be managed, and that it was declared from His Majeſty, that he diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of the Subſcriptions of the Officers of the Army, by means whereof that courſe
was diverted.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Moneys raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> we have in our former Papers given your
Lordſhips a full and juſt Anſwer, and we are ſorry the ſame cannot receive credit. Thoſe
Moneys raiſed upon charitable Collections, we do poſitively affirm were only imployed to
thoſe ends for which they were given; and we cannot but wonder the contrary ſhould be
ſuggeſted. We are confident the Commiſſion deſired by the two Houſes for the Lord
<hi>Wharton</hi> (and which your Lordſhips acknowledged was denied) was only ſuch as they
conceived moſt neceſſary for advancement of that Service, and the denial thereof proved
very prejudicial thereunto. And we muſt again inform your Lordſhips, that it was well
known, at the time when the Goods were ſeized by His Majeſties Forces (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
allege, near <hi>Coventry</hi>) that the ſame were then carrying for the ſupply of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſome other Proviſions made and ſent for the ſame purpoſe were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſeized and taken away by ſome of His Majeſties Forces, as we have been credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
not without His Majeſties own knowledge and direction. Your Lordſhips may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that thoſe who ſigned the Letters mentioned in your Papers have done nothing but
what they may well juſtifie; and if the ſame be well done, they need not fear to give an
Account thereof, nor your Lordſhips to ſuppoſe that if they come within our Quarters
they ſhall be otherwiſe dealt withal then ſhall be agreeable to Juſtice. Upon the whole
matter, notwithſtanding the Allegations, Pretences, and Excuſes offered by your Lordſhips
for the Ceſſation made with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we are clearly ſatisfied that the ſame was
altogether unjuſt, unlawful, and deſtructive to His Majeſties good Subjects, and of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to none but the Popiſh bloody Rebels in that Kingdom. And therefore we ſtill
earneſtly inſiſt, as we conceive our ſelves in Conſcience and Duty obliged, upon our former
Demands concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> which we conceive moſt Juſt and Honourable for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to conſent unto. We know no other ways to propound more probable for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of the Rebels there: but theſe being granted, we ſhall chearfully proceed in the
managing of that War, and doubt not, by God's bleſſing, we ſhall ſpeedily ſettle that
Kingdom in their due Obedience to His Majeſty.</p>

by us unto your Lordſhips, there ſhould be a ground for your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that upon any Differences between the Committees or Commanders imployed about
the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the War ſhould ſtand ſtill or be diſſolved: nor do we find that
the Ordinance of the 11. of <hi>April</hi> can produce any ſuch inconvenience as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
do imagine: nor doth the making of the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> Commander in chief of
the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Forces, and the ſettling of the proſecution of the War of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to be managed by the joynt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of both Kingdoms, take away the relation to His Majeſties Authority, or of the
two Houſes of Parliament, or of the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For, in the firſt
place, His Majeſties Conſent is humbly deſired, and the whole Power is derived from
him; only the Execution of it is put into ſuch a way, and the General is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the War according to the Orders he ſhall receive from the Committee of both
Kingdoms; and in caſe of Diſagreement in the Committee, the two Houſes of Parliament
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:60710:262"/>
are to proſecute that War, as is expreſſed in our Anſwer to your Lordſhips ſecond
Paper of the 19. of <hi>February.</hi> And when there ſhall be a Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
that he ſhall joyn with the Commander in chief of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army, the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
is to receive Inſtructions from him, according to the Orders of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of both Kingdoms, as we have ſaid in our Anſwer to your Lordſhips ſecond Paper
of this day. Nor doth the naming of the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> to be General any more take
away the Power of the two Houſes, then if he were a Native of this Kingdom; or is
there any part of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> delivered over into the hands of his Majeſties
Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who do only joyn with their Councils and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for carrying on the War, and reducing that Kingdom to his Majeſties Obedience.
And we conceive it moſt conducing for the good of his Majeſties Service and of
that Kingdom, that the Lieutenant and Judges there ſhould be nominated by the two
Houſes of Parliament, as is expreſſed in the twentieth Propoſition, who will recommend
none to be imployed by his Majeſty in places of ſo great truſt, but ſuch whoſe known
Ability and Integrity ſhall make them worthy of them, which muſt needs be beſt known
to a Parliament; nor are they to have any greater Power conferred upon them by
the granting this Propoſition, then they have had who did formerly execute thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And we know no reaſon why your Lordſhips ſhould make difficulty of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
conſenting to ſuch Acts as ſhall be preſented unto him for raiſing Moneys and
other neceſſaries from the Subject, which is without any charge to himſelf, for no other
end but the ſettling of the true Proteſtant Religion in that Kingdom, and reducing it
to his Majeſties Obedience, for which we hold nothing too dear that can be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us. And we cannot but wonder that your Lordſhips ſhould make the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is but to execute Juſtice upon thoſe bloody Rebels,
who have broken all Laws of God and Man, their Faith, their Allegiance, all bonds of
Charity, all rules of Humanity and humane Society, who have Butchered ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Innocent Chriſtians, Men, Women and Children, whoſe Blood cries up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for Vengeance, ſo many of his Majeſties Subjects, whoſe Lives he is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at their hands that ſpilt them, and to do Juſtice upon them to put away innocent
Blood from himſelf, his Poſterity, the whole Land; theſe execrable Antichriſtian Rebels,
who have made a covenant with Hell to deſtroy the Goſpel of Chriſt, and have taken up
Arms to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, to ſet up Popery, to rend away one of his
Majeſties Kingdoms, and deliver it up into the hands of Strangers, for which they
have negotiations with <hi>Spain</hi> and other States; a War which muſt prevent ſo much
miſchief, do ſo much good, offer up ſuch an acceptable Sacrifice to the Great and
Juſt God of Heaven, who groans under ſo much Wickedneſs to lie ſo long unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
a War which muſt reduce that Kingdom unto his Majeſties Obedience, the moſt
glorious work that this Kingdom can undertake; that the proſecution of ſuch a War
your Lordſhips ſhould make to depend upon any other condition, that the Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe Kingdoms ſhould be laid as an impediment unto it, and that there ſhould
be any thought, any thing which ſhould give thoſe Rebels hope of impunity, if our
Miſeries continue, whereas, according to Chriſtian reaſon and the ordinary courſe of
God's Providence, nothing can be more probable to continue our Miſeries then the

party here, to bring over ſuch Actors of barbarous Cruelties to exerciſe the ſame in

buſineſs of the Ceſſation, which was ſo neceſſary to be made, and being made
to be kept, have not given your Lordſhips ſatisfaction; and that your Lordſhips have
not rather thought fit to make the reaſonableneſs of your Propoſitions concerning <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
appear to us, or to make ſuch as might be reaſonable in the ſtead, then by charging
his Majeſty with many particulars which highly reflect upon his Honour, to compel us to
mention many things in Anſwer to your Lordſhips Allegations, which otherwiſe in a
time of Treaty, when we would rather endeavour to prevent future Inconveniences then
to inſiſt on paſt miſtakes, we deſired to have omitted. And we can no ways admit, that
when the Ceſſation was made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects there could
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:60710:263"/>
have ſubſiſted without that Ceſſation, nor that the War can be maintained and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the ſubduing the Rebels there ſo long as the War continues in this Kingdom; which
are the chief grounds laid for the Aſſertions in your Lordſhips firſt Paper delivered this
day, concerning the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neither can we conceive that your Lordſhips
have alleged any thing that could in the leaſt degree ſatisfie us, that his Majeſty had no
Power to make that Ceſſation, or had no Reaſon ſo to do, conſidering (as we have
formerly ſaid, and do again inſiſt upon it) that by that Ceſſation (which was not made
till long after this Kingdom was embroiled in a miſerable War) the poor Proteſtants
there (who for want of Supplies from hence were ready to famiſh and be deſtroyed)
were preſerved, and that Kingdom kept from utter Ruin, (ſo far was it from being a
deſign for their Deſtruction, or for the advantage of the Popiſh bloody Rebels, as is
inſinuated:) for it appears by the Letters of the Lords Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Sir <hi>William
Parſons</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlaſe,</hi> and of the Council there, of the fourth of <hi>April</hi> 1643. before
that Ceſſation made, directed to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, a Copy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we delivered to your Lordſhips, though we preſume you may have the Original,
<hi>That His Majeſties Army and good Subjects there were in danger to be devoured for want of
needful Supplies forth of</hi> England; <hi>and that His Majeſties Forces were of Neceſſity ſent
abroad, to try what might be done for ſuſtaining them in the Country, to keep them alive
until Supplies ſhould get to them: but that deſign failing, thoſe their hopes were converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
aſtoniſhment, to behold the Miſeries of the Officers and Souldiers for want of all things,
and all thoſe Wants made unſupportable in the want of Food; and divers Commanders and
Officers declaring they had little hope to be ſupplied by the Parliament, preſſed with ſo great
importunity to be permitted to depart the Kingdom, as that it would be extreme difficult to
keep them there.</hi> And in another part of that Letter (for we ſhall not grieve you with
mention of all their Complaints) they expreſſed, <hi>That they were expelling thence all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and muſt inſtantly ſend away for</hi> England <hi>thouſands of poor deſpoiled</hi> Engliſh, <hi>whoſe very
eating was then unſupportable to that place; that their Confuſions would not admit the writing
of many more Letters, if any,</hi> (for they had written divers others, expreſſing their great
Neceſſities.) <hi>And to the end His Majesty and the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation might not irrecoverably and
unavoidably ſuffer, they did deſire that then (though it were almoſt at the point to be too late)
ſupplies of Victuals and Ammunition in preſent might be haſtned thither to keep life until the reſt
might follow, there being no Victual in the ſtore, nor a hundred Barrells of Powder</hi> (a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to defend a Kingdom) <hi>left in the ſtore, when the out-Garriſons (as they were to be instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
were ſupplied and that remainder, according to the uſual neceſſary expence, beſides extraordinary
accidents, would not laſt above a Month.</hi> And in that Letter they ſent a Paper ſigned by ſundry
Officers of the Army, delivered to them as they were ready to ſign that Diſpatch, and by them
apprehended to threaten imminent Danger, which mentioned, <hi>That they were brought to that
great exigence, that they were ready to rob and ſpoil one another; that their Wants began to make
them deſperate that if the Lords Juſtices and Council there did not find a ſpeedy way for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
they did deſire that they might have leave to go away; that if that were not granted,

                        <p>And by a Letter of the 11. of <hi>May</hi> following (a Copy whereof we have alſo delivered
to your Lordſhips) the Lords Juſtices and Council there did advertiſe his Majeſty, <hi>That
they had no Victual, Cloaths, or other Proviſions, no Money to provide them of any thing they
want, no Arms, not above 40. Barrels of Powder, no ſtrength of ſerviceable Horſe, no viſible
means by Sea or Land of being able to preſerve that Kingdom; and that though the Winds had
in many days, and often formerly, ſtood very fair for acceſſions of Supplies forth of</hi> England (the
two Houſes having then and ever ſince the full Command of thoſe Seas) <hi>yet to their unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
grief, after full ſix months waiting, and much longer patience and long ſuffering, they found
their expectations anſwered in an inconſiderable quantity of Proviſions,</hi> viz. 75 <hi>Barrels of Butter
and 14 Tun of Cheeſe, being but the fourth part of a ſmall Veſſels-loading, which was ſent from</hi>
London, <hi>and arrived there on the fifth of</hi> May, <hi>which was not above 7 or 8 days Proviſions for
that part of the Army, in and about</hi> Dublin; <hi>no Money or Victuals (other then that inconſiderable
proportion of Victuals) having arrived there as ſent from the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>or from
any other forth of</hi> England, <hi>for the uſe of the Army ſince the beginning of</hi> November <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
And beſides theſe, whereof we have<note n="*" place="margin">given.</note>
 Copies to your Lordſhips, it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to His Majeſty by Petition from that Kingdom, <hi>That all means by which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and life ſhould be conveyed to that gaſping Kingdom ſeemed to be totally obstructed,
and that unleſs timely relief were afforded, His Loyal Subjects there muſt yield their Fortunes
for a Prey, their Lives for a Sacrifice, and their Religion for a Scorn to the mercileſs
Rebels.</hi> Upon all which deplorable paſſages, repreſented by Perſons principally inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
in the managing of the affairs of that Kingdom and the War there, in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
were Sir <hi>William Parſons,</hi> Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Meredith,</hi>
Perſons of great eſtimation with your Lordſhips (to which we could add many other Advices
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:60710:263"/>
and Letters from ſeveral men of Repute and Quality, but that we will not trouble
your Lordſhips with Repetition of private Advices) we cannot think but your Lordſhips
are now ſatisfied, that the Neceſſities of that Kingdom, which were the ground of the
Ceſſation there, were real, and not pretended: and therefore for Excuſes, we leave them
to them who ſtand in need of them; and we deſire your Lordſhips to conſider, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
condition of this Kingdom was, what other way could be imagined for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of that Kingdom, than by giving way to that Ceſſation. And though it is inſiſted
on in your Lordſhips Paper, that ſome Proteſtants in <hi>Vlſter, Munſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> (who
have refuſed to ſubmit to that Ceſſation) have yet ſubſiſted; yet your Lordſhips well
know theſe were generally of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, who had ſtrong Garriſons provided and
appointed to them, and were in thoſe parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> near the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
whence more ready ſupplies of Victuals might be had, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could have from
<hi>England,</hi> and for whoſe Supply (as His Majeſty hath been credibly informed, and we believe
that your Lordſhips know it to be true) ſpecial care was taken, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces
and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Subjects there were neglected, whereby they were expoſed to
apparent Deſtruction by Sword and Famine. And we cannot but wonder at the Aſſertion,
That His Majeſties Forces have, as much as lay in them, endeavoured to prevent thoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at the mention of the intercepting thoſe Proviſions near <hi>Coventry,</hi>
with His Majeſties own knowledge and direction; whereas, as we have formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
your Lordſhips, it was not known to His Majeſty, that thoſe Proviſions which
were taken near <hi>Coventry</hi> going thither, when His Majeſties Forces were before it, were
intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> till after the ſeiſure thereof, when it was impoſſible to recover them
from the Souldiers; which might have been prevented, if a ſafe Conduct had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
through His Majeſties Quarters, which we are aſſured he would have readily granted
for thoſe or any other Supplies for that Kingdom, but was never asked of him. And as
there is no particular Inſtance of any other Proviſions for <hi>Ireland</hi> intercepted by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Forces, but thoſe near <hi>Coventry,</hi> which were conſiderable; ſo we can aſſure your
Lordſhips, that when His Majeſty was in the greateſt wants of all Proviſions, and might have
readily made uſe of ſome provided for <hi>Ireland,</hi> lying in Magazines within His Quarters,
yet he gave expreſs Order for the ſending them away, which was done accordingly, and
would have ſupplyed them further out of His own Store, if He had been able. And no
man can be unſatisfied of His Majeſties tender ſenſe of the Miſeries of His Proteſtant Subjects
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they ſhall remember how readily He gave His Royal Aſſent to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
or Acts for raiſing of Men, Moneys, and Arms for them; that He offered to paſs
over in Perſon for their Relief, (which His Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> approved, and
declared it to be an Argument of Care in His Majeſty) and if that had proceeded, it might
in poſſibility have quenched the flames of that unhappy Rebellion, as long before it might
probably have been prevented, if the Army of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives there had been ſuffered to
have been tranſported out of that Kingdom, as was directed by His Majeſty.</p>
                        <p>What Proviſions are lately ſent, or are now ſending to <hi>Ireland</hi> from the two Houſes,
we know not: but His Majeſty hath been informed, that even thoſe Proviſions are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in purſuance of the late Treaty concerning <hi>Ireland</hi> made with His Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi>
without His Majeſties conſent, and only for ſuch who have declared themſelves againſt
His Majeſties Miniſters, and in oppoſition to that Ceſſation to which many of them had
formerly conſented, though they have ſince, upon private Intereſt, and the Incouragement
and Solicitations of others, oppoſed the ſame: and therefore His Majeſty cannot look upon
thoſe Supplies as a Support for the War againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, or as a Repayment of thoſe
Moneys, which being raiſed by Acts of Parliament for that War, have been formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to other uſes, of which Money 100000 <hi>l.</hi> at one time was iſſued out for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Forces under the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as to diverting the Forces provided for the reducing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it ought not to be objected to His Majeſty, conſidering the Forces under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> had been formerly diverted and imployd
againſt Him in the War here in <hi>England;</hi> yet it is evident they were not brought over till
after the Ceſſation, when they could no longer ſubſiſt there, and that there was no preſent
uſe for them; and before thoſe Forces brought over, there was an attempt to bring the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as likewiſe divers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers there, into this Kingdom; and
ſince the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> their General, and divers <hi>Scotch</hi> Forces were actually brought over.</p>
                        <p>To the Allegations that many Perſons of all ſorts have forſaken the Kingdom, rather
than they would ſubmit to that Ceſſation, we know of none: but it is manifeſt, that divers
who had left that Kingdom, becauſe they would have been famiſhed, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
there, ſince that Ceſſation, have returned.</p>
                        <p>Touching the Committee ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> we have already anſwered, they were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
by His Majeſty in what they lawfully might do, although they went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:60710:264"/>
His Privity, but conceive your Lordſhips will not inſiſt that they ſhould
ſit with the Privy-Council there, and aſſume to themſelves to adviſe and interpoſe as
Privy-Councellors. And we again deny the Subſcriptions of the Officers of the Army
was diverted by His Majeſty; and it is well known, that ſome Officers apprehending upon
ſome ſpeeches, that the drift in requiring Subſcriptions, was to engage the Army againſt
His Majeſty, in deteſtation thereof upon thoſe ſpeeches rent the Book of Subſcription in
pieces.</p>
                        <p>For the diverſion of the Moneys raiſed for that War, if they had been ſince repaid,
(the contrary whereof is credibly informed to His Majeſty) yet that preſent Diverſion
might be, and we believe was, a great means of the future Wants of that Kingdom which
induced the Ceſſation. As to the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Commiſſion, we conceive we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
fully ſatisfied your Lordſhips the juſt Reaſons thereof.</p>
                        <p>For the Letters whereof your Lordſhips had Copies, we conceive that you being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſatisfied of the Contents, and that they came from the Lords Juſtices and Council there,
your Lordſhips need not doubt of the truth of the matter: and for the Names of the ſingle
Perſons ſubſcribing, we cannot conceive it is deſired for any other purpoſe, than to be
made uſe of againſt ſuch of them as ſhould come into your Quarters, you having not
granted, though deſired, that it ſhall not turn to their Prejudice, if we ſhould give in
their Names.</p>
                        <p>Upon what hath been ſaid it appears, that His Majeſties <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Subjects in
<hi>Ireland</hi> could not ſubſiſt without a Ceſſation; and that the War there cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or proſecuted to the ſubduing of the Rebels there, during the continuance of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
War here, is evident to any man that ſhall conſider, that this Kingdom labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a War which imploys all the Force and Wealth at home, cannot, nor will ſpare
conſiderable Supplies to ſend abroad; or if it could, yet whiles there are mutual Jealouſies
that there cannot be that concurrence in joynt Advices betwixt the King, and the two
Houſes, as will be neceſſary, if that War be proſecuted; and that His Majeſty cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend,
or your Lordſhips in reaſon expect His Majeſty ſhould by His Conſent to Acts of
Parliament for the managing of that War, and raiſing moneys to that purpoſe, put ſo great a
Power into their hands, who, during theſe Troubles, may, if they will, turn that Power
againſt Him; and it is apparent, that the continuance of the War here, muſt inevitably
cauſe the continuance of the Miſeries there, and endanger the rending of that Kingdom
from this Crown.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="CLXXVI"/> VVE do very much wonder, that it doth not clearly appear to your Lordſhips, that
upon any difference between the Committees of both Kingdoms in the managing
the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (in the manner propoſed by your Lordſhips) the War there muſt
ſtand ſtill, or be diſſolved: for if the Ordinance of the 11th of <hi>April</hi> be by His Majeſties
Royal Aſſent made an Act of Parliament, (as your Lordſhips deſire) all the Forces of
that Kingdom, both <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> are put under the abſolute Command of the Earl of
<hi>Leven</hi> the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General, and the managing the War committed wholly to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of both Kingdoms, without any reference to the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by themſelves: ſo that whatſoever your Lordſhips ſay of your intentions, that the
the two Houſes of Parliament here ſhall upon ſuch difference manage the War (which
yet you ſay muſt be obſerving the Treaty of the 6th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the ſaid Ordinance of
the 11th of <hi>April</hi>) it is very evident, if that Ordinance ſhould be made a Law, the War
muſt ſtand ſtill or be diſſolved, upon difference of opinion between the Committee of both
Kingdoms, or elſe the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> muſt carry on the War according to his diſcretion;
for he is in no degree bound to obſerve the Orders or Directions of the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England</hi> by themſelves. Neither doth the asking His Majeſties Conſent at all alter
the Caſe from what we ſtated it to your Lordſhips in our Paper of the 20. of this Inſtant;
for we ſaid then, and we ſay ſtill, that if His Majeſty ſhould conſent to what you propoſe,
He would deveſt himſelf of all his Royal Power in that Kingdom, and reſerve no Power
or Authority in Himſelf over that War, which is moſt neceſſary for His Kingly Office to
do. For your Lordſhips Expreſſion, <hi>when there ſhall be a Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
your Lordſhips cannot but be informed that His Majeſty hath made, and we doubt
not but you acknowledge he hath power to make the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> His Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of that Kingdom, and who is very well able to manage and carry on that War, in
ſuch manner as ſhall be thought neceſſary for the good of that Kingdom; and there is no
queſtion but that the naming the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> to be General, to receive Orders only from
the joynt Committee of both Kingdoms, doth more take away the Power of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
here, than if he were a Native of this Kingdom, and to obey the Orders of the two
Houſes. And we conceive it evident, that the giving the abſolute Command of all Forces,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:60710:264"/>
both <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> General of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Forces, who is to
manage the War according to the Directions of the joynt Committee of both Kingdoms,
doth not amount to leſs than to deliver the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> over into the hands
of His Majeſties Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and therefore we muſt ask your
Lordſhips Pardon, to believe our ſelves obliged in Prudence, Honour, and Conſcience, very
much to inſiſt on that conſideration, and very earneſtly to recommend the ſame to your
Lordſhips. And we conceive it moſt conducing to the good of His Majeſties Service and
of that Kingdom, and the Lieutenant and Judges there be nominated (as they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been) by His Majeſty, who will be ſure to employ none in places of ſo great Truſt,
but ſuch, whoſe known Ability and Integrity ſhall make them worthy; and if at any
time He ſhall finde himſelf deceived by thoſe He ſhall chuſe, can beſt make them Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of His Juſtice, as they have been of His Grace and Favour. And we beſeech your
Lordſhips to conſider how impoſſible it is for His Majeſty to receive that meaſure of Duty,
Reverence and Application, which is due to Him, and His Royal Progenitors have always
enjoyed, if it be not in His own immediate Power to reward thoſe whom he ſhall by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
diſcern worthy of publick Truſt and Imployment. We have made no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to your Lordſhips of His Majeſties conſenting to Acts for the raiſing of moneys, and
other neceſſaries for the ſetling of the true Proteſtant Religion in that Kingdom; only
we think it unreaſonable that His Majeſty ſhould engage himſelf (as is propoſed) to paſs
all ſuch Acts as ſhall be preſented to Him, before He know whether ſuch Acts are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
or no, and whether thoſe (<hi>other neceſſaries</hi>) may not comprehend what in truth
is not only unneceſſary, but very inconvenient. Neither will the Argument, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
are to be raiſed from His Subjects, without any charge to Himſelf, ſeem reaſonable
to His Majeſty, His Majeſty conſidering His own charge much leſs than the Damage and
Preſſures which may thereby befall His good Subjects, the preſerving them from which, is
His Majeſties moſt ſollicitous and earneſt deſire. And we cannot but wonder that your
Lordſhips ſhould conceive any Expreſſions made by us, concerning the Proſecution of that
War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be unagreeable to the Zeal of Perſons abundantly ſenſible of that
Blood and Horrour of that Rebellion. We agree with you, they have broken the Laws
of God and Man, their Faith, their Allegiance, the Bonds of Charity, Rules of Humanity
and human Society; and we heartily wiſh that it were in His Majeſties Power to do juſtice
upon, and make up thoſe breaches of all thoſe Rules and Bonds; and to that purpoſe we
have deſired to be ſatisfied by your Lordſhips what probable courſe may be taken for the
remedying thoſe miſchiefs, and preſerving the remainder of His Majeſties good Proteſtant
Subjects: but without doubt the proſecution of that War ſo much depends upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Diſtractions of His Majeſties other Kingdoms, that the Information your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
give us of the Negotiation with <hi>Spain</hi> and other States, for delivering up that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from His Majeſties Obedience into the hands of Strangers, deſerves the moſt ſtrict Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
how His Majeſties two other Kingdoms can be applied to the Relief of the third,
whilſt theſe Diſtractions are in their own Bowels, and the continuance of the miſeries in
the two, muſt render thoſe in the third remedileſs, if it be not preſerved by ſome other
means than the proſecution of the War. Neither can it be foreſeen or determined what
help or aſſiſtance either Party may make uſe of, where it finds it ſelf oppreſſed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
by the other, eſpecially when it calls in any help, and leaves no means unattempted
to deſtroy the other. And we beſeech your Lordſhips, in the Bowels of Chriſtian Charity
and Compaſſion, and in the Name of him who is the Prince of Peace, and who will make
an Inquiſition for Blood, to conſider, whether all our endeavours ought not to be, to ſtop
theſe Bloody Iſſues in all His Majeſties Dominions; and whether the juſt God of Heaven,
who for our Sins hath made the ſeveral Nations under His Majeſties Government, to be
Scourges of one another, and of His Majeſty Himſelf, under whoſe Obedience they ſhould
all live, can be delighted with the Sacrifice of Blood, and the Blood of Chriſtians; and
whether it would not be more agreeable to our Chriſtian Profeſſion, to endeavour the
binding up of thoſe wounds, which Intereſts, Paſſion and Animoſity have made. We
deſire your Lordſhips to conſider theſe things, and to make ſuch Propoſitions to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Ireland,</hi> (ſince it is apparent, that thoſe already made by you, are by no means fit
to be conſented to) as may be for the growth and propagation of the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Peace and Happineſs of that Kingdom, and the welfare of all His Majeſties

neceſſary to make the Ceſſation in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when by undeniable Proofs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of all Circumſtances, it is moſt clear, that the Neceſſities alledged for grounds
of that Ceſſation, were made by deſign of the Popiſh and Prelatical Party in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> who ſo wickedly contrived the ſame, that the Proviſions ſent thither by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Relief of His Majeſties good Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were diſpoſed of and afforded
to the Rebels there in their greateſt wants; and then when your Lordſhips affirm the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
to be in ſo great extremity; and even at that time alſo when the Officers of our
Army and Garriſons, preſſing for leave to march into the Enemies Countrey to live upon
them, and ſave their own Stores, ſome who were driven forth, had great quantities of
Proviſions out with them, yet were not permitted to march into the Enemies Countrey,
but kept near <hi>Dublin,</hi> until their Proviſions were ſpent, and then commanded back again;
others could not obtain leave to go forth, but were commanded to ſtay at home, that
their own Proviſions might be the ſooner conſumed, and thereby the Neceſſity made
greater. Notwithſtanding, by the care of both Houſes of Parliament here for their ſupply,
they were able to ſubſiſt, and did ſubſiſt at the time of that Ceſſation, although the making
thereof reduced them to far greater Neceſſities than otherwiſe they could have ſuffered,
beſides the notorious advantage thereby to the Rebels, when their Wants and Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were moſt preſſing. And we ſhould not again have troubled your Lordſhips with
theſe Anſwers, had they not been cauſed by your own Repetition of the Letters, of
part whereof you have given us Copies, though not the knowledge of the Perſons from
whom they came; only you were pleaſed to mention the Lords Juſtices and Council there;
yet we were aſſured, even by ſome who were of the Council at that time when the
Letters were written, that the ſame was done only to preſs for Supplies from hence,
without the leaſt intention in them of inducing a Ceſſation; neither do the Copies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any thing tending to a Ceſſation, or the leaſt mention thereof. And we have cauſe
to grieve, not only at what your Lordſhips expreſs concerning the complaints from <hi>Ireland</hi>
and their great extremities, but that the ſame being procured and increaſed by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Party, yet we ſhould find ſuch earneſt endeavours to lay the blame and neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
upon the two Houſes of Parliament here, who have been ſo zealous for their Relief,
and whoſe only care (under the Bleſſing of God) hath been their Preſervation, and
that in the heat of our own miſerable Diſtractions, have continued their Supplies, and
from our own great Wants, have not ſpared to afford our Brethren there the means of
their ſubſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>The Proteſtants in <hi>Munſter, Connaught</hi> and <hi>Vlſter,</hi> who oppoſed this Ceſſation, were
many of them <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and both they and the <hi>Scots</hi> ſuffering under as great Wants and
Failer of Supplies as the Proteſtants in other places, and in no better poſture of their own
defence, notwithſtanding in a true ſenſe of their own Duty and Conſcience, they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and ſtill do oppoſe the ſame: neither were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there neglected, as your
Lordſhips have been miſinformed by ſuch who labour to deſtroy both Nations, and, as a
means thereto, to divide them.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the Goods ſeiſed near <hi>Coventry,</hi> we have mentioned other particulars aſſerted
to be ſeiſed, not without His Majeſties own knowledge and direction, as we are informed,
and are moſt unwilling to believe: Neither do we underſtand it to be an excuſe for ſeiſing
ſome Goods, to ſay that His Majeſty did forbear to ſeiſe others in His Power; but when
His Majeſty ſhall rightly ponder the horridneſs of that Rebellion, we hope thoſe wicked
Inſtruments who contrived, and do ſupport the ſame, will have no power to alter His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
tender ſenſe of the miſeries of His Proteſtants Subjects in that Kingdom, nor at all
to leſſen His Piety and gracious Care for quenching the Flames of that unhappy Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                        <p>We do again affirm unto your Lordſhips the truth of what we ſaid before concerning
the Supplies of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the two Houſes; and it ſeems ſtrange, that what hath been lately
ſent ſhould not be looked upon as a Support of the War againſt the Rebels, by which only
the Proteſtants were enabled to defend themſelves, and to infeſt their Enemies: nor can
we imagine any other means as a Support of that juſt War, being moſt aſſured that if this
had not been done, the Rebels muſt certainly have prevailed, and the remnant of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
good Subjects of that Kingdom have periſhed.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordſhips are pleaſed to remember ſome moneys by us imployed, particularly one
hundred thouſand Pounds, which was raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> all which have been re-ſatisfied
with advantage; and we muſt, as often as you are pleaſed to repeat it, refer your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
to our former juſt and clear Anſwers concerning the ſame, and the like for the Forces
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:60710:265"/>
under the Command of the Lord <hi>Wharton.</hi> And we believe what your Lordſhips expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Forces brought hither to His Majeſty out of <hi>Ireland</hi> after the Ceſſation, it
being one end for which the Ceſſation was made, that thoſe Forces might be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the two Houſes of Parliament here; and thoſe <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Forces which came over, were
not ſent for.</p>
                        <p>We know of no Perſons who have returned into <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the Ceſſation, except ſuch

                        <p>It is probable that ſome might endeavour to alienate the hearts of the Officers of the

                        <p>It is ſo far from being made appear that His Majeſties <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
could not ſubſiſt without a Ceſſation, that the contrary is undeniable, and that His
Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects there, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> who have oppoſed that
Ceſſation, have ſubſiſted, and do ſtill ſubſiſt; and we are ſorry to find any inclination to
continue that Ceſſation, which whenſoever made, will be eſteemed by all good Proteſtants
a countenancing of that bloody Rebellion.</p>

there can no ſuch Inconvenience follow upon confirming the Ordinance of the 11. of
<hi>April</hi> by Act of Parliament as your Lordſhips do imagine; it being deſired that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> be in like manner confirmed, by which the Commanders of the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> are to be anſwerable to His Majeſty and the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> for their whole deportment and proceeding there; and it being deſired
by the 13. Propoſition, that the Proſecutions of the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be ſettled in both
Houſes of Parliament: all which taken together, it cannot follow, that upon any Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between the Committees there, the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> may carry on the War accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own diſcretion. As for our Expreſſion [<hi>when there ſhall be a Lieutenant in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land]
which was uſed in Anſwer to your Lordſhips ſecond Paper of the 20. of <hi>February,</hi>
it was to ſatisfie your Lordſhips, that there could be no interfering between the Powers
of the Lord Lieutenant and of the Earl of <hi>Leven;</hi> and ſtill we ſay, when there ſhall be a
Lord Lieutenant choſen, as is expreſſed in our 20. Propoſition, (for we do not admit the
Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> to be ſo) the Commander in chief of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army is to receive
Inſtructions from him, in ſuch manner as we have laid it down in that Anſwer of ours to
your Lordſhips Paper above-mentioned: which will, we hope, ſatisfie your Lordſhips other
Objection, that this is not to deliver over the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> into the hands
of His Majeſties Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeeing ſuch of that Nation as are there
imployed, are to be ſubordinate to the Committee of both Kingdoms, and in caſe of Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
an Appeal lies to the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in whom the
power of proſecuting the War, is to be ſettled. And we muſt inſiſt to deſire that the Lord
Lieutenant and the Judges in that Kingdom may be nominated by the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who have by ſad experience (to the great coſt of this Kingdom, expence of ſo
much Treaſure and Blood, the loſs of many thouſand Lives there, and almoſt of all that
whole Kingdom from His Majeſties Obedience, and an ineſtimable prejudice to the true
Proteſtant Religion) found the ill conſequence of a bad choice of Perſons for thoſe
great places of Truſt. Therefore for His Majeſties Honour, the good of His Service, the
great Advantage it will be to the reſt of His Majeſties Dominions, the great Comfort to all
good Chriſtians, and even an acceptable Service to God himſelf, for the attaining of ſo
much good, and the prevention of ſo much evil, they deſire to have the nomination of
thoſe great Officers, that by a prudent and careful Election they may, by providing for
the good of that now miſerable Kingdom, diſcharge their Duty to God, the King, and
their Countrey. And certainly, if it be neceſſary to reduce that Kingdom, and that the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:60710:266"/>
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> be a faithful Council to his Majeſty, and fit to be truſted with
the proſecution of that War, (which his Majeſty was once pleaſed to put into their hands,
and they faithfully diſcharged their parts in it, notwithſtanding many practices to obſtruct
their proceedings, as is ſet forth in ſeveral Declarations of Parliament) then, we ſay, your
Lordſhips need not think it unreaſonable that His Majeſty ſhould ingage himſelf to
paſs ſuch Acts as ſhall be preſented to him for raiſing Moneys and other neceſſaries for that
War: for if the War be neceſſary (as never War was more) that which is neceſſary for
the maintaining of it muſt be had, and the Parliament that doth undertake and manage
it, muſt needs know what will be neceſſary, and the People of <hi>England,</hi> who have truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with their Purſe, will never begrudge what they make them lay out upon that
occaſion. Nor need his Majeſty fear the Parliament will preſs more upon the Subject
then is fit in proportion to the occaſion. It is true that heretofore Perſons about his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
have endeavoured and prevailed too much, in poſſeſſing him againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for not giving away the Money of the Subject when his Majeſty had deſired it;
but never yet did his Majeſty reſtrain them from it, and we hope it will not be
thought that this is a fit occaſion to begin. We are very glad to find that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
are ſo ſenſible in your expreſſions of the Blood and Horrour of that Rebellion, and
it is without all queſtion in His Majeſties Power to do Juſtice upon it, if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
be willing that the Ceſſation and all Treaties with thoſe bloody and unnatural
Rebels be made void, and that the proſecution of the War be ſettled in the two Houſes of
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to be managed by the joynt advice of both Kingdoms, and
the King to aſſiſt, and to do no Act to diſcountenance or moleſt them therein. This
we dare affirm to be more than a probable courſe for the remedying thoſe miſchiefs, and
preſerving the remainder of His Majeſties good Subjects there. We cannot believe your
Lordſhips will think it fit there can be any Agreement of Peace, any reſpite from Hoſtility,
with ſuch Creatures as are not fit to live, no more than with Wolves or Tigers, or any
ravenous Beaſts, deſtroyers of mankind. And we beſeech you, do not not think it muſt
depend upon the condition of His Majeſties other Kingdoms to revenge or not revenge
God's Quarrel upon ſuch perfiduous Enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt, who have imbrued
their hands in ſo much Proteſtant Blood; but conſider the Ceſſation that is made with
them is for their advantage, and rather a Protection then a Ceſſation of Acts of Hoſtility,
as if it had been all of their own contriving; Arms, Ammunition, and all manner of
Commodities may be brought unto them; and they may furniſh themſelves, during this
Ceſſation, and be aſſiſted and protected in ſo doing; that afterwards they may the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the ſmall remainder of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects. We beſeech your Lordſhips
in the bowels of Chriſtian Charity and Compaſſion to ſo many poor Souls who muſt periſh,
if the ſtrength of that raging Adverſary be not broken, and in the Name of him who is
the Prince of Peace, who hates to be at Peace with ſuch ſhedders of Blood, give not your
conſents to the continuation of this Ceſſation of War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and leſs to the making of
any Peace there, till Juſtice have been fully executed upon the Actors of that accurſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
Let not the Judgment of War within this Kingdom, which God hath laid upon
us for our Sins, be encreaſed by ſo great a Sin as any Peace or Friendſhip with them: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
becomes of us, if we muſt periſh, yet let us go to our Graves with that comfort,
that we have not made Peace with the Enemies of Chriſt, yea even Enemies of mankind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and unreconciled Enemies to our Religion and Nation: let not our War be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
to that War, for we are ſure that Peace will be a hindrance to our Peace. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
War there as much as we do Peace here: for both we are willing to lay out our Eſtates,
our Lives, and all that is dear unto us in this World; and we have made Propoſitions unto
your Lordſhips for both, if you were pleaſed to agree unto them. We can but look up
to God Almighty, beſeech him to encline your hearts, and caſting our ſelves on him,
wait his good time for the return of our Prayers in ſettling a ſafe and happy Peace here,
and giving ſucceſs to our Endeavours in the proſecution of the War of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

been by us ſent up to both Houſes of Parliament from time to time as we received them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

declared to your Lordſhips, that when the Houſes ſhall be ſatisfied in the good progreſs of

give your Lordſhips ſatisfaction in all particulars of this Treaty, have produced
no better effects towards a bleſſed Peace, which his Majeſty, and we who are truſted by
him, do ſo heartily pray for; and that ſo many and great Offers made by us to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
in the particulars we have Treated upon, ſhould not be thought a good progreſs on
our part in the ſaid Treaty, as we find by your Lordſhips laſt Paper (to our great grief)
they are not, and therefore that this muſt be the laſt day of the Treaty. We deſire your
Lordſhips to conſider, that we being intruſted by his Majeſty to Treat with your Lordſhips
for a ſafe and well grounded Peace, have upon the matter of your Lordſhips Propoſitions
conſented to ſo many particulars and alterations of very great importance, and that your
Lordſhips, who were to Treat with us, have not abated one tittle of the moſt ſevere and
rigorous of your Propoſitions, ſaving what you were pleaſed the laſt Night to propoſe in
the point of Time concerning the <hi>Militia;</hi> which though it ſeems to be limited to ſeven
years, in truth leaves it as unlimited as it was before in your-Propoſitions; for at the end of
ſeven years, it muſt not be exerciſed otherwiſe than ſhall be ſettled by his Majeſty and the
two Houſes of Parliament: ſo that all the Legal Power now in his Majeſty is taken away,
and not reſtored after the ſeven years expired. Neither is there a full conſent to that limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
offered by your Lordſhips the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor
have your Lordſhips offered to us any proſpect towards Peace, other than by ſubmitting
totally to thoſe Propoſitions; the which if we ſhould do, we ſhould conſent to ſuch Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as by Conſtructions and Conſequences may diſſolve the whole frame of the preſent
Government, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, in this Kingdom. And though the particulars
propoſed by your Lordſhips have by Debate appeared not only evidently unreaſonable, but,
literally conſidered, to comprehend things to be extended to Powers not intended by your
ſelves; yet your Lordſhips have not been pleaſed either to reſtrain or interpret any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in any other manner than as is ſet forth in the ſaid Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of <hi>Religion</hi> we have offered all ſuch Alterations as we conceive may give
ſatisfaction to any Objections that have been, or can be made againſt that Government, and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:60710:268"/>
have given your Lordſhips Reaſons not onely why we cannot conſent to your Lordſhips
Propoſitions, but that even thoſe Propoſitions, if conſented to, could not be in order
to a Reformation, or to the procuring the publick Peace. And we muſt deſire your
Lordſhips to remember, that though you do not onely in your Covenant (which you
require may be taken by his Majeſty, and enjoyned to be taken by all his Subjects) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Reformation in point of Government, but even in point of Doctrine too,
thereby laying an imputation upon the Religion it ſelf ſo long profeſſed in this Kingdom,
with the general approbation of all Reformed Churches; yet your Lordſhip, have not
given us the leaſt Argument, nor ſo much as intimated in your Debate the leaſt Prejudice
to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt which we preſume you cannot make
any colourable Objection; nor have you given us the view in particular of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you deſire ſhould be ſubmitted to in the place of that you propoſe to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and therefore we propoſe to your Lordſhips, if the Alterations propoſed by us, do
not give your Lordſhips ſatisfaction, that ſo great an Alteration as the total Abolition of
a Government eſtabliſhed by Law may, for the Importance of it, and any Reformation
in Doctrine, for the Scandal of it, be ſuſpended, till after the Disbanding of all Armies
his Majeſty may be preſent with the Two Houſes of Parliament, and calling a National
Synod, may receive ſuch Advice both from the one and the other, as in a matter of ſo
high concernment is neceſſary; and we are moſt confident that his Majeſty will then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Advice which ſhall be given him. And as any Reformation thus regularly and
calmly made, muſt needs prove for the ſingular Benefit and Honour of the Kingdom; ſo
we muſt appeal to your Lordſhips, whether the contrary, that is, an Alteration even to
things though in themſelves good, can by the Principles of Chriſtian Religion be enforced
upon the King or Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In the buſineſs of the <hi>Militia,</hi> though your Lordſhips do not deny that the Jealouſies
and apprehenſions of Danger are mutual, and that the chief end of depoſiting the <hi>Militia</hi>
in the hands of certain Perſons is for ſecurity againſt thoſe Jealouſies and poſſible Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
yet your Lordſhips inſiſt, That all thoſe Perſons to be entruſted ſhall be nominated
by the Two Houſes of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and the Eſtates of the Parliament in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and that the time for that great, general, and unheard-of Truſt ſhall be in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that though it ſeem to be limited to ſeven years, yet in truth by declaring, that after
thoſe ſeven years it ſhall not be otherwiſe exerciſed than His Majeſty and the Two Houſes
of Parliament ſhall agree, His Majeſty may thereby be totally and for ever deveſted of the
power of the Sword, without which He can neither defend Himſelf againſt Foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions
nor Domeſtick Inſurrections, nor execute His Kingly Office in the behalf of His
Subjects, to whom He is ſworn to give protection. And to both theſe your Lordſhips add
the introducing a Neighbour-Nation, governed by diſtinct and different Laws (though uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under one Sovereign) to a great ſhare in the Government of this Kingdom. In ſtead of
conſenting to theſe Changes, we have offered and propoſed to your Lordſhips, That the
Perſons to be truſted with the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom may be nominated between us, or
if that were refuſed, that an equal number ſhall be named by you, and the other number
by his Majeſty, and that half the Forts and places of Strength within the Kingdom, shall
be in the Cuſtody of thoſe whom you think fit to be truſted therewith, and the other half
in ſuch hands as his Majeſty pleaſes to commit the ſame to; and all perſons, as well thoſe
nominated by your Lordſhips as by his Majeſty, to take an Oath for the due diſcharge of
the ſaid Truſt: which being conſidered, as the Security is mutual, ſo neither part can be
ſuppoſed to violate the Agreement, without very evident inconvenience and danger to
that part who ſhall ſo violate it, the whole Kingdom being likely, and indeed obliged to
look upon whoſoever ſhall in the leaſt degree violate this Agreement as the Authors of
all the miſeries which the Kingdom ſhall thereby ſuffer. And as it is moſt reaſonable, that,
for this Security, his Majeſty ſhould part with ſo much of his own Power, as may make
him even unable to break the Agreement which ſhould be now made by him, and on his
part; ſo it is moſt neceſſary that all apprehenſion and danger of ſuch breach being over,
that Sovereign Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> should revert into the proper Chanel, and be, as it
hath always been, in his Majeſties proper and peculiar Charge. And therefore we have
propoſed, that the time limited for that Truſt should be for three years, which, by the
Bleſſing of God, will produce a perfect underſtanding between his Majeſty and all his
People; and if there should be any thing elſe neceſſary to be done in this Argument,
either for power or time, that the ſame be conſidered after the ſettlement of Peace in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
but whatever is now, or hereafter shall be thought neceſſary to be done, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
may be ſo ſettled, that this Kingdom may depend upon it ſelf, and not be ſubject to the
Laws or Advice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we think fit that <hi>Scotland</hi> should not receive Rules or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from this, having offered the like for <hi>Scotland</hi> as for <hi>England.</hi>

In the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> your Lordſhips propoſe not onely that his Majeſty diſclaim
and make void the Ceſſation made by his Royal Authority, and at the deſire of the Lords,
Juſtices and Council of that Kingdom, and for the preſervation of the remainder of his
poor Proteſtant Subjects there, who were in evident danger of Deſtruction, both by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and the Sword, but alſo to put the whole managery of that War, and diſpoſal of the
Forces within that Kingdom, and conſequently the Government of that Kingdom, into
the hands of the <hi>Scots</hi> General, to be managed by the Advice of a joynt Committee of
both Kingdoms, wherein each ſhould have a Negative Voice: In Anſwer to which, we
have acquainted your Lordſhips with the juſt grounds of his Majeſties proceedings in the
buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which we are confident, being weighed without prejudice, may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all men of his Majeſties Piety and Juſtice therein; and we are very ready and deſirous
to joyn with your Lordſhips in any courſe which may probably preſerve and reſtore that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Having put your Lordſhips in mind of theſe particulars, as they have a general reference
to the publick good of the Kingdoms, we beſeech your Lordſhips to conſider that we have
this great Truſt repoſed in us by his Majeſty, and to remember how far theſe Propoſitions
trench upon his peculiar Kingly Rights, without any, or any conſiderable recompence or
compenſation.</p>
                        <p>In the buſineſs of <hi>Religion,</hi> your Lordſhips propoſe the taking away his whole Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Juriſdiction, his Donations and Temporalties of Biſhopricks, his Firſt Fruits and
Tenths of Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, inſtead whereof your Lordſhips do not offer to
conſtitute the leaſt dependance of the Clergy upon his Majeſty; and for that ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a part of his Revenue, you propoſe onely the Biſhops Lands to be ſettled on his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
(reſerving a power to diſpoſe even thoſe Lands as you ſhall think fit:) whereas all the
Lands both of Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters (if thoſe Corporations muſt be diſſolved) do
undoubtedly belong to his Majeſty in his own Right.</p>
                        <p>In the buſineſs of the <hi>Militia,</hi> as it is propoſed, his Majeſty is ſo totally deveſted of the
Regal Power of the Sword, that he ſhall be no more able either to aſſiſt any of his Allies
with aid, though men were willing to engage themſelves voluntarily in that Service, or
to defend his own Dominions from Rebellion or Invaſion, and conſequently the whole
Power of Peace and War (the acknowledged and undoubted Right of the Crown) is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him.</p>
                        <p>In the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the power of nominating his Lieutenant or Deputy, and
other Officers there, of managing, directing, or in the leaſt manner of medling in that
War, or of making a Peace, is propoſed to be taken from him. And to add to all theſe
attempts upon his Kingly Rights, it is propoſed to bereave him of the Power of a Father,
in the Education and Marriage of his own Children, and of a Maſter, in the rewarding
his own Servants. And therefore we refer it to your Lordſhips, whether it be poſſible for
us, with a good Conſcience, and diſcharge of the Truſt repoſed in us, to conſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
made to us by your Lordſhips.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, we muſt obſerve to your Lordſhips, that after a War of near four years, for
which the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion, the Liberty and Property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and the Priviledges of Parliament were made the Cauſe and grounds, in a Treaty
of Twenty days, nor indeed in the whole Propoſitions upon which the Treaty ſhould
be, there hath been nothing offered to be Treated concerning the breach of any Law,
or of the Liberty or Property of the Subject, or Priviledge of Parliament, but onely
Propoſitions for the altering a Government eſtabliſhed by Law, and for the making new
Laws, by which almoſt all the old are, or may be cancelled; and there hath been nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on of our part which was not Law, or denied by us that you have demanded as due
by Law.</p>
                        <p>All theſe things being conſidered, and being much afflicted that our great hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a Peace is for the preſent fruſtrated by your Lordſhips<note n="*" place="margin">See their laſt Paper.</note>

Treaty, though for the preſent diſcontinued, may be revived, and the whole matter of
their Propoſitions, and thoſe ſent to them by his Majeſty, which have not yet been Treated
on, may be conſidered; and that depending that Treaty, to the end we may not Treat in
Blood, there may be a Ceſſation of Arms, and that the poor People of this Kingdom, now
expoſed to Plunderings and Spoils, and other direful effects of War, may have ſome earneſt
of a bleſſed Peace. And becauſe this Treaty is now expiring, if your Lordſhips cannot
give a preſent Reſolution, we deſire when you have repreſented this to the two Houſes, his
Majeſty may ſpeedily receive their Anſwer.</p>

reading thereof, to mention thus much; That it ſeems by many particulars in that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was reſolved the Treaty ſhould end with the Twenty days, the means to continue it
being well known to be a good progreſs in the Propoſitions for <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Militia,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and by what we have received, we cannot find any ſatisfaction in theſe was intended
to be agreed unto.</p>
                        <p>To that whereby your Lordſhips aſcribe ſo much to your own Conceſſions, we ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, That for <hi>Religion</hi> you have granted very little, or nothing, but what we are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in poſſeſſion of by the Laws of this Kingdom. For the buſineſs of the <hi>Militia,</hi> your
Lordſhips have not thought fit to conſent to any one of our Demands, but in that, as in
<hi>Religion,</hi> have made ſome new Propoſitions of your own, which are not in any degree
ſufficient for ſetling and ſecuring the Peace of the Kingdoms. As for the Propoſitions for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> your Lordſhips have been ſo far from affording a Conſent thereto, that you have
juſtified the deſtructive Ceſſation there, and ſtrongly implied an intention to renew the ſame,
and have not yielded to any part of our Propoſitions cencerning that Kingdom. We ſhall
repreſent your Lordſhips Papers to the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, who, upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
thereof, will do what is farther neceſſary for the good and Peace of His Majeſties
Dominions.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe ſeveral Deſires above mentioned from time to time for addition and enlargement
of time, for continuing and prolonging the Treaty, or if diſcontinued, that it might be revived,
and after a repreſentation to the Houſes, their Anſwer might be ſent to his Majeſty; in another
Paper before, Num. 135. upon the Head of the <hi>Militia,</hi> his Majeſties Commiſſioners did propoſe,
That if the Treaty might not then continue, it might be Adjourned for ſuch time as they ſhould
think fit, and not totally diſſolve, but be again reſumed: which Paper is not here inſerted, to
avoid repetition, being before upon the Head of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to which, as to that point of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment,
no Anſwer was given.</p>
                        <p>No Papers were given in to their Commiſſioners in Anſwer to the laſt-mentioned Paper, dated
the 22. of <hi>Feb.</hi> Numb. 197. which came in about two of the Clock in the morning after; nor to
that of the ſame date, Num. 135. concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> which came in with it; nor to their two
laſt concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the 22. of <hi>Febr.</hi> Num. 177, and 178. which came in about 12. of the
Clock that Night: all which were of ſuch length, and delivered upon the cloſe of the Treaty;
and thoſe which came in about two of the Clock upon the departure of the Commiſſioners, that it
was impoſſible to give preſent Anſwers; nor could any be given after, as part of the Treaty, without
conſent, which was required by his Majeſties Commiſſioners, but not granted. Neither is any
thing here inſerted in Anſwer to thoſe Papers, becauſe by the Agreements between the Commiſſioners
in the beginning of the Treaty, nothing was to be taken as part of the Treaty but what ſhould be put
in writing. And this Relation is intended only for a Narrative of the Treaty, (conformable to the
Agreements) without any Obſervations upon it, or Additions unto it, other than neceſſary Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Tranſitions for coherence, and more clear under ſtanding the Paſſages of the Treaty.</p>

                        <p>9. That the Publick Faith of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be given to their Brethren
of <hi>England,</hi> that neither their entrance into, nor their continuance in the Kingdom of
<hi>England</hi> ſhall be made uſe of to any other ends then are expreſſed in the Covenant, and

ſhall be by them appointed, with the ſame Power as in the precedent Article.</p>
                        <p>10. That in the ſame manner and upon the ſame conditions as the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

                        <p>Thirteenthly, it is provided and agreed, That at any time after the Three Months now

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> OUR very good Lord, the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> having in his March in his
laſt Expedition conſulted ſeveral times with the Commanders and Officers of the
Army in a Council of War, and ſo finding that ſubſiſtence could not be had abroad
for the Men and Horſes he had with him, or for any conſiderable part of them, it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them, that his Lordſhip with thoſe Forces ſhould return hither, which he did on the
ſix and twentieth of <hi>March.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="528" facs="tcp:60710:277"/>
In his return from <hi>Roſſe</hi> (which, in the caſe our Forces ſtand, he found ſo difficult to be
taken in, as although our Ordinance made a breach in their Walls, it was found neceſſary
to deſert the Siege) he was encountred by an Army of the Rebels, conſiſting of about ſix
thouſand Foot and ſix hundred and fifty Horſe well armed and horſed; yet it pleaſed God
ſo to diſappoint their counſels and ſtrength, as with thoſe ſmall Forces which the Lord
Marqueſs had with him, being of fighting men about two thouſand five hundred Foot,
and five hundred Horſe not well armed, and for the moſt part weakly horſed, (and thoſe
as well Men as Horſes much weakned by lying in the Fields ſeveral Nights in much Cold
and Rain, and by want of Mans-meat and Horſe-meat) the Lord Marqueſs obtained a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and glorious deliverance and Victory againſt thoſe Rebels, wherein were ſlain about
three hundred of them, and many of their Commanders and others of Quality, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
taken Priſoners, and amongſt thoſe Priſoners Colonel <hi>Cullen,</hi> a Native of this City,
who being a Colonel in <hi>France,</hi> departed from thence, and came hither to aſſiſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
and was Lieutenant-General of their Army in the Province of <hi>Leimster;</hi> and the
Rebels Army were totally routed and defeated, and their Baggage and Munition ſeized on
by His Majeſties Forces, who lodged that Night where they had gained the Victory, and on
our ſide about twenty ſlain in the fight, and divers wounded.</p>
                           <p>We have great cauſe to praiſe God, for magnifying his Goodneſs and Mercy to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and this His Kingdom ſo manifeſtly, and indeed wonderfully, in that Victory.</p>
                           <p>However, the Joy due from us upon ſo happy an occaſion is, we confeſs, mingled with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Diſtraction here in the apprehenſion of our Unhappineſs to be ſuch, as although the
Rebels are not able to overcome His Majeſties Army, and devour His other good Subjects
here as they deſire, yet both His Army and good Subjects are in danger to be devoured by
the wants of needful Supplies forth of <hi>England.</hi> For, as we formerly ſignified thither,
thoſe Forces were of neceſſity ſent abroad to try what might be done for ſuſtaining them in
the Countrey, ſo as to keep them alive until Supplies ſhould get to us; but that deſign now
failing, thoſe our hopes are converted into aſtoniſhment, to behold the unſpeakable Miſeries
of the Officers and Soldiers for want of all things, and all thoſe Wants made the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
in the want of Food, whilſt this City (being all the help we have) is now too
apparently found to be unable to help us, as it hath hitherto done, and divers Commanders
and Officers in the Army do now ſo far expreſs their ſenſe of their Sufferings, (which indeed
are very great and grievous) as they declare that they have little hope to be ſupplied by the
Parliament, and preſs with ſo great importunity to be permitted to depart the Kingdom, as
it will be extream difficult to keep them here.</p>
                           <p>By our Letters of the three and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> we ſignified thither the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
burthen laid on this City, for Victualling thoſe of the Army left here when the Lord
Marqueſs with the Forces he took with him marched hence; which burthen is found every
day more heavy than other, in regard of the many Houſe-keepers thereby daily breaking
up houſe, and ſcattering their Families, leaving ſtill fewer to bear the burthen. We alſo
by thoſe Letters, and by our Letters of the five and twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> advertiſed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the high danger this Kingdom would incur, if the Army ſo ſent abroad ſhould by any
diſtreſs, or through want be forced back hither again before our relief of Victuals ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
forth of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When we found that thoſe men were returning back hither, although we were (and are
ſtill) full of Diſtraction, conſidering the diſmal conſequences threatned thereby in reſpect
of our Wants, yet we conſulted what we could yet imagine feaſible that we had not former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, to gain ſome Food for thoſe men; and found, that to ſend them or others abroad
into the Countrey, we cannot, in regard we are not able to advance Money for procuring
the many Requiſites incident to ſuch an Expedition. In the end therefore we were enforced
to fix on our former way, and ſo to ſee who had any thing yet left him untaken from him
to help us: and although there are but few ſuch, and ſome of them poor Merchants, whom
we have now by the Law of Neceſſity utterly undone, and diſabled from being hereafter
helpful to us in bringing us in Victuals or other needful Commodities; yet were we forced
to wreſt their Commodities from them. And certainly there are few here of our ſelves or
others, that have not felt their parts in the enforced Rigour of our proceedings towards
preſerving the Army; ſo as what with ſuch hard dealing, no leſs grievous to us to do than
it is heavy to others to ſuffer, and by our deſcending (againſt our hearts) far below the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Dignity of that Power we repreſent here under His Royal Majeſty, we have with
unſpeakable difficulty prevailed ſo as to be able to find Bread for the Soldiers for the ſpace of
one Month.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="529" facs="tcp:60710:277"/>
We are now expelling hence all Strangers, and muſt inſtantly ſend away for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Thouſands of poor deſpoiled <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe very eating is now unſupportable to
this place.</p>
                           <p>And now again and finally, we earneſtly deſire, (for our Confuſions will not now admit
the writing of many more Letters, if any) that His Majeſty and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may
not ſuffer ſo great, if not irrecoverable, Prejudice and Diſhonour, as muſt unavoidably be
the conſequence of our not being relieved ſuddenly; but that yet (although it be even now
at the point to be too late) ſupplies of Victuals and Munition in preſent be haſtened hither,
to keep life until the reſt may follow, there being no Victual in the ſtore, nor will there be
a hundred Barrels of Powder left in the ſtore when the out-Garriſons (as they muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly)
are ſupplied, and that remainder, according to the uſual neceſſary expence, beſides
extraordinary accidents, will not laſt above a month. And the reſidue of our Proviſions
muſt alſo come ſpeedily after, or otherwiſe <hi>England</hi> cannot hope to ſecure <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſecure
themſelves againſt <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in the loſs of it muſt look for ſuch Enemies from hence as
will perpetually diſturb the Peace of His Majeſty and His Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and annoy
them by Sea and Land, as we often formerly repreſented thither: which miſchiefs may yet
be prevented, if we be yet forthwith enabled from thence with means to overcome this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                           <p>We hope that a courſe is taken there for haſtening hither the Proviſions of Arms and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
mentioned in the Docquet ſent with our Letters of the twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> and
the ſix hundred Horſes which we then moved might be ſent hither for Recruits, and that the
ſeven thouſand eight hundred fourſcore and thirteen pounds three ſhillings for Arms to be
provided in <hi>Holland</hi> (beſides thoſe we expect in <hi>London</hi>) hath been paid to <hi>Anthony Tierens</hi>
in <hi>London,</hi> or to <hi>Daniel Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and if that Sum had been paid as we at
firſt deſired, we might well have had thoſe Proviſions arrived here by the tenth of <hi>March,</hi>
as we agreed: however we now deſire that that Money, if it be not already pay'd, may be
yet pay'd to Mr. <hi>Tierens</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Wibrants</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> that ſo thoſe Proviſions
may arrive here ſpeedily, which (conſidering that Summer is now near at hand) will be
very neceſſary, that when our Supplies of Victuals, Munition, Cloaths, Money, and
other Proviſions ſhall arrive, we may not in the publick Service here loſe the benefit and
advantage of that ſeaſon. </p>

believe they have ſince our coming over ſucceeded pretty well: but for the laſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
our ſelves, that hath fallen out ſo contrary to our expectations, that inſtead of being
rewarded, we have been prejudiced; inſtead of getting a Fortune, we have ſpent part of
one; and though we behave our ſelves never ſo well abroad, and perform the actions of
honeſt men, yet we have the reward of Rogues and Rebels, which is, Miſery and Want,
when we come home. Now (my Lords) although we be brought to ſo great an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that we are ready to rob and ſpoil one another; yet to prevent ſuch outrages, we
thought it better to try all honeſt means for our ſubſiſtence before we take ſuch indirect
courſes. Therefore if your Lordſhips will be pleaſed to take us timely into your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
before our urgent Wants make us deſperate, we will, as we have done hitherto,
ſerve your Lordſhips readily and ſaithfully: But if your Lordſhips will not find a way
for our Preſervations here, we humbly deſire we may have leave to go where we may
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:60710:278"/>
have a better Being; and if your Lordſhips ſhall refuſe to grant that, we muſt then take
leave to have our recourſe to that firſt and primary Law which God hath endued all men
with, we mean the Law of Nature, which teacheth all men to preſerve themſelves.</p>

took into our conſideration at this Board the ſtate of Your Army here, which we
find ſuffering under unſpeakable Extremities of Want of all things neceſſary to the
ſupport of their Perſons or maintenance of the War; here being no Victuals, Cloaths, or
other Proviſions requiſite towards their ſuſtenance, no Money to provide them of any
thing they want, no Arms in Your Majeſties Stores to ſupply their many defective
Arms, not above Forty Barrels of Powder in Your Stores, no ſtrength of ſerviceable Horſes
being now left here, and thoſe few that are, their Arms for the moſt part loſt or unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
no Ships arrived here to guard the Coaſts, and conſequently no ſecurity rendred to
any that might (on their private Adventures) bring in Proviſions of Victuals, or other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
towards our ſubſiſtence; and finally, no viſible means by Sea or Land of being
able to preſerve for You this Your Kingdom, and to render deliverance from utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the remnant of Your good Subjects yet left here.</p>
                        <p>We find that Your Majeſties late Juſtices and this Board have often and fully by very
many Letters advertiſed the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> of the extremities of Affairs here,
and beſought Relief with all poſſible importunity, which alſo have been fully repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Your Majeſty, and to the Lord Lieutenant, and Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to be
made known to Your Majeſty: and although the Winds have of late for many days
(and often formerly) ſtood very fair for Acceſſions of Supply forth of <hi>England</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

our unexpreſſible grief) after full ſix months waiting, and much longer patience and
long ſuffering, we find all our great Expectations anſwered in a mean and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
quantity of Proviſions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) threeſcore and fifteen Barrels of Butter, and fourteen
Tun of Cheeſe, being but the fourth part of a ſmall Veſſels loading, which was ſent
from <hi>London,</hi> and arrived here on the fifth day of this month, which is not above ſeven
or eight days Proviſion for that part of the Army which lies in <hi>Dublin</hi> and the out-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
thereof; no Money or Victuals (other than that inconſiderable proportion of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual)
having arrived in this place, as ſent from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> or from
any other forth of <hi>England,</hi> for the uſe of the Army, ſince the beginning of <hi>November</hi>

                        <p>We have (by the Bleſſing of God) been hitherto proſperous and ſucceſsful in

the Royal Directions of Your Sacred Majeſty, to vindicate Your Majeſties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and recover Your Rights here, and take due Vengeance on theſe Traitors for
the innocent Blood they have ſpilt, if we might be ſtrengthened and ſupported
therein by needful Supplies forth of <hi>England:</hi> but theſe Supplies having hitherto been
expected to come from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (on which if Your Majeſty had
not relied, we are aſſured You would in Your high Wiſdom have found out ſome
other means to preſerve this Your Kingdom) and ſo great and apparent a failer
having hapned therein, and all the former and late long continuing <hi>Eaſterly</hi> Winds
bringing us no other Proviſions than thoſe few Cheeſes and Butter, and no Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
being brought us of any future Supply to be ſo much as in the way hither,
whereby there might be any likelihood that conſiderable means of ſupport for Your
Majeſties Army might arrive here in any reaſonable time, before we be totally ſwallowed
up by the Rebels, and Your Kingdom by them wreſted from you; we find our ſelves ſo
diſappointed of our hopes from the Parliament, as muſt needs trench to the utter loſs

                        <p>HAving received an account of the Paſſages of the late Treaty from Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
We cauſed a Narrative thereof to be made and publiſhed; wherein,
beſides the neceſſary Connexions, there is nothing ſet down but what paſſed in

conceive the Anſwers given in the Papers formerly delivered by Our Commiſſioners are
abundantly ſufficient to give ſatisfaction to thoſe alſo; yet becauſe there may be a want
of memory in ſome, and of obſervation in others, who ſhall read that Narrative, to
bring home and apply the former Anſwers of Our Commiſſioners to thoſe Papers, and
becauſe they ſeem to expect Anſwers, which (the Treaty being determined) cannot be
given by Our Commiſſioners, and to vindicate Our Self from many Paſſages ſcattered in
thoſe Papers, particularly reflecting upon Our Perſon and Royal Authority, We have
thought fit, for the further ſatisfaction of all Our good People, to make theſe enſuing
Anſwers.</p>
                        <p>And firſt to that<note n="*" place="margin">See it in the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, num. 136.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>WHoſoever ſhall obſerve the paſſionate expreſſions in the cloſe of this Paper, (wherein

theſe bleeding Kingdoms, the ſettling Religion, Our Honour, and the compoſing theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſtractions, to give full and clear Anſwers to the Demands concerning the</hi> Militia)
might very well believe, that they who ſo importunately demanded, would as willingly
have received an Anſwer. But when it ſhall be conſidered that this Paper was not delivered
in till after two of the Clock in the morning upon the breaking off the Treaty, when they
had denied any further time to treat, or to receive any Papers dated as within the time of
the Treaty, (as formerly was mutually done, and this very Paper of theirs delivered in
truth upon the 23. was received as dated the 22. of <hi>February</hi>) it will be moſt apparent they
kept it as a Reſerve to be purpoſely and by deſign delivered ſo as it ſhould remain unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>

For the matter of that Paper; They ſay, they <hi>have by their Anſwers ſatisfied the ſeveral
Queſtions propoſed to them by Our Commiſſioners touching the</hi> Militia. It was neceſſary they
ſhould have done ſo, that it being propoſed to Us to part with ſo great a Truſt as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Sword, and to put it wholly out of Our own hands, We might know how, and
to whom, and for what time, and upon what terms We parted with it. But We will look
back upon ſome of their Anſwers, that it may appear what they are.</p>
                        <p>Our Commiſſioners deſired to know,<note place="margin">See the Narrative, n. 77.</note>
 who the Commiſſioners ſhould be in whoſe hands
the Forces both by Sea and Land ſhould be entruſted, and whether We might except againſt
ſuch Perſons, and name others in their Places of known Affections to Religion and
Peace. To that part of the Queſtion, Whether We might except againſt the Perſons,
they made no Anſwer. To the other part, requiring who the Commiſſioners ſhould be,
they anſwered, <hi>That the Commiſſioners were to be named for</hi> England <hi>by the two Houſes, and
for</hi> Scotland <hi>by the Eſtates of the Parliament there:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">num. 78.</note>
 whereas the Queſtion was not, Who
ſhould name thoſe Commiſſioners; but, Who they were that ſhould be named, a

Power.</p>

 Whether the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,<note place="margin">num. 81.</note>

and not ſubordinate to thoſe Commiſſioners. They anſwered, <hi>It appeared by
the Propoſitions, the ſame was to be ordered in ſuch manner as ſhould be agreed on by both
Houſes.</hi> Which was no Anſwer to the Queſtion, though likewiſe neceſſary to be known,
the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> being ſo great and of ſuch importance.</p>
                        <p>Our Commiſſioners deſired to know,<note place="margin">num. 105. &amp; 107.</note>
 What Authority the Commiſſioners, nominated
by the Eſtates of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were to have in the <hi>Militia</hi> and ſettling
of all Forces by Sea and Land in this Kingdom, and what influence the Advices and
Orders from the Eſtates of that Parliament ſhould have upon this Kingdom. They
anſwered,<note place="margin">num. 106, 107, 112.</note>
                           <hi>That might be fully ſatisfied by the Propoſitions concerning the</hi> Militia. And
though Our Commiſſioners deſired it, they could get no other Anſwer from them in
writing.</p>
                        <p>Our Commiſſioners deſired to know,<note place="margin">num. 109.</note>
 What Juriſdiction they intended the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of both Kingdoms ſhould have, by the power given to them to hear and determine
all differences that might occaſion the breach of the Articles of the Peace, and by what
Law they ſhould proceed to hear and determine the ſame. They anſwered, <hi>That the
Commiſſioners were to proceed in ſuch manner as was expreſſed in the Propoſitions.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">num. 110.</note>
 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Propoſitions expreſs no more than what is contained in the words of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.<note place="margin">num. 111.</note>

And being further preſſed to an Anſwer, they anſwered, <hi>That the matter of the
Juriſdiction of the Commiſſioners was expreſſed in the Propoſitions;</hi> and for the manner of
exerciſing of it, and by what Law they ſhould proceed, <hi>The ſame was to be ſettled by the
two Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and the Eſtates of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</hi>
This being no Anſwer, and a full and direct Anſwer being required to theſe
Queſtions,<note place="margin">num. 113. 115.</note>
 the Anſwer given was, <hi>That they referred themſelves therein to their former
Anſwers.</hi>

                        <p>Our Commiſſioners deſired to ſee the Act of the late Treaty for the ſettling of the Garriſon
of <hi>Barwick,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">num. 116.</note>
 of the 29. of <hi>November,</hi> 1643. (being made betwixt the two Houſes and
thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without Our Privity) as relating to the buſineſs of the <hi>Militia:</hi> They
anſwered,<note place="margin">num. 117.</note>
                           <hi>It was not then to be treated on, but was reſerved to its proper time;</hi> and Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
could never ſee it.</p>
                        <p>Our Commiſſiones deſired to know,<note place="margin">num. 118.</note>
 Whether by the joynt Power mentioned in the
Propoſitions to be given to the Commiſſioners for both Kingdoms, to preſerve the Peace
between the Kingdoms, and the King, and every one of them, they intended any other
than Military Power for ſuppreſſing Forces only; which Queſtion was asked, becauſe in
the Propoſition there are two diſtinct Clauſes, one whereby they have that Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Peace,<note place="margin">num. 119.</note>
 the other whereby they have Power to ſuppreſs Forces. In anſwer to this
they refer Our Commiſſioners to the Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p>That theſe Anſwers (though made to Queſtions ariſing upon the doubtful Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in their Propoſitions) referring to the Propoſitions themſelves, or to what was
not then, but was after to be ſettled by the two Houſes, are not ſatisfactory Anſwers
to thoſe Queſtions, is moſt evident. But we do not wonder they were unwilling We
ſhould ſee the clear drift of thoſe Propoſitions, the ill conſequence whereof (which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
appears) We are willing to believe moſt of thoſe who agreed unto them did not at firſt
apprehend.</p>

They ſay, <hi>They marvel why it ſhould be inſiſted on, that the Commiſſioners for the</hi> Militia
<hi>ſhould not be nominated by the two Houſes only, and that we, who were to be equally ſecured,
ſhould name</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe are their words, but ſeem to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, We ſhould name ſome of them.</note>
                           <hi>none, ſince this Power was not to be exerciſed till a Peace concluded upon the
Treaty, and then We had been ſecured by the Laws of the Kingdom, and by the Duties and
Affections of Our Subjects.</hi> We think it far more matter of wonder (ſince it is confeſſed
that We, and ſuch Our Loyal Subjects who have faithfully and conſtantly adhered to Us,
were equally to be ſecured) that they would allow Us no ſecurity at all, but to put Our
ſelves wholly upon them, who even afterwards in this Paper deny Our Juſt Power of the
<hi>Militia,</hi> and of making Peace and War, and might with much more colour hereafter do
ſo, if by Our Conſent that Power ſhould be once, though for a time only, put wholly
into their Hands. It is true, the Laws of the Land and the Hearts of the People are
the beſt ſecurity for a Prince, that He ſhall enjoy what belongs to Him: But it is as true,
that the Laws of the Land and the Love of the Prince towards His People are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
their beſt ſecurity, that they ſhall enjoy what belongeth to them. It is a mutual
confidence each in other that ſecures both: but this is to be underſtood in calm and
quiet times. The preſent Diſtempers have bred mutual Jealouſies: and if they think it
not at this time reaſonable wholly to truſt the Laws and Us concerning their ſecurity,
but require the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> in which they have no right; much leſs is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that We ſhould wholly truſt them concerning Our ſecurity, who avowedly bear
Arms againſt Us: but if for the love of Peace We are content for a time to part
with this great Power, which is Our Known Right, it is reaſonable that We ſhould
have the nominating of ſome of thoſe who ſhould be truſted with it. Yet on Our part
We were well content to repoſe Our ſelves in that ſecurity they mention, if the two
Houſes would likewiſe have relied upon the ſame ſecurity of the Laws and Affections
of the People,<note place="margin">See Our Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Our Return to the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, after Disbanding of Armies, num. 191.</note>
 to which they ſo much pretend: But though it was offered that We
ſhould return to Our two Houſes, whereby all Armies being Disbanded, both they
and We might have been reſtored to the Laws, and guarded by thoſe Affections of the
People; yet that was not admitted. They ſay, <hi>This Power of the</hi> Militia <hi>was not to be
exerciſed till after a Peace;</hi> but they do not remember it is to be agreed on before a
Peace, and propoſed in order to a Peace: and We might with as much Reaſon (and
far more Juſtice, in reſpect of Our undoubted Right over the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdom)
have inſiſted upon the ſole nomination of the Commiſſioners, becauſe their Power was
not to be exerciſed till a Peace concluded, as they for that cauſe to have excluded Us
from the nomination of an equal number, and aſſumed that Power wholly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not affording Us ſo much as the liberty to except againſt any of them. And
whereas they ſay theſe Commiſſioners for the <hi>Militia have a Rule preſcribed, and being
removable and lyable for any miſcarriage to a ſevere puniſhment, cannot do any thing to Our
prejudice, contrary to the Truſt repoſed in them:</hi> If they had ſuch a Rule (which yet by their
Propoſitions and Papers We cannot find, having by general and indefinite terms an
unlimited Power given to them) it proves they ſhould not, not that they would not
break it. He that hath Power (as theſe Commiſſioners would have the greateſt that
ever Subjects had) and Will to abuſe that Power, may extend and interpret the Rule
preſcribed him as he ſhall pleaſe himſelf. And therefore ſince out of Our ardent deſire
of Peace, We were content to part with this Power, We had reaſon to require, that at
leaſt ſome of thoſe who ſhould execute it might be ſuch whom We Our ſelves ſhould
nominate and could truſt.</p>
                        <p>For that which is ſaid, That <hi>if the Commiſſioners had been ſeverally choſen,
the memory of theſe unnatural Diviſions muſt needs have been continued, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
being ſeverally named, they would have acted dividedly according to ſeveral
Interests, and the War thereby might be more eaſily revived:</hi> It is apparent, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the War muſt as much continue where any Commiſſioners are named at
all, as where they are named by either Party, ſince by putting that Power into
their hands it is put out of the proper Chanel. But it is not the memory of a paſt
War that is dangerous, but ſuch a remembrance of it as is joyned with a deſire
or inclination to revive it. And if it were probable, as is alledged, that if the
Commiſſioners were partly choſen by Us, and partly by them, that being ſeverally
named, they would have acted dividedly according to ſeveral Intereſts; it would
be much more probable, that being wholly named by them, they would have
acted only according to their Intereſt, and ſo on Our part, inſtead of an
equal Security, We muſt have been contented with what Laws an Conditions
they would have impoſed. But We ſhall again remember, that the offer
on Our part was to name ſuch <hi>againſt whom there could be no juſt Exception,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">num. 130.</note>

                           <pb n="534" facs="tcp:60710:280"/>
                           <hi>if the Perſons were named equally betwixt us.</hi> It was likewiſe offered, <hi>That thoſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſhould take an Oath for the true diſcharge of their Trust; that We Our ſelves were willing
to take an Oath to obſerve the Articles of the Treaty; and that all Perſons of any immediate
Trust by Offices or attendance upon Vs, and all others whom they ſhould nominate, ſhould take
the like Oath, and with ſuch penalties, that whoſoever ſhould infringe the Agreement, ſhould be
accounted moſt pernicious Enemies to Vs and the Kingdoms.</hi> And if this way of mutual
nomination were not approved, there was another propoſed, that the Perſons ſhould be
nominated between Our Commiſſioners and theirs, by whoſe mutual conſent it might
well have been hoped ſuch Perſons might have been named, in whom We and they
might have confided. But to this no Anſwer hath been vouchſafed, nor could any thing
ſatisfie concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> unleſs without knowing who the Perſons were who ſhould
be entruſted, We ſhould with an implicite Faith in Perſons whom We did not know put
that Power into their hands.</p>
                        <p>They ſay,<note place="margin">Num. 131.</note>
 that though by their Propoſitions the Commiſſioners were to continue
without any limitation of time, <hi>yet they have ſince propoſed a time of ſeven years.</hi> We
know not that they have, during the whole Treaty, in any one particular receded
from inſiſting on their Demands as they are ſet down in their Propoſitions <hi>in terminis.</hi>
And in this point though they ſeem to reduce the time, which in their Propoſitions was
indefinite,<note place="margin">See num. 132.</note>
 to a certainty, to which yet the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners have not abſolutely
agreed, the alteration is more in ſhew than in deed, and rather to the heightning
than abating their Demands. For whereas they have limited the time to ſeven years,
yet it is with an additional Clauſe, That after thoſe ſeven years it was to be executed
as We and they ſhould agree, and not otherwiſe: ſo that though the Commiſſioners
ſhould have the Power but for ſeven years, yet We ſhould not have it after thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years nor at any time, unleſs they and We could agree in it: ſo much would
they have gained by this ſeeming compliance in point of limitation of this Power to
a time, though not to that time of three years which We propoſed. But they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Reaſonableneſs of it:<note place="margin">Num. 130.</note>
 for whereas Our Commiſſioners in their Paper (to
which this of theirs is applied as an Anſwer) tell them, that if the time for this
Power be unlimited, <hi>We and Our Poſterity ſhall for ever part with Our peculiar Regall
Power of being able to reſiſt Our Enemies or protect Our good Subjects, and with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
and never-denied Right of the Crown to make War and Peace, or ever more to
have Juriſdiction over Our own Navy and Fleet at Sea,</hi> (the Command thereof being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a part of this great Power to be given to theſe Commiſſioners:<note place="margin">Num. 136.</note>
) they anſwer plainly,
<hi>They cannot admit of this peculiar Regall Power, which Our Commiſſioners mention, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in Vs, concerning the</hi> Militia, <hi>and to make Peace and War, or that it is otherwiſe to be
exerciſed then by Authority from Vs and both Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>and
the Estates of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>reſpectively.</hi> We approve of their ingenuity,
that now at the breaking off of the Treaty, they tell Us in plain terms what they
mean: Though the Common-Law-books and Records of Parliament have mentioned,
that the ſole Power of protecting the Subjects belongs to the King, and that He alone
hath Power to make Peace and War; though it hath been the language of former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
even of the laſt Parliament, and at the beginning of this Parliament, <hi>That the
Power of Peace and War is in the King; but if He will have Money from His Subjects to
maintain the Wars, He muſt have their Conſents;</hi> and though the univerſal conſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion heretofore hath gone accordingly: yet they cannot admit thereof as to
have been Our Right (for the Anſwer is made to the aſſertion concerning Our Right.)
And not admitting it, it ſeems their Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy, to defend Our
Crown and Dignity, and to aſſiſt and defend all <hi>Juriſdictions, Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
belonging to Us, oblige them not. And as they do not admit this Power in Right
to have been in Us alone for the time paſt, ſo neither will they admit it for the time to
come, in Us or Our Succeſſors, to be able to reſiſt Our Enemies or protect Our Subjects,
or to make Peace or War, but it muſt be <hi>by Authority from Vs and the two Houſes, and
the Eſtates of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>reſpectively.</hi> They are to be aſſociated in theſe
Regal Powers, and the Scepter and the Sword may in Pictures or Statues, but are not
in deed to be in the Kings hand alone. Upon theſe grounds, We wonder not that they
would have the Navy and Fleet at Sea to be put into the hands of their Commiſſioners
for ſeven years, as the <hi>Militia</hi> for the Land, and after the ſeven years to be commanded
in ſuch manner as they and We ſhould agree, and not otherwiſe; for the ſay, <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are the ſame for them as for the</hi> Militia <hi>by Land.</hi> It is a principal means, they ſay,
of their ſecurity; and We cannot find they think themſelves to have any ſecurity, if
We and Our Succeſſors have any Power: But if We will part with Our Power wholly
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:60710:280"/>
unto them, We and Our Poſterity ſhall be fully ſecured by the Affections of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(that is, by the Lords and Commons now at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> who in their ſenſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
all the People) who by themſelves during the Parliament, or, when they ſhall
pleaſe to make any Receſſes, by their Commiſſioners during the Intervals, will free Us
from the burthen of the <hi>Militia</hi> and of Our Navy, and ſo of protecting Our Subjects,
and will ſave Us the Charge of Our Navy, becauſe <hi>it is to be principally maintained by
the free gift of the Subject out of Tonnage and Poundage, and other Impoſitions upon
Merchandiſe.</hi> And having taken this care for Our Security (ſuitable to all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
theſe three years laſt paſt) they ſay, that <hi>for ſecurity of thoſe who have been with Vs
in the War, an Act of Oblivion is deſired to be paſſed, whereby all Our Subjects would have
been put in one and the ſame condition and under the ſame protection, with ſome Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
mentioned in the Propoſitions.</hi> We are not willing to mention thoſe Exceptions,
by which not only moſt of Our beſt Subjects (who have been with Us in the War ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Duties) by expreſs or general terms are excepted, but all the Eſtates
of ſome of them, and a great part of the Eſtates of the reſt of them, for that very
cauſe, becauſe they were with Us in the War, are to be forfeited. As for ſecuring
them by an Act of Oblivion, they have leſs cauſe to deſire it than they who propoſe
it, as being more ſecured by the Conſcience of doing their Duties, and the protection
of the known Common Law of the Land, if it might take place, than any protection
under the two Houſes or their Commiſſioners for the <hi>Militia:</hi> yet we were not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for the ſecurity of all Our Subjects, to have aſſented to an Act of Oblivion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing, as much as in Us lies, to have made up theſe Breaches, and buried the
memory of theſe unhappy Diviſions.</p>
                        <p>It was urged by Our Commiſſioners, that according to the literal ſenſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
(in the Powers given to the Commiſſioners for the <hi>Militia) That Sheriffs and
Juſtices of Peace, and other legal Miniſters, could not raiſe the</hi> Poſſe Comitatus, <hi>or
Forces to ſuppreſs Riots, without being liable to the interpretation of the Commiſſioners.</hi>
To this they anſwer, <hi>That this is no part of the</hi> Militia <hi>to be exerciſed by the Commiſſioners,
but in executing of Juſtice and legal Proceſs; nor can be intended to be any disturbance,
but for the preſervation of the Peace.</hi> We ſhall admit that to be their meaning; but it
being by the Propoſitions made Treaſon in any <hi>who ſhall levy any Forces without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or conſent of the Commiſſioners, to the disturbance of the publick Peace,</hi> it is apparent
that the Sheriffs or Juſtices of Peace, if they raiſe any Forces to ſuppreſs any tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Aſſembly, (which it is poſſible ſome of the Commiſſioners may countenance) or
for executing of other legal Acts, may not only be liable to the interpretation of being
diſturbers of the Publick Peace, but feel the puniſhment of it. And whereas they
ſay, <hi>That the Power</hi> (given by the Propoſitions to the Commiſſioners for the <hi>Militia</hi> of
both Kingdoms as a joynt Committee) <hi>for the hearing and determining Civil Actions
and Differences cannot be extended further than preſervation of the Articles of the Peace to
be made:</hi> We conceive that a Court being thereby allowed to them for the hearing
and determining of Civil matters for the preſervation of the Articles of the Peace, they
may in order thereunto (upon pretence it is for the preſervation of the Peace) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and determine any Cauſe or Difference they pleaſe, eſpecially their Power by
the Propoſitions being, <hi>not only to preſerve the Peace,</hi> but <hi>to prevent the violation of the
Articles of the Peace;</hi> and having the power of the Sword in their hands, and being
not tied up to any certain Law, whereby to judge, (for ought appears by their Anſwers
to the Queſtions propoſed by Our Commiſſioners) and the Common Law not being the
Rule in ſuch caſe (becauſe part of them are to be of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation) they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controul exerciſe what Arbitrary Power they pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is inſiſted upon in this Paper, That an Anſwer be given to the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Propoſition, which is, <hi>That the Subjects be appointed to be Armed, Trained, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
in ſuch manner as both Houſes ſhall think fit;</hi> which Our Commiſſioners thought
fit to have deferred till after the Peace eſtabliſhed, and then to be ſettled by Us and the
two Houſes: it is apparent, that Propoſition concerned not (that which was deſired as
the end of their Propoſitions) the ſecurity for the obſervation of the Articles; and We
conceive there is already ſufficient Proviſion made by the Law in ſuch caſes; and if there
were not, it were fit that that defect were ſupplied by Law, not to be left at large, as
the two Houſes ſhould think fit, without expreſſing the manner of it, but to proceed
by a Bill, wherein We might ſee before We conſented to it, how Our Subjects ſhould be
charged, We being as much concerned and ſenſible of the burthen to be put upon Our
Subjects as the two Houſes can be, who, We are ſure, ſince they took upon them the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of impoſing upon their fellow-Subjects without Us, have laid the heavieſt Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ever were.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="536" facs="tcp:60710:281"/>
And whereas they ſay, <hi>The ſcope of theſe their Propoſitions touching the</hi> Militia <hi>was to
take away occaſions of future Differences, to prevent the raiſing of Arms, and to ſettle a firm
and durable Peace:</hi> If We look upon the whole frame of their <hi>Militia</hi> as they have
propoſed it to Us, We cannot but conclude thoſe Propoſitions to be moſt deſtructive to
thoſe ends. For firſt, they have propoſed it to Us (as they have ſettled it already by
their Ordinance) That the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well of Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects as
<hi>Scotiſh,</hi> ſhall be Commanded by <hi>Leſley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> their <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General, and be
managed by the joynt Advice of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, and therein the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have a Negative Voice, and ſo by conſequence ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Government of that Kingdom to the manage of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects.
And (having thus ordered the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they will be ſure to keep
Forces on Foot (for that is another part of the Propoſitions, <hi>That we ſhall aſſent to
whatſoever Acts ſhall be propoſed for Moneys for the VVar of</hi> Ireland) which Forces ſhall be
ready upon all occaſions to ſerve them) for the <hi>Militia</hi> and Navy of <hi>England,</hi> that is
likewiſe to be ordered and Commanded by theſe Commiſſioners: and though We
their Sovereign are denied to nominate any to be joynt-Commiſſioners, they are
content to admit thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> (who, though Our Subjects, yet are ſtrangers to
their Government) to a nomination of <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners to be joyned with them.
Theſe <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners in matters wherein both Kingdoms are joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
(and they may eaſily call and make what they will to be of joynt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
are to have a Negative Voice, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can do nothing without
them, not ſo much as to raiſe Force to ſuppreſs a Commotion or prevent an Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners, though not a third part of the number of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
ſay it is of joynt concernment; and in matters ſolely concerning <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Commiſſioners (to a third part of the whole number of the Commiſſioners) are to
reſide in <hi>England,</hi> and to Vote as ſingle Perſons.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Commiſſioners, as well <hi>Scotiſh</hi> as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they have the ſole Power of the
Forces by Sea and Land, ſo they muſt have a Court in a Civil way, to hear and
determine whatſoever Civil action that ſhall tend to the preſervation of the Peace,
or whatſoever elſe is for the prevention of the violation of it; within which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
words, and in order thereunto, they may comprehend any cauſe or thing they
pleaſe. And as theſe Commiſſioners, as well <hi>Scotiſh</hi> as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are to name all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Officers in Our Forts and Ships; ſo in the Intervals of Paliament, leſt
there ſhould be too much dependance upon Us, they are to name all the great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Judges of both Our Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To theſe ſo unreaſonable Propoſitions, wherein the Parliament and Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would have ſo great an Influence and Power over the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> if (as reflecting meerly upon Our ſelves, and not entertaining ſuch thoughts
of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects as perhaps ſome may by the danger of ſuch a Power) We
ſhould have agreed, as hoping that the good Affections of Our Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi>
might in time have reſtored Us to that Power which the two Houſes of <hi>England</hi> would
take away; yet when We conſider, that We are in Conſcience obliged to maintain
the Rights of Our Crown ſo far as to be able to protect Our Subjects, and what
jealouſies and heart-burnings it might probably produce betwixt Our Subjects of
the two Kingdoms, what reluctancy all Our Subjects here may have when they ſhall
ſee Our Power ſo ſhaken, and they muſt have ſo much dependency upon their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Subjects both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> We conceive it ſo far from being a <hi>Remedy
to the preſent Distempers</hi> (as they affirm in their Papers) that as at preſent it would
alter the whole frame and conſtitution of the Government of this Kingdom, both Civil
and Military, ſo in the concluſion it would occaſion the Ruin and Deſolation of all Our
Kingdoms.</p>

 to
inſinuate unto Our People, that We were either privy to the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
or aſſenting to the continuance of it; and if it could not be perſonally fixed upon Our
ſelf, yet to perſwade them into a belief that evil Counſellors, and others prevalent with
Us, did encourage and aſſiſt it. By this means having a colour to raiſe Forces, and to
levy Money for the ſupply of thoſe Forces, they might ſo diſpoſe of both, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

a pretence of ſuppreſſing the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they might thereby alſo raiſe a War
in <hi>England,</hi> for the effecting of their Ambitious and Covetous deſires in both
Kingdoms. And they ſo carried on this Deſign, that whereas out of Our earneſt
deſire of the relief of Our poor Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to ſhew the great ſenſe
We had of their Miſeries, We had given way to ſeveral unuſual Bills for raiſing of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and likewiſe to the Bill for the 400000. <hi>l.</hi> for the Adventurers and others, for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Moneys, (which Moneys by thoſe Acts were to be pay'd to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or otherwiſe out of the ordinary courſe, and not into Our Exchequer, as was uſual
in like caſes, thence to be iſſued for publick uſe) thoſe Supplies were diverted and
imployed to feed and nouriſh a Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> rather than to ſuppreſs that
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Thus 100000. <hi>l.</hi> of the Adventurers Money was imployed for the Earl
of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army when he firſt march'd againſt Us; and that imployment of
it, though contrary to the expreſs words of the Act, which are, That no part of
that Money ſhall be imployed to any other purpoſe than the reducing of thoſe Rebels,
was publickly juſtified by a Declaration made in the name of the Houſe of Commons
the ſixth of <hi>September,</hi> not long before the Battel at <hi>Edge-hill:</hi> and at the ſame Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
ſeveral Regiments of Horſe and Foot raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command
of the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> Lord of <hi>Leny,</hi> Sir <hi>Faithful Forteſcue</hi> and others, were imployed
againſt Us at <hi>Edge-hill:</hi> the Moneys raiſed upon the Bill of 400000. <hi>l.</hi> and others
have been wholly made uſe of againſt Us. And it was impoſſible, without thus work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

into the managery of that War, and miſapplying the aids intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
have brought this Kingdom into the bleeding and deſperate condition wherein it now
languiſheth.</p>
                        <p>The Propoſitions concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they are inſiſted upon by theſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
(though in charity We ſhall hope not ſo intended by all of them) are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in purſuance of that original deſign in begetting a ſuſpicion of Our Integrity
in that buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ingroſſing the managing of that War and the
Power of that Kingdom into their hands. They would have the Ceſſation (which
We have avowed to be aſſented to by Us, and adviſed as moſt neceſſary for the
preſervation of that Kingdom) to tend <hi>to the utter Destruction of the Proteſtants there,</hi>
and the continuance of the Ceſſation there, (though but during the War here) to
be <hi>a countenancing of that bloody Rebellion;</hi> and We Our ſelves are charged <hi>to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and to give directions for the ſeiſing of ſome Proviſions</hi> made and ſent for the ſupply
of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the next place, concerning the War there, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that the proſecution of that War be ſettled in both Houſes of Parliament, to
be managed by the Advice of both Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (that is, a
Commmittee of both Kingdoms, thoſe of each Kingdom to have a Negative Voice)
and all the Forces there to be under the Command of the <hi>Scotch</hi> General; the
Lieutenant and other great Officers and Judges there to be nominated by both
Houſes; and that We ſhould conſent to paſs all Acts to be propoſed by them for the
raiſing of Moneys and other things neceſſary for the proſecution of that War. And
notwithſtanding all the zealous and pathetical Epreſſions in thoſe Papers, deſiring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of that War, and the execution of Juſtice upon thoſe Rebels; it is not
barely the proſecution of the War in zeal of Juſtice that is deſired, that might be
managed either by Us (whom God and the Law have entruſted ſolely with that
Power, and whoſe Predeceſſors have alone, and without the concurrence of their
Parliaments, other than by competent aſſiſtance with Moneys, ſuppreſſed great Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
in that Kingdom) or by fit Miniſters to be appointed, upon juſt occaſion to be
removed by Us: they have not made any the leaſt Propoſition or deſire to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
But they inſiſt upon ſuch a proſecution of the War, wherein thoſe who are
in Arms againſt Us may have the ſole managing of the War, and of Moneys to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that War, even while they are in Arms againſt Us. For the Ceſſation already
made it is apparent it was the only viſible means whereby the Kingdom was preſerved,
the poor Proteſtants there being in danger inevitably to have periſhed, either by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
for want of Food, or by the Rebels for want of Ammunition, there being not
above forty Barrels of Powder there, as appears by the Letters of the Lords Juſtices
and Council of <hi>Ireland</hi> mentioned by Our Commiſſioners, and no ſupplies of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
or Money ſent in ſix Months time before thoſe Letters (although Our Ships
were then taken away from Us, and all the Forces at Sea belonging to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were under their Command.) Neither could the not making void or declaring
againſt that Ceſſation have hindered a Peace upon this Treaty, if it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:60710:282"/>
really on their part, it being to expire in <hi>March,</hi> and ſo before the Treaty could
probably have been perfected, and there being no further Peace or Ceſſation made in
<hi>Ireland.</hi> And therefore Our Commiſſioners did earneſtly deſire them to make ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
as were fit to be conſented to, for the growth of the Proteſtant Religion, and
the good of that Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>But inſtead of ſuch Propoſitions, they ſtill except againſt the Ceſſation, and though
expiring within a Month, they inſiſt upon their demands of <hi>an Act of Parliament to
make that Ceſſation void:</hi> to which if We ſhould have conſented, as We muſt have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Our ſelves uncapable of being truſted at any time after, and odious abroad in
breaking that Ceſſation, ſolemnly made by Our publick Miniſters of State in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and after conſented unto by Our ſelves; ſo We muſt have implicitely confeſſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truth, that which they alledge againſt the Ceſſation, that it was deſtructive
to the Proteſtants there, and a countenancing of that bloody Rebellion, and thereby
having loſt the Plea of Our Innocency, have alſo loſt the hearts of Our People, and
rendered Our ſelves guilty of thoſe Infamous Slanders which have been charged upon
Us concerning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, and which ſome were ſo willing to fix upon Us,
that even during this Treaty, when <hi>Mac-guire</hi> was impeached by them for this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for which he was by them after executed, (though they well knew Confeſſions of
Men in his condition, in hopes of Pardon or Reprieves, are not to be credited,) he
was ſtrictly examined concerning Us (as We are credibly informed) whether or no We
gave any Commiſſion to the Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any aſſiſtance to them; and if he
had not abſolutely denied it to his laſt, with more ſenſe of Conſcience in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
than they who examined him expected, it is likely whatſoever Untruths reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Us had been forced from him, had been (as others were) publiſhed to
Our diſgrace. And although they long queſtioned the credit and truth of thoſe
Letters of the Lords Juſtices and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> notwithſtanding one of them
being directed to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons was received and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Houſe, and Ours was but a Duplicate thereof, and Copies were delivered to
them of both Letters, which two of their Commiſſioners compared with Our Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
and ſaw the Names of all the Council-ſubſcribers as well as the two Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſome of which Councellors were of principal eſtimation with themſelves, and they
might alſo have had Copies of their Names who ſubſcribed, if they would have aſſured
Our Commiſſioners, that ſuch of them as ſhould have come into their Quarters ſhould
not have been prejudiced by it; yet the extremity of Our poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that Ceſſation being ſo notorious, and that atteſtation thereof undeniable, they fall
at laſt to confeſs and avoid them: they ſay, <hi>That ſome who were of the Council when
thoſe Letters were written aſſure them, that thoſe Letters were written only to preſs for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
without any intention of inducing a Ceſſation, neither do the Letters contain any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Ceſſation.</hi> It is true, thoſe Letters do not, nor was it alledged they did men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any Ceſſation; but they preſſed for Supplies from hence, and laid open their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
to be ſuch, that it was apparent to any Man (as We had alſo private advices
from ſome of the Council there, and of credit with thoſe at <hi>Weſtminster</hi>) that if Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
failed, there was no way for the preſervation of Our good Subjects there but by a
Ceſſation. And theſe bleeding Wants of Our Army and good Subjects there ſo earneſtly
calling for Relief, and (this Kingdom being then ingaged in the height of an unnatural War)
Our ſelves unable to ſupply them, and no timely ſupply nor hopes of it coming from the
two Houſes, what courſe leſs diſhonourable for Us, or more for the good and ſafety of
the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, could be taken, than to admit of a Treaty for a Ceſſation,
which was managed by Our publick Miniſters of State there, and that Ceſſation aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto as beſt for that Kingdom by the chief Officers of the Army and the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Council of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before Our Approbation thereof?</p>
                        <p>They ſay, that <hi>thoſe Neceſſities were made by a deſign of the Popiſh and Prelatical Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(the Prelatical Party muſt come in upon all turns, though none ſuffered more by the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, nor were leſs advantaged by the Ceſſation, than thoſe poor Prelates) <hi>and
that at this very time when the Proteſtants were in ſuch Extremity, Proviſions ſent thither
by the Parliament for their Relief were diſpoſed of and afforded to the Rebels.</hi> The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Lords Juſtices and Council tell Us, that no Proviſions at all were ſent by the
Parliament; and if they had not told it, yet this being barely affirmed, might as eaſily be
denied, unleſs they had inſtanced in particular what Proviſions were ſent, and how,
and when, and by whom, or to whom they were diſpoſed. But they ſay, that <hi>at the
ſame time the Officers of the Army and Garriſons, preſſing for leave to march into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Countrey to live upon them, and ſave their own ſtores; ſome could not obtain leave to
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:60710:282"/>
go, and thoſe who were drawn forth, had great quantities of Proviſions out with them, yet
were not permitted to go into the Enemies Countrey, but kept near</hi> Dublin <hi>till their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were ſpent, and then commanded back again.</hi> They might remember, at that time
(wherein they ſuppoſe this miſcarriage) the chief manage of thoſe Affairs was in the
hands of ſuch Miniſters of State, whom they did and do ſtill rely upon; but ſure thoſe
Miniſters are not to be blamed, if they durſt not ſuffer the Soldier to march far, or
ſtay long in the Enemies Countrey, when there was but forty Barrels of Powder
in all the Store, or if they called them back in ſuch caſe when the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</p>
                        <p>Let ſuch as theſe, or what other pretences and excuſes ſoever, be made for not
relieving <hi>Ireland,</hi> We are ſure the chief Impediment to it was their active promoting
this Rebellion in <hi>England:</hi> And therefore, as they made uſe of the Supplies both of
Men and Money, provided for that Kingdom, againſt Us at <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> ſo from the
time of that Battel (ſome Supplies ſent before (which elſe perhaps had been alſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded)
arriving in <hi>Ireland</hi> about the time, or ſhortly after that Battel) they were ſo
careful of recruiting and ſupplying their Armies here, that though they received much
Moneys for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had at their diſpoſal great ſtore of Our Ammunition, neither
the one nor the other was ever after afforded to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army and Forces, or to
the Proteſtants about <hi>Dublin,</hi> though the Ceſſation was not made till <hi>September</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
As for thoſe Proteſtants in <hi>Munſter, Connaught,</hi> and <hi>Ulſter,</hi> who, they ſay,
<hi>oppoſed the Ceſſation, and did and do ſtill ſubſiſt,</hi> they were moſt of them of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Subjects; the reſt (excepting ſome few wrought upon by private intereſt or particular
ſolicitation) were ſuch, who being under their Power, were forced for their relief to
concur with them againſt it. Theſe, indeed, as they did not ſuffer under ſo great
Wants as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the time of the Ceſſation, as is well known, though it ſeem to
be denied, more ſpecial Proviſions being made for them and for their Garriſons than
for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (as doth in great part appear even by the Articles of their Treaty of
the ſixth of <hi>August;</hi>) ſo they have ſince ſubſiſted by Supplies ſent from the two Houſes,
whereof none were ſuffered to partake but ſuch as take their new Covenant, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
break the Bonds of their Obedience and Duty, both by taking that dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring
Oath prohibited by God and their King, and oppoſing Our Miniſters of State
there, without whoſe Authority (a Ceſſation being concluded) during that Ceſſation
they ought not to have continued a War in that Kingdom. We eaſily believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
they mention are or may be ſent for ſupply of thoſe Forces, as being a means to
keep up a Party againſt Us there, and to have a Reſerve of an Army ready upon any
accidents of War to be drawn hither againſt Us; and being alſo neceſſary for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects (whom they muſt pleaſe) who would not be ſo forward
in their Service without ſome good aſſurance (ſuch as is the having an Army of theirs
kept on foot in <hi>Ireland</hi> at the charge of this Kingdom, and two of Our ſtrongeſt Towns
and Caſtles there delivered to them Cautionary Towns, as We may believe <hi>Berwick</hi> alſo
is (being denied the ſight of that Treaty) and by the Command of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there by the General of the <hi>Scots</hi>) that they ſhall be well pay'd the Arrears
to the Armies in both Kingdoms before they quit their Intereſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi> If We
ſhall allow Proviſions thus imployed to be for the preſervation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> We may believe they have repay'd the 100000. <hi>l.</hi> taken up of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
Money; and yet thus to re-ſatisfie this Money, admitting it be current ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the Debt, can be no ſatisfaction or excuſe for the former Diverſion.</p>
                        <p>But ſince they cannot excuſe themſelves for this Diverſion of the Adventurers Money,
nor of the other Moneys raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor of the imploying the Forces raiſed for
that Kingdom under the Command of the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> againſt Us at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> which
they deny not; they fall to recriminate Us.</p>
                        <p>They ſay, <hi>They have mentioned particulars of Proviſions for</hi> Ireland, (beſides thoſe few
Cloaths taken near <hi>Coventry,</hi> which being formerly anſwered by Our Commiſſioners, they
do not again urge) <hi>aſſerted to be ſeiſed not without Our own knowledge and directions, as
they were informed.</hi> This they had formerly alledged, and Our Commiſſioners had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
(as We do now) that they have inſtanced no particulars at all of any ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
ſeiſed. And whereas they ſay, that <hi>Our forbearance to ſeiſe ſome Proviſions</hi> (which
Our Commiſſioners alledged in Our greateſt Wants We forbore to take, though they lay in
Magazines within Our own Quarters, but took order to ſend away into <hi>Ireland,) was no
excuſe for ſeiſing others;</hi> they miſapply that to be an excuſe, which was alledged as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that We ſeiſed none, ſince We might in Our great Want have ſeiſed thoſe, if We
had been minded to have ſeiſed any.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="540" facs="tcp:60710:283"/>
They ſay again, <hi>the Service of that Kingdom was much prejudiced by denying the
Lord</hi> Wharton'<hi>s Commiſſion, of which they have not received ſatisfaction.</hi> To this it hath
been already anſwered, that thoſe Forces were raiſed for him before any Commiſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
from Us, and that the Commiſſion for him propoſed to Us was, to have been
independent of the Lieutenant of that Kingdom; Cauſes (though not ſatisfactory to
them yet) ſufficient in themſelves to juſtifie Our refuſal. But beſides theſe, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
the Army which was brought down againſt Us was then raiſing, that the Lord
<hi>Wharton</hi> was one of the moſt active in it; and We had cauſe to be confident (nor
did he fail Us therein) that what Forces he ſhould raiſe for <hi>Ireland</hi> he would imploy
againſt Us in <hi>England:</hi> neither did that Service depend upon the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> other
able Officers were appointed over thoſe Forces, whom (if they had as much affected
that Service as the Perſon of the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>) they might have truſted with the
Tranſport of them to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where others of more Experience and fitter for Conduct
than the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> might have taken the charge of them. They ſay further,
That it was <hi>one end for which the Ceſſatian was made, that the Forces might be brought
hither to Vs out of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and imployed againſt the two Houſes.</hi> The bleeding Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> there (which have been mentioned, and whereof they cannot
but be convinced) will beſt ſpeak the cauſe of that Ceſſation; and the ſight of thoſe
Soldiers half ſtarved when they came over, having neither Cloaths to their Backs, nor
ſo much as Shoes to their Feet, nor any Pay to provide either, will witneſs the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of bringing them over, when there was no ſubſiſtance for them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor uſe
for them there during the Ceſſation. And for making uſe of them here, how can they
quarrel at Our imploying Our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers, who ſhould otherwiſe have disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when they make uſe of an Army of <hi>Scots</hi> againſt Us?</p>
                        <p>They have been told that they brought over out of <hi>Ireland</hi> the Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi>
their General, and divers <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Officers, (which they deny not;) and that before
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces brought over, they attempted the bringing once the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as likewiſe divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers there, into this Kingdom: to which all
the Anſwer given is, <hi>that the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Forces which came over were not ſent for.</hi>
Which as it denies not what is objected, ſo neither can it excuſe their not ſending
them back to the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imploying them here in an unnatural Rebellion
againſt Us.</p>
                        <p>But whatſoever their own acts or failings have been in this buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
though apparently the Neceſſities which cauſed the Ceſſation were occaſioned by the
two Houſes, yet rather than they ſhall be guilty of the blame and neglect therein, Our
People muſt be made to believe that either there were no ſuch Neceſſities, or when that is
ſo apparent, then that thoſe Neceſſities were deſigned and contrived by a Popiſh and
Prelatical Party prevalent with Us, and the Supplies denied and ſtopped by Our ſelf, and
ſo that it is reaſonable for them to preſs and inſiſt (as they do with much fervour in their
laſt Paper concerning <hi>Ireland</hi>) upon their Demands for the ſettling of the proſecution of
the War in themſelves or the <hi>Scots,</hi> excluding Us, and that there ſhall be no further Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
or Peace made there, (though the War ſhould continue here;) to have the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Lieutenant and all the great Officers there; and to have Us bound up to
aſſent to whatſoever Acts they ſhall propoſe for Moneys or other neceſſaries for the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that War: and if We agree not to theſe Propoſitions, We are like to be
charged <hi>with countenancing of that bloody Rebellion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore, though the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe Propoſitions hath been fully lay'd
open by Our Commiſſioners in their Paper, yet becauſe this of theirs is framed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to thoſe, and the fervency and fluency of their expreſſions may make impreſſions
on thoſe who do not warily weigh the matter, We ſhall examine what new inforcements
they bring to make good thoſe Demands.</p>
                        <p>The proſecution of the War there, though it be demanded (generally) in the 13.
Propoſition to be ſettled in both the Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to be
managed by the joynt Advice of both Kingdoms; yet according to their ſeventeenth
Propoſition it is to be ordered <hi>according to the Ordinance of the 11. of April</hi> 1644. which is
alſo propoſed to be <hi>enacted.</hi> By that Ordinance the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General <hi>Leven</hi> is to command
all the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> and that War is to be managed by a
<hi>joynt Committee,</hi> to be named by the two Houſes of <hi>England</hi> and the Eſtates of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Committees of each Kingdom is to have a <hi>Negative Voice.</hi>
They inſiſting to have the proſecution of the War thus ſettled, Our Commiſſioners an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <hi>That this was in effect to deliver the Kingdom of</hi> Ireland <hi>into the hands of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and neither agreeable to the Rules of Honour or Prudence.</hi> That it was
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:60710:283"/>
                           <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> if the War continued here, that We by Our conſent to Act of Parliament
for the managing of that War, and raiſing Moneys for that purpoſe, ſhould put ſo great
Power into their hands, who during theſe Troubles may turn that Power againſt Us. And
laſtly, that if the Diſtractions continued here, the Forces and Wealth of this Kingdom
would be ſo imployed at home, that the proſecution of that War to the ſubduing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
was impoſſible, but probably might be deſtruction of the remainder of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                        <p>For the Power given to Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects in that Kingdom, Our Commiſſioners ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
That General <hi>Leven</hi> being to Command all the Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Committee
of <hi>Scotland</hi> having a Negative Voice, upon difference of Opinion that War muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtand ſtill to the Ruine of Our Subjects there, or be carried as the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
whoſe Power was not bounded by any reference to Us or Our Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
no nor to the Houſes of <hi>England.</hi> And though it had been anſwered, that in caſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
betwixt the Committee, the two Houſes might proſecute the War, obſerving
the Treaty of the ſixth of <hi>August,</hi> and the Ordinance of the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April;</hi> yet by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to that Ordinance, (which is deſired to be Enacted) and by that Ordinance the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
being thereby put into the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> and that Committee without mention of the
two Houſes, it was apparent the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> would not be bound to obſerve the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Houſes of <hi>England</hi> by themſelves.</p>
                        <p>But they Reply in this laſt Paper of theirs, <hi>That as the Ordinance of the</hi> 11th <hi>of</hi> April,
1644. <hi>ſo the Treaty of the</hi> 6th <hi>of</hi> Auguſt, 1642. <hi>is deſired to be confirmed, by which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Forces in</hi> Ireland <hi>was to be anſwerable to Vs, and the two Houſes of the
Parliament of</hi> England <hi>for his whole deportment.</hi> But this is apparently no Anſwer at all:
for this Treaty of the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> binds not the Committee who are to manage that War,
and relates to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General as General of the <hi>Scots</hi> only; the other of <hi>April,</hi> 1644.
being later in time, giving him Power alſo as Commander in chief over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and according to this latter he is to receive his Orders from the Committee,
without reference to Us or the two Houſes, neither can the two Houſes be hereby brought
in to have Command over this <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General or Committee more than Our ſelves, whom
they intend wholly to exclude. Yet We cannot but obſerve even upon theſe Articles of
the Treaty of the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> how little cauſe there is to expect this <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General
will manage that War for the good of this Kingdom, who being by thoſe Articles to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<hi>to Vs</hi> as well as to the two Houſes (for then though the ſame Deſign was on foot, yet
their outward pretences were ſomewhat more modeſt than now they are) did without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
from Us leave his Charge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to bring an Army into <hi>England</hi> againſt Us.
Well, they ſay at laſt, they had (by the 13<hi>th</hi> Propoſition) deſired the proſecution of the
War to be ſettled in the two Houſes, and ſo taking all together, that the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi>
cannot manage that War according to his own diſcretion: But VVe muſt remember them,
the Propoſition is not barely to ſettle the proſecution of the VVar in the two Houſes, but
to ſettle it in the two Houſes <hi>to be managed by the joynt Advice of both Kingdoms,</hi> and that
joynt Advice is by a joynt Committee, according to the Ordinance of the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi>
in which Committee they confeſs thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> have a Negative Voice, and by the
laſt part of the 17<hi>th</hi> Propoſition, <hi>the War of</hi> Ireland <hi>is to be ordered according to that
Ordinance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But they ſay, <hi>The</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Commander is to receive Orders from the Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland,
<hi>if a Lord Lieutenant ſhall be choſen by the two Houſes</hi> (for a Lieutenant nominated by Us is
not allowed by them to give Orders to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General.) This indeed (though not
warranted by their Propoſitions, upon which nevertheleſs they inſiſt) yet being admitted
in this latitude, might ſeem to give ſome Power to the two Houſes over the <hi>Scotch</hi> General
in the manage of the VVar, as giving the Lieutenant ſuch a Power, and by conſequence
the two Houſes, who have power over this Lieutenant. But they ſay not generally, that
he ſhall receive Inſtructions from the Lieutenant, but that <hi>he ſhall receive Inſtructions from
the Lieutenant in ſuch manner as they have ſet down in their Paper of the</hi> 20th <hi>of</hi> February;
that is, <hi>when it ſhall be neceſſary for the good of that Service that he and the Commander in
chief of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Army joyn:</hi> but how ſhall it be for the Service that he joyn with him,
when he ſhall command no Forces with which he may joyn, the <hi>Scotch</hi> General being by
the Ordinance of the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> to command all the Forces whatſoever in <hi>Ireland?</hi>
But admit them to have joyned; then the <hi>Scotch</hi> General is to receive Inſtructions from the
Lieutenant, <hi>according to the Orders which ſhall be given by the Commiſſioners of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
ſo, and no otherwiſe. Still the caſe is the ſame: The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> General is not bound
to obey any Orders but ſuch as ſhall come mediately or immediately from the Committee
of both Kingdoms. And (whatſoever Evaſions and Diſguiſes are made to cover it from
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:60710:284"/>
Our People's Eyes) the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Committee being an equal number, and having an
equal ſhare in the Counſels, and their General having the Command of all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
it is apparent, the whole Power over that Kingdom is in effect to be transferred to
them.</p>
                        <p>But ſhould We admit that theſe Propoſitions did not give ſo great Power in <hi>Ireland</hi> to
Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet how ſhould it be imagined that We ſhould put the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this War in the two Houſes in ſuch manner as is inſiſted on by them, ſo long as they
maintain a Rebellion againſt Us in this Kingdom? It is not denied but by their Authority
divers Forces raiſed, and the Moneys levied for <hi>Ireland,</hi> were imployed againſt Us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and upon the ſame Pretences that they made uſe of thoſe aids (becauſe (as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in their Declaration upon that Subject) that <hi>the ſubſiſtence of</hi> Ireland <hi>depended upon
their welfare here</hi>) they may ſtill make uſe of ſuch Power as ſhall be given them for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of that VVar, and raiſing Moneys for that purpoſe, againſt Us in <hi>England.</hi> Neither
if a Peace ſhould be concluded here, could VVe aſſent that the proſecution of the VVar
ſhould be ſettled in the two Houſes, excluding Our ſelves, as they intend it by thoſe words,
<hi>the King not to moleſt them therein.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> managed the VVar in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſolely,
when the two Houſes were ſitting, and excluded them. Though VVe inſiſt not upon that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
VVe ſhould be wanting to the Truſt VVe have received from God, and that care
of Our Subjects which lies upon Us (and of which VVe are to give Him an account) to
exclude Our ſelf. They themſelves know, great Bodies are not ſo fit to carry on the VVar
as a few; and therefore they have in a manner given up their Power in this unhappy VVar
at home to their State-Committee, whoſe Reſolutions are rather brought to them for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Execution, than for Debate and Deliberation.</p>
                        <p>They tell us, <hi>The Parliament of</hi> England <hi>is a faithful Council to Vs, and that We have
truſted them with the proſecution of that War, and they faithfully diſcharged their parts in it.</hi>
VVe wiſh, though VVe are willing to be ſilent in it, that yet the Ruins and Deſolations of
this Kingdom would not ſpeak to Poſterity what Counſellors thoſe are who have deveſted
Us of Our Revenue, Arms, Ships, Power, and even the ſecurity of Our Perſon, who
have Armed Our Subjects here, who have brought in the <hi>Scots</hi> into this Kingdom, to the
tearing up the bowels of it, who have infamouſly libelled againſt Us and Our Conſort,
who have threatned to depoſe us, and impeached Her of Treaſon; and who thoſe are
who have denied Peace to this miſerable Kingdom, unleſs We would conſent to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
deſtructive Propoſitions, overturning the whole frame of Government both in
Church and State. They ſay, and it is true, <hi>We truſted them with the Proſecution of that
War:</hi> and how faithfully they diſcharged it, VVe will not again repeat: but VVe never
truſted them ſo as to exclude Our ſelves, as they now ſuppoſe; and if VVe had relied more
on the Judgments and Advice of Our Privy Council, and leſs on theirs, neither that nor
this Kingdom had been in the condition they now are. It was their Interpoſition and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which hindered the tranſportation of the Army of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives out of that Kingdom
into <hi>Spain</hi> (even to Our diſ-reputation abroad, who had agreed with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
to ſend them over, and he, in confidence of Our performance, had disburſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for their tranſport:) and had they been tranſported (their ſtay as it provoked them, ſo
it emboldening and ſtrengthening the other <hi>Iriſh</hi>) VVe are confident the flames of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
would never have broken forth at all, or at moſt have been ſo ſmall as might ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been extinguiſhed. It was their Advice that ſtaid Our going over thither in Perſon,
which probably might have ſtopped the rage of that VVar, and, by the Bleſſing of God,
would have ſaved the Effuſion of much Blood which was ſince ſhed in that Kingdom. It
was their unſeaſonable Declarations at the beginning of the Rebellion (before the old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
and other Papiſts had engaged themſelves with the Rebels of <hi>Vlſter</hi>) of making it a
VVar of Religion, and againſt that connivence which had been uſed in that Kingdom ever
ſince the Reformation, and tending to make it a National Quarrel, and to eradicate the
whole ſtock of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (which they now purſue by giving no Quarter to thoſe few of
that Nation in <hi>England</hi> who never were in that Rebellion, but according to their Duty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
us their Sovereign) which made the Rebellion ſo genera; whereas otherwiſe the old
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> as in former times (though Papiſts) would have joyned againſt thoſe Rebels.
VVhen VVe had offered in <hi>December</hi> 1641. that 10000. Voluntiers ſhould be raiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
in <hi>England</hi> for the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if the Houſe of Commons would declare they
would pay them; inſtead thereof, in <hi>January</hi> following Propoſitions were made for the
tranſporting the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and VVe were adviſed by the two Houſes, to give the
Command and keeping of the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Carick fergus</hi> to the <hi>Scotiſh,</hi> who were to
be tranſported thither, and pay'd by this Kingdom: to which VVe returned Anſwer, <hi>That
we did not approve the ſame, as prejudicial to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Service intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:60710:284"/>
and implying too great truſt for Auxiliary Forces;</hi> yet afterwards; becauſe VVe perceived
the inſiſting upon it would breed a great delay in the neceſſary ſupply of that Kingdom,
VVe did admit of the Advice of the Parliament in that particular, (and ſince, by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the ſixth of <hi>August,</hi> 1642. (which though ſaid to be made by Commiſſioners au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by Us and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> VVe never were made acquainted with
them, till upon this Treaty almoſt three years after) both the Towns and Caſtles of <hi>Carick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus</hi>
and <hi>Colrane</hi> are left with them as Cautionary.) The conſequence whereof was ſuch,
that though the Service of <hi>Ireland</hi> were little advanced, or the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants
relieved by it, and this Kingdom drained to pay thoſe (whoſe great Arrears growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Agreement, muſt be paid out of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they have ſo good foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already, or of Our good Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> according to their other Propoſitions) by
this means the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> having an Army there, under colour of ſupplying them, Our Arms
and Ammunition were ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> for the ſupply of another Army to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England;</hi> and the countenance of that Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it gave encouragement to ſome
of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects, ſo it over-awed others, and was a means, without any the leaſt
provocation to thoſe Our ungrateful Subjects, of bringing of another Army into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where they ſtill remain, to the utter Ruine of many of Our good Subjects, and the
probable Deſtruction of the whole Kingdom. And laſtly, it was upon their Advice in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>
1641. (ſhortly after thoſe Propoſitions tendred for tranſporting the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>)
that We agreed, that the Rebels Lands ſhould be ſhared amongſt the Adventurers, and the
Rebels to have no Pardons; though We then expreſly declared, <hi>We did it meerly relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Wiſdom, without further examining,</hi> (what We in Our particular Judgment were
perſwaded) <hi>whether that courſe might not retard the reducing of that Kingdom, by exaſperating
the Rebels, and rendring them deſperate of being received into grace if they ſhould return to their
Obedience.</hi> And it is moſt apparent that thoſe Propoſitions, and the Act drawn upon them,
wherein alſo a further Clauſe (not obſerved by Us, but paſſed, as conceiving that Act had
wholly purſued the Propoſitions) was inſerted, <hi>That every perſon who ſhould make, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to take any Compact, Bond, Covenant, Oath, Promiſe or Agreement, to introduce or bring
into the ſaid Realm of</hi> Ireland <hi>the Authority of the See of</hi> Rome <hi>in any caſe whatſoever, or to
maintain or defend the ſame, ſhould forfeit his Lands and Goods,</hi> (as in caſe of Rebellion) were
great cauſes not only of provoking, but increaſing and encouraging the Rebels; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no pretence before for the horrid Rebellion, had now ſome colour to make it a matter
of Religion, and ſo to make their application to Foreign Princes, and to negotiate with them
for delivering that Kingdom into their hands. We profeſs Our averſion from their Religion
and hatred to their Rebellion: but though We think them worſe Chriſtians becauſe they are
Rebels, We think them not worſe Rebels becauſe they are Papiſts: A Proteſtant Rebel in
the ſame degree of Rebellion hath far more to anſwer, as having more light, and it being
more expreſly againſt the Religion he profeſſeth, whereof it hath heretofore been a Maxim
(though it be now taken for Apocryphal Doctrine) <hi>Not to take up Arms againſt their Prince
upon any pretence whatſoever.</hi> And as We have endeavoured by Our Perſonal Example and
otherwiſe, ſo We ſhall ſtill continue by all good means to propagate the Proteſtant Religion:
but We are far from that <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctrine, that We ought to propagate Our Religion
by the Sword. And though We ſhall be moſt willing to hearken to the Advice of Our
People aſſembled in a free Parliament; yet We ſhould be wanting to the Truſt that God
hath repoſed in Us, and Our uſe of that Reaſon with which He hath endowed Us, if We
ſhould wholly give up that Kingdom to be managed ſolely by their Counſels, ſecluding Our
ſelves from all Intereſt therein, eſpecially when We conſider that which Experience hath
taught Us, if they have the ſole Power of that War (by which all the Soldiers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
being to be nominated and pay'd, removed and advanced by them, the neceſſary
application (paſſing by Us) muſt be made to ſuch as are powerful with them) how eaſie a
matter it will be for a prevalent Faction (if they ſhall have a mind to demand other things
hereafter not fit to be granted) again to bring over an Army raiſed and payed by them into
this Kingdom, eſpecially ſo much compoſed of Our <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subjects. And whereas they
deſire further <hi>the nomination of the Lord Lieutenant and other great Officers and Judges in that
Kingdom,</hi> (which they alſo deſire in this of <hi>England</hi>) they cannot but know, that it muſt
of neceſſity take away all dependency upon Us and application to Us, when the power to
reward thoſe who are worthy of publick Truſt ſhall be transferred to others, and having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force left Us to puniſh nor power to reward, We ſhall be in effect a titular contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prince. We ſhall leave all Our Miniſters to the known Laws of the Land, to be tried and
puniſhed according to thoſe Laws if they ſhall offend; but We cannot conſent to put ſo
great a Truſt and Power out of Us: and VVe have juſt cauſe to conceive, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their ſpecious pretences, this deſire of nomination of thoſe great Officers is but a cloak
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:60710:285"/>
to cover the Ambition of thoſe who having been the Boutefeus of this Rebellion, deſire
to advance themſelves and their own Faction. And to that which is ſaid, that Our <hi>bad

protected in greater ſecurity againſt the Papiſts. And VVe muſt remember them, that
that Rebellion was begun when there was no Lieutenant there, and when the Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which had been formerly uſed in that Kingdom was queſtioned and diſgraced, when
thoſe in the Parliament there by whom that Rebellion was hatched were countenanced in
their complaints and proſecution.</p>
                        <p>But they are not content to demand all the Power over <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the nomination of
all Officers, but We muſt alſo engage Our ſelf to paſs <hi>ſuch Acts as ſhall be preſented to Vs
for raiſing of Moneys and other neceſſaries for that War.</hi> Our former readineſs to paſs Acts
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe they were adviſed by the two Houſes, (when they were apparently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to Our ſelf, and contrary to Our own Judgment) might ſufficiently ſatisfie them
We would make no difficulty to conſent to ſuch Acts as ſhould be for the good of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
but they have been already told it was unreaſonable to make a general engagement,
before We ſaw the Acts whether reaſonable or no, and whether <hi>thoſe other neceſſaries may not
in truth comprehend what is not only unneceſſary, but very inconvenient.</hi> But the People, they
ſay, <hi>who have truſted them with their Purſe, will never begrudg what they make them lay out
upon that occaſion.</hi> The two Houſes indeed were entruſted that Our Subjects ſhould not be
charged without them, but they never were ſolely truſted by Our Subjects with a Power to
charge them; the care that no preſſure in that or any other kind ſhould be upon Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is principally in Us, without whoſe Conſent (notwithſtanding the late contrary and
unexampled practice) no ſuch Charge can or ought to be levied, and We ought not to give
that Conſent but where it is viſibly for the good of Our Kingdoms; which upon ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
power of raiſing Moneys may fall out otherwiſe, eſpecially in ſo unuſual a caſe as
this, where thoſe who muſt have the ſole manage of the VVar ſhall have the ſole command
of the Purſe, without any check or controll upon them. But they ſay again, <hi>VVe have
heretofore been poſſeſſed againſt the Parliament, for not giving away the Money of the Subject
when VVe had deſired it, but never yet did VVe reſtrain them from it.</hi> It is true, We had no
great cauſe heretofore to reſtrain the two Houſes from giving the Subjects Money to Us,
having found more difficulty to obtain from them three or four Subſidies, than they have
met with in raiſing ſo many Millions. But Our People cannot think themſelves well dealt
with by Us, if We ſhall conſent to put an unlimited power of raiſing what Moneys they
pleaſe in thoſe Perſons who have drained more wealth from them in four years, than We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all the Supplies given to the Crown in 400. years before have amounted unto.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place, We wiſh every man to conſider how the Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> can be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by War, whilſt theſe unhappy Diſtractions continue here, whilſt contrary Forces and
Armies are raiſed in moſt parts of this Kingdom, and the blood of Our People is ſpilt like
water upon the ground, whilſt the Kingdom is waſted by Soldiers, and the People exhauſted
by maintaining them, and (as if this Kingdom were not ſufficient to deſtroy it ſelf) whilſt
an Army of <hi>Scots</hi> is brought into the bowels of this Kingdom, and maintained at the charge
of it; whilſt this Kingdom labours under ſuch a War, how is it poſſible that a conſiderable
ſupply of men or money can be ſent into <hi>Ireland?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To this with much fervour of expreſſion they ſay,</hi> It muſt not depend upon the condition
of Our other Kingdoms to revenge God's Quarrel upon ſuch perfidious Enemies to the Goſpel of
Chriſt, who have embrewed their hands in ſo much Proteſtant Blood; that the Ceſſation is for
their Advantage, Arms and Ammunition, and all manner of Commodities may be brought to
them; that it is not fit there be any Agreement of Peace or reſpite from Hostility with ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as are not fit to live, more than with VVolves or Tigers, or any ravenous Beasts, deſtroyers of
mankind.</p>
                        <p>VVe are moſt ſenſible of the blood and horror of that Rebellion, and would be glad that
either a Peace in this Kingdom or any other Expedient might furniſh Us with means and
power to do Juſtice upon it. If this cannot be, We muſt not deſperately expoſe Our good
Subjects to their Butchery without means or poſſibility of protection. God will in His due
time revenge His Own Quarrel: in the mean time His Goſpel gives Us leave in caſe of War
to ſit down, and caſt up the coſt, and eſtimate Our Power to go through with it; and in ſuch
caſe where Prudence adviſeth it is lawful to propoſe conditions of Peace, though the VVar
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:60710:285"/>
otherwiſe might juſtly be purſued. And ſurely, as a Ceſſation in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Rebels, as all Ceſſations in their nature are to both parts, they having thereby
time and liberty to procure Arms and Ammunition to be brought to them: ſo it is not only
for the advantage, but neceſſary preſervation of Our good Subjects there, whoſe bleeding
Dangers call for Our bowels of Charity and Compaſſion, by ſuſpending the rage of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
by this Ceſſation, till means may be found to turn their hearts, or to diſable their
Malice from purſuing their Cruelty, to the utter Ruin of that Remainder of Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there; it being more acceptable to God and Man to preſerve a few good men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
than to deſtroy a multitude, though in the way of Juſtice: and perhaps a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may bring ſome of thoſe Rebels to reflect upon their Offences, and to return to their
Duty: all are not in the ſame degree of guilt, all were not Authors of nor conſenting to the
Cruelties committed; ſome were inforced to comply with, or not reſiſt their proceedings;
ſome were ſeduced upon a belief the Nation was deſigned to be eradicated, and the VVar
not againſt the Rebellion only, but their Religion. The VVar deſtroys all alike without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
(even innocent Children have ſuffered, not by the Rebels only) and all are not Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or Wolves: there may be grounds of Mercy to ſome, though no ſeverity be exceſſive
towards others. However, We cannot deſire the deſtruction even of the worſt of thoſe
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, ſo much as We do the preſervation of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> remaining there; but
ſhould make choice rather to ſave the Rebels for preſerving the lives of thoſe poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
than deſtroy them to ruine the Rebels. And therefore exceeding ſtrange it is to
Us and We are ſorry to find, that any <hi>Engliſh</hi> men (who have ſeen this their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
heretofore (even in Our time) flouriſhing beyond moſt of the Kingdoms and Churches
in the world, and now moſt hideous and deformed, weltring in the blood of her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and, if this VVar continue, like to be a perpetual ſpectacle of Deſolation,) ſhould
expreſs that <hi>they deſire War in</hi> Ireland <hi>as much as they do Peace here,</hi> no more valuing the
ſparing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood here, than they do the effuſion of the blood of the Rebels in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
They ſay, indeed, <hi>they are willing to lay out their Eſtates and Lives both for the War in</hi>
Ireland <hi>and Peace in this Kingdom;</hi> but withal they ſay, <hi>they have made Propoſitions for both,
if Our Commiſſioners would agree to them.</hi> Theſe are the Conditions they offer, neither Peace
is to be had here without agreeing to their Propoſitions, nor that VVar in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
but according to thoſe Propoſitions, ſuch Propoſitions as apparently tend to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of the Church, to the ſubverſion of all Our Power, to the ſetting up a new frame of
popular Government, to the deſtructioo of Our Loyal and true-hearted Subjects; Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
which aſſociate Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Counſels and Power, and inveſt
them in a great ſhare of the Government and VVealth of this Kingdom, and render both
the VVealth and Power of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be at their command. Theſe Propoſitions they inſiſt
upon, and for the obtaining theſe, they are reſolved to engage <hi>the Lives and Eſtates</hi> of Our
poor People in this unnatural Rebellion. But VVe truſt God Almighty will open the Eyes
and the Hearts of Our People, not to aſſiſt them any longer againſt Us in the ſhedding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood in this VVar. And VVe caſt Our ſelves on Him, waiting His good time for
the reſtoring the Peace of Our Kingdoms, and Our deliverance from theſe Troubles, which
at length VVe are aſſured He will give unto Us.</p>

of a deep and ſeeming ſenſe of the Miſeries of this afflicted Kingdom, and of the
Dangers incident to His Perſon during the continuance of this unnatural War, your
many great and ſo often repeated Proteſtations, that the raiſing theſe Arms hath been only for

Calamities, which, if not in time prevented, muſt prove the ruin of this unhappy Nation; and

no former times) to His Majeſties two former Meſſages, His Majeſty will lay aſide
all Expoſtulations, as rather ſerving to loſe time, than to contribute any remedy
to the evils which (for the preſent) do afflict this diſtracted Kingdom: Therefore, without
further Preamble, His Majeſty thinks it moſt neceſſary to ſend theſe Propoſitions this way,
which He intended to do by the Perſons mentioned in His former Meſſages; though He well
knows the great diſadvantage which Overtures of this kind have, by the want of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

                     <p>His Majeſty conceiving that the former Treaties have hitherto proved ineffectual,
chiefly for want of Power in thoſe Perſons that Treated, as likewiſe becauſe thoſe from
whom their Power was derived (not poſſibly having the particular informations of

earneſt and ſincere intentions of putting an end to theſe unnatural Diſtractions,
(knowing that point of ſecurity may prove the greateſt obſtacle to this moſt bleſſed

ſigns of a real Intention to Peace; and ſhall now only inſiſt upon His former Meſſage

                     <p>BUT that theſe are times wherein nothing is ſtrange, it were a thing much to be
marvelled at, what ſhould cauſe this unparallel'd long detention of His Majeſties
Trumpet, ſent with His Gracious Meſſage of the 26. of <hi>December</hi> laſt; Peace being the
only ſubject of it, and His Majeſties Perſonal Treaty the means propoſed for it. And it
were almoſt as great a wonder, that His Majeſty ſhould be ſo long from inquiring after it,
if that the hourly expectation thereof had not in ſome meaſure ſatisfied His Impatience.
But leſt His Majeſty by His long ſilence ſhould condemn Himſelf of Careleſneſs in that
which ſo much concerns the good of all His People, He thinks it high time to inquire
after His ſaid Trumpeter: For ſince all men who pretend any goodneſs muſt deſire Peace,
and that all men know Treaties to be the beſt and moſt Chriſtian way to procure it, and
there being as little queſtion that His Majeſties Perſonal Preſence in it is the likelieſt way to
bring it to a happy Iſſue; He judges there muſt be ſome ſtrange variety of accidents which
cauſeth this moſt tedious Delay. Wherefore His Majeſty earneſtly deſires to have a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Account of His former Meſſage, the ſubject whereof is Peace, and the means His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Preſence at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> where, the Government of the Church being ſetled as it was
in the times of the happy and glorious Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> and
full Liberty for the eaſe of their Conſciences who will not communicate in that Service
eſtabliſhed by Law, and likewiſe for the free and publick uſe of the <hi>Directory</hi> (preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and by Command of the two Houſes of Parliament now practiſed in ſome parts of
the City of <hi>London</hi>) to ſuch as ſhall deſire to uſe the ſame, and all Forces being agreed
to be Disbanded, His Majeſty will then forthwith (as He hath in His Meſſage of the 29.
of <hi>December</hi> laſt already offered) joyn with His two Houſes of Parliament in ſetling ſome
way for the payment of the publick Debts to His <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects, the City of <hi>London</hi> and
others. And His Majeſty having propoſed a fair way for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which
now by this long Delay ſeems not to be thought ſufficient Security; His Majeſty (to ſhew
how really He will imploy Himſelf at His coming to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for making this a laſting
Peace, and taking away all Jealouſies, how groundleſs ſoever) will endeavour, upon
debate with His two Houſes, ſo to diſpoſe of it (as likewiſe of the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi>) as
may give to them and both Kingdoms juſt ſatisfaction; not doubting alſo but to give good
contentment to His two Houſes of Parliament in the choice of the Lord Admiral, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of State and others, if His two Houſes, by their ready inclinations to Peace, ſhall
give him encouragement thereunto.</p>

Thus His Majeſty having taken occaſion by His juſt impatience ſo to explain His Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that no man can doubt of a happy iſſue to this ſucceeding Treaty; if now there
ſhall be ſo much as a Delay of the ſame, He calls God and the World to witneſs who

much the ſtranger, that His Majeſties coming to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (which was firſt the greateſt
pretence for taking up Arms) ſhould be ſo much as delayed, much leſs not accepted, or

That there hath been no Delay on our parts, but what was neceſſary in a buſineſs of
ſo great a conſequence, as is expreſt in our former Letter to Your Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Perſonal Treaty deſired by your Majeſty, There having been ſo much
innocent blood of Your good Subjects ſhed in this War by Your Majeſties Commands
and Commiſſions, <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels brought over into both Kingdoms, and endeavours to
bring over more into both of them, as alſo Forces from Foreign parts; Your Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Arms in theſe parts, and the Prince in the head of an Army in the Weſt, divers
Towns made Garriſons and kept in Hoſtility by Your Majeſty againſt the Parliament of
<hi>England;</hi> there being alſo Forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt that Parliament and Kingdom, by
Your Majeſties Commiſſion; the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> fomented and prolonged by Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
whereby the three Kingdoms are brought near to utter Ruine and Deſtruction: we
conceive, that until ſatisfaction and ſecurity be firſt given to both Your Kingdoms, Your
Majeſties coming hither cannot be convenient, nor by us aſſented unto; neither can we
apprehend it a means conducing to Peace, that Your Majeſty ſhould come to Your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a few days, with any thoughts of leaving it, eſpecially with intentions of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Hoſtility againſt it. And we do obſerve, That Your Majeſty deſires the Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not only of Your Parliaments, but of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
and <hi>Militia</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> the chief Commanders of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax's</hi>
Army and thoſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, which is againſt the Priviledges and Honour of the
Parliaments, thoſe being joyned with them who are ſubject and ſubordinate to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>That which Your Majeſty (againſt the Freedom of the Parliaments) inforces in both
Your Letters with many earneſt expreſſions, as if in no other way than that propounded
by Your Majeſty the Peace of Your Kingdoms could be eſtabliſhed, Your Majeſty may
pleaſe to remember, that in our laſt Letter we did declare that Propoſitions from both
Kingdoms were ſpeedily to be ſent to Your Majeſty, which we conceive to be the only
way for the attaining a happy and well-grounded Peace, and Your Majeſties Aſſent unto
thoſe Propoſitions will be an effectual means for giving ſatisfaction and ſecurity to Your
Kingdoms, will aſſure a firm Union between the two Kingdoms, (as much deſired by
each for other as for themſelves) and ſettle Religion, and ſecure the Peace of the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereof neither is ſo much as mentioned in Your Majeſties Letter.</p>
                     <p>And in proceeding according to theſe juſt and neceſſary grounds for the putting an

                     <p>HIS Majeſty thinks not fit now to anſwer thoſe Aſperſions which are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as Arguments for his not admittance to <hi>VVestminſter</hi> for a Perſonal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
becauſe it would inforce a Style not ſuitable to his End, it being the Peace
of theſe miſerable Kingdoms: yet thus much he cannot but ſay to thoſe who have
ſent him this Anſwer, That if they had conſidered what they had done themſelves
in occaſioning the ſhedding of ſo much innocent Blood, by withdrawing themſelves
from their Duty to him in a time when he had granted ſo much to his Subjects,
and in violating the known Laws of the Kingdom to draw an exorbitant Power
to themſelves over their fellow-Subjects, (to ſay no more, to do as they have
done) they could not have given ſuch a falſe Character of his Majeſties Actions.
Wherefore his Majeſty muſt now remember them, that having ſome hours before his
receiving of their laſt Paper of the 13. of <hi>Jan.</hi> ſent another Meſſage to them of the
fifteenth, wherein by divers particulars He inlargeth himſelf to ſhew the reality of
his endeavours for Peace by his deſired Perſonal Treaty (which he ſtill conceives to
be the likelieſt way to attain to that bleſſed End) he thinks fit by this Meſſage to
call for an Anſwer to that, and indeed to all the former: For certainly no rational
man can think their laſt Paper can be any Anſwer to his former Demands, the ſcope
of it being, that becauſe there is a War, therefore there ſhould be no Treaty for
Peace. And is it poſſible to expect that the Propoſitions mentioned ſhould be the
grounds of a laſting Peace, when the Perſons that ſend them will not endure to
hear their own King ſpeak? But whatever the ſucceſs hath been of his Majeſties
former Meſſages, or how ſmall ſoever his hopes are of a better, conſidering the high
ſtrain of thoſe who deal with his Majeſty, yet he will neither want Fatherly bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
to his Subjects in general, nor will he forget that God hath appointed him for
their King with whom he Treats. Wherefore he now demands a ſpeedy Anſwer to

And firſt therefore, Whereas in the ſaid laſt Paper it is objected as an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to his Majeſties Perſonal Treaty, that much innocent Blood hath been ſhed
in this War by his Majeſties Commiſſions, &amp;c. He will not now diſpute (it being
apparent to all the World by whom this Blood hath been ſpilt) but rather preſſeth
that there ſhould be no more: and to that end only he hath deſired this Perſonal
Treaty, as judging it the moſt immediate means to aboliſh ſo many horrid Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in all his Kingdoms. And it is no Argument, to ſay, That there ſhall be no
ſuch Perſonal Treaty, becauſe there have been Wars, it being a ſtrong inducement
to have ſuch a Treaty to put an end to the War.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That there ſhould be no ſuch Perſonal Treaty, becauſe ſome of his <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Subjects have repaired to his Aſſiſtance in it, ſeems an Argument altogether as ſtrange
as the other; as always urging that there ſhould be no Phyſick, becauſe the party is
ſick. And in this particular it hath been often obſerved unto them, that thoſe whom they
call <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who have ſo expreſſed their Loyalty to their Soveraign, were indeed (for
the moſt part) ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants as had been formerly ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> by
the two Houſes, impoſſibilitated to ſtay there any longer by the neglect of thoſe
that ſent them thither, who ſhould there have better provided for them. And for
any Forein Forces, it is too apparent that <hi>their</hi> Armies have ſwarmed with them, when
his Majeſty hath had few or none.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, for a third impediment, it is alledged that the Prince is in the head
of an Army in the Weſt, and that there are divers Garriſons ſtill kept in his Majeſties
Obedience, and that there are Forces in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it muſt be as much confeſſed, as
that as yet there is no Peace: and therefore it is deſired that by ſuch a Perſonal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
all theſe impediments may be removed. And it is not here amiſs to put them in
mind, how long ſince his Majeſty did preſs a disbanding of all Forces on both ſides;
the refuſing whereof hath been the cauſe of this Objection.</p>
                     <p>And whereas exception is taken, that there is a time limited in the Propoſition for
his Majeſties Perſonal Treaty, thereupon inferring that he ſhould again return to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility;
his Majeſty proteſteth that he ſeeks this Treaty to avoid future Hoſtility, and
to procure a laſting Peace: and if he can meet with like inclinations to Peace in thoſe
he deſires to Treat with, he will bring ſuch affections and reſolutions in himſelf as ſhall
end all theſe unhappy bloody Differences.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Ingagements which his Majeſty hath deſired for his Security, whoſoever
ſhall call to mind the particular occaſions that enforced his Majeſty to leave his City
of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>VVestminſter,</hi> will judge his Demand very reaſonable and neceſſary for
his Safety. But he no way conceiveth how the Lord Maior, Aldermen, Common-Council
and <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> were either ſubject or ſubordinate to that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is alledged, as knowing neither Law nor practice for it: and if the two
Armies be, he believes it is more than can be parallel'd by any former times in this
Kingdom. Nor can his Majeſty underſtand how his Majeſties ſeeking of a Perſonal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
can be any breach of Priviledge; it being likely to be infringed by hindring his
Majeſty from coming freely to his two Houſes.</p>
                     <p>As for the Objection, that his Majeſty omitted to mention the ſettling Religion
and ſecuring the Peace of his Native Kingdom, his Majeſty declares, that he conceives
that it was included in his former, and hath been particularly mentioned in his latter
Meſſage of the 15. preſent. But, for their better ſatisfaction, he again expreſſeth, that
it was and ever ſhall be both his meaning and endeavour in this Treaty deſired. And
it ſeems to him very clear, that there is no way for a final ending of ſuch Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as afflict this Kingdom, but either by Treaty or Conqueſt: the latter of which
his Majeſty hopes none will have the impudence or impiety to wiſh for; and for the
former, if his Perſonal aſſiſtance in it be not the moſt likely way, let any reaſonable
man judge, when by that means not only all unneceſſary Delays will be removed, but
even the greateſt Difficulties made eaſy. And therefore he doth now again earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon that Propoſition, expecting to have a better Anſwer upon mature conſideration.
And can it be imagined that any Propoſitions will be ſo effectual being formed before a
Perſonal Treaty, as ſuch as are framed and propounded upon a full debate on both ſides?
Wherefore his Majeſty, who is moſt concerned in the good of his People, and is moſt
deſirous to reſtore Peace and Happineſs to his three Kingdoms, doth again inſtantly deſire
an Anſwer to his ſaid former Meſſages, to which he hath hitherto received none.</p>

                     <p>HIS Majeſty having received Information from the Lord Lieutenant and
Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> hath, without his or their
Directions or privity, entred into a Treaty with ſome Commiſſioners on
the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick Party there, and alſo drawn up and agreed unto certain
Articles with the ſaid Commiſſioners, highly derogatory to his Majeſties Honour
and Royal Dignity, and moſt prejudicial unto the Proteſtant Religion and
Church there in <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereupon the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> is arreſted upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of High Treaſon, and impriſoned by the ſaid Lord Lieutenant and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
at the inſtance and by the Impeachment of the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> who (by reaſon
of his Place, and former Imployment in theſe Affairs) doth beſt know how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
that Proceeding of the ſaid Earl hath been to His Majeſties Intentions and
Directions, and what great prejudice it might bring to His Affairs, if thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> ſhould be any ways underſtood to have been
done by the directions, liking, or approbation of his Majeſty:</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having in his former Meſſages for a Perſonal Treaty offered to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to his two Houſes in the Buſineſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath now thought fitting,
the better to ſhew his clear Intentions, and to give ſatisfaction to his ſaid Houſes of
Parliament, and the reſt of his Subjects in all his Kingdoms, to ſend this Declaration
to his ſaid Houſes, containing the whole truth of the buſineſs. Which is,</p>
                     <p>That the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> having made offer unto him to raiſe Forces in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to conduct them into <hi>England</hi> for his Majeſties Service, had a
Commiſſion to that purpoſe, and to that purpoſe only.</p>
                     <p>That he had no Commiſſion at all to Treat of any thing elſe without the privity and
directions of the Lord Lieutenant, much leſs to capitulate any thing concerning Religion,
or any Propriety belonging either to Church or Laity.</p>
                     <p>That it clearly appears by the Lord Lieutenant's Proceedings with the ſaid Earl, that
he had no notice at all of what the ſaid Earl had Treated and pretended to have capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> until by accident it came to his knowledge.</p>
                     <p>And his Majeſty doth proteſt, that until ſuch time as he had advertiſement that the
Perſon of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was arreſted and reſtrained, as is above-ſaid,
He never heard nor had any kind of notice that the ſaid Earl had entred into any
kind of Treaty or Capitulation with thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners; much leſs that he
had concluded or ſigned thoſe Articles, ſo deſtructive both to Church and State, and
ſo repugnant to his Majeſties publick Profeſſions and known Reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>And for the further vindication of his Majeſties Honour and Integrity herein, He
doth declare, That He is ſo far from conſidering any thing contained in thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
or Writings framed by the ſaid Earl and thoſe Commiſſioners with whom he
Treated, as he doth abſolutely diſavow him therein, and hath given Commandment
to the Lord Lieutenant and the Council there to proceed againſt the ſaid Earl, as
one who, either out of falſeneſs, preſumption, or folly, hath ſo hazarded the blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Majeſties Reputation with his good Subjects, and ſo impertinently framed
thoſe Articles of his own head, without the Conſent, Privity, or Directions of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
or the Lord Lieutenant, or any of his Majeſties Council there. But true it is, that
for the neceſſary preſervation of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Caſe
was daily repreſented unto him to be ſo deſperate, his Majeſty had given Commiſſion to
the Lord Lieutenant to Treat and conclude ſuch a Peace there as might be for the ſafety
of that Crown, the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and no way derogatory to
his own Honour and publick Profeſſions.</p>
                     <p>But to the end that his Majeſties real Intentions in this buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:60710:291"/>
the more clearly underſtood, and to give more ample ſatisfaction to both Houſes of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
and the Commiſſioners of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> eſpecially concerning his
Majeſties not being engaged in any Peace or Agreement there, he doth deſire, if the
two Houſes ſhall admit of his Majeſties repair to <hi>London</hi> for a Perſonal Treaty, (as
was formerly propoſed) that ſpeedy notice be given thereof to his Majeſty, and a
Paſs or ſafe Conduct, with a Blank, ſent for a Meſſenger to be immediately diſpatched
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prevent any accident that may happen to hinder his Majeſties Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of leaving and managing of the buſineſs of <hi>Ireland</hi> wholly to the two Houſes, and
to make no Peace there but with their Conſent; which, in caſe it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſs
His endeavours in the Treaty with ſucceſs, His Majeſty doth hereby engage himſelf to do.</p>
                     <p>And for a further explanation of his Majeſties Intentions in his former Meſſages, he
doth now Declare, That if his Perſonal repair to <hi>London,</hi> as aforeſaid, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and a Peace thereon ſhall enſue, he will then leave the Nomination of the
Perſons to be entruſted with the <hi>Militia</hi> wholly to his two Houſes, with ſuch Power
and Limitations as are expreſſed in the Paper delivered by his Majeſties Commiſſioners
at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> the 6. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1644. for the term of ſeven years, as hath been deſired,
to begin immediately after the Concluſion of the Peace, the disbanding of all Forces on
both ſides, and the diſmantling of the Garriſons erected ſince theſe preſent Troubles; ſo
as at the expiration of the time before mentioned the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhall entirely
revert and remain as before.</p>
                     <p>And for their further ſecurity, his Majeſty (the Peace ſucceeding) will be content,
that <hi>pro hac vice</hi> the two Houſes ſhall nominate the Admiral, Officers of State and
Judges, to hold their places during Life, or <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint,</hi> which ſhall be
beſt liked, to be accomptable to none but the King and the two Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>As for matter of Religion, his Majeſty doth further Declare, That by the Liberty
offered in his Meſſage of the 15. preſent, for the eaſe of their Conſciences who will
not communicate in the Service already eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he intends that all other Proteſtants, behaving themſelves peaceably in and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Civil Government, ſhall have the free exerciſe of their Religion according to their
own way.</p>
                     <p>And for the total removing of all Fears and Jealouſies, His Majeſty is willing to
agree, That upon the Concluſion of Peace there ſhall be a general act of Oblivion and
Free Pardon paſt by Act of Parliament in both his Kingdoms reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>And leſt it ſhould be imagined, that in the making theſe Propoſitions, his Majeſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> and his Subjects there have been forgotten or neglected, his Majeſty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
That what is here mentioned touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the naming of Officers of
State and Judges, ſhall likewiſe extend to his Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now his Majeſty having ſo fully and clearly expreſſed his Intentions and Deſires of
making a happy and well-grounded Peace, if any perſon ſhall decline that Happineſs by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſo apparent a way of attaining it, he will ſufficiently demonſtrate to all the World,
his intention and deſign can be no other then the total ſubverſion and change of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and happy Government of this Kingdom, under which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation hath ſo
long flouriſhed.</p>

received either no Anſwer at all, or ſuch as argues nothing will ſatisfie them but the
Ruin, not onely of Us, Our Poſterity and Friends, but even of Monarchy it ſelf; and
having lately received very good Security, that We, and all that do or ſhall adhere to Us,

to give you Power and Authority to Treat with them upon ſuch pious, honourable and ſafe

was and will be ever deſirous to take all ways which might the

but you will alſo have a due regard to maintain the juſt Power of the Crown,
according to your many Proteſtations and Profeſſions. For certainly, except King
and People have reciprocal care each of other, neither can be happy.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, 'Tis your KING Who deſires to be heard (the which if refuſed
to a Subject by a King, he would be thought a Tyrant for it) and for that end
which all men profeſs to deſire. Wherefore his Majeſty conjures you, as you deſire
to ſhew your ſelves really what you profeſs, even as you are good Chriſtians and
Subjects, that you will accept this his Offer, which he is confident God will ſo bleſs,
that it will be the readieſt means by which theſe Kingdoms may again become a comfort
to their Friends, and a terror to their Enemies.</p>

ſtate I ſtand (as in relation to Freedom) before I can give you any other Anſwer.
(The Reaſon of this My Queſtion the Governour can beſt reſolve you,) But if you
object the loſs of time and urgency of it; certainly in one reſpect it preſſes none
ſo much as My ſelf: which makes Me alſo think it neceſſary (that I be not to ſeek

                     <p>AS the daily expectation of the coming of the Propoſitions hath made his Majeſty
this long time to forbear giving his Anſwer unto them; ſo the appearance of their
ſending being no more (for any thing he can hear) than it was at his firſt coming
hither, notwithſtanding that the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> hath been at <hi>London</hi> above theſe Ten
days, (whoſe not coming was ſaid to be the onely ſtop) hath cauſed his Majeſty thus to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
their coming to him. And yet conſidering his Condition, that his Servants are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
acceſs to him, all but very few, and thoſe by appointment, not his own election; and
that it is declared a Crime for any but the Commiſſioners, or ſuch who are particularly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them, to converſe with his Majeſty, or that any Letters ſhould be given to or
received from him; may he not truly ſay, That he is not in caſe fit to make Conceſſions,
or give Anſwers, ſince he is not maſter of thoſe ordinary Actions which are the undoubted
Rights of any free-born man, how mean ſoever his Birth be? And certainly he would ſtill be
ſilent as to this Subject until his Condition were much mended, did he not prefer ſuch a
right underſtanding betwixt him and his Parliaments of both Kingdoms, which may make
a firm and laſting Peace in all his Dominions, before any particular of his own or any
earthly Bleſſing: and therefore his Majeſty hath diligently employed his utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for divers months paſt, ſo to inform his Underſtanding and to ſatisfie his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:60710:300"/>
that he might be able to give ſuch Anſwers to the Propoſitions as would be moſt
agreeable to his Parliaments; but he ingenuouſly profeſſes, that not withſtanding all the
pains that he hath taken therein, the nature of ſome of them appears ſuch unto him, that
without diſclaiming that Reaſon which God hath given him to judge by for the good of
him and his People, and without putting the greateſt violence upon his own Conſcience,
he cannot give his Conſent to all of them. Yet his Majeſty (that it may appear to all the
World how deſirous he is to give full ſatisfaction) hath thought fit hereby to expreſs his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to grant what he may, and his willingneſs to receive from them, and that Perſonally,
(if his two Houſes at <hi>VVeſtminster</hi> ſhall approve thereof) ſuch further information in the
reſt as may beſt convince his Judgment, and ſatisfie thoſe Doubts which are not yet clear
unto him: deſiring them alſo to conſider, That if his Majeſty intended to wind himſelf
out of theſe Troubles by indirect means, were it not eaſie for him now readily to conſent
to what hath or ſhall be propoſed unto him, and afterwards chuſe his time to break all,
alledging, That forc'd Conceſſions are not to be kept? Surely he might, and not incur a
hard Cenſure from ſome indifferent men. But Maximes in this kind are not the Guides of
his Majeſties Actions: for he freely and clearly avows, that he holds it unlawful for any man,
and moſt baſe in a King, to recede from his Promiſes for having been obtained by force or
under reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore his Majeſty not onely rejecting thoſe Acts which he eſteems unworthy
of him, but even paſſing by that which he might well inſiſt upon, a Point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in reſpect of his preſent Condition, thus anſwers the firſt Propoſition; That
upon his Majeſties coming to <hi>London,</hi> He will heartily joyn in all that ſhall concern
the Honour of his two Kingdoms, or the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or of
the Commiſſioners or Deputies of either Kingdom, particularly in thoſe things which
are deſired in that Propoſition; upon confidence that all of them reſpectively with
the ſame Tenderneſs will look upon thoſe things which concern his Majeſties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to all the Propoſitions concerning Religion, his Majeſty propoſeth, that
he will confirm the Presbyterial Government, the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>VVeſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and the Directory, for Three years, being the time ſet down by the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſo that his Majeſty and his Houſhold be not hindred from that Form of God's
Service which they formerly have: And alſo that a free Conſultation and Debate be
had with the Divines at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> (Twenty of his Majeſties Nomination being
added unto them) whereby it may be determined by his Majeſty and the Two
Houſes how the Church ſhall be governed after the ſaid Three years, or ſooner, if
Differences may be agreed. Touching the Covenant, his Majeſty is not yet therein
ſatisfied, and deſires to reſpite his particular Anſwer thereunto until his coming to
<hi>London;</hi> becauſe it being a matter of Conſcience, he cannot give a Reſolution there
in till he may be aſſiſted with the Advice of ſome of his own Chaplains (which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been denied him) and ſuch other Divines as ſhall be moſt proper to inform him
therein: and then he will make clearly appear both his Zeal to the Proteſtant Profeſſion,
and the Union of theſe two Kingdoms, which he conceives to be the main drift of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>To the Seventh and Eighth Propoſitions his Majeſty will conſent.</p>
                     <p>To the Ninth his Majeſty doubts not but to give good ſatisfaction, when he
ſhall be particularly informed how the ſaid Penalties ſhall be levied and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of.</p>
                     <p>To the Tenth his Majeſties Anſwer is, That he hath been always ready to prevent the
practices of Papiſts, and therefore is content to paſs an Act of Parliament for that purpoſe;
and alſo that the Laws againſt them be duly executed.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will give his Conſent to the Act for the due Obſervation of the Lord's day,
for the ſuppreſſing of Innovations, and thoſe concerning the preaching of God's Word, and
touching Non-reſidence and Pluralities: and his Majeſty will yield to ſuch Act or Acts as ſhall
be requiſite to raiſe moneys for the payment and ſatisfying all publick Debts, expecting alſo
that his will be therein included.</p>
                     <p>As to the Propoſition touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> though his Majeſty cannot conſent unto it <hi>in
terminis</hi> as it is propoſed, becauſe thereby he conceives he wholly parts with the power of
the Sword entruſted to him by God and the Laws of the Land, for the Protection and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his People, thereby at once deveſting himſelf and diſ inheriting his Poſterity
of that Right and Prerogative of the Crown which is abſolutely neceſſary to the Kingly
Office, and ſo weaken Monarchy in this Kingdom, that little more than the Name and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it will remain; yet if it be onely ſecurity for the preſervation of the Peace of this
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:60710:300"/>
Kingdom after the unhappy Troubles, and the due performance of all the Agreements
which are now to be concluded, which is deſired, (which his Majeſty always underſtood
to be the caſe, and hopes that herein he is not miſtaken) his Majeſty will give abundant
ſatisfaction: To which end he is willing by Act of Parliament, That the whole power of
the <hi>Militia</hi> both by Sea and Land for the ſpace of Ten years be in the hands of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as the Two Houſes ſhall nominate, giving them power during the ſaid Term to
change the ſaid Perſons, and ſubſtitute others in their places at pleaſure; and afterwards to
return to the proper Chanel again, as it it was in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King
<hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory.</p>
                     <p>And now his Majeſty conjures his two Houſes of Parliament, as they are <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men
and lovers of Peace, by the Duty they owe to his Majeſty their King, and by the bowels of
Compaſſion they have to their fellow-Subjects, that they will accept of this his Majeſties
Offer, whereby the joyful News of Peace may be reſtored to this languiſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will grant the like to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if it be deſired; and agree
to all things that are propounded touching the conſerving of Peace betwixt the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Ireland</hi> (other things being agreed) His Majeſty will give Satisfaction
therein.</p>
                     <p>As to the mutual Declarations propoſed to be eſtabliſhed in both Kingdoms by Act of
Parliament, and the Modifications, Qualifications and Branches which follow in the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
his Majeſty onely profeſſes, that He doth not ſufficiently underſtand, nor is able to
reconcile many things contained in them: but this He well knoweth, that a general Act of
Oblivion is the beſt bond of Peace; and that after Inteſtine Troubles, the Wiſdom of this
and other Kingdoms hath uſually and happily in all Ages granted general Pardons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the numerous diſcontentments of many Perſons and Families, otherwiſe expoſed to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
might not become fewel to new Diſorders, or ſeeds to future Troubles. His Majeſty
therefore deſires that His two Houſes of Parliament would ſeriouſly deſcend into theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and likewiſe tenderly look upon His condition herein, and the perpetual diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that muſt cleave to Him, if He ſhall thus abandon ſo many Perſons of Condition and
Fortune that have engaged themſelves with and for him out of a ſenſe of Duty; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
as a very acceptable teſtimony of their Affection to him, That a general Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
and free Pardon be forthwith paſſed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Touching the new Great Seal, His Majeſty is very willing to confirm both it and all the
Acts done by virtue thereof until this preſent time, ſo that it be not thereby preſſed to make
void thoſe Acts of His done by virtue of his Great Seal, which in Honour and Juſtice He is
obliged to maintain; and that the future Government thereof may be in His Majeſty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the due courſe of Law.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Officers mentioned in the 19. Article, His Majeſty when He ſhall come to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> will gratifie His Parliament all that poſſibly He may, without deſtroying the
alterations which are neceſſary for the Crown.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will willingly conſent to the Act for the confirmation of the Priviledges and
Cuſtoms of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all that is mentioned in the Propoſitions for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
advantage.</p>
                     <p>And now that His Majeſty hath thus far endeavoured to comply with the deſires of His
two Houſes of Parliament, to the end that this Agreement may be firm and laſting, without
the leaſt face or queſtion of reſtraint to blemiſh the ſame, His Majeſty earneſtly deſires pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to be admitted to His Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with that Honour which is due to their
Sovereign, there ſolemnly to confirm the ſame, and legally to paſs the Acts before mentioned,
and to give and receive as well ſatisfaction in all the remaining particulars, as likewiſe ſuch
other pledges of mutual Love, Truſt and Confidence, as ſhall moſt concern the good of Him
and His People: Upon which happy Agreement His Majeſty will diſpatch His Directions to
the Prince His Son to return immediately to Him, and will undertake for his ready Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereunto.</p>

1. That Parliaments may <hi>Biennially</hi> be called, and meet at a certain day, with ſuch
proviſion for the certainty thereof as in the late Act was made for <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliaments,
and what further other proviſion ſhall be found needful by the Parliament to reduce it to
more certainty: And upon the paſſing of this, the ſaid Act for <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliaments to

Rule of equality or proportion, ſo as all Counties may have a number of Parliament-Members
allowed to their choice proportionable to the reſpective Rates they bear in
the common Charges and burthens of the Kingdom, according to ſome other Rule of
equality or proportion, to render the Houſe of Commons (as near as may be) an equal
<hi>Repreſentative</hi> of the whole; and in order thereunto, that a preſent conſideration be had
to take off the Elections of Burgeſſes for poor, decayed, or inconſiderable Towns, and

and Conſent.</p>
                     <p>10. That the Right and Liberty of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> may be cleared
and vindicated as to a due Exemption from any Judgment, Trial, or other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
againſt them by the Houſe of Peers, without the concurring Judgment of
the Houſe of Commons: as alſo from any other Judgment, Sentence, or Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any to be added to the Commiſſion, and at the Summer-Aſſize to preſent the Names
of Three Perſons, out of whom the King may prick one to be Sheriff for the next
year.</p>

many of the King's Party (out of their deſires to avoid further Miſery to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
have contributed their endeavours to prevent, (as for divers of them we have had
particular Aſſurance;) we do therefore deſire that ſuch of the King's Party who ſhall appear
to have expreſſed, and ſhall hereafter expreſs, that way their good Affections to the Peace
and Welfare of the Kingdom, and to hinder the imbroiling of the ſame in a new War, may
be freed and exempted from Compoſitions, or to pay but one years Revenue, or a twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
part.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Particulars aforegoing are the Heads of ſuch Propoſals as we have agreed on, to
tend in order to the ſettling of the Peace of this Kingdom, leaving the Terms of Peace for
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſtand as in the late Propoſitions of both Kingdoms, until that
Kingdom ſhall agree to any alteration.</p>
                     <p>Next to the Propoſals aforeſaid for the preſent ſettling of a Peace, we ſhall deſire that no
time may be loſt by the Parliament for diſpatch of other things tending to the welfare, eaſe
and juſt ſatisfaction of the Kingdom; and in ſpecial manner,</p>
                     <p>I. That the juſt and neceſſary Liberty of the People, to repreſent their Grievances and
Deſires by way of Petition, may be cleared and vindicated, according to the fifth Head in
the late Repreſentation or Declaration of the Army ſent from St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">[Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Jun.</hi> 14. 1647.]</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. That (in purſuance of the ſame Head of the ſaid Declaration) the common Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the People may be ſpeedily conſidered of and effectually redreſſed; and in
particular,</p>
                     <p>1. That the Exciſe may be taken off from ſuch Commodities whereon the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Land do ordinarily live; and a certain time to be limited for taking off the
whole.</p>
                     <p>2. That the Oppreſſions and Incroachments of Foreſt Laws may be prevented for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>3. All Monopolies (old or new) and Reſtraints to the freedom of Trade to be taken
off.</p>
                     <p>4. That a courſe may be taken, and Commiſſioners appointed to remedy and rectifie
the inequality of Rates lying upon ſeveral Counties, and ſeveral parts of each County, in
reſpect of others, and to ſettle the proportions for Land rates to more equality through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom; in order to which we ſhall offer ſome further particulars, which we
hope may be uſeful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="583" facs="tcp:60710:304"/>
5. The preſent unequal, troubleſome and contentious way of Miniſters maintenance
by Tithes to be conſidered of, and ſome Remedy applied.</p>
                     <p>6. That the Rules and Courſe of Law and the Officers of it may be ſo reduced and
reformed, as that all Suits and Queſtions of Right may be more clear and certain in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues,
and not ſo tedious or chargeable in the proceedings as now; in order to which we
ſhall offer ſome further particulars hereafter.</p>
                     <p>7. That Priſoners for Debt or other * Creditors (who have Eſtates to diſcharge them)
may not by embracing Impriſonment or any other ways have advantage to defraud their
Creditors, but that the Eſtates of all men may be ſome way made liable to their Debts
(as well as Tradeſmen are by Commiſſions of Bankrupt) whether they be impriſoned for
it or not: and that ſuch Priſoners for Debt who have not wherewith to pay, or at leaſt
do yield up what they have to their Creditors, may be freed from Impriſonment, or
ſome way provided for, ſo as neither they nor their Families may periſh by their Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments.</p>
                     <p>8. Some proviſion to be made, that none may be compelled by Penalties or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to anſwer unto Queſtions tending to the accuſing of themſelves or their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Relations in Criminal Cauſes; and no man's life to be taken away under two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
                     <p>9. That conſideration may be had of all Statutes, and the Laws or Cuſtoms of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
impoſing any Oaths, either to repeal, or elſe to qualifie and provide againſt the
ſame ſo far as they may extend or be conſtrued to the moleſtation or enſnaring of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and peaceable people, meerly for non-conformity in Religion.</p>
                     <p>III. That, according to the ſixth Head in the Declaration of the Army, the large powers
given to Committees or Deputy-Lieutenants during the late times of War and Diſtraction
may be ſpeedily taken into conſideration, to be re-called and made void; and that ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of that nature as ſhall appear neceſſary to be continued, may be put into a regulated
way, and left to as little Arbitrarineſs as the nature and neceſſity of the things (wherein they
are converſant) will bear.</p>
                     <p>IV. That (according to the ſeventh Head in the ſaid Declaration) an effectual courſe may
be taken, that the Kingdom may be righted and ſatisfied in point of Accounts for the vaſt
ſums that have been levied.</p>
                     <p>V. That proviſion may be made for payment of Arrears to the Army, and the reſt
of the Soldiers of the Kingdom who have concurred with the Army in the late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and Proceedings thereof: and in the next place, for payment of the Publick Debts
and Damages of the Kingdom; and that to be performed firſt to ſuch perſons whoſe
Debts or Damages (upon the Publick Account) are great, and their Eſtates ſmall,
ſo as they are thereby reduced to a difficulty of ſubſiſtence. In order to all which,
and to the fourth particular laſt preceding, we ſhall ſpeedily offer ſome farther parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
(in the nature of Rules) which we hope will be of good uſe towards publick ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>

                     <p>HIS Majeſty cannot chuſe but be paſſionately ſenſible (as he believes all his good
Subjects are) of the late great Diſtractions, and ſtill languiſhing and unſetled State,
of this Kingdom; and he calls God to Witneſs, and is willing to give teſtimony
to all the World of his readineſs to contribute his utmoſt Endeavours for reſtoring it to a
happy and flouriſhing Condition.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having peruſed the Propoſitions now brought to him, finds them the ſame
in effect which were offered to him at <hi>Newcastle:</hi> To ſome of which as he could not then
conſent without violation of his Conſcience and Honour; ſo neither can he agree to others
now, conceiving them in many reſpects more diſagreeable to the preſent condition of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
then when they were formerly preſented unto him, as being deſtructive to the main
principal Intereſts of the Army, and of all thoſe whoſe Affections concur with them. And
his Majeſty having ſeen the Propoſals of the Army to the Commiſſioners from his two
Houſes reſiding with them, and with them to be Treated on, in order to the clearing and
ſecuring the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and the ſetling of a juſt and laſting
Peace; to which Propoſals as he conceives his two Houſes not to be ſtrangers, ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
they will think, with him, that they much more conduce to the ſatisfaction of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and may be a fitter foundation for a laſting Peace than the Propoſitions which at this
time are tendered unto him: He therefore propounds (as the beſt way in his Judgment
in order to a Peace) that his two Houſes would inſtantly take into conſideration thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
upon which there may be a Perſonal Treaty with his Majeſty, and upon ſuch other
Propoſitions as his Majeſty ſhall make; hoping that the ſaid Propoſals may be ſo moderated
in the ſaid Treaty, as to render them the more capable of his Majeſties full Conceſſion;
wherein he reſolves to give full ſatisfaction unto his People for whatſoever ſhall concern the
ſetling of the Proteſtant Profeſſion, with Liberty to tender Conſciences, and the ſecuring
of the Laws, Liberties and Properties of all his Subjects, and the juſt Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the future. And likewiſe, by his preſent deportment in this Treaty, he will make
the World clearly judge of his Intentions in matter of future Government. In which
Treaty his, Majeſty will be well pleaſed (if it be thought fit) that Commiſſioners from the
Army (whoſe the Propoſals are) may likewiſe be admitted.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty therefore conjures his two Houſes of Parliament, by the Duty they owe to
God and his Majeſty their King, and by the bowels of Compaſſion they have to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects,
both for the relief of their preſent Sufferings and to prevent future Miſeries,
that they will forthwith accept of this his Majeſties Offer, whereby the joyful news of
Peace may be reſtored to this diſtreſſed Kingdom. And for what concerns the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> mentioned in the Propoſitions, His Majeſty will very willingly Treat upon thoſe
particulars with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners; and doubts not but to give reaſonable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>LIberty being that which in all Times hath been, but eſpecially now is, the common
Theme and Deſire of all men; common Reaſon ſhews, That <hi>Kings</hi> leſs then any
ſhould endure <hi>Captivity.</hi> And yet I call God and the World to Witneſs, with what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
I have endured a tedious Reſtraint; which, ſo long as I had any hopes that this ſort of
My Suffering might conduce to the Peace of My Kingdoms, or the hindring of more effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Blood, I did willingly undergoe: But now finding by two certain proofs, that this My
continued Patience would not only turn to My Perſonal Ruine, but likewiſe be of much more
prejudice then furtherance to the Publick Good, I thought I was bound, as well by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as Political Obligations, to ſeek my Safety, by Retiring My ſelf for ſome time from the
publick View both of My Friends and Enemies. And I appeal to all indifferent men to
judge, if I have not juſt cauſe to free My ſelf from the hands of thoſe who change their
Principles with their Condition, and who are not aſhamed openly to intend the Deſtruction
of the Nobility by taking away their Negative Voice, and with whom the Levellers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is rather countenanced then puniſhed: and as for their intentions to My Perſon, their
changing and putting more ſtrict Guards upon Me, with the diſcharging moſt of all thoſe
Servants of Mine who formerly they willingly admitetd to wait upon Me, does ſufficiently
declare. Nor would I have this My Retirement miſinterpreted; for I ſhall earneſtly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
endeavour the ſetling of a ſafe and well-grounded Peace where-ever I am or ſhall
be, and that (as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſtian Blood: for which
how many times have I deſired, preſt to be heard, and yet no ear given to Me? and can any
Reaſonable man think that (according to the ordinary courſe of affairs) there can be a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Peace without it; or that God will bleſs thoſe who refuſe to hear their own King? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no. Nay, I muſt further add, that (beſides what concerns My ſelf) unleſs all other chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
have not only a hearing, but likewiſe juſt ſatisfaction given unto them, (to wit, the
Presbyterians, Independants, Army, thoſe who have adhered to Me, and even the <hi>Scots</hi>) I ſay
there cannot (I ſpeak not of Miracles, it being, in My Opinion, a ſinful preſumption in ſuch
caſes to expect or truſt to them) be a ſafe or laſting Peace. Now, as I cannot deny but My
Perſonal Security is the urgent cauſe of this My Retirement; ſo I take God to witneſs,
that the Publick Peace is no leſs before My Eyes: and I can find no better way to expreſs
this My Profeſſion, (I know not what a wiſer man may do) then by deſiring and urging
that all chief Intereſts may be heard, to the end each may have juſt Satisfaction. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the Army, (for the reſt, though neceſſary, yet, I ſuppoſe, are not difficult to content)
ought (in My Judgment) to enjoy the Liberty of their Conſciences, have an Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Indemnity, (which ſhould extend to all the reſt of My Subjects) and that all their
Arrears ſhould be ſpeedily and duly paid; which I will undertake to do, ſo I may be heard,
and that I be not hindred from uſing ſuch Lawful and honeſt means as I ſhall chuſe. To
conclude, let Me be heard with Freedom, Honour and Safety, and I ſhall inſtantly break
through this Cloud of Retirement, and ſhew My ſelf really to be <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>

theſe languiſhing and diſtreſſed Kingdoms) at this time to offer ſuch grounds to his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for that effect, which upon due examination of all Intereſts may beſt conduce thereunto.
And becauſe Religion is the beſt and chiefeſt foundation of Peace, His Majeſty will begin
with that particular.</p>
                     <p>That for the aboliſhing Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. His Majeſty cleary profeſſeth that he
cannot give his conſent thereunto, both in relation as he is a Chriſtian, and a King. For the
firſt, he avows that he is ſatisfied in his Judgment, that this Order was placed in the Church
by the Apoſtles themſelves, and ever ſince their time hath continued in all Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
throughout the World until this laſt Century of years; and in this Church, in all times
of Change and Reformation, it hath been upheld by the Wiſdom of his Anceſtors, as the
great preſerver of Doctrine, Diſcipline and Order in the Service of God. As a King, at his
Coronation he hath not only taken a ſolemn Oath to maintain this Order, but his Majeſty
and his Predeceſſors in their confirmations of the Great Charter have inſeparably woven
the Right of the Church into the Liberties of the reſt of their Subjects. And yet he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it be provided, that the particular Biſhops perform the ſeveral Duties of their Callings,
both by their perſonal Reſidence and frequent Preachings in their Dioceſes, as alſo that they
exerciſe no Act of Juriſdiction or Ordination without the conſent of their Presbyters; and
will conſent that their Powers in all things be ſo limited that they be not grievous to tender
Conſciences. Wherefore ſince his Majeſty is willing to give eaſe to the Conſciences of others,
he ſees no reaſon why he alone and thoſe of his Judgment ſhould be preſſed to a violation of
theirs. Nor can his Majeſty conſent to the Alienation of Church-Lands, becauſe it cannot
be denied to be a ſin of the higheſt Sacriledge; as alſo that it ſubverts the intentions of ſo
many pious Donors, who have laid a heavy Curſe upon all ſuch profane violations, which
his Majeſty is very unwilling to undergoe: and beſides the matter of Conſcience, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
believes it to be a prejudice to the Publick good, many of his Subjects having the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of renewing Leaſes at much eaſier Rates then if thoſe Poſſeſſions were in the hands
of private men: not omitting the diſcouragement which it will be to all Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
when ſuch eminent rewards ſhall be taken away which now lye open to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of meaneſt Perſons. Yet his Majeſty conſidering the great preſent Diſtempers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Church-Diſcipline, and that the Presbyterian Government is now in practice, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
to eſchew Confuſion as much as may be, and for the ſatisfaction of his two Houſes, is
content that the ſaid Government be legally permitted to ſtand in the ſame condition it now
is for three years: provided that his Majeſty and thoſe of his Judgment (or any other who
cannot in Conſcience ſubmit thereunto) be not obliged to comply with Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but have free practice of their own Profeſſion without receiving any prejudice
thereby; and that a free Conſultation and debate be had with the Divines at <hi>Westminster</hi>
(twenty of his Majeſties nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his Majeſty and the two Houſes how the Church-Government after the ſaid time
ſhall be ſettled, (or ſooner, if Differences may be agreed) as is moſt agreeable to the Word
of God, with full Liberty to all thoſe who ſhall differ upon conſcientious grounds from that
ſettlement: always provided, that nothing aforeſaid be underſtood to tolerate thoſe of the
Popiſh Profeſſion, nor the exempting of any Popiſh Recuſant from the penalties of the Laws,
or to tolerate the publick profeſſion of Atheiſm or Blaſphemy, contrary to the Doctrine
of the Apoſtles, <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds, they having been received by and had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of all the Chriſtian Churches, and more particularly by this of <hi>England</hi> ever ſince
the Reformation.</p>
                     <p>Next, the <hi>Militia</hi> being that Right which is inſeparably and undoubtedly inherent in the
Crown by the Laws of this Nation, and that which former Parliaments, as likewiſe this,
hath acknowledged ſo to be; his Majeſty cannot ſo much wrong that Truſt which the
Laws of God and this Land hath annexed to the Crown for the Protection and Security of
his People, as to deveſt himſelf and Succeſſors of the power of the Sword: yet to give an
infallible evidence of his deſire to ſecure the performance of ſuch Agreements as ſhall be
made in order to a Peace, his Majeſty will conſent to an Act of Parliament, that the whole
Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> both by Sea and Land, for and during his whole Reign, ſhall be ordered
and diſpoſed by his two Houſes of Parliament, or by ſuch perſons as they ſhall appoint with
Powers limited for ſuppreſſing of Forces within this Kingdom to the diſturbance of the
publick Peace, and againſt foreign Invaſion; and that they ſhall have Power, during his ſaid
Reign, to raiſe moneys for the purpoſes aforeſaid, and that neither his Majeſty that now is, or
any other (by any Authority derived only from him,) ſhall execute any of the ſaid Powers
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:60710:307"/>
during his Majeſties ſaid Reign, but ſuch as ſhall act by the conſent and approbation of the
two Houſes of Parliament. Nevertheleſs his Majeſty intends that all Patents, Commiſſions,
and other Acts concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> be made and acted as formerly; and that after his
Majeſties Reign, all the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhall return intirely to the Crown, as it was in
the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory.</p>
                     <p>After this Head of the <hi>Militia,</hi> the conſideration of the Arrears due to the Army is not
improper to follow; for the payment whereof, and the eaſe of his People, his Majeſty is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to concur in any thing that can be done without the Violation of his Conſcience and
Honour. Wherefore if his two Houſes ſhall conſent to remit unto him ſuch benefit out of
Sequeſtrations from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, and out of Compoſitions that ſhall be made before the
concluding of the Peace, and the Arrears of ſuch as have been already made, the aſſiſtance
of the Clergy, and the Arrears of ſuch Rents of his own Revenues as his two Houſes ſhall not
have received before the concluding of the Peace, his Majeſty will undertake within the ſpace
of eighteen Months the payment of four hundred thouſand pounds for the ſatisfaction of the
Army; and if thoſe means ſhall not be ſufficient, his Majeſty intends to give way to the ſale
of Foreſt Lands for that purpoſe, this being the Publick Debt which in his Majeſties
Judgment is firſt to be ſatisfied: and for other publick Debts already contracted upon
Church-Lands or any other Ingagements, his Majeſty will give his conſent to ſuch Act or
Acts for raiſing of moneys for payment thereof as both Houſes ſhall hereafter agree upon,
ſo as they be equally laid, whereby his People (already too heavily burthened by theſe
late Diſtempers) may have no more Preſſures upon them than this abſolute neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                     <p>And for the further ſecuring of all Fears, his Majeſty will conſent, that an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be paſſed for the diſpoſing of the great Offices of State, and naming of Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
for the whole term of his Reign, by the two Houſes of Parliament, their Patents and
Commiſſions being taken from his Majeſty, and after to return to the Crown, as is expreſt
in the Article of the <hi>Militia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Court of Wards and Liveries, his Majeſty very well knows the conſequence of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that way, by turning of all Tenures into common Soccage, as well in point of Revenue
to the Crown, as in the Protection of many of his Subjects being Infants: nevertheleſs, if
the continuance thereof ſeem grievous to his Subjects, rather then he will fail on his part in
giving ſatisfaction, he will conſent to an Act for taking of it away, ſo as a full recompence be
ſettled upon his Majeſty and his Succeſſors in perpetuity, and that the Arrears now due be
reſerved unto him towards the payment of the Arrears of the Army.</p>
                     <p>And that the memory of theſe late Diſtractions may be wholly wiped away, his Majeſty
will conſent to an Act of Parliament for the ſuppreſſing and making null of all Oaths, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
and Proclamations againſt both or either Houſe of Parliament, and of all Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and other proceedings againſt any perſons for adhering unto them; and his Majeſty
propoſeth, (as the beſt Expediment to take away all ſeeds of future Differences) that there
be an Act of Oblivion to extend to all his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Ceſſation there is long ſince determined; but for the future (all other
things being fully agreed) his Majeſty will give full ſatisfaction to his Houſes concerning that
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And although his Majeſty cannot conſent in Honour and Juſtice to avoid all his own
Grants and Acts paſt under his Great Seal ſince the two and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> 1642. or to
the confirming of all the Acts and Grants paſſed under that made by the two Houſes; yet his
Majeſty is confident, that, upon peruſal of particulars, he ſhall give full ſatisfaction to his two
Houſes to what may be reaſonably deſired in that particular.</p>
                     <p>And now his Majeſty conceives that by theſe his Offers (which he is ready to make good
upon the ſettlement of a Peace) he hath clearly manifeſted his intentions to give full ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ſatisfaction to all Intereſts, for what can juſtly be deſired in order to the future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of his People. And for the perfecting of theſe Conceſſions, as alſo for ſuch other things
as may be propoſed by the two Houſes, and for ſuch juſt and reaſonable demands as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhall find neceſſary to propoſe on his part, he earneſtly deſires a Perſonal Treaty at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
with his two Houſes, in Honour, Freedom and Safety, it being, in his Judgment, the moſt
proper, and indeed only, means to a firm and ſettled Peace, and impoſſible without it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
former, or to avoid future miſunderſtandings.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things being by Treaty perfected, his Majeſty believes his two Houſes will think
it reaſonable that the Propoſals of the Army, concerning the Succeſſion of Parliaments and
their due Elections, ſhould be taken into conſideration.</p>
                     <p>As for what concerns the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Majeſty will very readily apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to give all reaſonable ſatisfaction, when the Deſires of the two Houſes of Parliament on
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:60710:307"/>
their behalf, or of the Commiſſioners of that Kingdom, or of both joyned together, ſhall
be made known unto him.</p>

that He could not with Safety continue longer there: That if He could have been there with
Safety, He would not have departed thence, nor from the Army: And that He choſe this
place rather than any other (when He was at liberty to have gone whither He pleaſed) that
He might ſtill continue under the protection of the Army (Colonel <hi>Hammond</hi> being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

to come to the place where He now is, for the ends aforeſaid, and for their endeavouring

                     <p>HAD His Majeſty thought it poſſible that His two Houſes could be imployed in things
of greater concernment than the Peace of this miſerable diſtracted Kingdom, He
would have expected with more patience their leiſure in acknowledging the receit of
His Meſſage of the 16. of <hi>November</hi> laſt: But ſince there is not in nature any conſideration
preceding to that of Peace, His Majeſties conſtant tenderneſs of the welfare of His Subjects
hath ſuch a prevalence with Him, that He cannot forbear the vehement proſecution of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Treaty; which is only ſo much the more deſired by His Majeſty, as it is ſuperior to all
other means of Peace. And truly, when His Majeſty conſiders the ſeveral complaints He
daily hears from all parts of this Kingdom, that Trade is ſo decayed, all Commodities ſo dear,
and Taxes ſo inſupportable, that even natural ſubſiſtence will ſuddenly fail; His Majeſty (to
perform the Truſt repoſed in Him) muſt uſe His uttermoſt endeavours for Peace, though He
were to have no ſhare in the benefit of it. And hath not His Majeſty done His part for it,
by deveſting Himſelf of ſo much Power and Authority as by His laſt Meſſage He hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to do upon the concluding of the whole Peace? And hath He met with that Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment

as He will meet you, He no way doubts but that ye will willingly agree to this His Majeſties
earneſt deſire of a Perſonal Treaty, and ſpeedily deſire His preſence amongſt you: where all
things agreed on being digeſted into Acts (till when it is moſt unreaſonable for His Majeſty

                     <p>THE neceſſity of complying with all engaged Intereſts in theſe great Diſtempers, for
a perfect ſettlement of Peace, His Majeſty finds to be none of the leaſt Difficulties He
hath met with ſince the time of His Afflictions. Which is too viſible, when at the ſame time
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:60710:310"/>
that the two Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament do preſent to his Majeſty ſeveral Bills and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
for his Conſent, the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do openly proteſt againſt them. So
that were there nothing in the caſe but the conſideration of that difference, his Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine how to give ſuch an Anſwer to what is now propoſed, as thereby to promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
his great End, <hi>A Perfect Peace.</hi> And when his Majeſty farther conſiders how impoſſible
it is (in the condition he now ſtands) to fulfil the deſires of his two Houſes, ſince the only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and known ways of paſſing Laws are either by his Majeſties Perſonal Aſſent in the
Houſe of Peers, or by Commiſſion under his Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> he cannot but wonder
at ſuch failings in the manner of Addreſs which is now made unto him: unleſs his two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
intend that his Majeſty ſhall allow of a Great Seal made without his Authority, before
there be any conſideration had thereupon in a Treaty; which as it may hereafter hazard the
Security it ſelf, ſo for the preſent it ſeems very unreaſonable to his Majeſty. And though his
Majeſty is willing to believe that the intention of very many in both Houſes, in ſending theſe
Bills before a Treaty, was only to obtain a Truſt from him, and not to take any advantage
by paſſing them, to force other things from him which are either againſt his Conſcience or
Honour: yet his Majeſty believes it clear to all underſtandings, that theſe Bills contain (as
they are now penned) not only the deveſting himſelf of all Sovereignty, and that without
poſſibility of recovering it either to him or his Succeſſors, (except by repeal of thoſe Bills)
but alſo the making his Conceſſions guilty of the greateſt preſſures that can be made upon
the Subject, as in other particulars, ſo by giving an Arbitrary and unlimited Power to the two
Houſes for ever, to raiſe and levy Forces for Land or Sea-ſervice, of what perſons (without
diſtinction or quality) and to what numbers they pleaſe; and likewiſe, for the payment of
them, to levy what moneys, in ſuch ſort and by ſuch ways and means (and conſequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Eſtates of whatſoever perſons) as they ſhall think fit and appoint; which is utterly
inconſiſtent with the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and his Majeſties Truſt in prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them. So that if the major part of both Houſes ſhall think it neceſſary to put the reſt
of the Propoſitions into Bills, his Majeſty leaves all the world to judge how unſafe it would
be for him to conſent thereunto: and if not, what a ſtrange condition (after the paſſing of
theſe Four Bills) his Majeſty and all his Subjects would be caſt into. And here his Majeſty
thinks it not unfit, to wiſh his two Houſes to conſider well the manner of their proceeding;
That when his Majeſty deſires a Perſonal Treaty with them for the ſettling of a Peace, they
in Anſwer propoſe the very ſubject matter of the moſt eſſential part thereof to be firſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
a thing which will be hardly credible to Poſterity. Wherefore his Majeſty declares, That
neither the deſire of being freed from this tedious and irkſome condition of life his Majeſty
hath ſo long ſuffered, nor the apprehenſion of what may befall him in caſe his two Houſes
ſhall not afford him a Perſonal Treaty, ſhall make him change his Reſolution, of not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any Act till the whole Peace be concluded. Yet then he intends not only to give juſt
and reaſonable ſatisfaction in the particulars preſented to him, but alſo to make good all other
Conceſſions mentioned in his Meſſage of the 16. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> laſt, which he thought would
have produced better effects than what he finds in the Bills and Propoſitions now preſented
unto him.</p>
                     <p>And yet his Majeſty cannot give over, but now again earneſtly preſſeth for a Perſonal
Treaty, (ſo paſſionately is he affected with the advantages which Peace will bring to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and all his Subjects;) of which he will not at all deſpair, (there being no other viſible
way to obtain a well-grounded Peace.) However his Majeſty is very much at eaſe within
himſelf, for having fulfilled the Offices both of a Chriſtian and of a King; and will patiently
wait the good pleaſure of Almighty God, to incline the hearts of his two Houſes to conſider
their King, and to compaſſionate their fellow-Subjects miſeries.</p>

                        <head>To all My People, of whatſoever Nation, Quality or Condition.</head>
                        <p>AM I thus laid aſide? and muſt I not ſpeak for my ſelf? No; I will ſpeak, and that to all
my People, (which I would have rather done by the way of my two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that there is a publick Order, neither to make Addreſſes to, or receive Meſſage from
me.) And who but you can be judge of the Differences betwixt me and my two Houſes? I
know none elſe; for I am ſure you it is who will enjoy the happineſs, or feel the miſery of good
or ill Government: and we all pretend who ſhall run faſteſt to ſerve you, without having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
(at leaſt in the firſt place) to particular Intereſts. And therefore I deſire you to conſider
the ſtate I am and have been in this long time, and whether my actions have more tended to
the Publick or my own Particular good. For whoſoever will look upon upon me barely as
I am a Man, without that Liberty (which the meaneſt of my Subjects enjoys) of going
whither and converſing with whom I will; as a Huſband and Father, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of my Wife and Children; or laſtly, as a King, without the leaſt ſhew of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Power to protect my diſtreſſed Subjects; muſt conclude me not onely void of
all Natural Affection, but alſo to want common Underſtanding, if I ſhould not moſt
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:60710:311"/>
chearfully embrace the readieſt way to the ſettlement of theſe diſtracted Kingdoms. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
on the other ſide, do but conſider the Form and draught of the Bills lately preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Me; and as they are the Conditions of a Treaty, ye will conclude, that the ſame ſpirit
which hath ſtill been able to fruſtrate all My ſincere and conſtant endeavours for Peace, hath
had a powerful influence on this Meſſage: for though I was ready to grant the Subſtance, and
comply with what they ſeem to deſire; yet as they had framed it I could not agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
without deeply wounding my Conſcience and Honour, and betraying the Truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in me, by abandoning my People to the Arbitrary and unlimited power of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for ever, for the levying and maintaining of Land or Sea-Forces, without diſtinction of
Quality, or limitation for Money-Taxes. And if I could have paſſed them in terms, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of a Condition were it for a Treaty to grant beforehand the moſt conſiderable part
of the ſubject matter? How ineffectual were that Debate like to prove, wherein the moſt
potent party had nothing of moment left to ask, and the other nothing more to give? ſo
conſequently, how hopeleſs of mutual compliance? without which a Settlement is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Beſides, if after my Conceſſions the two Houſes ſhould inſiſt on thoſe things from which
I cannot depart, how deſperate would the Condition of theſe Kingdoms be, when the moſt
proper and approved Remedy ſhould become ineffectual? Being therefore fully reſolved that
I could neither in Conſcience, Honour or Prudence, paſs thoſe Four Bills, I only endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make the Reaſons and Juſtice of my Denial appear to all the World, as they do to me,
intending to give as little diſſatisfaction to the two Houſes of Parliament (without betraying
my own Cauſe) as the matter would bear. I was deſirous to give my Anſwer of the 28. of
<hi>December</hi> laſt to the Commiſſioners ſealed, (as I had done others heretofore, and ſometimes
at the deſire of the Commiſſioners) chiefly, becauſe when my Meſſages or Anſwers were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
known before they were read in the Houſes, prejudicial interpretations were forced on
them, much differing, and ſometimes contrary to my meaning. For example, my Anſwer from
<hi>Hampton-Court</hi> was accuſed of dividing the two Nations, becauſe I promiſed to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the <hi>Scots</hi> in all things concerning that Kingdom: and this laſt ſuffers in a contrary
ſenſe, by making me intend to intereſt <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Laws of this Kingdom, (then which
nothing was, nor is, further from my thoughts) becauſe I took notice of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
proteſting againſt the Bills and Propoſitions, as contrary to the Intereſts and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the two Kingdoms. Indeed, if I had not mentioned their diſſent, an Objection,
not without ſome probability, might have been made againſt me, both in reſpect the <hi>Scots</hi>
are much concerned in the Bill for the <hi>Militia</hi> and in ſeveral other Propoſitions, and my ſilence
might with ſome juſtice ſeem to approve of it. But the Commiſſioners refuſing to receive
my Anſwer ſealed, I (upon the engagement of their and the Governour's Honour, that no
other uſe ſhould be made or notice taken of it than as if it had not been ſeen) read and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it open unto them; whereupon what hath ſince paſſed, either by the Governour, in
diſcharging moſt of my Servants, redoubling the Guards, and reſtraining me of my former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
(and all this, as himſelf confeſt, meerly out of his own diſlike of my Anſwer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his beforeſaid Engagement) or afterwards by the two Houſes (as the Governor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms)
in confining me within the circuit of this Caſtle, I appeal to God and the World,
whether my ſaid Anſwer deſerved the Reply of ſuch proceedings; beſides the unlawfulneſs
for Subjects to impriſon their King. That, by the permiſſion of Almighty God, I am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to this ſad condition, as I no way repine, ſo I am not without hope but that the ſame
God will, in due time, convert the Afflictions into my Advantage. In the mean time I am
confident to bear theſe croſſes with Patience and a great equality of Mind: but by what
means or occaſion I am come to this Relapſe in my Affairs, I am utterly to ſeek; eſpecially
when I conſider that I have ſacrificed to my two Houſes of Parliament, for the Peace
of the Kingdom, all but what is much more dear to me than my Life, my <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
deſiring nothing more than to perform it in the moſt proper and natural way, A
<hi>Perſonal Treaty.</hi> But that which makes me moſt at a loſs is, the remembring my ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Compliance with the Army and their Intereſts, and of what importance my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
was to them, and their often-repeated Profeſſions and Engagements for my juſt
Rights in general, at <hi>Newmarket</hi> and <hi>Saint-Albans,</hi> and their particular explanations of
thoſe generals by their Voted and revoted <hi>Propoſals;</hi> which I had reaſon to underſtand
ſhould be the utmoſt extremity would be expected from me, and that in ſome things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I ſhould be eaſed, (herein appealing to the Conſciences of ſome of the chiefeſt Officers in
the Army, if what I have ſaid be not punctually true:) and how I have failed of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
or my profeſſions to them, I challenge them and the whole World to produce the
leaſt colour of Reaſon. And now I would know what it is that is deſired. Is it Peace? I have
ſhewed the way (being both willing and deſirous to perform my part in it) which is, a juſt
Compliance with all chief Intereſts. Is it Plenty and Happineſs? they are the inſeparable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:60710:312"/>
of Peace. Is it Security? I who wiſh that all men would forgive and forget like me,
have offered the <hi>Militia</hi> for my time. Is it Liberty of Conſcience? He who wants it is moſt
ready to give it. Is it the right adminiſtration of Juſtice? Officers of truſt are committed to
the choice of my two Houſes of Parliament. Is it frequent Parliaments? I have legally, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concurr'd therewith. Is it the Arrears of the Army? Upon a Settlement they will certainly
be payed with much eaſe; but before, there will be found much difficulty, if not impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in it.</p>
                        <p>Thus all the World cannot but ſee my real and unwearied endeavours for Peace, the which
(by the Grace of God) I ſhall neither repent me of, nor ever be ſlackned in, notwithſtanding
My paſt, preſent, or future Sufferings: But if I may not be heard, let every one judge who
it is that obſtructs the good I would or might do. What is it that men are afraid to hear from
me? It cannot be Reaſon, (at leaſt none will declare themſelves ſo unreaſonable as to confeſs
it:) and it can leſs be impertinent or unreaſonable Diſcourſes; for thereby, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I might more juſtifie this my Reſtraint than the cauſers themſelves can do: ſo that of
all wonders yet this is the greateſt to me. But it may be eaſily gathered how thoſe men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to govern who have uſed me thus. And if it be my hard Fate to fall together with the
Liberty of this Kingdom, I ſhall not bluſh for my ſelf, but much lament the future Miſeries
of my People; the which I ſhall ſtill pray God to avert, whatever becomes of me.</p>

                     <p>IF the Peace of my Dominions were not much dearer to me than any particular Intereſt
whatſoever; I had too much reaſon to take notice of the ſeveral Votes which paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, and the ſad Condition I have been in now above theſe ſeven Months. But ſince
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:60710:312"/>
you my two Houſes of Parliament have opened (as it ſeems to me) a fair beginning to a
happy Peace, I ſhall heartily apply my ſelf thereunto; and to that end I will, as clearly and
ſhortly as I may, ſet you down thoſe things which I conceive neceſſary to this bleſſed Work,
ſo that we together may remove all impediments that may hinder a happy concluſion of
this Treaty, which with all chearfulneſs I do embrace.</p>
                     <p>And to this wiſhed End your ſelves have laid moſt excellent grounds: For what can I
reaſonably expect more then to Treat with Honour, Freedom and Safety, upon ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
as you have or ſhall preſent unto me, and ſuch as I ſhall make to you? But withal
remember, that it is the definition, not names, of things which make them rightly known; and
that without means to perform, no Propoſitions can take effect. And truly my preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is ſuch, that I can no more Treat then a blind man judge of colours, or one run a race
who hath both his feet faſt tied together. Wherefore my firſt neceſſary Demand is,</p>
                     <p>That you will recal all ſuch Votes and Orders by which people are frighted from coming,
writing, or ſpeaking freely to me.</p>
                     <p>Next, that ſuch men of all Profeſſions, whom I ſhall ſend for as of neceſſary uſe to me
in this Treaty, may be admitted to wait upon me. In a word, that I may be in the ſame ſtate
of Freedom I was in when I was laſt at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And indeed, leſs cannot in any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
meaſure make good thoſe Offers which you have made me by your Votes. For how
can I Treat with Honour, ſo long as people are terrified with Votes and Orders againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak or write to me? and am I honourably treated, ſo long as there is none about
me (except a Barber, who came now with the Commiſſioners) that ever I named to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me? or with Freedom, until I may call ſuch unto me, of whoſe ſervices I ſhall have uſe in
ſo great and difficult a Work? And for Safety, (I ſpeak not of my Perſon, having no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
that way) how can I judge to make a ſafe and well grounded Peace, until I may
know (without diſguiſe) the true preſent ſtate of all my Dominions, and particularly of all
thoſe whoſe Intereſts are neceſſarily concerned in the Peace of theſe Kingdoms? Which
leads me naturally to the laſt neceſſary Demand I ſhall make for the bringing this Treaty to
an happy end, which is,</p>
                     <p>That you alone, or you and I joyntly, do invite the <hi>Scots</hi> to ſend ſome perſons authorized
by them to Treat upon ſuch Propoſitions as they ſhall make: For certainly the publick and
neceſſary Intereſts they have in this great Settlement is ſo clearly plain to all the World, that
I believe no body will deny the neceſſity of their concurrence in this Treaty in order to a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace. Wherefore I will only ſay, that as I am King of both Nations, ſo I will yield to
none in either Kingdom for being truly and zealouſly affected for the good and honour of
both; my Reſolution being never to be partial for either to the prejudice of the other.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Place (becauſe I conceive it to be rather a circumſtantial than real part of
this Treaty, I ſhall not much inſiſt upon it) I name <hi>Newport</hi> in this Iſle: yet the fervent zeal
I have that a ſpeedy end be put to theſe unhappy Diſtractions, doth force me earneſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to conſider what a great loſs of time it will be to Treat ſo far from the body of my
two Houſes, when every ſmall debate (of which doubtleſs there will be many) muſt be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> before it be concluded. And really I think (though to ſome it may
ſeem a Paradox) that peoples minds will be much more apt to ſettle, ſeeing me Treat in or

that I am really ſo free as before this Treaty begin I expect to be. And ſo I leave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
this point to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have not only fully accepted of the Treaty which you have propoſed to me by
your Votes of the third of this Month, but alſo given it all the furtherance that lies in me,
by demanding the neceſſary means for the effectual performance thereof: All which are ſo
neceſſarily implied by, though not particularly mentioned in, your Votes, as I can no ways
doubt of your ready compliance with me herein. I have now no more to ſay, but to conjure
you by all that is dear to Chriſtians, honeſt men, or good Patriots, that ye will make all the
Expedition poſſible to begin this happy Work, by haſtning down your Commiſſioners fully
authorized and well inſtructed, and by enabling me (as I have ſhewed you) to Treat; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the God of Peace ſo to bleſs our endeavours, that all my Dominions may ſpeedily enjoy
a ſafe and well-grounded Peace.</p>

Forty days Treaty the many Diſtractions of theſe Kingdoms can be ſetled; and if ſo,

fit means to begin a Treaty for a Peace, which might put an end to His own ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and the Miſeries of His Kingdom. For an entrance whereunto, His Majeſty

hath already expreſſed His Conſent to the Firſt Propoſition. But finding you are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Inſtructions, which you have no Warrant to communicate unto Him, and having
cauſe by your Paper, of the 20. of this preſent to believe that you have no power to
omit or alter any thing, though He ſhall give you ſuch Reaſons as may ſatisfie you ſo to
do, without tranſmitting the Papers to the two Houſes at a far diſtance, where His
Majeſties Reaſons, Expreſſions and Offers upon Debate cannot be fully repreſented, and
from whence their Anſwers cannot be returned without much waſt of the time allotted for
the Treaty here; and having lately received another Paper concerning the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

Articles of Religion, and other things (eleven or twelve in number) of great
length, and ſome of them very new, and never before preſented to His Majeſty, the
due conſideration whereof will take up much time, and require His Majeſties Preſence
with His two Houſes before a full reſolution can well be had in matters of ſo high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
To the end therefore that the good work now in hand may (by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing)
proceed more ſpeedily and effectually to an happy Concluſion, and that His
two Houſes of Parliament may at preſent have further ſecurity, and an earneſt of future

                     <p>And will by Act of Parliament confirm for Three years the Directory for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worſhip of God in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And will likewiſe confirm for Three years by Act of Parliament the form of Church-Government
which ye have preſented to Him, to be uſed for the Churches of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi> Provided, that His Majeſty, and thoſe of His
Judgement, or any others who cannot in Conſcience ſubmit thereunto, be not in the
mean time obliged to comply with the ſame Government, or form of Worſhip, but have
free practice of their own profeſſion. And that a free Conſultation and debate be had
with the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the mean time, (Twenty of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and His two Houſes of Parliament, how the ſaid Church-Government and form of
Publick Worſhip after the ſaid time may be ſetled, or ſooner, if Differences may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
and how alſo Reformation of Religion may be ſetled within the Kingdoms of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales:</hi> And the Articles of Chriſtian Religion
now delivered to Him, may in like manner be then conſidered of and determined, and
care taken for the eaſe of tender Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the Biſhops Lands and Revenues, His Majeſty conſidering that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe troubleſome times divers of His Subjects have made Contracts and Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and divers have disburſed great Sums of Money upon ſecurity and engagement of
thoſe Lands; His Majeſty for their ſatisfaction will conſent to an Act or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby legal Eſtates for Lives or for Years (at their choice) not exceeding
ninety nine years, ſhall be made of thoſe Lands towards the ſatisfaction of the ſaid Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers,
Contractors, and others to whom they are engaged, at the old Rents, or ſome
other moderate Rent, whereby they may receive ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>And in caſe ſuch Leaſe ſhall not ſatisfie, His Majeſty will propound and conſent to ſome
other way for their further ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Provided, that the Propriety and Inheritance of thoſe Lands may ſtill remain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the Church and Church-men reſpectively, according to the pious intentions
of the Donors and Founders thereof: And the reſt that ſhall be reſerved, to be for their
maintenance.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will give His Royal Aſſent for the better obſervation of the Lords day;
for ſuppreſſing of Innovations in Churches and Chappels in and about the Worſhip of
God; and for the better advancement of the Preaching of God's Holy Word in all parts
of this Kingdom; and to an Act againſt enjoying Pluralities of Benefices by Spiritual
Perſons, and Non-reſidency; and to an Act for Regulating and reforming both Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
and the Colleges of <hi>Westminster, Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Eaton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will conſent to an Act for the better diſcovery and ſpeedy conviction of
Popiſh Recuſants, as is deſired in your Propoſitions; and alſo to an Act for the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Children of Papiſts by Proteſtants in the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                     <p>As alſo to an Act for the rrue levying of the Penalties againſt Papiſts, to be levied
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:60710:315"/>
and diſpoſed in ſuch manner as both Houſes ſhall agree on, and as is propoſed on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties

                     <p>And alſo to an Act to prevent the practiſes of Papiſts againſt the State; and for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Laws in execution; and for a ſtricter courſe to prevent hearing and ſaying of
Maſs.</p>
                     <p>But as to the Covenant, His Majeſty is not yet therein ſatisfied that He can either ſign
or ſwear it, or conſent to impoſe it on the Conſciences of others; nor doth conceive it
proper or uſeful at this time to be inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Militia;</hi> His Majeſty conceives that your Propoſition demands a far
larger power over the Perſons and Eſtates of His Subjects than hath ever hitherto been
warranted by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm: yet conſidering the preſent Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
require more, and truſting in His two Houſes of Parliament, that they will make
no further uſe of the Power therein mentioned, after the preſent Diſtempers ſetled, than
ſhall be agreeable to the Legal exerciſe thereof in times paſt, or juſt neceſſity ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
His Majeſty will conſent to an Act of Parliament,</p>
                     <p>That the Lords and Commons in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> now aſſembled, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

                     <p>That Moneys be raiſed and levied for the maintenance and uſe of the ſaid Forces for

                     <p>And the ſaid Lords and Commons, or ſuch as they ſhall appoint, during the ſaid ſpace
of ten years ſhall have power,</p>
                     <p>1. To ſuppreſs all Forces raiſed, or to be raiſed, without Authority and Conſent of
the ſaid Lords and Commons, to the diſturbance of the Publick Peace of the Kingdoms
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Gerneſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and the

                     <p>And with the ſame Proviſoes for ſaving the ordinary Legal Power of Officers of
Juſtice, not being Military Officers, as is ſet down in your Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>And with a Declaration, That if any perſons ſhall be gathered and aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Warlike manner, or otherwiſe, to the number of thirty perſons, and ſhall not
forthwith diſperſe themſelves, being require thereto by the ſaid Lords and Commons, or

command from them, or any by them eſpecially authorized for that purpoſe; then ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Treaſon, being firſt declared guilty of ſuch offence by the ſaid Lords and Commons; any
Commiſſion under the Great Seal, or any other Warrant to the contrary notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
And he or they that ſhall ſo offend herein, to be uncapable of any Pardon from
His Majeſty, His Heirs or Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe that it be provided that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall have and enjoy all their
Rights, Liberties, &amp;c. in raiſing and imyloying the Forces of that City in ſuch ſort as
is mentioned in the ſaid Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>With theſe Proviſoes following to be inſerted in the ſaid Act.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That none be compelled to ſerve in the Wars againſt their wills, but in caſe
of coming in of ſtrange Enemies into this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And that the Powers above mentioned, as concerning the Land-Forces, other than
for keeping up and maintenance of Forts and Gariſons, and the keeping up, mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and pay of this preſent Army, ſo long as it ſhall be thought fit by both Houſes
of Parliament, be exerciſed to no other purpoſes, than for the ſuppreſſing of Forces
raiſed or to be raiſed without Authority and Conſent of the ſaid Lords and Commons as
aforeſaid, or for ſuppreſſing of any Foreign Forces which ſhall invade or endeavour to
invade the Kingdoms, Dominions, or places aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>And that the Monies be raiſed by general and equal Taxations; ſaving that Tonnage
and Poundage, and ſuch Impoſts as have been applyed to the Navy, be raiſed as hath
been uſual.</p>
                     <p>And that all Patents, Commiſſions, and other Acts concerning the Premiſſes, be
made and acted in His Majeſties Name, by Warrant ſignified by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or ſuch others as they ſhall authoriſe for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall be more ſatisfactory to His two Houſes, to have the <hi>Militia</hi> and Powers
thereupon depending during the whole time of His Majeſties Reign, rather than for the
ſpace of ten years, His Majeſty gives them the Election.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majeſty having in the two preceding Propoſitions given His
Conſent concerning the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Militia</hi> there in all things as in <hi>England,</hi> as to
all other matters relating to that Kingdom, after advice with His two Houſes, He will
leave it to their determination, and give His Conſent accordingly, as is herein here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Touching Publick Debts, His Majeſty will give His Conſent to ſuch an Act for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Monies by general and equal Taxations for the payment and ſatisfying the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears
of the Army, Publick Debts and Engagements of the Kingdom, as ſhall be agreed
on by both Houſes of Parliament, and ſhall be audited and aſcertained by them, or ſuch
perſons as they ſhall appoint, within the ſpace of twelve Months after the paſſing of an
Act for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will Conſent to an Act, that during the ſaid ſpace of ten years, the
Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, or Treaſury, Lord
Warden of the Cinque-Ports, Chancellor of Exchequer and Dutchy, Secretaries of State,
Maſter of the Rolles, and Judges of both Benches, and Barons of the Exchequer of
<hi>England,</hi> be nominated by both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to continue <hi>quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu
ſe bene geſſerint;</hi> and in the intervals of Parliament, by ſuch others as they ſhall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe
for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty will Conſent, That the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
during the ſpace of ten years, may be in the Ordering and Government of the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen and Commons in the Common-Councel aſſembled, or ſuch as they
ſhall from time to time appoint, (whereof the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be three) to be imployed and directed from time to time, during the ſaid ſpace
of ten years, in ſuch manner as ſhall be agreed upon and appointed by both Houſes of
Parliament: And that no Citizen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> nor any of the Officers of the
ſaid City, ſhall be drawn forth or compelled to go out of the ſaid City or Liberties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for Military ſervice, without their own free conſent.</p>
                     <p>That an Act be paſſed for granting and confirming the Charters, Cuſtomes, Liberties
and Franchiſes of the City of <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding any <hi>Nonuſer, Miſuſer,</hi> or <hi>Abuſer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="606" facs="tcp:60710:316"/>
And that during the ſaid ten years the Tower of <hi>London</hi> may be in the Government
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Chief Officer and Governor from time to time during
the ſaid ſpace to be nominated and removable by the Common-Council, as are deſired
in your Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having thus far expreſſed His Conſent for the preſent ſatisfaction and
ſecurity of His two Houſes of Parliament and thoſe that have adhered unto them, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
your four firſt Propoſitions, and other the particulars before ſpecified; as to all
the reſt of your Propoſitions delivered to Him at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, (not referring to thoſe
Heads) and to that of the Court of Wards ſince delivered, as alſo to the remaining
Propoſitions concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majeſty deſires only, when He ſhall come to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
Perſonally to adviſe with His two Houſes, and to deliver His Opinion, and
the reaſons of it: which being done, He will leave the whole matter of thoſe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Propoſitions to the determination of His two Houſes, which ſhall prevail with
Him for his Conſent accordingly.</p>
                     <p>And His Majeſty doth (for His own particular) only propoſe that He may have
Liberty to repair forthwith to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and be reſtored to a condition of abſolute
Freedom and Safety, (a thing which He ſhall never deny to any of His Subjects)
and to the poſſeſſion of His Lands and Revenues; and that an Act of Oblivion and
Indemnity may paſs to extend to all perſons, for all matters relating to the late unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Differences: Which being agreed by His two Houſes of Parliament, His Majeſty
will be ready to make theſe His Conceſſions binding, by giving them the force of
Laws by His Royal Aſſent.</p>

                     <p>[The Remonſtrance it ſelf being very long, and ſerving only to introduce their Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the end, we have thought fit to repreſent only the Propoſitions themſelves, as they are
contracted in their own Abridgment.]</p>
                     <p>FIrſt, That the Capital and grand Author of our Troubles, the Perſon of the King,
by whoſe procurement, and for whoſe Intereſt only of will and power, all our
Wars have been, may be brought to Juſtice for the Treaſon, Blood, and Miſchief he
is therein guilty of.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That a timely day may be ſet for the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
to come in, by which time if they do not, that then they may be immediately declared
incapable of any Government or Truſt in this Kingdom or its Dominions, and thence
to ſtand exil'd for ever as Enemies and Traitors, to dye without mercy if ever after
found and taken therein. Or if by the time limited they do render themſelves, that
then the Prince be proceeded with as on his appearance he ſhall give ſatisfaction or not;
and the Duke, as he ſhall give ſatisfaction, may be conſidered as to future Truſt or not.
But however, that the Revenue of the Crown (ſaving neceſſary allowances for the
Children, and for Servants and Creditors to the Crown) be ſequeſtred, and the coſtly
Pomp ſuſpended for a good number of years; and that this Revenue be for that time
diſpoſed toward publick Charges, Debts and Damages, for the eaſing of the People;
ſo as the Eſtates neither of Friends to publick Intereſt, nor alone of inferior Enemies
thereto, may bear wholly the burthen of that loſs and charge which by and for that
Family, the Kingdom hath been put unto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That Capital puniſhment be ſpeedily executed upon a competent number
of his chief Inſtruments alſo, both in former and later Wars; and that ſome of both
ſorts be pitcht upon as are really in your hands or reach.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the reſt of the Delinquents <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may upon rendring themſelves
to Juſtice have mercy for their Lives; and that only Fines be ſet upon them, and their
perſons declared incapable of any publick Truſt, or having any voice in Elections
thereto, at leaſt for a good number of years: And that a ſhort day may be ſet, by
which all ſuch Delinquents may come in; and for thoſe who come not in by that day,
that their Eſtates be abſolutely confiſcate and ſold to the publick uſe, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſtand exil'd as Traitors, and to die without mercy if ever found after in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or its Dominions.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That the ſatisfaction of Arrears to the Soldiery, with other publick Debts,
and competent reparations of publick Damages, may be put into ſome orderly way:
And therefore that the Fines and Compoſitions of Delinquents be diſpoſed to thoſe
uſes only, as alſo the Confiſcations of ſuch who ſhall be excluded from Pardon, or not
come in by the day aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>Now after publick Juſtice thus far provided for, we proceed in order to the general
ſatisfaction and ſettling of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That you would ſet ſome reaſonable and certain period to your own Power.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That with a period to this Parliament, there may be a ſettlement of the
Peace, and future Government of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That there may be a certain ſucceſſion of future Parliaments, Annual, or
Biennial, with ſecure proviſion, 1. For the certainty of their ſitting, meeting, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
2. For equal Elections; 3. For the Peoples meeting to elect, provided that none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in War againſt the Kingdom may elect or be elected, nor any other who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this Settlement; 4. For clearing the future power of Parliaments as ſupreme, only
they may not give away any Foundation of Common Right; 5. For liberty of entring
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:60710:317"/>
Diſſents in the ſaid Repreſentatives, that the People may know who are not fit for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Truſts, but without any further penalty for their free judgements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That no King be hereafter admitted but upon Election of, and as upon Truſt
from, the People by ſuch their Repreſentatives, not without firſt diſclaiming all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to a Negative Voice againſt the determinations of the Commons in Parliament;
and this to be done in ſome form more clear than heretofore in the Coronation Oath.</p>
                     <p>Theſe matters of general Settlement we propound to be provided by the Authority
of the Commons in this Parliament, and to be further eſtabliſhed by a general Contract
or Agreement of the People, with their Subſcriptions therunto. And that no King be

                     <head>Four Queries propounded by His MAJESTY, when the Armies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
was read unto him at Newport, concerning the intended Trial of His

                     <p>1. WHether this Remonſtrance be agreeable to the former Declarations of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
and if not, whether the Parliament would make good their Votes, that
after He had conſented to what they deſired, He ſhould be in a capacity of Honour,
Freedom and Safety.</p>
                     <p>2. Whether His acknowledgement of the Blood that hath been ſpilt in the late Wars
(nothing being as yet abſolutely concluded or binding) could be urged ſo far as to
be made uſe of by way of Evidence againſt Him or any of His Party?</p>
                     <p>3. Whether the Arguments that He hath uſed in a free and Perſonal Treaty, to leſſen
or extenuate, and avoid the exactneſs of any of the Conditions, though in manner and
form only, might be charged againſt Him as an act of Obſtinacy, or wilful perſiſtence
in what is alledged againſt Him, in that He goes on in a deſtructive courſe of Enmity
againſt the People and the Laws of the Land, when He hath declared, that His Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was ſatisfied concerning divers particulars in the Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>4. Whereas by the Letter of the Law all perſons charged to offend againſt the Law,
ought to be tried by their Peers or Equals, what the Law is, if the Perſon queſtioned is
without a Peer? And if the Law (which of it ſelf is but a dead Letter) ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him, by what power ſhall Judgement be given, and who ſhall give it; or from
whence ſhall the adminiſtrators of ſuch Judgement derive their power, which may (by
the ſame Law) be deemed the ſupreme Power or Authority of Magiſtracy in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>

                     <p>WHen large pretences prove but the ſhadows of weak performance, then the
greateſt labours produce the ſmalleſt effects; and when a period is put to a
work of great concernment, all mens ears do (as it were) hunger till they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in their expectations. Hath not this diſtracted Nation groaned a long time under
the burthen of tyranny and oppreſſion? And hath not all the blood that hath been ſpilt
theſe ſeven years been caſt upon My Head, Who am the greateſt Sufferer, though the
leaſt guilty? And was it not requiſite to endeavour the ſtopping of that flux, which,
if not ſtopt, will bring an abſolute Deſtruction to this Nation? And what more ſpeedy
way was there to conſummate thoſe Diſtractions, than by a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> being agreed
upon by My two Houſes of Parliament, and condeſcended to by Me? And I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that I conceive it had been the beſt Phyſick, had not the operation been hindred
by the interpoſition of this imperious Army, who were ſo audacious as to ſtyle Me
in their unparallel'd <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> their <hi>Capital Enemy.</hi> But let the world judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mine endeavours have not been attended with reality in this late Treaty: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:60710:317"/>
I was not as ready to grant as they were to ask; and yet all this is not ſatisfaction to
them that purſue their own ambitious ends more than the welfare of a miſerable Land.
Were not the dying hearts of my poor diſtreſſed People much revived with the hopes of
a Happineſs from this Treaty? and how ſuddenly are they fruſtrated in their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons!
Have not I formerly been condemned for yielding too litte to My two Houſes of
Parliament; and ſhall I now be condemned for yielding too much? Have I not formerly
been Impriſoned for making War; and ſhall I now be condemned for making Peace?
Have I not formerly ruled like a KING; and ſhall I now be ruled like a Slave? Have I
not formerly enjoyed the ſociety of my dear Wife and Children in peace and quietneſs;
and ſhall I now neither enjoy them nor Peace? Have not My Subjects formerly obeyed
Me; and ſhall I now be obedient to My Subjects? Have I not been condemned for Evil
Counſellors; and ſhall I now be condemned for having no Counſel but God? Theſe
are unutterable Miſeries, that the more I endeavour for Peace, the leſs My endeavours
are reſpected; and how ſhall I know hereafter what to grant, when your ſelves
know not what to ask? I refer it to your conſciences, whether I have not ſatisfied your
deſires in every particular ſince this Treaty; if you find I have not, then let Me bear
the burthen of the fault; but if I have given you ample ſatisfaction (as I am ſure I
have) then you are bound to vindicate Me from the fury of thoſe whoſe thoughts are
filled with blood: though they pretend zeal, yet they are but Wolves in Sheeps cloathing.</p>
                     <p>I muſt further declare, that I conceive there is nothing can more obſtruct the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoped-for
peace of this Nation, than the illegall proceedings of them that preſume from
Servants to become Maſters, and labour to bring in Democracy, and to aboliſh
Monarchy. Needs muſt the total alteration of Fundamentals be not only deſtructlve to
others, but in concluſion to themſelves; for they that endeavour to rule by the Sword,
ſhall at laſt fall by it; for Faction is the Mother of Ruine: and it is the humour of thoſe
that are of this weather-cock-like diſpoſition, to love nothing but mutabilities,
neither will that pleaſe them but only <hi>pro tempore;</hi> for too much variety doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the ſenſes, and makes them ſtill hate one folly, and fall in love with another.</p>
                     <p>Time is the beſt cure for Faction: for it will at length (like a ſpreading leproſie)
infect the whole body of the Kingdom, and make it ſo odious, that at laſt they will hate
themſelves for love of that, and, like the Fiſh, for love of the bait be catch'd with the hook.</p>
                     <p>I once more declare to all My loving Subjects, and God knows whether or no this
may be My laſt, That I have earneſtly laboured for Peace, and that My thoughts were
ſincere and abſolute, without any ſiniſter ends; and there was nothing left undone by
Me that My Conſcience would permit me to do. And I call God to witneſs, that I do
firmly conceive that the interpoſition of the Army (that cloud of Malice) hath altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eclips'd the glory of that Peace which began again to ſhine in this Land. And let
the world judge whether it be expedient for an Army to contradict the Votes of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
endeavouring, by pretending for Laws and Liberties, to ſubvert both. Such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as theſe muſt produce ſtrange conſequences, and ſet open the flood-gates of Ruin to
overflow this Kingdom in a moment. Had this Treaty been only Mine own ſeeking, then
they might have had fairer pretences to have ſtopt the courſe of it; but I being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
by My two Houſes, and they by moſt part of the Kingdom, could not but with
a great deal of alacrity concurr with them in their deſires for the performance of ſo
commodious a work: and I hope by this time that the hearts and eyes of My People
are opened ſo much, that they plainly diſcover who are the Underminers of this Treaty.</p>
                     <p>For Mine own part, I here proteſt before the face of Heaven, that Mine own Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(though they need no addition) afflict Me not ſo much as My Peoples Sufferings,
for I know what to truſt to already, and they know not; God comfort both them and
Me, and proportion our Patience to our Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>And when the Malice of Mine Enemies is ſpun out to the ſmalleſt thred, let them know,
that I will, by the grace of God, be as contented to ſuffer as they are active to advance
My Sufferings: and Mine own Soul tells Me, that the time will come when the very clouds
ſhall drop down vengeance upon the heads of thoſe that barricado themſelves againſt the
proceedings of of Peace: for if God hath proclaimed a bleſſing to the Peace-makers, needs
muſt the Peace-breakers draw down curſes upon their heads.</p>
                     <p>I thank My God, I have armed My ſelf againſt their Fury; and now let the arrows
of their Envy fly at Me, I have a breaſt to receive them, and a heart poſſeſt with Patience
to ſuſtain them; for <hi>God is My Rock and My ſhield;</hi> therefore <hi>I will not fear what man can do
unto Me.</hi> I will expect the worſt; and if any thing happen beyond My expectation, I will
give God the glory: for vain is the help of man.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> WE do fully agree without heſitation, That theſe Scriptures cited in the margin

iii <hi>John</hi> 9, &amp; 10. do prove that the Apoſtles did ordain Presbyters and Deacons,
give Rules concerning Chriſtian Diſcipline, and had power of exerciſing Cenſures

1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 19. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. do prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had power to ordain Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
and Deacons, and to exerciſe cenſures over Presbyters and others: and that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> do prove, That the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches
had power of governing of the Churches, and exerciſing Cenſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But that either the Apoſtles, or <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches
were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as Biſhops are diſtinct from Presbyters, exerciſing Epiſcopal Government in
that ſenſe; or that the Apoſtles did commit and derive to any particular perſons as their
Subſtitutes and Succeſſors any ſuch Epiſcopal Government; or that this is proved in
the leaſt meaſure by the Scriptures alledged, we do as fully deny. And therefore do
humbly deny alſo, That Epiſcopal Government is therefore moſt conſonant to the
Word of God, and of Apoſtolical inſtitution, or proved ſo to be by theſe Scriptures.
None of theſe were Biſhops, or practiſed Epiſcopal Government, as Biſhops are diſtinct
from Presbyters. Neither is ſuch an Officer of the Church as a Biſhop diſtinct from a
Presbyter to be found in the New Teſtament (by which we humbly conceive that our
Faith and Conſcience touching this point ought to be concluded.) The Name, Office,
and Work of Biſhop and Presbyter being one and the ſame in all things, and never in
the leaſt diſtinguiſht, as is clearly evident, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5, 7. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Crete,
that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Presbyters in every

his reaſoning were altogether invalid and inconſequent, if Presbyter and Biſhop
were not the ſame Office, as well as they have the ſame Name.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 17, 28. <hi>And from Miletus he ſent to Epheſus, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Presbyters of the Church,</hi> to whom he gave this charge, verſe 28. <hi>Take heed
therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>

                        </gap>, to feed and govern the Church of God. Where we obſerve, That the
Apoſtle being to leave theſe Presbyters, and <hi>never to ſee their faces more,</hi> verſe 28.
doth charge them with the <hi>feeding</hi> and governing of the Church, as being Biſhops
of the Holy Ghoſt's making. But that the Holy Ghoſt did make any ſuperior or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
kind of Biſhops than theſe common Presbyters, is not to be found in that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Text.</p>
                     <p>And that under the mouth of two or three witneſſes this aſſertion of ours may ſtand;

are to do. Neither can <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſo called, as above Presbyters, do more for
the government and good of the Church otherwiſe than is there expreſly enjoyned unto
Presbyters. By all which that hath been ſaid, the point is rendred to be moſt clear to the
judgement of moſt men, both ancient and of later times, That there is no ſuch Officer to
be found in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament as a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter:
neither doth the Scripture afford us the leaſt notice of any qualification required in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
that is not required in a Presbyter, nor any Ordination to the Office of a Biſhop
diſtinct from a Presbyter, nor any work or duty charged upon a Biſhop which Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are not enjoyned to do, nor any greater honour or dignity put upon them. For
that <hi>double honour</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 17. as due to Presbyters that
<hi>rule well,</hi> is with a note of <hi>(eſpecially)</hi> affixed to that Act or work of <hi>labouring in the
word and Doctrine,</hi> which is not that Act wherein Biſhops have challenged a ſingularity
or peculiar eminency above the Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To that which Your Majeſty doth conceive, <hi>That Epiſcopal government was practiſed
by the Apoſtles themſelves;</hi> we humbly anſwer, That the Apoſtles, as they were the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Officers of the Church of Chriſt, ſo they were extraordinary in reſpect of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
gifts and Office, and diſtinguiſht from all other Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 28. <hi>God
hath ſet ſome in the Church, first, Apoſtles, ſecondarily, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers;</hi>
Epheſ. iv. 11. <hi>Chriſt gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors
and Teachers.</hi> Where the Apoſtles are diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Pastors and Teachers,</hi> who are
the ordinary Officers of the Church for Preaching the Word, and Government. That
they had power and authority to ordain Church-Officers, and to exerciſe Cenſures in all
Churches, we affirm; and withal, that no other Perſons or Officers of the Church may
challenge or aſſume to themſelves ſuch power in that reſpect alone, <hi>becauſe the Apostles
practiſed it:</hi> except ſuch power belong unto them in common, as well as to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
by warrant of the Scripture. For that Government which they practiſed was Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical,
according to the peculiar commiſſion and authority which they had, and no
otherwiſe to be called Epiſcopal, than as their Office was ſo comprehenſive, as they had
power to do the work of any or all other Church-Officers; in which reſpect they call
themſelves <hi>Presbyteri, Diaconi,</hi> (but never <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> in diſtinct ſenſe;) and therefore we
humbly crave leave to ſay, that to argue the Apoſtles to have practiſed Epiſcopal
Goverment becauſe they ordained other Officers, and exerciſed Cenſures, is as if we
ſhould argue a Juſtice of Peace to be a Conſtable, becauſe he doth that which a Conſtable
doth in ſome particulars. It's manifeſt that the Office of Biſhops and Presbyters was not
diſtinct in the Apoſtles. They did not act as Biſhops in ſome Acts, and as Presbyters in
other Acts: the diſtinction of Presbyters and Biſhops being made by men in after-times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And whereas Your Majeſty doth conceive that the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government was by the
Apoſtles <hi>committed and derived to particular perſons, as their Subſtitutes or Succeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as for ordaining Presbyters and Deacons, giving rules concerning Christian diſcipline, and
exerciſing cenſures over Presbyters and others,</hi> ſeeming by the alledged places of Scripture
to inſtance in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Angels of the Churches; we humbly anſwer,
and firſt, to that of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> We grant that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had Authority
and Power of ordaining Presbyters and Deacons, and of exerciſing Cenſures over Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
and others; though we cannot ſay they had this power as the Apoſtles Subſtitutes
or Succeſſors in Epiſcopal Government; nor that they exerciſed the power they had as
being Biſhops in the ſenſe of Your Majeſty; but as extraordinary Officers or Evangeliſts,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:60710:320"/>
which <hi>Evangelists</hi> were an Office in the Church diſtinct from <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,
Eph.</hi> iv. 11. and that they were <hi>Evangelists,</hi> it appears by their being ſent up and down by
the Apoſtles, or taken along with them in company to ſeveral Churches, as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and occaſion of the Churches did require: The one of them being expreſly called
an <hi>Evangeliſt, 1 Tim.</hi> iv. 5. and neither of them being any where in Scripture called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi>
Neither were they fixed to <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> as Biſhops in the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them; but removed from thence to other places, and never, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in Scripture, returned to them again. And it ſeems clear to us, that neither their
abode at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> was for any long time, nor ſo intended by the Apoſtle. For
he imploys them there upon occaſional buſineſs, and expreſſes himſelf in ſuch manner,
(<hi>I beſought thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mighteſt

been of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete;</hi> as they are called by the <hi>Postſcripts</hi> of theſe Epiſtles; the

                     </p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of the Churches are called <hi>Stars,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> which denominations
are metaphorical and in a <hi>myſtery, Rev.</hi> i. 20. <hi>the myſtery of the ſeven Stars; Angels</hi> in
reſpect of their Miſſion or ſending, <hi>Stars</hi> in reſpect of their Station and ſhining. And it
ſeems ſtrange to us, that to ſo many expreſs Teſtimonies of Scripture, an allegorical deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
or myſtery ſhould be oppoſed: Theſe Angels being no where called <hi>Biſhops</hi> in
vulgar acceptation; nor the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> uſed in any of <hi>John</hi>'s writings, who calls himſelf
<hi>Presbyter;</hi> nor any mention of ſuperiority of one Presbyter to another, but in <hi>Diotrephes</hi>
affecting it. And as to that which may be ſaid, that the <hi>Epiſtles are directed to one,</hi> we
anſwer, that a number of perſons are in the myſterious and prophetick writings expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in ſingulars; and we humbly conceive, that being written in an Epiſtolary ſtyle,
(for they are as Letters or Epiſtles to the Churches) theſe writings are directed as Letters
to collective Repreſentative Bodies uſe to be, that is, to one, but intended and meant
to that Body in meeting aſſembled; which that they were ſo intended, is clear to us,
both becauſe there were in <hi>Epheſus</hi> Biſhops and Presbyters, one and the ſame, to whom
the Apoſtle at his farewel commendeth the Government of the Church; and by divers
expreſſions in theſe Epiſtles, as <hi>Rev. 11. 24. To you and to the reſt in Thyatira;</hi> by which
diſtinction of <hi>you and the rest,</hi> we conceive the particular Governours (which were
more than one) and the people to be ſignified. And ſo cannot conſent that any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
perſon had majority over the reſt, or ſole power of exerciſing Church-Cenſures
and Government ſpoken of in theſe Chapters.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Having thus (as we humbly conceive) proved by pregnant places of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
together, that the Apoſtles themſelves did not <hi>inſtitute</hi> or <hi>practice Epiſcopal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor <hi>commit and derive it to particular perſons, as their Substitutes or Succeſſors
therein;</hi> we ſhall in farther diſcharge of our duty to, and for the more clear and full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of, Your Majeſty in this point, briefly declare into what Officers hands the
ordinary and ſtanding Offices of the Church were tranſmitted and derived by and from
the Apoſtles. The Apoſtles had no Succeſſors <hi>in eundem gradum:</hi> the Apoſtolical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was not derived by Succeſſion, being inſtituted by Chriſt by extraordinary and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Commiſſion. But for the ordinary and ſtanding uſe and ſervice of the Church, there
were ordained only two Orders of Officers, viz. <hi>Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
expreſſeth, <hi>Phil. 1. 1. To all the Saints in Christ Jeſus which are at Philippi, with
the Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> and onely of them doth the Apoſtle give the due Characters of
Officers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii 2, 8. From both which places of Scripture we conclude with ancient
Expoſitors, both Greek and Latine, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> are the ſame with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> there is no mention of any other Order but that of <hi>Deacons.</hi> Of both
which Orders in the Apoſtles times there were in one City more than one, as in <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi</hi>
and <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And we humbly offer to Your Majeſty as obſervable, That though one
Order might be ſuperiour to another Order, yet in the ſame Order of Officers there
was not any one ſuperior to others of the ſame Order: No Apoſtle was above an Apoſtle;
no Evangeliſt above an Evangeliſt; no Presbyter above a Presbyter; no Deacon above
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:60710:320"/>
a Deacon. And ſo we conclude this part, That ſince Church Officers are inſtituted and
ſet in the Church by God or <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and that Ordination by or in which the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is conveyed is of no other Officers but of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> therefore there
are no other Orders of ordinary and ſtanding Officers in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> As for the Ages immediately ſucceeding the Apoſtles, we anſwer, firſt, Our Faith
reaches no farther than the Holy Scriptures: No human teſtimony can beget any
more than a human faith. Secondly, we anſwer, That it is agreed upon by Learned
men, as well ſuch as contend for Epiſcopacy, as others, that the times immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Apoſtles, are very dark in reſpect of the Hiſtory of the Church. Thirdly,
That the moſt unqueſtionable Record of thoſe times gives clear teſtimony to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who reciting the Orders of
Church-Officers, expreſly limits them to two, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> and them whom in
one place he calls Biſhops, he always afterwards nameth Presbyters. The Epiſtles of
<hi>Ignatius</hi> pretend to the next Antiquity, but are by ſome ſuſpected as wholly ſpurious,
and proved by <hi>Vedelius</hi> to be ſo mixed, that it is hard, if not impoſſible, to know what
part of them are genuine: Beſides, Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> in his late obſervations on them,
chap. 18. pag. 138. confeſſes, that of the twelve of his Epiſtles, ſix are counterfeit, the
other ſix mixt, and none of them in every reſpect to be accounted ſincere and genuine.
Fourthly, we grant, That not long after the Apoſtles times, <hi>Biſhops</hi> in ſome ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>Presbyters</hi> are by the Writers of thoſe times reported to be in the Church; but
they were ſet up not as a Divine Inſtitution, but as an Eccleſiaſtical, as afterwards both
<hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were. Which is clear by Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Epiſtle to
Sir <hi>Francis Knowles,</hi> wherein he ſhews out of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> that <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome,
Jerome, Auguſtine,</hi> and many more holy Fathers, together with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> agree
that by the Word of God there is no difference between a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter;</hi>
and that <hi>Medina</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> affirms not only the ſame Fathers, but alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jerome, Theodoret, Primaſius, Sedulius</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> to be of the ſame judgment:
and that with them agree <hi>Oecumenius, Anſelme</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and another
<hi>Anſelme, Gregory</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> and after them many others: that it was inrolled in the
Canon Law for ſound and Catholick Doctrine, and publickly taught by Learned men.
And adds, That all who have laboured in the Reformation of the Church for theſe
500 years, have taught that all Paſtors, be they intituled Biſhops or Prieſts, have equal
authority and power by God's word. The ſame way goes <hi>Lombard</hi> Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and Father of the School-men, who ſpeaking of Presbyters and Deacons, ſaith,
The Primitive Church had thoſe Orders only, and that we have the Apoſtles precept
for them alone. With him agree many of the moſt eminent in that kind, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all the Canoniſts. To theſe we may add <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> who teſtifies for himſelf
and many others: and <hi>Caſſander,</hi> who was called by one of the <hi>German</hi> Emperors, as
one of ſingular ability and integrity, to inform him and reſolve his Conſcience in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
of that nature; who ſaid, It is agreed among all, that in the Apoſtles times there
was no difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter. For a concluſion, we add, that
the Doctrine we have herein propounded to Your Majeſty concerning the Identity of
the Order of Biſhops and Presbyters, is no other than the Doctrine publiſhed by
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. 1543. <hi>for all his Subjects to receive, ſeen and allowed by the Lords both
Spiritual and Temporal, with the neather Houſe of Parliament.</hi> Of theſe two Orders on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(ſo ſaith the Book) that is to ſay, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> Scripture maketh expreſs
mention, and how they were conferred of the Apoſtles by Prayer and Impoſition
of hands. By all which it ſeems evident, that the Order of Epiſcopacy, as diſtinct
from Presbytery, is but an Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution, and therefore not unalterable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, we anſwer, That Epiſcopal Government which at firſt obtained in the Church,
did really and ſubſtantially differ from the Epiſcopal Goverment which the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Houſes of Parliament deſire the abolition of. The Biſhop of thoſe times was one
preſiding and joining with the Presbytery of his Church, ruling with them, and not
without them: either created and made by the Presbyters, chuſing out one among
themſelves, as in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi> or choſen by the Church, and confirmed by
three or more of his Neighbours of like dignity within the ſame precinct; leſſer
Towns and Villages had, and might have have, Biſhops in them, as well as populous
and eminent Cities, until the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> decreed, <hi>That Villages and ſmall Cities
ſhould have no Biſhops, leſt the name and authority of a Biſhop might thereby come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi>
But of one claiming as his due and right, to himſelf alone, as a ſuperior order
or degree, all power about Ordination of Presbyters and Deacons, and all juriſdiction,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:60710:321"/>
either to exerciſe himſelf, or delegate to whom he will of the Laity or Clergy, (as
they diſtinguiſh) according to the Judgment and Practice of thoſe in our times, we
read not till in the latter and corrupter Ages of the Church.</p>
                     <p>By all which it appears, that the preſent Hierarchy, the abolition whereof is deſired
by the Honourable Houſes, may accordingly be aboliſhed, and yet poſſibly the Biſhops
of thoſe Primitive times, be. They are ſo far differing one from another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> In anſwer to that part of Your Majeſties Paper, wherein You require whether <hi>our
Saviour and his Apoſtles did ſo leave the Church at liberty, as they might totally alter or
change the Church-Government at their pleaſure;</hi> we humbly conceive that there are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials
belonging to Church-Government, ſuch as are appointed by Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, which are not in the Churches liberty to alter at pleaſure. But as for <hi>Arch-Biſhops,
&amp;c.</hi> we hope it will appear unto Your Majeſties Conſcience, that they are
none of the Church-Governors appointed by our Saviour and his Apoſtles. And we
beſeech Your Majeſty to look rather to the Original of them, than Succeſſion.</p>

1648. findeth that you acknowledg the ſeveral Scriptures cited in the Margin
to prove the things for which they are cited, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> by Authority derived from them, and the Angels of the
Churches, had power of Church-Government, and did or might actually exerciſe the
ſame in all the three ſeveral branches in His Paper ſpecified: And ſo in effect you grant
all that is deſired. For the Biſhops challenge no more or other power to belong unto
them in reſpect of their Epiſcopal Office, as it is diſtinct from that of Presbyters,
than what properly falleth under one of theſe three, <hi>Ordination,</hi> giving <hi>Rules,</hi> and
<hi>Cenſures.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But when you preſently after deny the perſons that exerciſed the power aforeſaid to
have been Biſhops, or to have exerciſed Epiſcopal Government in that ſenſe, as Biſhops
are diſtinct from Presbyters, you do in effect deny the very ſame thing you had before
granted: For Epiſcopal Government in that ſenſe being nothing elſe but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Churches within a certain Precinct (commonly called a <hi>Dioceſe</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to one ſingle perſon, with ſufficient authority over the Presbyters and people
of thoſe Churches for that end; ſince the ſubſtance of the thing it ſelf in all the three
forementioned particulars is found in the Scriptures, unleſs you will ſtrive about names
and words (which tendeth to no profit, but to the puzling and ſubverting thoſe which
ſeek after truth) you muſt alſo acknowledg that Epiſcopal Government in the ſenſe
aforeſaid may be ſufficiently proved from the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>In that which you ſay next,<note place="margin">Tit. i. 5, 7.</note>
 and for proof thereof inſiſt upon three ſeveral Texts,
His Majeſty conceiveth as to the preſent buſineſs,<note place="margin">Acts xx. 17, 18.</note>
 that the moſt that can be proved
from all or any of thoſe places is this,<note place="margin">1 Pet. v. 1, 2.</note>
 That the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> is there uſed to ſignifie
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> and that conſequently the Office and Work mentioned in thoſe places as the
Office and Work of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> are the Office and Work of a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
on all ſides, although His Majeſty is not ſure that the proof will reach ſo far in each
of thoſe places. But from thence to infer an abſolute Identity of the Functions of a
<hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> is a fallacy, which his Majeſty obſerveth to run in a manner quite
along your whole Anſwer: but it appears from the Scriptures, by what you have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſingle perſons (as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for example) had Authority to perform
ſuch Acts and Offices of Church-Government as his Majeſty hath not yet found, by
any thing repreſented unto Him by you or any other from the Scripture, that a ſingle
<hi>Presbyter</hi> ever had authority to perform; which is enough to prove that, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Names in ſome places notwithſtanding, the Functions themſelves are in
other places by their proper work ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="617" facs="tcp:60710:321"/>
But for the Name <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> His Majeſty hath long ſince learned<note n="*" place="margin">by.</note>
 from
thoſe that are skilful in the Greek tongue, that it imports properly no more than an
<hi>Overſeer,</hi> one that hath the charge or inſpection of ſome thing committed unto him,
as hee that is ſet to <hi>watch</hi> a Beacon, or to keep Sheep; whence in the New Teſtament,
and in the Eccleſiaſtical uſe, it is applied to ſuch perſons as have the Care and <hi>Inſpection</hi>
of the Churches of Chriſt committed unto them <hi>in Spiritualibus;</hi> as both Biſhops and
Presbyters have in ſome ſort, but with this difference, that mere <hi>Presbyters</hi> are <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi
gregis</hi> only, they have the <hi>overſight</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> in the duties of Preaching, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Sacraments, Publick Prayer, Exhorting, Rebuking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>Biſhops</hi>
are <hi>Epiſcopi gregis</hi> and <hi>Pastorum</hi> too, having the <hi>overſight</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi>
within their ſeveral Precincts, in the acts of external Government; ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
work of both Functions is the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, but that which is peculiar
to the Function of <hi>Biſhops</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Presbyters</hi> is Church-Government. It
is not therefore to be wondred, if it ſhould happen in the New Teſtament, the word
<hi>Epiſcopus</hi> to be [uſually] applied unto <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who were indeed <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the
<hi>flock,</hi> rather than unto Church-Governors, who had then another Title of greater
Eminency whereby to diſtinguiſh them from ordinary <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to wit, that of
<hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But when the government of Churches came into the hands of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
the names were by common uſage (which is the beſt Maſter of words) very
ſoon appropriated, that of <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> to the Eccleſiaſtical Governor or <hi>Biſhop</hi> of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,
and that of <hi>Presbyter</hi> to the ordinary Miniſter or <hi>Priest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty had rather cauſe to wonder, That upon ſuch premiſes you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with ſo much confidence, as if the <hi>point</hi> were <hi>rendred moſt clear to the Judgment
of most men, both ancient and of latter times, That there is no ſuch Officer to be found in
the Scriptures of the New Testament as a Biſhop distinct from a Presbyter;</hi> whenas His
Majeſty remembreth to have ſeen cited, by ſuch Authors as He hath no reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
both out of the ancient Fathers and Councils, and out of ſundry modern Writers,
even of thoſe Reformed Churches that want <hi>Biſhops,</hi> great variety of Teſtimonies to
the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> His Majeſty is not ſatisfied with your Anſwer concerning the Apoſtles exerciſe of
Epiſcopal Government, which you would put off, by referring it to their extraordinary
Calling. Our Saviour himſelf was the firſt and chief Apoſtle, and Biſhop of our
Souls, <hi>ſent</hi> by the Father, and <hi>Anointed</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, to be both the Teacher
and the Governour of his Church. By that <hi>Miſſion</hi> he receiv'd Authority, and by his
Unction ability for thoſe works which he performed in his own perſon whilſt he lived
upon the earth. Before he left the world, that the Church might not want Teaching
and Governing to the worlds end, he choſe certain perſons upon whom he conferred
both theſe Powers, whereby they became alſo Apoſtles and Biſhops, by making them
partakers both of his <hi>Miſſion</hi> before his Aſcenſion, (<hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend
I you</hi>) and of his <hi>Vnction</hi> ſhortly after his Aſcenſion, when he poured upon them the Holy
Ghoſt at <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> The <hi>Miſſion</hi> both for teaching and governing (at leaſt for the
ſubſtance of it) was ordinary, and to continue to the end of the world (<hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii.
18, 20.) and therefore neceſſarily to deſcend, and be by them tranſmitted to others,
as their Subſtitutes and Succeſſors. But the <hi>Vnction</hi> whereby they were enabled to
both Offices or Functions, by the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſuch a plenteous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Knowledg, Tongues, Miracles, Prophecyings, Healing, Infallibility of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
diſcerning of ſpirits and ſuch like, was indeed extraordinary in them, and in
ſome few others, though in an inferiour meaſure, as God ſaw it needful for the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Churches and propagation of the Goſpel in thoſe Primitive times; and in
this (which was indeed extraordinary in them) they were not neceſſarily to have
Succeſſors. But it ſeems very unreaſonable to attribute the exerciſe of that Power,
whether of Teaching or Governing, to an extraordinary calling, which being of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and continual uſe in the Church, muſt therefore of neceſſity be the work of a
Function of ordinary and perpetual uſe: Therefore the Acts of Governing of the
Church were no more nor otherwiſe extraordinary in the Apoſtles, than the Acts of
Teaching the Church were; that is to ſay, both extraordinary for the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
in reſpect of their more than ordinary abilities for the ſame; and yet both
ordinary for the ſubſtance of the Offices themſelves, and the works to be performed
therein: and in theſe two ordinary Offices, their ordinary Succeſſors are <hi>Presbyters</hi>
and <hi>Biſhops;</hi> Presbyters <hi>qua</hi> Presbyters immediately ſucceeding them in the Office of
Teaching, and Biſhops <hi>qua</hi> Biſhops immediately in the Office of Governing.</p>

The inſtances of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> you likewiſe endeavour to avoid by the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an extraordinary calling. But in this Anſwer, beſides the inſufficiency thereof
(<hi>if</hi> all that is ſaid therein could be proved) His Majeſty findeth very little ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>1. Firſt, you ſay that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were by Office Evangeliſts, whereas of <hi>Titus</hi>
the Scriptures no where affirm any ſuch thing at all; and by your own Rule, your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
without Scripture will beget (if that) but a humane Faith; neither doth the
Text clearly Prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo.</p>
                     <p>2. Setting aſide mens conjectures (which can breed but an humane Faith neither)
you cannot make it appear by any Text of Scripture, that the Office of an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> is
ſuch as you have deſcribed it: <hi>The work of an Evangeliſt</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
to do, ſeems by the Context (2 <hi>Tim:</hi> iv. 5.) to be nothing but diligence in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Word, notwithſtanding all impediments and oppoſitions.</p>
                     <p>3. That which you ſo confidently affirm, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> acted as <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi>
is not onely denyed, but clearly refuted by <hi>Scultetus, Gerard</hi> and others; yea even
with ſcorn rejected of late (as His Majeſty is informed) by ſome rigid Presbyterians,
as <hi>Gilleſpy, Rutherford,</hi> &amp;c. And that which you ſo confidently deny, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> is not onely confirmed by the conſentient teſtimony of all Antiquity
(even <hi>Jerome</hi> himſelf having recorded it, that they were Biſhops, and that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
ordination) and acknowledged by very many late Divines; but a Catalogue alſo of
27. Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> lineally ſucceeding from <hi>Timothy</hi> our of good records, is vouched

                     <p>4. You affirm, but upon very weak proofs, that they were from <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi>
removed to other places. Some that have exactly out of Scripture compared the times
and orders of the ſeveral journeys and ſtations of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> have demonſtrated
the contrary concerning this particular.</p>
                     <p>5. Whereas you ſay it is manifeſt from the 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 9. and <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 12. that they
were called away from theſe places; it doth no more conclude that they were not <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
there, or that they might as well be called <hi>Biſhops</hi> of other Churches, than it may
be concluded from the attendance of the Divines at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> that they are no longer
Parſons or Vicars of their ſeveral Pariſhes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for the <hi>Postſcripts</hi> of theſe Epiſtles, though His Majeſty lay no great weight
upon them, yet He holdeth them to be of great antiquity, and therefore ſuch as in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fact, where there appears no ſtrong evidence to weaken their belief, ought not to
be lightly rejected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Neither doth His Majeſty lay any weight at all upon the Allegory or Myſtery of the
denomination in the next point concerning the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches, as you miſtake
in your Anſwer thereunto; wherein His Majeſty finds as little ſatisfaction as in the laſt
point before. The ſtrength of His Majeſties inſtance lay in this, That in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Ancient and the beſt Modern Modern Writers, and by many probabilities in the
Text it ſelf, the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Seven Churches were <hi>perſonoe Singulares,</hi> and ſuch as had
a Prelacy as well over Paſtors as People within their Churches, and that is in a word,
<hi>Biſhops.</hi> And you bring nothing of moment in your Anſwer to infirm this. You ſay
truly indeed, That thoſe Epiſtles were written in Epiſtolary ſtyle, and ſo (as Letters
to collective or repreſentative Bodies uſe to be) directed to one, but intended to the
Body: Which when you have proved, you are ſo far from weakning, that you rather
ſtrengthen the Argument to prove thoſe Angels to have been ſingle perſons: as when
His Majeſty ſendeth a Meſſage to His two Houſes, and directs it to the Speaker of the
Houſe of Peers, His intending it to the whole Houſe doth not hinder but that the
Speaker to whom it is directed is one ſingle perſon ſtill. Yet His Majeſty cannot but
obſerve in this (as in ſome parts of your Anſwer) how willing you are <hi>verſari in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralibus,</hi>
and how unwillingly to ſpeak out, and to declare plainly and directly what
your opinion is concerning thoſe <hi>Angels,</hi> who they were; whether they were, (as the
great Antagoniſt of Epiſcopacy, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> very peremptorily (<hi>ſit ergo hoc fixum,</hi> &amp;c.)
affirmeth) the whole Churches; or ſo many individual Paſtors of the gathered Churches
in thoſe Cities; or the whole College of Presbyters in the reſpective Churches; or the
ſingular and individual Preſidents of theſe Colleges; for into ſo many ſeveral Opinions
are thoſe few divided among themſelves, who have divided themſelves from the common
and received judgement of the Chriſtian Church.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In the following diſcourſe, you deny that the Apoſtles were to have any Succeſſors
in their Office, and affirm that there were to be onely two Orders of ordinary and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Officers in the Church, wiz. <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="619" facs="tcp:60710:322"/>
What His Majeſty conceiveth concerning the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, is in part
already declared, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have no Succeſſors <hi>in eundem gradum,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe
things that were extraordinary in them, as namely the meaſure of their Gifts, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their Charge, the infallibility of their Doctrine, and (which is ſundry times
mentioned as a ſpecial Character of an <hi>Apostle</hi> properly ſo called) the having <hi>ſeen Chriſt
in the fleſh.</hi> But in thoſe things that were not extraordinary (and ſuch thoſe things are
to be judged which are neceſſary for the ſervice of the Church in all times, as the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Teaching,</hi> and the power of <hi>Governing</hi> are) they were to have and had Succeſſors;
and therefore the Learned and Godly Fathers and Councils of old times did uſually ſtyle
Biſhops the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, without ever ſcrupling thereat.</p>
                     <p>And as to the ſtanding Offices of the Church, although in the places by you cited,
<hi>Phil.</hi> i. 1. i <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 8. there be no mention of <hi>Biſhops</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but
of the two Orders only of <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> yet it is not thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that there is no other ſtanding Office in the Church beſides: For there appear two
other manifeſt reaſons, why that of <hi>Biſhops</hi> might not be ſo proper to be mentioned in
thoſe places; the one, becauſe in the Churches which the Apoſtles themſelves planted,
they placed Presbyters under them for the Office of Teaching, but took upon themſelves
the care, and reſerved in their own hands the power of Governing in thoſe Churches,
for a longer or ſhorter time, as they ſaw it expedient for the propagating of the Goſpel,
before they ſet Biſhops over them; and ſo it may be probable that there was as yet no
Biſhop ſet over the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ his Epiſtle to them. The
other, becauſe in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the perſons to whom he wrote being
themſelves <hi>Biſhops,</hi> there was no need to write any thing concerning the choice or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of any other ſort of Officers than ſuch as belonged to their ordination or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
which were Presbyters and Deacons only, and not Biſhops.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Concerning the Ages ſucceeding the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. His Majeſty believeth, that altho Faith, as it is an aſſent unto Truth ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or of Divine revelation, reacheth no further than the Scriptures, yet in matters of
fact, humane Teſtimonies may beget a Faith, though humane, yet certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
as by the credit of Hiſtories we have an infallible Faith that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a Greek
Philoſopher, and <hi>Cicero</hi> a Roman Orator.</p>
                     <p>2. The darkneſs of thoſe times in reſpect of the Hiſtory of the Church is a very
ſtrong Argument for Epiſcopacy; which notwithſtanding the darkneſs of the times hath
found ſo full and clear a proof, by the unqueſtioned Catalogues extant in ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Biſhops of ſundry famous Cities, as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome,
Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> in a continued ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, as ſcarce any other matter of
fact hath found the like.</p>
                     <p>3. In <hi>Clement</hi>'s Teſtimony cited by you, His Majeſty conceiveth you make uſe of
your old fallacy, from the promiſcuous uſe of the words to infer the indiſtinction of the
things: for who can doubt of <hi>Clement</hi>'s Opinion concerning the diſtinct Offices of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Presbyters, who either readeth his whole Epiſtle, or conſidereth that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was a Biſhop in that ſenſe, even by the confeſſion of <hi>Videlius</hi> himſelf, a man never
yet ſuſpected to favour Biſhops, who<note n="*" place="margin">Exercit. 8. in Ignat. c. 3.</note>
 ſaith, that after the death of <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,
Clemens ſolus Epiſcopi nomen retinuit, quia jam invaluerat distinctio Epiſcopi &amp; Presbyteri?</hi>
And for <hi>Ignatius</hi> Epiſtles, though ſome of late, out of their partial diſaffection to Biſhops,
have endeavoured to deſcredit the whole Volume of them by all poſſible means, without
any regard either of ingenuity or truth; yet ſundry of them are ſuch as, being atteſted
by the Suffrages of Antiquity, cannot with any forehead be denied to be his; and there
is ſcarce any of them which doth not give teſtimony to the Prelacy of a Biſhop above a
Presbyter: <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf alſo was a Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and a holy Martyr for the Faith
of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>4. You grant that not long after the Apoſtles times Biſhops are found in the Writers
of thoſe times, as in ſome ſuperiority to Presbyters; but you might have added farther
out of theſe Writers (if you had pleaſed) that there were ſome of them, as <hi>James</hi> at
<hi>Jeruſalem, Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus, Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete, Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria, Linus</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi>
at <hi>Rome, Polycarpus</hi> at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> conſtituted and ordained Biſhops of theſe places by the
Apoſtles themſelves, and all of them reputed Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their Epiſcopal
Office: And His Majeſty preſumeth you could not be ignorant that all or moſt of the
teſtimonies you recite of the ancient Fathers, Writers of the middle ages, Schoolmen
and Canoniſts, and the Book publiſhed under King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. do but either import the
promiſcuous and indifferent uſe of the names of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whereof advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:60710:323"/>
ought not to be made to take away the difference of the things; or elſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> by curious queſtioniſts, <hi>Vtrum Epiſcopatus ſit or do vel gradus,</hi> both ſides
in the mean time acknowledging the right of Church-government to be in the Biſhops
alone, and not in the Presbyters; as alſo that there may be produced either from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame Writers, or from others of as good authority or credit, teſtimonies both for
number and clearneſs far beyond thoſe by you mentioned, to aſſert the three different
Degrees or Orders (call them whether you will) of Eccleſiaſtical Functions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and the <hi>Deacon.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> As to that which you add laſtly, concerning the difference between Primitive Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
and the preſent Hierarchy, albeit His Majeſty doth not conceive that the acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or additions granted by the favour of His Royal Progenitors, for the enlarging of
the Power or Privileges of Biſhops, have made, or indeed can make, the Government
really and ſubſtantially to differ from what formerly it was, no more than the addition
of Arms or Ornaments can make a body really and ſubſtantially to differ from it ſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
or deveſted of the ſame; nor can think it either neceſſary or yet expedient that the
elections of the Biſhops, or ſome other Circumſtantials touching their Perſons or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſhould be in all reſpects the ſame under Chriſtian Princes, as it was when Chriſtians
lived among Pagans and under Perſecution: yet His Majeſty ſo far approveth of your
Anſwer in that behalf, that he thinketh it well worthy the ſtudies and endeavours of the
Divines of both Opinions, laying aſide Emulation and private Intereſts, to reduce Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
and Presbytery into ſuch a well-proportioned Form of Superiority and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as may beſt reſemble the Apoſtolical and Primitive times, ſo far forth as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
condition of times and the exigences of all conſiderable circumſtances will admit, ſo
as the power of Church-Government in the particular of Ordination, which is meerly
ſpiritual, may remain <hi>Authoritative</hi> in the Biſhop, but that Power not to be exerciſed
without the concurrence or aſſiſtance of his Presbytery, as <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the
authority of St <hi>Paul,</hi> ii <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 6. but with the concurrence or aſſiſtance of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
i <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. Other powers of Government which belong to Juriſdiction,
though they are in the Biſhops, (as before is expreſt) yet the outward exerciſe of them,
may be ordered and diſpoſed or limited by the Sovereign power, to which by the Laws
of the Land and the acknowledgement of the Clergy they are ſubodinate: but His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
doubteth whether it be in your power to give Him any preſent aſſurance, that in
the deſired Abolition of the preſent Hierarchy, the utter aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy, and
conſequently of the Primitive Epiſcopacy, is neither included nor intended.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> As to the laſt part of His Majeſties Paper, His Majeſty would have been ſatisfied,
if you had been more particular in your Anſwer thereunto. You tell Him in general,
that there are <hi>Subſtantials</hi> in Church-Government appointed by Chriſt, &amp;c. but you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay what thoſe <hi>Substantials</hi> are, nor in whoſe hands they are left; whereas His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
expected that you ſhould have declared your opinions clearly, whether Chriſt or
his Apoſtles left any certain Form of Government to be obſerved in all Chriſtian Churches;
then, whether the ſame binds all Churches to the perpetual obſervation thereof, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they may upon occaſion alter the ſame, either in whole or in part; likewiſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that certain Form of Government which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have appointed
as perpetual and unalterable (if they have appointed any ſuch at all) be the Epiſcopal,
or the Presbyterian, or ſome other differing from them both.</p>
                     <p>And whereas in the concluſion you beſeech His Majeſty to look rather to the <hi>Original</hi>
of Biſhops than to their <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> His Majeſty thinks it needful to look at both; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſince their <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is the beſt clue, the moſt certain and ready way to find out their
<hi>Original.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty having returned you this Anſwer, doth profeſs, that as whatſoever was
of weight in yours ſhall have influence on Him; ſo He doubts not but ſomewhat may
appear to you in His which was not ſo clear to you before: and if this Debate may have
this end, that it diſpoſe others to the temper of accepting Reaſon, as it ſhall Him of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> AS in our Paper of <hi>October</hi> the third, in Anſwer to Your Majeſties of <hi>October</hi> the
ſecond, we did, ſo now again we do, acknowledg that the Scriptures cited in
the Margin of Your Majeſties Paper do prove, that the Apoſtles in their own perſons,
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Angels of the Churches, had power reſpectively to do
thoſe things which are in thoſe places of Scripture ſpecified: But as then, ſo now alſo
we humbly do deny, that any of the perſons or Officers fore-mentioned were <hi>Biſhops</hi>
as diſtinct from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or did exerciſe Epiſcopal Government in that ſenſe; or that
this was in the leaſt meaſure proved by the alledged Scriptures. And therefore our
Negative not being to the ſame point or ſtate of the Queſtion which was affirmed, we
humbly conceive that we ſhould not be interpreted to have, in effect, denied the very
ſame thing which we had before granted, or to have acknowledged that the ſeveral
Scriptures do prove the thing for which they are cited by Your Majeſty. And if that
which we granted were all that, by the Scripture cited in Your Margin, Your Majeſty
intended to prove; it will follow, that nothing hath yet been proved on Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
part, to make up that Concluſion which is pretended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As then we ſtood upon the Negative to that Aſſertion, ſo we now crave leave to
repreſent to Your Majeſty, that Your Reply doth not infirm the Evidence given in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thereof. The reaſon given by Your Majeſty in this Paper to ſupport Your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
That the perſons that exerciſed the power aforeſaid were Biſhops in diſtinct ſenſe,
is taken from a deſcription of Epiſcopal Government; which is (as Your Majeſty ſaith)
<hi>nothing elſe but the Government of the Churches within a certain Precinct (commonly called
a Dioceſs) committed to one ſingle perſon, with ſufficient authority over the Presbyters and
people of thoſe Churches for that end:</hi> which Government ſo deſcribed being for <hi>ſubſtance
of the thing it ſelf in all the three forementioned particulars</hi> (Ordaining, giving rules of
Diſcipline, and Cenſures) <hi>found in Scriptures,</hi> except we will contend <hi>about names and
words, muſt be acknowledged in the ſenſe aforeſaid to be ſufficiently proved from Scriptures.</hi> And
Your Majeſty ſaith farther, that <hi>the Biſhops do not challenge more or other power to belong
to them, in reſpect of their Epiſcopal Office, as it is distinct from that of Presbyters, than what
properly falls under one of thoſe three.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We deſire to ſpeak both to the <hi>Biſhops Challenge,</hi> and to Your Majeſties <hi>Deſcription</hi>
of <hi>Epiſcopal Government.</hi> And firſt to their <hi>Challenge,</hi> becauſe it is firſt expreſt in Your
Majeſties Reply.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Challenge we undertake in two reſpects: 1. In reſpect of the <hi>Power</hi> challenged,
2. in reſpect of that ground or <hi>Tenure</hi> upon which the claim is laid. The <hi>Power</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
conſiſts of three particulars, <hi>Ordaining, giving Rules</hi> of Diſcipline, and <hi>Cenſures:</hi>
No more, no other, in reſpect of their Epiſcopal Office. We ſee not by what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
this Writ of partition is taken forth by which the Apoſtolical Office is thus ſhared
or divided; the <hi>Governing</hi> part into the <hi>Biſhops</hi> hands, the <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>administring</hi>
Sacraments into the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> For beſides that the Scripture makes no ſuch incloſure
or partition-wall, it appears, the challenge is grown to more than was pretended unto
in the times of grown Epiſcopacy. <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> do both acknowledg for
their time, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> differed only in the matter of <hi>Ordination:</hi> and
learned Doctor <hi>Bilſon</hi> makes ſome abatement in the claim of <hi>three,</hi> ſaying, the things
proper to Biſhops, which might not be common to Presbyters, are ſingularity of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
and ſuperiority in Ordaining.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>Tenure</hi> or ground upon which the claim is made, is <hi>Apostolical,</hi> which with us
is all one with <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> And this, as far as we have learned, hath not been
<hi>anciently, openly,</hi> or <hi>generally</hi> avowed in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> either in time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or of the firſt Reformation; and whenſoever the pretenſion hath been made, it
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:60710:324"/>
was not without the contradiction of learned and godly men. The abettors of the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
that they might reſolve it at laſt into the Scripture, did chuſe the moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way of aſcending by the ſcale of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> going up the River to find the Head: but
when they came to Scriptures, and found it like the head of <hi>Nile</hi> (which cannot
be found) they ſhrouded it under the name and countenance of the <hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi>
and of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Thoſe that would carry it higher, endeavoured to impe it
into the <hi>Apoſtolical Office,</hi> and ſo at laſt called it a <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> not in force of any
<hi>expreſs precept,</hi> but <hi>implicite practice</hi> of the Apoſtles; and ſo the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Office (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the gifts or enablements confeſt only extraordinary) is brought down to be
<hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> raiſed up to be <hi>Apostolical.</hi> Whereupon it follows, that the
<hi>Higheſt</hi> Officers in the Church are put into a <hi>lower orb;</hi> an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Office turned
into an <hi>ordinary,</hi> a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Office confounded with that which in the Scripture is not
<hi>found,</hi> a <hi>temporary</hi> and an <hi>extinct</hi> Office revived. And indeed if the definitions of both
be rightly made, they are ſo incompetible to the ſame ſubject, that he that will take
both muſt loſe that one; <hi>aut Apoſtolus Epiſcopatum, aut Apostolatum Epiſcopus:</hi> For the
Apoſtles, though they did not in many things act <hi>aliud,</hi> yet they acted <hi>alio nomine &amp;
alio munere,</hi> then Presbyters or Biſhops do: and if they were indeed Biſhops, and their
Government properly Epiſcopal in diſtinct ſenſe, then it is not needful to go ſo far about
to prove Epiſcopal government of <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution, becauſe they practiſed it; but to
aſſert expreſly, that Chriſt inſtituted it immediately in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> For Your Majeſties <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government, it is extracted out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of later date than Scripture-times, and doth not ſute to that Meridian under which
there were more Biſhops than one in a Precinct or Church; and it is as fully competent
to Archiepiſcopal and Patriarchal Government, as Epiſcopal. The parts of this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>materially</hi> and <hi>abſtractly</hi> conſidered, may be found in Scripture. The Apoſtles, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> were ſingle perſons, but not limited to a Precinct: The Government
of the <hi>Angel</hi> was limited to a Precinct, but not in ſingle perſons. In ſeveral Offices, not
to be confounded, the parts of this definition may be found; but the aggregation of
them all together into one ordinary Officer cannot be found. And if that word, <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
and <hi>ſtanding Government,</hi> had made the <hi>Genus</hi> in your Majeſties Definition
(as it ought to be) we ſhould crave leave to ſay it would be <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> if not
<hi>petitio principii:</hi> for the Scripture doth not put all theſe parts together in a Biſhop, who
never borrowed of <hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> the matter of Governing and
Ordaining, and left the other of Teaching, diſpenſing Sacraments, and dealing only
<hi>in foro interno,</hi> to Presbyters, until after-times. By this that hath been ſaid it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
enough, that we contend not, firſt, <hi>de nomine,</hi> about the <hi>Name</hi> of Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which yet (though <hi>names</hi> ſerve for <hi>diſtinction</hi>) is not called or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by the name in Scripture: nor ſecondly, <hi>de opere,</hi> about the <hi>Work,</hi> whether
the work of Governing, Ordering, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be of continuance in the Church,
which we clearly acknowledg: But thirdly, <hi>de munere,</hi> about the <hi>Office,</hi> it being a great
fallacy to argue, That the Apoſtles did the ſame work which Biſhops or Presbyters are
to do in ordinary: Therefore they were of the ſame Office. For as it is ſaid of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and learned Arts, one and the ſame thing may be handled in divers of them: and
yet theſe Arts are diſtinguiſht by <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of handling of them: ſo we ſay of
Offices, they are diſtinguiſht by their Callings and Commiſſions, though not by the
work; as all thoſe that are named Eph. iv. ii. <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors,</hi>
and <hi>Teachers,</hi> are deſigned to one and the ſame general and common work, <hi>the work of
the Miniſtry, ver.</hi> 12. and yet they are not therefore all one; for it's ſaid, <hi>ſome</hi> Apoſtles,
<hi>ſome</hi> Prophets, <hi>ſome</hi> Evangeliſts, and <hi>ſome</hi> Paſtors and Teachers. A <hi>Dictator</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> and
an ordinary <hi>Tribune, Moſes</hi> and the ſubordinate Governors of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Court of
<hi>Parliament</hi> and of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> may agree in
ſome common work, and yet no confuſion of Offices follows thereupon.</p>

any of thoſe places by us alledged (to prove that the Name, Office, and Work of
Biſhops and Presbyters is one and the ſame in all things, and not in the leaſt diſtinguiſht)
is, <hi>That the word</hi> Biſhop <hi>is uſed in them to ſignifie a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>and the conſequently the
Office and Work mentioned in thoſe places as the Office and Work of a Biſhop, are the Office of
a Presbyter, which is confeſſed on all ſides;</hi> we make this humble return, That though
there be no ſuppoſition ſo much as implied that the Office of a Biſhop and a Presbyter
are diſtinct in any thing (for the names are mutually reciprocal,) yet we take Your
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:60710:324"/>
Majeſties Conceſſion, that in theſe times of the Church and places of Scripture there
was no diſtinct Office of Biſhops and Presbyters; and conſequently, that the identity
of the Office muſt ſtand, until there can be found a clear diſtinction of diviſion in the
Scriptures. And if we had argued the identity of Functions from the <hi>Community</hi> of names
and <hi>ſome part</hi> of the work, the Argument might have been juſtly termed a <hi>fallacy;</hi> but
we proved them the ſame Office from the ſame work, <hi>per omnia,</hi> being allowed ſo to
do by the fulneſs of thoſe two words uſed in the <hi>Acts</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, under the force of which words the Biſhops claim their whole power of
Government and Juriſdiction: and we found no little weight added to our Argument
from that in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the Apoſtle departing from the <hi>Epheſian Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
as <hi>never to ſee their faces more,</hi> commits (as by a final charge) the Government of
that Church, both over parricular Presbyters and people, not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who then
ſtood at his elbow, but to the Presbyters, under the name of Biſhops, <hi>made by the Holy
Ghost;</hi> whom we read to have ſet many Biſhops over one Church, not one over either
one or many. And the Apoſtles arguing from the ſame Qualification of a Presbyter and
of a Biſhop in order to Ordination or putting him into Office, fully proves them to be
two names of the ſame Order or Function; the <hi>divers</hi> orders of Presbyter and Deacon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diverſly characteriſed. Upon theſe grounds (we hope without fallacy) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it juſtly proved, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> are wholly the ſame. That <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> were ſingle perſons, having authority of Government, we acknowledge; but
deny that from thence any argument can be made unto either <hi>ſingle Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter:</hi>
for though a ſingie Presbyter by the power of his Order (as they call it) may preach
the Word and diſpenſe the Sacraments; yet by that example of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> their
<hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> and that Rule of <hi>Telling the Church</hi> in matter of ſcandal, it ſeems
manifeſt that Ordination and Cenſures are not to be exerciſed by a <hi>ſingle Presbyter:</hi>
neither hath Your Majeſty hitherto proved either the names of Biſhops and Presbyters,
or the Function, to be in other places of Scripture at all diſtinguiſhed; You having
wholly waved the notice or anſwer of that we did aſſert (and do yet deſire ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the contrary) <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture doth not afford us the leaſt notice
of <hi>any Qualification,</hi> any <hi>Ordination,</hi> any work or duty, any <hi>honour</hi> peculiary belonging
to a Biſhop diſtinct from a Presbyter; the aſſignment of which, or any of them, unto a
Biſhop by the Scripture, would put this Queſtion near to an iſſue. That God ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a diſtinct and higheſt kind of Officer for Government in the Church, and yet not
expreſs any qualification, work, or way of conſtituting and ordaining of him, ſeems
unto us improbable.</p>

of the <hi>Function of Biſhops is Church-Government;</hi> and that the reaſon why the
<hi>word Epiſcopus is uſually applied to Presbytery,</hi> was becauſe Church-Governors had <hi>then
another title of greater eminency, to wit, that of Apoſtles,</hi> until the <hi>Government of the
Church came into the hands of their Succeſſors,</hi> and then <hi>the names were by common uſage
very ſoon appropriated, that of</hi> Epiſcopus <hi>to Eccleſiaſtical Governors, that of</hi> Presbyter <hi>to
the ordinary Miniſtrrs:</hi> This aſſertion Your Majeſty is pleaſed to make without any
demonſtration; for whom the Scripture calls Presbyters, Rulers, and Paſtors, and
Teachers, it calls Governors, and commits to them the charge of feeding and inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we have proved, and that without any mention of Church-Government pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to a Biſhop. We deny not but ſome of the Fathers have conceived the notion that
Biſhops were called Apoſtles, till the names of <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> became appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate;
which is either an alluſion or conceit, without Evidence of Scripture; for
while the Function was one, the names were not divided; when the Function was
divided, the name was divided alſo, and indeed impropriate; but we that look for the
ſame warrant for the diviſion of an Office as for the Conſtitution, cannot find that this
appropriation of names was made till afterwards, or in proceſs of time, as <hi>Theodore</hi> (one of
the Fathers of this conceit) affirms, whoſe ſaying, when it is run out of the pale of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
time, we can no further follow. From which premiſſes laid all together, we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:60710:325"/>
the clearneſs of our aſſertion, that in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> a Biſhop di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from a Presbyter in <hi>Qualification, Ordination, Office</hi> or <hi>Dignity,</hi> is not found: the
contrary whereof though Your Majeſty ſaith that You have ſeen confirmed by <hi>great
variety of credible Teſtimony,</hi> yet we believe thoſe Teſtimonies are rather ſtrong in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than in demonſtrating the Scripture-Original of a Biſhop, which is declared againſt
by a cloud of Witneſſes, named in the latter end of our former Anſwer, unto which we

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> We ſaid that the Apoſtles were the higheſt Order of Officers of the Church; that
they were extraordinary; that they were diſtinguiſht from all other Officers; and that
their Government was not <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> but <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi> To which Anſwer Your Majeſty,
being not ſatisfied, doth oppoſe certain Aſſertions, That <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi>
received their <hi>Authority</hi> by <hi>Miſſion,</hi> their <hi>Ability</hi> by <hi>Vnction;</hi> That <hi>the Miſſion of the
Apoſtles was ordinary, and to continue to the end of the World; but the Vnction, whereby they
were enabled to both Offices and Functions,</hi> Teaching and Governing, <hi>was indeed extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;</hi>
That in their <hi>Vnction</hi> they were <hi>not neceſſarily to have Succeſſors,</hi> but <hi>neceſſarily</hi>
in their <hi>Miſſion</hi> or Office of Teaching and Governing; That <hi>in theſe two ordinary Offices,
their ordinary Succeſſors are Presbyters and Biſhops;</hi> That <hi>Presbyters</hi> qua <hi>Presbyters, do
immediately ſucceed them in the Office of Teaching, and Biſhops</hi> qua <hi>Biſhops immediately in
the Office of Governing:</hi> the demonſtration of which laſt alone would have carried in it
more conviction than all theſe Aſſertions put together. Officers are diſtinguiſhed by
that whereby they are conſtituted, their Commiſſion, which being produced ſigned by
one place of Scripture, gives ſurer evidence than a Pedigree drawn forth by ſuch <hi>a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of diſtinctions as do not diſtinguiſh him</hi> into another Officer from a Presbyter. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this chain of diſtinction be ſtrong, and the links of it ſufficiently tackt together, we
crave leave to examine. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith Your Majeſty, was the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of our
Souls, and he made the Apoſtles both Apoſtles and Biſhops. We do not conceive that
Your Majeſty means that the Apoſtles ſucceeded Chriſt as the chief Apoſtle, and that
as Biſhops they ſucceed Chriſt as a Biſhop, leſt thereby Chriſt his <hi>Miſſion</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
and <hi>Biſhop</hi> might be conceived as ordinary as their <hi>Miſſion</hi> is ſaid to be; but we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Your Majeſty to mean, that the Office of <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> was <hi>eminently</hi> contained
in Chriſts Office, as the Office of a Biſhop was <hi>eminently</hi> contained in that of Apoſtleſhip:
but thence it will not follow that <hi>inferior</hi> Offices being contained in the <hi>ſuperior eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
are therefore exiſtent in it <hi>formally.</hi> For becauſe all <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> are <hi>eminently</hi>
contained in <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> would it therefore follow that Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> is <hi>formally</hi> and
<hi>diſtinctly</hi> a <hi>Baron</hi> of the Realm, as it is aſſerted, the Apoſtles to have been Biſhops in
diſtinct ſenſe? That <hi>Miſſion</hi> refers to Office and Authority, and <hi>Vnction</hi> only to Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we cannot conſent; for beſides that the breathing of Chriſt upon his Diſciples, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> doth refer to <hi>miſſion</hi> as well as <hi>unction;</hi> we conceive that in
the proper <hi>anointing</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> or other Officers, the natural uſe and effect of the oil upon
the body was not ſo much intended, as the <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>ceremonious</hi> uſe of it in the Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. So there is relation to Office in unction, as well as to conferring of abilities;
elſe how are Kings or Prieſts or Prophets ſaid to be anointed? And what good ſenſe
could be made of that expreſſion in Scripture, of anointing one in <hi>anothers</hi> room? To
omit, that Chriſt by this conſtruction ſhould be called the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in reſpect of Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
only. And although we ſhould grant Your Majeſties explication of <hi>Miſſion</hi> and
<hi>Vnction;</hi> yet it will not follow that the <hi>miſſion</hi> of the Apoſtles was ordinary, and their
<hi>unction</hi> only extraordinary. That into which there is ſucceſſion, was ordinary; that
into which there is no ſucceſſion, (for ſucceſſion is not unto abilities or gifts) extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
and ſo the Apoſtles were ordinary Officers in all whereunto there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
any ſucceſſion, and that is <hi>Office.</hi> They differed from Biſhops in that wherein
one Apoſtle or Officer of the ſame order might differ from another, to wit, in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and meaſure of Spirit, but not in that wherein one order of Officers is above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their Office; To which we cannot give conſent. For ſince no man is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
an Officer from his meer abilities or gifts; ſo neither can the Apoſtles be called
extraordinary Officers becauſe of extraordinary gifts: but that the Apoſtles Miſſion and
Office (as their abilities) was extraordinary and temporary, doth appear in that it was by
immediate Commiſſion from Chriſt, without any intervention of men, either in Election
or Ordination, for planting an authoritative governing of all Churches through the
World, comprehending in it all other Officers of the Church whatſoever; and therefore
it ſeems to us very unreaſonable that the Office and Authority of the Apoſtles
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:60710:325"/>
ſhould be drawn down to an ordinary, thereby to make it, as it were, a fit <hi>ſtock</hi> into
which the ordinary Office of a Biſhop may be <hi>ingrafted;</hi> nor doth the continuance of
Teaching and Governing in the Church more render the Office of teaching and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
in the Apoſtles an ordinary Office, than the Office of teaching and governing
in Chriſt himſelf renders his Office therefore ordinary. The reaſon given, That the
Office of Teaching and Governing was ordinary in the Apoſtles, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of them in the Church (we crave leave to ſay) is that great miſtake which
runs through the whole file of Your Majeſties Diſcourſe: for tho there be a Succeſſion in
the <hi>Work</hi> of Teaching and Governing, yet there is no Succeſſion in the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> or
<hi>Office</hi> by which the Apoſtles performed them; for the Office of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> is thence alſo concluded ordinary, as to <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the diſtinction of Offices Extraordinary and Ordinary <hi>eatenus</hi> deſtroyed. The
Succeſſion may be into the ſame <hi>Work,</hi> not into the ſame <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Office:</hi> The
ordinary Officers, which are to manage the work of Teaching and Government, are
conſtituted, ſettled and limited by warrant of Scripture, as by another Commiſſion
than that which the Apoſtles had. And if Your Majeſty had ſhewn us ſome Record
out of Scripture, warranting the diviſion of the Office of Teaching and Governing
into two hands, and the appropriation of Teaching to Presbyters, of Governing to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
the queſtion had been determined; otherwiſe we muſt look upon the diſſolving
of the Apoſtolical Office, and diſtribution of it into theſe two hands, as the dictate
of men who have a mind, by ſuch a precarious Argument, to challenge to themſelves
the <hi>Keys of Authority,</hi> and leave the <hi>Word</hi> to the Presbyters.</p>

to be the main erection of Epiſcopal power, if the proof of their being Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

Your Majeſty <hi>finds very little ſatisfaction, though all that is ſaid therein could be

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, becauſe the</hi> Scriptures no where imply any ſuch thing at all, <hi>that</hi> Titus <hi>was an</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,
neither doth the text clearly prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo.</p>
                     <p>1. The name of <hi>Biſhop the Scripture neither expreſsly nor by implication gives to
either;</hi> the work which they are injoyned to do is common to Apoſtles, Evangeliſts,
Paſtors and Teachers, and cannot of it ſelf make a character of one diſtinct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Office: But that there was ſuch an Order of <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church as <hi>Evangeliſts</hi>
reckoned amongſt the <hi>extraordinary</hi> and temporary Offices, and that <hi>Timothy</hi> was one
of that Order, and that both <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not ordained to one particular
Church, but were companions and fellow-Labourers with the Apoſtles, ſent abroad
to ſeveral Churches as occaſion did require; it is (as we humbly conceive) clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in Scripture, and not denied by the learned defenders of Epiſcopal Government,
nor (as we remember) by <hi>Scultetus</hi> himſelf, during the time of their travels.</p>

any Text of Scripture that the Office of Evangeliſt is ſuch as we have deſcribed, his work
ſeeming,</hi> 11 Tim. VIII. 4, 5. <hi>to be nothing elſe but diligence in preaching the word, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all impediments and oppoſitions;</hi> we humbly anſwer, that <hi>exact definitions</hi>
of theſe or other Church-Officers are hard to be found in any Text of Scripture, but
by comparing one place of Scripture with another, it may be proved as well what
they were, as what the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> were, the deſcription by us given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Character made up by <hi>collation</hi> of Scriptures; from which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth
not much vary, ſaying, that <hi>Evangeliſts were Presbyters of principal ſufficiency, whom the
Apostles ſent abroad and uſed as Agents in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, whereſoever they ſaw need.</hi>
And that <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> were ſettled in ſome certain charge, and <hi>thereby</hi> differed
from <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whoſe work that it ſhould be nothing but diligence in preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which is common to Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, and ſo not diſtinctive
of this particular Office, argueth to us, that as the Apoſtles Office was divided into
Epiſcopal and Apoſtolical, ſo this alſo is to be divided into Epiſcopal and Evangeliſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
Ordination and Cenſures belonging to <hi>Timothy</hi> as to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and diligence in
Preaching only being left to the <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> which diviſion (as we humbly conceive)
is not warranted by the Scripture.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly, Your Majeſty faith, that</hi> that which we ſo confidently affirm of <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> their acting as Evangelists, is by ſome <hi>denied</hi> and <hi>refuted,</hi> yea even with ſcorn
<hi>rejected</hi> by ſome rigid Presbyterians; and that which we ſo confidently deny, that <hi>they</hi>
were Biſhops, is <hi>confirmed</hi> by the conſentient testimony of all antiquity, recorded by <hi>Jerome</hi>
himſelf that they were Biſhops of <hi>Paul</hi>'s ordination, <hi>acknowledged</hi> by very many late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<hi>and that a</hi> Catalogue of 27 <hi>Biſhops of Epheſus</hi> lineally ſucceeding from <hi>Timothy,</hi>
out of good Record, is vouched by Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> and other Writers.</p>
                     <p>Our confidence (as Your Majeſty is pleaſed to call it) was in our Anſwer expreſt
in theſe words, <hi>We cannot ſay that</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were Biſhops in the ſenſe of Your
Majeſty, but extraordinary Officers or Evangeliſts:</hi> in which opinion we were then clear,
not out of a total ignorance of thoſe Teſtimonies which might be alleged againſt it,
but from intrinſick arguments out of Scripture, from which Your Majeſty hath not
produced any one to the contrary. Nor is our confidence weakned by ſuch replies as
theſe, The <hi>Scripture</hi> never calls them Biſhops, but the <hi>Fathers</hi> do; The <hi>Scripture</hi> calls
<hi>Timothy</hi> an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> ſome of late have refuted it and rejected it with ſcorn; The
<hi>Scripture</hi> relates their motions from Church to Church, but <hi>ſome affirm</hi> them to be fixed
at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and in <hi>Crete;</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> makes diſtinction of Evangeliſts and Paſtors,
but <hi>ſome</hi> ſay that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were both. We cannot give Your Majeſty a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
account of <hi>Scultetus</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Arguments, but do believe that Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy</hi> and
<hi>Rutherford</hi> are able with greater ſtrength to refute that opinion of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
their being <hi>Biſhops,</hi> than they do (if they do) with ſcorn reject this of their being
<hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> As for <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> and <hi>Catalogues,</hi> tho we undervalue them not, yet Your
Majeſty will be pleaſed to allow us the uſe of our Reaſon, ſo far as not to erect an
Office in the Church which is not found in Scripture, upon <hi>general appellations</hi> or <hi>titles,</hi>
and <hi>alluſions</hi> frequently found in the Fathers, eſpecially when they ſpeak <hi>vulgarly,</hi> and
not as to a point in debate; for even <hi>Jerome,</hi> who, as Your Majeſty ſaith, doth record
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were made <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ordination, doth,
when he ſpeaks to the point between Your Majeſty and us, give the Biſhops to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that they are ſuperior to Presbyters <hi>conſuetudine magis quam Dominicoe veritatis
diſpoſitione.</hi> For <hi>Catalogues,</hi> their credit reſts upon the firſt witneſſes, from whom they
are reported by <hi>tradition</hi> from hand to hand, whoſe writings are many times <hi>ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
dubious,</hi> or not <hi>extant:</hi> beſides that theſe <hi>Catalogues</hi> do reſolve themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> as the firſt <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as the catalogue of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into the
<hi>Apoſtle James,</hi> that of <hi>Antioch</hi> into <hi>Peter,</hi> that of <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> into <hi>Mark,</hi> that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> into <hi>Timothy;</hi> which Apoſtles and Evangeliſts
can neither themſelves be degraded by being made Biſhops, nor be ſucceeded in their
proper Calling or Office: and it is eaſie for us to proceed the ſame way, and to find
many ancient rites and cuſtoms generally received in the Church (counted by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<hi>Apoſtolical traditions</hi>) as near the Apoſtles times as Biſhops, which yet are confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
not of <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi> And further, if <hi>Timothy</hi> and the reſt that are <hi>firſt</hi> in
the <hi>catalogue</hi> were Biſhops with ſuch ſole Power of Ordination and Cenſures as is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how came their pretended Succeſſors, who were but <hi>primi Presbyterorum</hi> (as the
Fathers themſelves call them) to loſe ſo much Epiſcopal power as was in their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
and as was not recovered in 300 years? And therefore we cannot upon any thing
yet ſaid recede from that of our Saviour, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ſic,</hi> from the beginning it
was not ſo.</p>

ſo when the <hi>firſt Epiſtle</hi> was ſent to him, in which he is pretended to receive the charge

that after this Epiſtle ſent to him he was in continual Journeys, or abſent from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for we find that <hi>after all this,</hi> towards the end of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s life, after his

the affairs of Chriſt in ſeveral Churches and places,</hi> the ſilence of the Scriptures
as touching his being Biſhop of any one Church, you will acknowledg that ſuch a man
was not a Biſhop fixed to one Church or Precinct; and then by aſſuming that <hi>Timothy</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The like concluſion may be inferred from the like premiſſes from the inſtance of

And ſo we hope Your Majeſty doth conceive, that we affirm not upon very <hi>weak proofs</hi>
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were from <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> removed to other places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> In the fifth exception Your Majeſty takes notice of two places of Scripture cited by
us, to prove that they were called away from thoſe places of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> which
they do not conclude much of themſelves, yet being accompanied by <hi>two other places</hi>
which Your Majeſty takes no notice of, may ſeem to conclude more, and theſe i <hi>Tim.</hi>
i. 3. <hi>Titus</hi> i. 5. as, <hi>I be ſought thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus; for this cauſe left I thee in Crete:</hi>
in both which is ſpecified the <hi>occaſional employment</hi> for which they made ſtay in thoſe
places: and the expreſſions uſed, <hi>I beſought thee to abide still at Epheſus, I left thee in
Crete,</hi> do not ſound like words of <hi>inſtalment</hi> of a man into a Biſhoprick, but of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment</hi>
to call them away again; and if the firſt and laſt be put together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
revocation</hi> of them both, the <hi>intimation</hi> of his intention that they ſhould not ſtay
there for continuance, and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of his beſeeching the one to ſtay, and of his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other behind him, which was ſome preſent defects and diſtempers in thoſe
Churches, they will put fair to prove that the Apoſtle <hi>intended not</hi> to eſtabliſh them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of thoſe places, and therefore <hi>did not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Postſcripts;</hi> becauſe your Majeſty <hi>lays no great weight upon them,</hi> we ſhall
not be ſolicitous in producing evidence againſt them, though they do bear witneſs in
a matter of fact which in our opinion <hi>never was,</hi> and in Your Majeſties Judgment <hi>was
long before they were born.</hi> And ſo we conclude this diſcourſe about <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
with this obſervation, that in the ſame very Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> out of which
Your Majeſty hath endeavoured to prove that he was a Biſhop, and did exerciſe Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Government, there is clear evidence both for Presbyters <hi>impoſing hands</hi> in Ordination,
and for their <hi>Ruling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> In the next point, concerning the Angels of the Churches, tho Your Majeſty faith
that <hi>you lay no weight upon the</hi> Allegory <hi>or</hi> Myſtery <hi>of the denomination,</hi> yet you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
that the perſons bearing that name were <hi>perſonae ſingulares,</hi> and, in a word, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;</hi>
                        <pb n="628" facs="tcp:60710:327"/>
who yet are never ſo called in Scripture; and the allegorical denomination of
Angels or Stars, which in the Judgment of ancient and modern Writers doth belong
to the faithful Miniſters and Preachers of the Word in general, is appropriate (as we
may ſo ſay) to the <hi>Mitre</hi> and <hi>Croſier-ſtaff,</hi> and ſo oppoſed to many expreſs teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture. And if Your Majeſty had been particular in that, wherein You ſay
the <hi>ſtrength of Your inſtance lies,</hi> viz. <hi>the Judgment of all ancient and of the beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writers, and many probabilities in the Text it ſelf,</hi> we hope to have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that many ancient and eminent modern Writers, many probabilitirs out of the
Text it ſelf, do give evidence to the contrary. To that which is aſſerted, That theſe
ſingular perſons were Biſhops in diſtinct ſenſe, whether we brought any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to infirm this, we humbly ſubmit to Your Majeſties Judgment, and ſhall only
preſent to You, that in Your Reply You have not taken notice of that which in our
Anſwer ſeems to us of moment, which is this, That in <hi>Myſterious</hi> and <hi>prophetick wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
or <hi>viſional repreſentation</hi> (ſuch as this of the Stars and golden Candleſticks is)
a <hi>number</hi> of <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> is uſually expreſt in <hi>ſingulars:</hi> and this in Viſions is
the uſual way of Repreſentation of things; <hi>a thouſand perſons</hi> making up one Church,
is repreſented by one <hi>Candleſtick; many Miniſters</hi> making up one <hi>Presbytery,</hi> by one
<hi>Angel.</hi> And becauſe Your Majeſty ſeems to call upon us to be particular, though
we cannot name the <hi>Angels,</hi> nor are ſatisfied in our judgment, that thoſe whom ſome
do undertake to name were intended by the name of <hi>Angels</hi> in thoſe Epiſtles; yet we
ſay, Firſt, that theſe Epiſtles were ſent unto the Churches, and that under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>this thou doſt,</hi> or <hi>this thou hast,</hi> and <hi>the like,</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> are reſpectively
intended; for the <hi>Sins reproved,</hi> the <hi>Repentance commanded,</hi> the <hi>Puniſhments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
ate to be referred to the Churches, and not to the ſingular <hi>Angels</hi> only: and yet
we do not think that <hi>Salmaſius</hi> did intend, nor do we, that in formal denomination the
<hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Candleſticks</hi> were the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Angels</hi> of theſe Churches or <hi>Rulers</hi> were a <hi>Collective body,</hi> which we
endeavoured to prove by ſuch probabilities as Your Majeſty takes no notice of, namely,
the inſtance of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where there were many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom the
charge of that Church was by St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his <hi>final departure</hi> from them committed; as
alſo by that expreſſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 24. <hi>To you and to the reſt in Thyatira:</hi> Which diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
makes it very probable that the <hi>Angel</hi> is explained under that <hi>plurality, to you.</hi> The
like to which many expreſſions may be found in theſe <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which to interpret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the conſentient Evidence of other Scriptures of the New Teſtament is not
Safe only, but Solid and Evidential.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe Writings are directed as Epiſtolary Letters to <hi>Collective Bodies</hi>
uſually are, (that is) to <hi>One,</hi> but intended to <hi>the Body:</hi> which Your Majeſty illuſtrateth
by Your ſending a Meſſage to Your Two Houſes, and directing it to the <hi>Speaker of
the Houſe of Peers:</hi> which as it doth not hinder (we confeſs) but that the <hi>Speaker is
one ſingle Perſon;</hi> ſo it doth not prove at all that the Speaker is <hi>always the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
or if he were, that therefore becauſe Your Meſſage is directed to him, he is the
<hi>Governour</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi> of the two Houſes in the leaſt. And ſo Your Majeſty hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
clear inſtance, that tho theſe Letters be directed to the <hi>Angels,</hi> yet that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they might neither be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor yet <hi>perpetual Moderators.</hi> For the
ſeveral opinions ſpecified in Your Majeſties Paper, <hi>three</hi> of them, by eaſy and fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
(as we declared before) are ſoon reduced and united amongſt themſelves,
and may be holden without <hi>receſs</hi> from the received Judgment of the Chriſtian
Church, by ſuch as are far from meriting that Aſperſion which is caſt upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Divines</hi> by Popiſh Writers, that they have divided themſelves from the
Common and received Judgment of the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> which Imputation, we
hope, was not in Your Majeſties intention to lay upon us, until it be made clear that
it is the common and received Judgment of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> that <hi>now is,</hi> or of that
in <hi>former Ages,</hi> that the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches were Biſhops, having Prelacy as well
over Paſtors as People within their Churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> In the following Diſcourſe we did deny that the Apoſtles were to have any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
in their Office, and affirmed only <hi>Two Orders</hi> of <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ſtanding Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
in the Church, <hi>viz. Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Concerning the former of which
Your Majeſty refers to what you had in part already declared; That in <hi>thoſe things
which were extraordinary</hi> in the Apoſtles, <hi>as namely the Meaſure of their Gifts,</hi> &amp;c.
They <hi>had no Succeſſors</hi> in eundem gradum; <hi>but in thoſe things which were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
as the Office of Teaching</hi> and <hi>Power of Governing (which are neceſſary
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:60710:327"/>
for the Service of the Church in all times) they were to have, and had, Succeſſors.</hi> Where
Your Majeſty delivers a Doctrine new to us; namely, that the Apoſtles had Succeſſors
into their <hi>Offices,</hi> not into their <hi>Abilities:</hi> For (beſides that <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is not properly
into <hi>Abilities,</hi> but into <hi>Office,</hi> we cannot ſay that one ſucceeds another in his Learning,
or Wit, or Parts, but into his Room and Function) we conceive that the Office Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
was extraordinary <hi>in whole,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was ſo, and the
ſervice or work of Teaching and Governing being to continue in all times, doth not
render their Office <hi>Ordinary;</hi> as the Office of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not rendered Ordinary,
becauſe many works of Government exerciſed by him were re-committed to the <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elders</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if they have Succeſſors, it muſt be either into their <hi>whole Office,</hi>
or into ſome <hi>parts.</hi> Their Succeſſors into the <hi>whole</hi> (however differing from them in
meaſure of Gifts and peculiar Qualifications) muſt be called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>ſame Office</hi>
gives the <hi>ſame Denomination;</hi> and then we ſhall confeſs that Biſhops, if they be their
Succeſſors in Office, are of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtolical Office <hi>was ſo.</hi> If
their Succeſſors come into part of their Office only, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> may as well be
called their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> as the Biſhops, and ſo indeed they are called by ſome of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers, <hi>Irenoeus, Origen, Hierome</hi> and others. Whereas in truth the Apoſtles have
not properly Succeſſors into Office, but the ordinary Power of Teaching and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(which is ſetled in the Church for continuance) is inſtituted and ſettled in the
hands of ordinary Officers by a <hi>New Warrant</hi> and Commiſſion, according to the rules
of <hi>Ordination</hi> and Calling in the Word, which the Biſhop hath not yet produced for
himſelf, and without which he cannot challenge it upon the general alluſive Speeches
uſed by the Fathers without ſcruple.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> And whereas Your Majeſty numbers the extent of their work amongſt thoſe
things which were <hi>extraordinary</hi> in the Apoſtles; we could wiſh that You had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
whether it belong to their <hi>Miſſion</hi> or <hi>Vnction:</hi> for we humbly conceive, that their
Authoritative Power to do their Work in <hi>all places</hi> of the World did properly belong
to their <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and conſequently that their <hi>Office</hi> as well as their <hi>Abilities</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;
and ſo by Your <hi>Majeſties own Conceſſion</hi> not to be ſucceeded into by the

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> As to the Orders of ſtanding Officers of the Church, Your Majeſty doth reply, That
<hi>although in the places cited,</hi> Phil. i. 1. i Tim. iii. 8. <hi>there be no mention but of the two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
only of Biſhops or Presbyters, and Deacons, yet it is not thereby proved that there is
no other standing Office in the Church beſides:</hi> Which we humbly conceive is juſtly
proved, not only becauſe there are no other named, but becauſe there is no rule of
Ordaining any <hi>third,</hi> no Warrant or <hi>way of Miſſion;</hi> and ſo Argument is as good
as can be made, <hi>a non cauſa ad non effectum:</hi> for we do not yet apprehend that the
Biſhops pretending to the Apoſtolick Office do alſo pretend to the ſame manner
of <hi>Miſſion;</hi> nor do we know that thoſe very many Divines that have aſſerted <hi>two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
only,</hi> have concluded it from any other grounds than the Scriptures cited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> There appear (<hi>as your Majeſty ſaith</hi>) two other manifeſt Reaſons why <hi>the Office of</hi>
Biſhops might not be ſo proper to be mentioned in thoſe places. <hi>And we humbly conceive
there is a third more manifeſt than thoſe two,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe</hi> it was not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> The <hi>one</hi> Reaſon given by Your Majeſty is, <hi>becauſe in the Churches which the Apostles
themſelves planted, they placed</hi> Presbyters <hi>under them for the Office of</hi> Teaching, but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in their</hi> own hands <hi>the Power of</hi> Governing <hi>thoſe Churches, for a</hi> longer <hi>or</hi> ſhorter
<hi>time, before they ſet Biſhops over them.</hi> Which, under Your Majeſties favour, is not ſo
much a reaſon why <hi>Biſhops are not mentioned</hi> to be in thoſe places, as that they indeed
were not. The variety of Reaſons (may we ſay? or Conjectures) rendred why
Biſhops were not ſet up at <hi>firſt,</hi> as namely, becauſe <hi>fit men</hi> could not be ſo ſoon found
out, which is <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his reaſon; or for remedy of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is <hi>Jerome</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
or becauſe the Apoſtles ſaw it not <hi>expedient,</hi> which is Your Majeſties reaſon; doth
ſhew that this Cauſe labours under a manifeſt weakneſs. For the Apoſtles reſerving in their
own hands the power of Governing, we grant it, they could no more deveſt themſelves
of power of Governing, than (as Dr. <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſaith) they could loſe their Apoſtleſhip:
had they ſet no Biſhops in all Churches, they had no more parted with their power of
Governing than they did in ſetting up the Presbyters; for we have proved that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
being called <hi>Rulers, Governors, Biſhops,</hi> had the power of Governing in <hi>Ordinary</hi>
                        <pb n="630" facs="tcp:60710:328"/>
committed to them, as well as the Office of <hi>Teaching,</hi> and that <hi>both the Keys</hi> (as they
are called) being by our Saviour committed into <hi>one hand,</hi> were not by the Apoſtle
divided into <hi>two.</hi> Nor do we ſee how the Apoſtle could reaſonably commit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church to the <hi>Presbyters of Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20. and yet reſerve the
power of Governing (<hi>viz.</hi> in Ordinary) in his own hands, who took <hi>his ſolemn leave
of them, as never to ſee their faces more.</hi> As concerning that part of the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which for diſtinction ſake, may be called <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> and which is one of
the three fore-mentioned things challenged by the Biſhops, <hi>viz. giving Rules,</hi> the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of it in the Apoſtles hands hindred not but that, in Your Majeſties Judgment,
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle gives <hi>Rules</hi>
for <hi>Ordering</hi> and <hi>Governing</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Nor is there any more reaſon that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
reſerving that part of the Power of Governing which is called <hi>Executive</hi> in ſuch
caſes and upon ſuch occaſions as they thought meet, ſhould hinder the ſetting up of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
if they had intended it; and therefore the reſerving of Power in their <hi>hands</hi>
can be no greater reaſon why they did not ſet us Biſhops <hi>at the firſt,</hi> than that <hi>they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did.</hi> And ſince (by Your Majeſties Conceſſion) the Presbyters were plac'd by
the Apoſtles <hi>first,</hi> in the Churches by them planted, and that with Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we prove by Scripture; You muſt prove the <hi>ſuper-inſtitution</hi> of a Biſhop over
the Presbyters by the Apoſtles in ſome after-times, or elſe we muſt conclude that the
Biſhop got both his Name and Power of Government out of the Presbyters hand, as
the <hi>Tree in the wall</hi> roots out the ſtones by little and little as it ſelf grows.</p>
                     <p>As touching <hi>Philippi,</hi> where Your Majeſty ſaith it <hi>may be probable there was yet no
Biſhop,</hi> it is certain there <hi>were many</hi> like them, who were alſo at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to whom if
only the Office of Teaching did belong, they had the moſt <hi>laborious</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi>
part, that which was leſs honourable being reſerved in the Apoſtles hands, and the
Churches left in the mean time without ordinary Government.</p>

                        <hi>The other Reaſon given why only two Orders are mentioned in thoſe places is,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he wrote in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to them that were Biſhops, <hi>ſo</hi> there
was no need to write any thing concerning the Choice or Qualification of any other ſort of
Officers than ſuch as belonged to their Ordination or Inſpection; which were <hi>Presbyters</hi> and
<hi>Deacons</hi> only, and no <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> The former Reaſon why only two Orders are mentioned in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi>
was, becauſe <hi>there was yet no Biſhop;</hi> this latter Reaſon why the ſame two only
are mentioned in theſe Epiſtles, is, becauſe there was <hi>no Biſhop to be Ordained.</hi> We
might own the reaſon for good, if there may be found any rule for the Ordination of
the other Order of Biſhops in ſome other place of Scripture: but if the <hi>Ordination can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found,</hi> how ſhould we <hi>find the Order?</hi> And it is reaſonable to think that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in the Chapter formerly alledged, i <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. where he paſſes immediately from the
Biſhop to the Deacon, would have diſtinctly expreſt, or at leaſt hinted, what ſort of
Biſhops he meant, whether the <hi>Biſhop over Presbyters,</hi> or the <hi>Presbyter-Biſhop,</hi> to have
avoided the confuſion of the Name, and to have ſet as it were ſome matk of difference
in the <hi>Eſcocheon</hi> of the <hi>Presbyter-Biſhop,</hi> if there had been ſome other Biſhop <hi>of a
higher houſe.</hi> And whereas Your Majeſty ſaith, there was no need to write to them
about a Biſhop in a diſtinct ſenſe, who belonged not to their Ordination and Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
we conceive that in Your Majeſties judgment, Biſhops might then have Ordained
Biſhops like themſelves; for there was then no <hi>Canon</hi> forbidding one ſingle Biſhop to
ordain another of his own rank; and there being <hi>many Cities</hi> in <hi>Crete, Titus</hi> might
have found it expedient (as thoſe ancient Fathers that call him Arch-biſhop think he
did) to have ſet up Biſhops in ſome of thoſe Cities. So that. this Reaſon fights againſt
the Principles of thoſe that hold <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been Biſhops. For our part, we
believe that theſe Rules belonged not to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with ſtrict limitation to <hi>Epheſus</hi>
and <hi>Crete,</hi> but reſpectively to all the places or Churches where they might come, and
to all that ſhall at any time have the Office of Ordaining and Governing; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the ſame Chapter, i <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 14, 15. <hi>Theſe things I have written unto thee,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>that thou mayest know how to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church.</hi>
And therefore if there had been any proper Character or Qualification of a Biſhop di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from a Presbyter, if any <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Office;</hi> we think the Apoſtle would have
ſignified it; but becauſe he did not, we conclude (and the more ſtrongly from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
of Your Majeſties two Reaſons) that there are <hi>only two Orders of Officers,</hi>
and conſequently that a Biſhop is not ſuperior to a Presbyter: for we find not (as we
ſaid in our Anſwer) that one Officer is ſuperior to another who is of the ſame Order.</p>

through thoſe Hiſtorical darkneſſes, and ſo make up their of <hi>Catalogues</hi> very much from
<hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Reports,</hi> which can give no great Evidence, becauſe they agree not

the <hi>nearer</hi> they come to the Apoſtles times (wherein they ſhould be moſt of all clear,
to eſtabliſh the Succeſſion firm and clear <hi>at firſt</hi>) the more <hi>doubtful, uncertain,</hi> and indeed
<hi>contradictory</hi> to one another, are the Teſtimonies. Some ſay that <hi>Clemens</hi> was <hi>firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Peter;</hi> ſome ſay the <hi>third:</hi> and intricacies about the Order of
Succeſſion in <hi>Linus, Anacletus, Clemens,</hi> and another called <hi>Cletus</hi> (as ſome affirm)
are inextricable. Some ſay that <hi>Titus</hi> was <hi>Biſhop of Crete;</hi> ſome ſay, <hi>Arch-Biſhop;</hi>
and ſome, <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> Some ſay that <hi>Timothy</hi> was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and ſome
ſay that <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> at the ſametime. Some ſay that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was the

<hi>Ariſto</hi> was firſt. Some ſay that <hi>Alexandria</hi> had but <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> and other Cites <hi>two;</hi>
and others, that there was but <hi>one Biſhop</hi> of <hi>one City</hi> at the ſame time. And how
ſhould thoſe <hi>Catalogues</hi> be unqueſtionable, which muſt be made up out of Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that fight one with another? We confeſs that the Ancient Fathers, <hi>Tertullian,
Irenoeus,</hi> &amp;c. made uſe of Succeſſion as an Argument againſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> or Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to prove that they had the <hi>traduces Apostolici ſeminis,</hi> and that the Godly and

in <hi>Office;</hi> which, according to the <hi>Catalogues,</hi> reſolves it ſelf into ſome <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or
<hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> as the firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of ſuch a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> who (as we conceive) could not

may vary, or be miſtaken, in the order, or times, or names of thoſe perſons that
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:60710:329"/>
ſucceeded the Apoſtles, yet all agree that there was a Succeſſion of <hi>ſome</hi> perſons; and
ſo though the credit of the Catalogues be <hi>infirmed,</hi> yet the thing intended is <hi>confirmed</hi>
thereby. We grant that a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of men to feed and govern thoſe Churches while
they continued Churches, cannot be denied, and that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
that planted and watered thoſe Churches, (though extraordinary and temporary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers)
were by Eccleſiaſtical Writers, in <hi>compliance with the Language and uſage of

in the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of the Cities or Churches, called by ſuch Writers as wrote after
the <hi>diviſion</hi> or <hi>diſtinction</hi> of the names of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But that thoſe <hi>firſt</hi>

(mentioned by Your Majeſty) in their own hand; it will follow, that all

<hi>our old fallacy, from the</hi> promiſcuous <hi>uſe of the words to infer the indiſtinction of the things;</hi>
we refer our ſelves to <hi>himſelf</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> now in all mens hands, whoſe Teſtimony
we think cannot be eluded but by the old Artifice of <hi>hiding the Biſhop under the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
name:</hi> for they that have read his whole Epiſtle, and have conſidered that himſelf
is called a Biſhop, <hi>may doubt of Clement</hi>'s opinion concerning the diſtinct Offices of
<hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or rather <hi>not doubt</hi> of it, if only his own Epiſtle may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panel'd
upon the Inqueſt. Concerning <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles, Your Majeſty is pleaſed to
uſe ſome earneſtneſs of <hi>expreſſion,</hi> charging ſome of late, without any regard of <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity</hi>
or <hi>truth,</hi> out of their partial diſaffection to Biſhops, to have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to diſcredit his Writings. One of thoſe cited by us cannot (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
be ſuſpected of <hi>diſaffection</hi> to <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and there are great Arguments
drawn out of thoſe Epiſtles themſelves, betraying their <hi>inſincerity,</hi> adulterate <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and <hi>interpolations;</hi> ſo that <hi>Ignatius</hi> cannot be diſtinctly known in <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
And if we take him <hi>in groſs,</hi> we make him the <hi>Patron</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> and the reſt of the
Popiſh Writers do) of ſuch rites and obſervations as the Church in his time cannot be
thought to have owned. He doth indeed give teſtimony to the <hi>Prelacy</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi>
above a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> that which may juſtly render him ſuſpected is, that he <hi>gives too much.
Honour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Biſhop,</hi> as God's high Prieſt, and <hi>after him</hi> you muſt honour

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> That which Your Majeſty ſaith in Your fourth Paragraph, that <hi>we might have added,
(if we had pleaſed) That</hi> James, Timothy, Titus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were <hi>constituted and ordained
Biſhops of the</hi> forementioned places reſpectively, and that <hi>all</hi> the Biſhops of thoſe times
were reputed <hi>Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their Epiſcopal Office;</hi> we could not have added
it without prejudice (as we humbly conceive) to the truth: for the Apoſtles did
not ordain <hi>any of themſelves Biſhops,</hi> nor could they do it, for even by Your Majeſties
Conceſſion they were Biſhops <hi>before, viz.</hi> as they were <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> nor could any Apoſtle
his choice of a <hi>certain Region</hi> or place to exerciſe his function in whilſt he pleaſed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him a Biſhop any more, than <hi>Paul</hi> was Biſhop of the <hi>Gentiles, Peter</hi> of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi>
Neither did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ordain the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> Biſhops of thoſe places unto
which they ſent them; nor were the Biſhops of thoſe times any more than, as Your
Majeſty ſaith, <hi>reputed Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their Epiſcopal Office;</hi> they <hi>came after</hi>
the Apoſtles in the Churches by them planted, ſo might <hi>Presbyters</hi> do. But that's not
properly <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> at leaſt not ſucceſſion <hi>into Office;</hi> and this we ſay with a <hi>Salvo</hi>
to our Aſſertion, That in thoſe times there were no ſuch Biſhops diſtinct from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Neither do we underſtand, whether the <hi>words Epiſcopal Office</hi> in this Section re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> for in reference to <hi>Apostles</hi> it inſinuates a diſtinction of
the Apoſtles Office into <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> or that the Office Apoſtolical was
<hi>wholly</hi> Epiſcopal; unto neither of which we can give our conſent for reaſons
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:60710:329"/>
forementioned. To the teſtimonies by us recited in proof of <hi>two only Orders,</hi>
Your Majeſty anſwers, firſt, That the <hi>promiſcuous uſe</hi> of the <hi>names of Biſhops and
Presbyters</hi> is imported. That which Your Majeſty not long ago called <hi>our old fallacy,</hi>
is now Your Anſwer, only with this <hi>difference:</hi> we under <hi>promiſcuous names</hi> hold the
ſame Office; Your Majeſty under <hi>promiſcuous names</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>two,</hi> which if, as it is often
<hi>aſſerted,</hi> was but once <hi>proved,</hi> we ſhould take it for a <hi>determination</hi> of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
Secondly, that <hi>they relate to a School-point,</hi> or a nicety, <hi>utrum Epiſcopatus fit or do
vel gradus; both ſides</hi> of the <hi>questioniſts</hi> or diſputants <hi>in the mean time acknowledging the
right of Church-government in the Biſhops alone.</hi> It is confeſt by us, that that queſtion
as it is ſtated by <hi>Popiſh Authors</hi> is a <hi>curious nicety,</hi> to which we have no eye or reference;
for though the ſame Officers may <hi>differ</hi> from, and <hi>excel</hi> others of the <hi>ſame order</hi> in
<hi>Gifts</hi> or Qualifications, yet the <hi>Office it ſelf</hi> is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> without <hi>difference</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi>
as one Apoſtle or Presbyter is not ſuperior to another in the degree of Office;
they that are of the ſame Order are of the ſame <hi>degree</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Office,</hi> as having
Power and Authority to the ſame Acts. Nor doth the Scripture warrant or allow any
Superiority of <hi>one over another</hi> of the <hi>ſame Order;</hi> and therefore the proving of <hi>two Orders
only</hi> in the Church is a <hi>demonſtration</hi> that Presbyters and Biſhops are the ſame. In which
point the Scripture will counter-balance the teſtimonies of thoſe that aſſert <hi>three degrees</hi>
or <hi>orders,</hi> though <hi>ten</hi> for <hi>one.</hi> But, for eaſing of Your Majeſty of the trouble of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

                     <p>WHat you have offered by way of Reply to His Majeſties Second Paper of
<hi>October</hi> 6. in yours of <hi>October</hi> 17. in order to the further ſatisfaction of His
Conſcience in the point of Epiſcopacy, His Majeſty heard, when it was publickly
read by you, with diligent attention, and hath ſince (ſo far as His leiſure would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
taken the ſame into his private and ſerious Conſideration: Wherein His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
not only acknowledgeth your great Pains and Endeavours to inform His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
acording to ſuch perſwaſions as your ſelves have in the matter in debate; but
alſo taketh ſpecial notice of the Civility of your applications to Him both in the Body
and Concluſion of your Reply: yet He cannot but obſerve withall, that in very many
things you either miſtake His meaning and purpoſe in that Paper, or at leaſt come not
up fully enough thereunto in this Reply. Which to have ſhown, will ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
your preſent Reply to be unſatisfactory in that behalf, without making a
particular Anſwer to every paſſage in it, which to a Paper of that length would require
more time than His Majeſty can think fit (amidſt the preſent weighty affairs) to allow
unto a debate of this nature: Eſpecially ſince His Majeſty hath often found mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of long Anſwers and Replies, to have rather multiplied diſputes by ſtarting new
Queſtions, than informed the Conſcience by removing former Scruples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Scriptures cited in the Margin of His Majeſties firſt Paper.</hi>

 It being granted
by you, that thoſe Scriptures did prove the Apoſtles, and others being ſingle Perſons, to
have exerciſed reſpectively the ſeveral powers in the Paper ſpecified, which powers (by
your own confeſſion in this Reply, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.) a ſingle Perſon who is but a mere Presbyter
hath no right to exerciſe; and it being withall evident that a Biſhop in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſenſe, and as diſtinct from a Presbyter, layeth claim to no more than to a peculiar
right in the exerciſe of ſome or all of the ſaid Powers, which a mere Presbyter hath
not; the Concluſion ſeemeth natural and evident, that ſuch a Power of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as we uſually call <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> is ſufficiently proved by thoſe Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Biſhops Challenge.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Reply, Sect. 3. 4, 5.</note>
 Firſt, when you ſpeak of a Writ of partition, you ſeem to
take His Majeſties words, as if He had ſhared and cantoned out the Epiſcopal Office, one
part to the Biſhops alone, another to the Presbyters alone; and you fall upon the ſame
again afterwards (<hi>Sect.</hi> 6.) Whereas His Majeſties meaning was, and by His words ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
ſo to have been, that one part of the Office (that of <hi>Teaching,</hi> &amp;c.) was to be
common to both alike; but the other part (that of <hi>Governing Churches</hi>) peculiar to the
Biſhop alone.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you infer from His Majeſties words, That the <hi>Biſhops Challenge appeareth
to be grown to more than was formerly pretended to.</hi> Which inference His Majeſties words
by you truly cited, if rightly underſtood, will not bear. For having proved from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the power of Church-Government in all the three mentioned Particulars to have
been exerciſed by the Apoſtles and others; His Majeſty ſaid but this only, That <hi>the
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:60710:330"/>
Biſhops challenge no more or other power to belong unto them, in reſpect of their Epiſcopal
Office, than what properly falleth under one of theſe three.</hi> The Words are true; for he
that believeth they challenge not ſo much, might ſafely ſay they challenge no more.
But the Inference is not good; For he that ſaith they challenge no more, doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
imply they challenge all that. In the power of Ordination, which is purely
ſpiritual, His Majeſty conceiveth the Biſhops challenge to have been much-what the
ſame in all times of the Church; and therefore it is that the matter of <hi>Ordination</hi> is
moſt inſiſted on, as the moſt conſtant and moſt evident difference between Biſhops and
Presbyters, eſpecially after the times of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which His Majeſty by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> taketh to be the ſame you call the times of <hi>Grown Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</hi>
But His Majeſty ſeeth no neceſſity that the Biſhops challenge to the power of
Juriſdiction ſhould be at all times as large as the exerciſe thereof appeareth at ſome times
to have been; the exerciſe thereof being variable according to the various conditions of
the Church in different times. And therefore His Majeſty doth not believe that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
under Chriſtian Princes do challenge ſuch an amplitude of Juriſdiction to belong
unto them in reſpect of their Epiſcopal Office preciſely, as was exerciſed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times by Biſhops before the days of <hi>Constantine.</hi> The reaſon of the difference being
evident, That in thoſe former times under Pagan Princes the Church was a diſtinct
Body of it ſelf, divided from the Commonwealth, and ſo was to be governed by its
own Rules and Rulers; the Biſhops therefore of thoſe times, tho they had no outward
coercive power over mens Perſons or Eſtates, yet inaſmuch as every Chriſtian man, when
he became a Member of the Church, did <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and by that his own voluntary act,
put himſelf under their Government, they exerciſed a very large power of Juriſdiction
in <hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> in making Eccleſiaſtical Canons, receiving Accuſations, conventing the
Accuſed, examining Witneſſes, judging of Crimes, excluding ſuch as they found guilty
of ſcandalous offences from the Lord's Supper, enjoyning Penances upon them, caſting
them out of the Church, receiving them again upon their Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this
they exerciſed as well over Presbyters as others. But after that the Church under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes began to be incorporated into the Commonwealth, whereupon there muſt
of neceſſity follow a complication of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Powers, the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Biſhops (in the outward exerciſe of it) was ſubordinate unto and limitable by
the ſupreme Civil power, and hath been, and is at this day, ſo acknowledged by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of this Realm.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you ſeem to affirm in a Parentheſis, as if nothing were <hi>confeſſed to have been
extraordinary in the Apoſtles but their Gifts and Enablements</hi> only; whereas His Majeſty
in that Paper hath in expreſs words named as Extraordinaries alſo, the Extent of their
Charge, and the Infallibility of their Doctrine, without any meaning to exclude thoſe
not named, as their immediate Calling, and if there be any other of like reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, for the Claim to a <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> His Majeſty was willing to decline both the
Term (as being by reaſon of the different acception of it ſubject to miſconſtruction) and
the diſpute, whether by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles. Nevertheleſs, altho His Majeſty ſees no
cauſe to diſlike their opinion who derive the Epiſcopal power originally from Chriſt
himſelf, without whoſe warrant the Apoſtles would not either have exerciſed it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or derived it to others; Yet for that the practice in them is ſo clear and evident,
and the warrant from him expreſt but in general Terms (<hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I
you,</hi> and the like) He choſe rather (as others have done) to fix the claim of the power
upon the practice, as the more evidential way, than upon the warrant, which by reaſon
of the generality of expreſſion would bear more diſpute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Definition of Epiſcopacy.</hi> Firſt, whereas you except againſt it, for that it is
competent to Archiepiſcopal and Patriarchal Government as well as Epiſcopal,<note place="margin">3. Reply, Sect. 6.</note>
 His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
thinketh you might have excepted more juſtly againſt it if it had been otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His Majeſty believeth that even in the perſons by you named. (<hi>Timothy, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and the Angels) the definition in all the parts of it is to be found, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
were all ſingle perſons; that they had their ſeveral peculiar Charges; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their ſeveral precincts they had authority over Presbyters as well as others.</p>
                     <p>Neither, thirdly, doth His Majeſty think it needful that any word be added to the
<hi>Genus</hi> in the definition, or that the Scripture ſhould any where put all the parts of the
definition together. It would be a hard matter to give ſuch a definition of an Apoſtle,
or a Prophet, or an Evangeliſt, or a Presbyter, or a Deacon, or indeed almoſt of any
thing, as that the parts thereof ſhould be found in any place of Scripture put alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="636" facs="tcp:60710:331"/>
Fourthly, His Majeſty conſenteth with you, that the point in iſſue is not the Name or
Work meerly, but the Office, and that it were a Fallacy to argue a particular Office
from a General or Common work: But judgeth withal, that it can be no Fallacy to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
a Particular Office from ſuch a work as is peculiar to that Office, and is as it were
the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> thereof; and therefore no Fallacy from a work done by a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which a ſingle Presbyter hath no right to do, to infer an Office in that perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the Office of a Presbyter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Scriptures cited by you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Reply, Sect. 7.</note>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> Titus 1. Acts xx. 11 Peter v. Firſt, when you
ſay you <hi>take His Majeſties Conceſſion, That in thoſe times of the Church and places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there was no distinct Office of Biſhops and Presbyters;</hi> if you take it ſo, truly you
take it <hi>gratis</hi> (His Majeſty never gave it you:) and you miſtake it too more ways
than one; for, to ſpeak properly, His Majeſty made no Conceſſion at all. It was rather
a Preterition in order to the preſent buſineſs, and to avoid unneceſſary diſputes, which
ought not to be interepreted as an acknowledgement of the Truth of your Expoſitions of
thoſe places. For his own expreſs words are, [<hi>Although His Majeſty be not ſure that the
Proof will reach ſo far in each of thoſe Places.</hi>] Which words plainly evidence, that which
you call His Majeſties Conceſſion to be indeed no Conceſſion, but to have been meant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that form of Speech very uſual in diſputations, <hi>Dato, non Conceſſo.</hi> But in
that Conceſſion, ſuch as it is, His Majeſty is not yet able to imagine what you could
find whereon to ground thoſe words, <hi>That in thoſe times of the Church there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,</hi>
&amp;c. there being not any thing in the whole paſſage that carrieth the leaſt ſound
that way, or that hath relation to any particular times of the Church. Neither is the
Conceſſion ſuch as you take it, as it relateth to thoſe places of Scripture: What His
Majeſty ſaid was <hi>confeſſed on all ſides</hi> (which are the words you take for a Conceſſion)
was but this, That ſuppoſing (but not granting) the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> to be uſed in all
thoſe places <hi>to ſignifie a Presbyter, the Office and Work in thoſe places mentioned as the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Work of a Biſhop, are</hi> (upon that ſuppoſal) the Office and Work of a Presbyter;
which is ſo manifeſt a Truth, that no man without admitting Contradictions can ſay
the contrary. But how wide or ſhort that is from what you make to be His Majeſties
Conceſſion, your ſelves by comparing His words with yours may eaſily judge. But your
ſelves a little after make a Conceſſion which His Majeſty (warned by your example
how ſoon anothers meaning may be miſtaken when his words are altered) is willing to
take in the ſame words you give it, <hi>viz.</hi> When you ſay, and you bring reaſons alſo to
prove it, <hi>That it ſeemeth manifeſt that Ordination and Cenſures are not to be exerciſed by a
ſingle Presbyter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, you repeat your Arguments formerly drawn from thoſe places, and preſs the
ſame from the force of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and from the Circumſtances of
the Text, and otherwiſe; adding withal, that His Majeſty hath waved the notice or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of ſomething by you alledged therein. Hereunto His Majeſty ſaith, that He waved
not any thing in your former Paper for any great difficulty He conceived of anſwering it;
but being deſirous to contract His Anſwer, and knowing to what frailties Arguments
drawn from Names and Words and Conjectural Expoſitions of Scripture are ſubject, He
paſſed by ſuch things as He deemed to be of leaſt Conſideration in order to the end of the
whole Debate, to wit, the ſatisfaction of His Judgement and Conſcience in the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
Otherwiſe His Majeſty could have then told you, That there are who, by the like
Conjectures, grounded (as ſeemeth to them,) upon ſome Probabilities in the Text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
thoſe places in the <hi>Acts</hi> and in St <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> properly ſo called, and in the
reſtrained Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe, rather than of ordinary Presbyters: That ſuppoſing them
both meant of Ordinary Presbyters, the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (which ſignifie to
<hi>feed</hi> and <hi>overſee</hi>) might not unfitly be applied to them as inferior Paſtors, in relation to
their Flocks under their charge and overſight (the Flock being in both the places expreſly
mentioned) which hindreth not, but that the ſame words may in a more particular
manner be appropriated to Biſhops in reſpect of that Authority and overſight they have
even over Presbyters themſelves alſo: That ſtill granting your own interpretation of the
word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in that place to <hi>Titus,</hi> it can prove no more than that the two names in
that place are given to the ſame Function: That from all the Premiſſes in your Paper
there laid together, and ſuppoſed true, His Majeſty doth not conceive it juſtly proved,
That the Office of a Biſhop and Presbyter is wholly the ſame, but at the moſt, That the
Offices were not in thoſe places diſtinguiſhed by thoſe Names.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the <hi>Aſſignment of any particular Qualification, work or duty, unto a Biſhop, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from a Presbyter, by the Scripture, would</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>put this queſtion near to an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue;</hi>
                        <pb n="637" facs="tcp:60710:331"/>
His Majeſty ſhould well have hoped that it might ſoon be brought to a near point,
and that from the evidence of the Epiſtles onely of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein as he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary
expreſſeth the qualification, work, and duty of Presbyters and Deacons, that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
might know what perſons were fit to be ordained unto thoſe Offices; ſo in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given to <hi>Timothy</hi> throughout thoſe Epiſtles, he ſufficiently deſcribeth the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
work and duty of a Biſhop, that <hi>Timothy</hi> might know how to behave himſelf in
the exerciſe of his Epiſcopal Office, as well in Ordaining as in Governing the Church.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſignification of the word <hi>Epiſcopus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5. Reply, Sect. 8.</note>
 the primary ſignification thereof, and
the application of it to Church-Officers, you acknowledge; and that the ſame was after
by Eccleſiaſtical uſage appropriated to Biſhops you deny not: But the diſtinction of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopus
Gregis</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopus Paſtorum</hi> you do not allow. If you diſallow it for the unfitneſs
of the word, as may ſeem by that paſſage, where you ſay that His Majeſty hath ſaid that
<hi>Epiſcopus</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Keeper of Shepherds,</hi> His Majeſty thinketh you might very well have
ſpared that exception: For if there be a perſon that hath the overſight of many Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
under him, there is no more impropriety in giving ſuch a perſon the ſtyle of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus
Paſtorum,</hi> than there is in uſing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or in calling <hi>Doeg</hi> the Maſter
of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Herdſmen. And for the thing it ſelf, it cannot be denied but that the Apoſtles,
and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> (by what claim, ordinary or extraordinary, as to the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it matters not) had the <hi>overſight</hi> and authority over many Paſtors and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
truly and really <hi>Epiſcopi Paſtorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The appropriation of the names of <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> to theſe diſtinct Offices,
conſidering that it was done ſo early, and received ſo univerſally in the Church, as by
the writings of <hi>Clemens, Ignatius,</hi> the Canons commonly called of the Apoſtles, and other
ancient evidences doth appear, His Majeſty hath great reaſon to believe that it was done
by conſent of the Primitive Biſhops, merely in honour of the Apoſtles, out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and reverence to whoſe perſons and perſonal Prerogatives. they choſe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Biſhops rather than Apoſtles in common uſage; although they made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to maintain their ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, when they ſpake of things proper
to their Epiſcopal Function, nor to uſe upon occaſion the terms of Apoſtle and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in that ſenſe. The truth of all which is to be ſeen frequently in the writings of the
Ancients.</p>
                     <p>The Teſtimonies of ſo many Writers, ancient and modern, as have been produced for
the Scripture-original of Biſhops, His Majeſty conceiveth to be of ſo great importance
in a queſtion of this nature, that He thinks himſelf bound both in Charity and Reaſon to
believe, that ſo many men of ſuch quality would not have aſſerted the ſame with ſo much
confidence, but upon very good ground. The Men reſpectively of high eſtimation and
reverend authority in the Church, worthily renowned for their Learning and Piety, of
moderate and even Paſſions, of Orthodox belief, ſundry of them unintereſſed in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and ſome of them of later times by intereſt and education byaſſed the other way.
Their aſſertions poſitive, peremptory and full of aſſurances (<hi>Conſtat, &amp; nemo ignorat,</hi> it
is clear, none can be ignorant, and other ſuch like expreſſions;) namely That Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted

their evidence in reaſon be much leſſened thereby; inaſmuch as one Witneſs for the

                     <p>And whereas you ſeem in this Queſtion to decline this kind of trial, becauſe <hi>matter
of Right is properly triable by Scripture;</hi> His Majeſty conceiveth this preſent Queſtion,
in what terms ſoever propoſed, to be yet in the true ſtating of it, and in the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
clearly a Queſtion of Fact, and not of Right: For what Right ſoever the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have, or pretend to have, muſt be derived from the Fact of Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
Which matter of Fact, if it be not in the moſt plain Hiſtorical manner that
may be, related in the Scriptures, but is to be deduced thence by topical remote infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and probability of Conjectures, the moſt rational and proper expedient for the
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:60710:332"/>
finding out of the Right is to have recourſe to the Judgment, but eſpecially to the
Practice, of the neareſt and ſubſequent times, according to the received Maxims,
<hi>Lex currit cum Praxi, &amp; Conſuetudo optimus interpres Legum.</hi> Now he that ſhall find
by all the beſt Records extant, that the diſtinction of Biſhops from, and the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over Presbyters, was ſo univerſally and ſpeedily ſpread over the face of the whole
World, and their Government ſubmitted unto ſo unanimouſly by the Presbyters, that
there never was any conſiderable oppoſition made there-againſt before <hi>Aerius,</hi> (and
that cryed down as an Hereſie) nor ſince, till this laſt Age; and ſhall duly conſider
withal, that if Epiſcopal Government had not then been conceived to have had its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
from the Authority of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, or if any other form of Church-Government
could have pretended to ſuch inſtitution, it had been the moſt impoſſible
thing in the world, when there neither was any outward coercive power to inforce it,
nor could be any General Council to eſtabliſh it, to have introduced ſuch a Form of
Government ſo ſuddenly and quietly into all Chriſtian Churches, and not the Spirit of
any one Presbyter, for ought that appeareth, for above Three Hundred years, to have
been provoked either through Zeal, Ambition, or other motive, to ſtand up in the juſt
defence of their own and the Churches liberty againſt ſuch an Uſurpation; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
believeth that whoſoever ſhall conſider the premiſſes, together with the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidences
that are brought for that Government, will ſee reaſon enough to conclude
the ſame to have ſomething of Divine Inſtitution in it, notwithſtanding all the evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
aad objections that the ſubtil wit of man can deviſe to perſwade the contrary.
And therefore His Majeſty thinketh it fit plainly to tell you, that ſuch Conjectural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of Scripture as He hath yet met with in this Argument, how handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſoever ſet off, are not Engines of ſtrength enough to remove Him from that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein He hath been ſetled from His Childhood, and findeth ſo conſonant to
the Judgment of Antiquity, and to the conſtant Practice of the Chriſtian Church for
ſo many hundred years; which in a matter of this nature ought to weigh more than
mere Conjectural Inferences from Scripture-Texts that are not ſo atteſted. Which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now once told you, His Majeſty thinketh Himſelf diſcharged from the neceſſity
of making ſo large and particular an Anſwer to every Allegation in the ſequel of your
Reply, as hitherto He hath done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Apoſtles Miſſion and Succeſſion;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6. Reply, Sect. 9.</note>
 To make His Anſwer the ſhorter to ſo long
a diſcourſe, His Majeſty declareth, that His meaning was not by diſtinguiſhing the
<hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Vnction</hi> of the Apoſtles, ſo to confine them as if they ſhould relate preciſely
and excluſively, the one to the Office, the other to the Abilities; but that they did
more eſpecially and eminently ſo relate: For the Apoſtles after their laſt Miſſion,
(<hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20.) whereby they were further warranted to their Office and
Work, were yet to wait for that promiſed <hi>anointing, (Luke</hi> xxiv. 49. <hi>Acts</hi> i. 4.) the
ſpecial effect whereof was the enduing them with Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, for the
better and more effectual performing of that their Work and Office. Nor was it His
Majeſties meaning to reſtrain the Extraordinaries in the Apoſtolical Office to thoſe
Gifts only: (for His Majeſty afterwards in the ſame Paper mentioneth other Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
alſo, as before is ſaid) but only to inſtance in thoſe Gifts, as one ſort of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries,
wherein the Apoſtles were to have no Succeſſors. But His Majeſties full
meaning was, that the whole Apoſtolical Office (ſetting aſide all and only what was
perſonal and extraordinary in them) conſiſted in the work of Teaching and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which being both of neceſſary and perpetual uſe in the Church to the worlds end,
the Office therefore was alſo to continue, and conſequently, the perſons of the Apoſtles
being mortal, to be tranſmitted and derived to others in ſucceſſion: And that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Succeſſors of the Apoſtles immediately, and into the whole Office both of
Teaching and Governing, are properly the Biſhops; the Presbyters ſucceeding them
alſo, but in part, and into the Office of Teaching only, and that mediately and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately
to the Biſhops, by whom they are to be ordained and authorized thereunto,
which His Majeſty taketh not to be, as you call it, a <hi>diſſolving</hi> of the Apoſtolical
Office.</p>
                     <p>Now the ground of what His Majeſty hath ſaid concerning the manner of Succeſſion
to the Apoſtles, that it may appear not to have been ſaid <hi>gratis,</hi> is this; The things
which the Scriptures record to have been done by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, or by others
at their appointment, are of three ſorts, ſome acts of Power merely extraordinary;
others acts of an ordinary power, but of neceſſary and perpetual uſe; otherſome,
laſtly, and thoſe not a few, Occaſional and Prudential, fitted to the preſent condition
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:60710:332"/>
of the Church in ſeveral times. To the Apoſtles in matters of the firſt ſort none pretend
ſucceſſion; nor are either the Examples of what the Apoſtles themſelves did, or the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that they gave to others what they ſhould do, in matters of the third ſort, to be
drawn into conſequence ſo far as to be made neceſſary Rules, binding all ſucceeding
Church-officers in all Times to perpetual obſervation. So that there remain the things
of the middle ſort only, which we may call <hi>Substantials,</hi> into which the Apoſtles are
to have ordinary and ſtanding Succeſſors. But then the difficulty will be, by what
certain marks Extraordinaries, Subſtantials and Prudentials may be known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
each from other. Evident it is, the Scriptures do not afford any particular
diſcriminating Characters whereby to diſcern them; the Acts of all the three ſorts
being related in the like narrative forms, and the directions of all the three ſorts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the like preceptive forms. Recourſe therefore muſt of neceſſity be had to
thoſe two more general <hi>Criterions</hi> [the Laws of all human actions] Reaſon and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Uſage. Our own Reaſon will tell us, that inſtructing the People of God in the
Chriſtian Faith, exhorting them to Piety and good Works, adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c. which belong to the Office of Teaching; that Ordaining of Miniſters,
Inſpection over their Lives and Doctrines, and other Adminiſtrations of Eccleſiaſtical
Affairs belonging to the Office of Governing, are matters of great importance, and
neceſſary concernment to the Church in all ages and times; and therefore were to be
concredited to ſtanding Officers in a Line of ſucceſſion, and accordingly were judged,
and the continuance of them preſerved in the conſtant uſage of the Churches of Chriſt:
But that, on the other ſide, the decrees concerning Abſtinence from Blood and Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Acts</hi> xv. the Directions given for the ordering ſome things in the Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
i <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. for making Proviſions for the Poor, i <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 1. for the choice and
maintenance of Widows, i <hi>Tim.</hi> v. for the enoiling of the ſick, <hi>James</hi> v. 14. and other
like, were but Occaſional, Prudential and Temporary, and were ſo eſteemed by the
Churches; and the practice of them accordingly laid aſide. So for the Succeſſion into
the Apoſtolical Office, we find in the Scriptures Evidence clear enough, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
committed to others, as namely to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the Power both of Teaching
and Governing the Churches. And common Reaſon and Prudence dictating to us, that
it is good for the edifying of the Church, that there ſhould be many Teachers within a
competent precinct, but not ſo that there ſhould be many Governours; and the difference
of Biſhops and Presbyters to the purpoſes aforeſaid, having been by continual uſage recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and preſerved in the Chriſtian Church, down from the Apoſtles to the preſent times;
His Majeſty conceiveth the ſucceſſion of Biſhops to the Apoſtles into ſo much of their
Office as was ordinary and perpetual, and ſuch a diſtinction of Biſhops and Presbyters
as His Majeſty hath formerly expreſſed, needeth no further Confirmation from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(to ſuch as are willing to make uſe of their Reaſon alſo, which in interpreting
Scripture upon all other occaſions they are inforced to do) nor any thing by you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in this Paragraph any further Anſwer: only that diſtinction of Eminently and
Formally, becauſe you illuſtrate it by inſtancing in Himſelf, His Majeſty could not but take
notice of, which He either underſtandeth not, or thinketh your Illuſtration thereof not
to be very appoſite: for Actions and Operations flow from the Forms of things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the ſame, as Effects do their Cauſes. The Apoſtles therefore acting in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
exerciſe of Church-Government, did act not Eminently only, but Formally
alſo, as Biſhops rather than Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>As Concerning <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Whether they were Evangeliſts or no, His Majeſty never meant to diſpute:
Only,<note place="margin">7. Reply, Sect. 10.—15.</note>
 becauſe you often call for Scripture-proof, His Majeſty thought fit to admoniſh
you, that in your Anſwer you take two things for granted (<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
were Evangeliſts and that Evangeliſts, were ſuch Officers as you deſcribed) neither of
which, if it ſhould be denied, you could clearly prove from Scripture alone, without
calling in the help of other Writers to atteſt it, as in your Reply you have now done
Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi>'s: neither have you indeed brought any thing in this Reply out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to prove either of both, ſufficient to convince him that were of a contrary mind.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſeem (<hi>Sect.</hi> 12.) to miſtake that which was the Third Point in that
part of His Majeſties Paper, which was not, Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
or no; (concerning which His Majeſty neither did, nor doth contend) but Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Church-Government they exerciſed, they acted as Evangeliſts (as you affirm)
and ſo only as extraordinary Officers, or not. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> having ſaid that the Name of
a Biſhop and Evangeliſt is the ſame thing, proveth it from ii <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. and concludeth,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:60710:333"/>
                        <hi>Constat idem fuiſſe officium utriuſque,</hi> Biſhop and Evangeliſt the ſame Office both. <hi>Gerard</hi>
ſaith, the word <hi>Evangelist</hi> in that place is taken generally, and not in the ſpecial ſenſe,
that is to ſay, for a Miniſter of the Goſpel at large, (and the Context there indeed ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to import no more) and not for an Evangeliſt by peculiar Office. And <hi>Scultetus</hi>
not only affirmeth, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> appointed <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi>
not as Evangeliſts, but as Church-Governours; but ſaith further, that the Epiſtles
written to them both do evince it, and alſo bringeth Reaſons to prove it. Upon what
particular Reaſons <hi>Gilleſpy,</hi> &amp;c. reject the conceit of their acting as Evangeliſts, His
Majeſty certainly knows not: But if this be one of their Arguments (as, to their beſt
remembrance from whom His Majeſty had the Information, it is) That <hi>if whatſoever
is alleged from the Scripture to have been done by the Apostles, and by</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<hi>in point of Ordination, Diſcipline and Government, may be eluded by this, that they
acted therein as extraordinary Officers; there will be no proof at all from Scripture of any
power left in any ordinary Church-Officer to the purpoſes aforeſaid:</hi> His Majeſty then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth
to your moſt ſober thoughts to conſider, Firſt, how this Conceit of their
acting as extraordinary Miniſters only tends to the ſubverſion of all Miniſters, as well
as of the Biſhops, (ſince upon this very ground eſpecially the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny all Miſſion
and Ordination of Miniſters in the Church); and Secondly, if the contrary be proved
by <hi>Gilleſpy,</hi> &amp;c. by good Arguments, that they acted as ordinary Officers in the Church,
then, whether they have not thereby laid a better foundation for the claim of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
(<hi>viz.</hi> of Governing the Churches as ſingle perſons in Ordinary Office) than either
they or you are willing to acknowledg.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His Majeſty thinketh it a great liberty which you take in rendring the
ſenſe of His Reply as you have done; viz. <hi>The Scriptures never call them Biſhops, but the
Fathers do,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas if you had followed His ſenſe in that Paper, you might rather
have delivered thus, The Scripture deſcribeth them as Biſhops, and the Fathers call them
ſo. For that of yours, <hi>The Scripture calls</hi> Timothy <hi>an Evangeliſt; ſome of late have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
it, and rejected it with ſcorn:</hi> you ſhould have ſaid rather, The Scripture doth not
any where affirm of <hi>Titus,</hi> nor clearly prove of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that they were (by peculiar
Office) Evangeliſts; but that in governing the Churches they acted as Evangeliſts, or
extraordinary Officers, is by ſundry late Writers (the Evaſion it ſelf having been but
of late time minted) refuted and rejected. For that of yours, <hi>The Scripture relates
their motion from Church to Church; but ſome affirm them to be fixed at</hi> Epheſus <hi>and in</hi>
Crete; It ſhould have been, Neither doth their motion from Church to Church hinder
but that they might afterward be fixed at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and in <hi>Crete:</hi> neither doth their being
Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> hinder but that they might afterwards, for propagation of
the Goſpel, be by the Apoſtles appointment often imployed other-where. For that of
yours, <hi>The Scripture makes distinction of Evangeliſts and Pastors, but ſome ſay that</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were both;</hi> It ſhould have been, The Scripture maketh no ſuch diſtinction
of Evangeliſts and Paſtors, but that the ſame perſons might not only ſucceſſively be
both, but even at the ſame time alſo be called by both Names.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Tho you ſay, <hi>You do not undervalue the Teſtimonies and Catalogues mentioned,</hi>
yet you endeavour (which cometh not far ſhort of undervaluing) to leſſen the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both but too much. Of thoſe Teſtimonies, by putting them off, as if, when
they report <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> and others to have been Biſhops, they ſpeak but vulgarly,
or by way of alluſion, and not exactly as to the point in Debate. But of <hi>Hierom,</hi> upon
whom you chiefly rely in this cauſe, the contrary is evident, who in his Catalogue of
Eccleſiaſtical Writers, wherein he was to deliver things <hi>Fide Historica,</hi> and to deſcribe
the perſons of ſuch as are Regiſtred in that Catalogue by their proper and known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive
Titles and Styles, expreſly ſtyleth <hi>Timothy, Titus, Mark, Polycarp</hi> and others,
<hi>Biſhops</hi> of ſuch and ſuch places; and ſuch on the other ſide as were but mere Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>Eccleſioe Antiochenoe</hi> or <hi>Alexandrinoe Presbyteri, &amp;c.</hi> obſerving the difference ſo
conſtantly and exactly throughout the whole Book, that nothing can be more clear, than
that he underſtood the word <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> no otherwiſe than in the ordinary Eccleſiaſtical
ſenſe, and as a Biſhop is diſtinct from a Presbyter. As for that paſſage you allege out
of him, by <hi>cuſtome,</hi> in the judgment of Learned men, he muſt mean the <hi>practice</hi> of the
<hi>Apoſtolick</hi> times; and by <hi>Dominica diſpoſitio,</hi> the expreſs <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> unleſs you
will have himſelf contradict what himſelf hath written in ſundry other places; whoſe
Teſtimonies in the behalf of Epiſcopal Superiority are ſo clear and frequent in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that (altho he of all the Ancients be leaſt ſuſpected to favour that Function over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
yet) the Biſhops would not refuſe to make him Arbitrator in the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
As for the Catalogues, there will be more convenient place to ſpeak of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="641" facs="tcp:60710:333"/>
Fifthly, your long Diſcourſe concerning the ſeveral ſtations and removes of <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus (Sect.</hi> 13, 14.) and their being called away from <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete (Sect.</hi> 15.)
His Majeſty neither hath time to examine, nor thinketh it much needful (in reſpect of
what He hath ſaid already) ſo to do. It is ſufficient to make His Majeſty at leaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend
His Aſſent to your Conjectures and Inferences, Firſt, that He findeth other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, from the like Conjectures, to have made other Inferences; as namely, that
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> having accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> in many journeys, <hi>poſtea &amp; tandem</hi> were by
him conſtituted Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi> Secondly, that ſuppoſing they were, after
the times of the ſeveral Epiſtles written to them, ſent by the Apoſtles to other places,
or did accompany them in ſome of their journeys, even for a long time together, it
cannot be concluded thence that they were not then Biſhops of thoſe Churches, or
that the Government of thoſe Churches was not committed to their peculiar charge:
If it be ſuppoſed withall (which is but reaſonable) that their abſence was commanded by
the Apoſtle, and that they left their Churches <hi>cum animo revertendi.</hi> Thirdly, that the
places which you preſs again of i <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 3. and <hi>Titus</hi> i. 5. weigh ſo little to the purpoſe
intended by you, even in your own judgments (for you ſay only, <hi>They put fair to prove
it</hi>) that you cannot expect they ſhould weigh ſo much in His as to need any further
Anſwer; ſave only that His Majeſty knoweth not what great need or uſe there ſhould
be of leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> for ordaining Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
with ſuch directions and admonitions to them for their care therein, if they were
not ſent thither as Biſhops. For either there were Colleges of Presbyters in thoſe places
before their coming thither, or there were not: if there were, and that ſuch Colleges
had power to ordain Presbyters and Deacons without a Biſhop, then was there little need
of ſending <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ſo ſolemnly thither about the work; if there were none,
then had <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> power of ſole Ordination, which is a thing by you very
much diſliked. Thoſe inconveniences His Majeſty thinketh it will be hard wholly to
avoid upon your Principles.</p>
                     <p>That Diſcourſe you conclude with this Obſervation, <hi>That in the very ſame Epiſtle to</hi>
Timothy, <hi>out of which he is endeavoured to be proved a Biſhop, there is clear evidence
both for Presbyters impoſing hands in Ordination, and for their Ruling:</hi> Yet His Majeſty
preſumeth you cannot be ignorant, that the evidence is not ſo clear in either particular,
but that in the former very many, of the Latin Fathers eſpecially and ſundry later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as <hi>Calvin</hi> and others, refer the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the remoter Subſtantive Grace or
Gift, and not that of Impoſition of Hands; and ſo underſtand it as meant of the Office
of Presbytery, or, as we were wont to call it in Engliſh, by derivation from that Greek
word, of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> in <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf, and not of a Colledg or Company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
collectively impoſing hands on him: and that the Greek Fathers, who take the
word collectively, do yet underſtand by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> there a Company of Apoſtles or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
who laid hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> in his ordination to the Office of a Biſhop, (as was
ordinarily done by three joyning in that act in the Primitive and ſucceeding times) and
not of a College of mere Presbyters: and that in the latter particular, to wit, that of
<hi>Ruling,</hi> the place whereon His Majeſty conceiveth your Obſervation to be grounded,
hath been by the Adverſaries of Epiſcopal Government generally and mainly inſiſted
upon, as the only clear proof for the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Ruling-Lay-Elders,</hi> which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
His Majeſty knoweth not how far you will admit of.</p>
                     <p>As to the Angels of the Churches.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſties purpoſe in naming theſe Angels in His firſt Paper,<note place="margin">8. Reply, 16.</note>
 ſufficiently declared
in His ſecond, required no more to be granted for the proving of what He intended, but
theſe Two Things only: Firſt, That they were <hi>Perſonae ſingulares;</hi> and then, That they
had a Superiority in their reſpective Churches, as well over Presbyters as others: which
two being the <hi>Periphraſis</hi> or Definition of a Biſhop, His Majeſty conceived it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of it ſelf, That they were Biſhops. That the Epiſtles directed to them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Reproofs, Precepts, Threatnings, and other the contents thereof, did concern
their fellow-Presbyters alſo, and indeed the whole Churches (which in your laſt you
again remember) His Majeſty did then and doth ſtill believe, finding it agreeable both
to the tenor of the Epiſtles themſelves, and to the conſentient judgment of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Only His Majeſty ſaid, and ſtill doth, That that hindreth not but that the Angels
to whom the Epiſtles were directed were <hi>Perſonae ſingulares</hi> ſtill. This His Majeſty il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
by a Similitude, which tho it do not hold in ſome other reſpects, and namely
thoſe you obſerve, (for His Majeſty never dreamt of a four-footed Similitude) yet it
perfectly illuſtrates the thing it was then intended for; as is evident enough, ſo that
there needeth no more to be ſaid about it.</p>

another perſon, being very uſual both in Prophetick Writings, ſuch as this Book of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
is, and in Epiſtles of this nature written to one, but with reference to many
others therein concerned. <hi>Beza</hi> expoundeth it, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>to you,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Angel</hi> as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and his Collegues the other Presbyters) <hi>and to the reſt,</hi> that is, to the whole flock
or people: which manner of ſpeaking might be illuſtrated by the like forms of ſpeech
to be uſed in a Letter written to a Corporation, wherein the Mayor and Aldermen eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
but yet the whole Town generally, were concerned, but directed to the Mayor
alone; or from a Lord, containing ſome Orders for his own houſhould eſpecially, and
generally for the whole Townſhip, but by the Inſcription directed to his Steward only,
or the like.</p>
                     <p>The Conſent of ancient and later Writers was produced by His Majeſty for the proof
of the two things before named only, but eſpecially of the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were <hi>Perſonae ſingulares:</hi> (for the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were ſuperiour
to Presbyters alſo, had been confeſſed by your ſelves in your firſt Grant before)
but was not produced to prove the Concluſion it ſelf immediately, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were
Biſhops in diſtinct ſenſe, altho ſundry of their Teſtimonies come up even to that alſo.
But to the firſt point, That they were <hi>Single</hi> perſons, the concurrence is ſo general, that
His Majeſty remembreth not to have heard of any one ſingle Interpreter, before <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
that ever expounded them otherwiſe: And yet the ſame man (as His Majeſty is
informed) in his whole Commentary upon the <hi>Revelation</hi> doth ſcarce, if at all, any
where elſe, ſave in theſe Seven Epiſtles, expound the word <hi>Angel</hi> collectively, but ſtill
of one ſingle perſon or other, inſomuch as he maketh one Angel to be <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
another Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> another <hi>Cranmer,</hi> another <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and the like. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
both the Fathers and Proteſtant Divines agree in this, That the Angel was a
Single perſon: ſome affirming plainly, and that <hi>in terminis,</hi> he was the Biſhop; ſome
naming the very perſons of ſome of them, as of <hi>Polycarp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and others;
ſome calling him the chief Paſtor or Superintendent of that Church; and thoſe that
ſpeak leaſt, and were more or leſs diſaffected to Biſhops, as <hi>Beza,</hi> Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> the

Presbyters. And this they do ſundry of them, not crudely delivering their Opinions
only, and then no more, but they give Reaſons for it, and after examination of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Opinions, prefer this before the reſt, affirming, That <hi>Doctiſſimi quique interpretes,

                     <p>That which His Majeſty ſaid concerning the Subdiviſion of thoſe that had divided
themſelves from the common received judgment of the Church, was meant by His
Majeſty, as to the Subdiviſion, in reſpect of this particular of the Angels, wherein they
differ one from another; as to the Diviſion, in reſpect of their diſlike of Biſhops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they all agree. And truly His Majeſty doth not yet ſee, how either their Differences
can be poſſibly reconciled in the former (no accommodation in the world being able to
make all the people of the whole Church, nor yet a Colledg conſiſting of many Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
to be one <hi>Single</hi> perſon;) or their receſs wholly excuſed in the latter, their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
from the common and received Judgment and Practice of the Chriſtian Church
in the matter of Epiſcopacy, and the evil conſequents thereof, having, in His Majeſties
Opinion, brought a greater reproach upon the Proteſtant Religion, and given more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
(or colour at leaſt) to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party to aſperſe the Reformed Churches in ſuch

                     </p>
                     <p>Here little is ſaid, the ſubſtance whereof hath not been Anſwered before. His
Majeſty therefore briefly declares His meaning herein, That the Apoſtles were to have
no neceſſary Succeſſors in any thing that was extraordinary, either in their Miſſion
or Unction; That His Majeſty ſpake not of Succeſſion into Abilities otherwiſe than
by inſtance, mentioning other particulars withal, which thing, He thinketh, needeth
not to have been now the third time by you mentioned; That in the Apoſtles Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Commiſſion (for His Majeſty under the name of Miſſion comprehended both)
and conſequently in the Apoſtolical Office, as there was ſomething extraordinary, ſo
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:60710:334"/>
there was ſomething ordinary, wherein they were to have Succeſſors; That Biſhops
are properly their Succeſſors in the whole Apoſtolical Office, ſo far as it was ordinary,
and to have Succeſſors; That therefore the Biſhops Office may in regard of that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
be ſaid to be Apoſtolical; That yet it doth not follow that they muſt needs be
called Apoſtles, taking the Denomination from the Office, inaſmuch as the Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Apoſtles, peculiarly ſo called, was not given them from the Office whereunto
they were ſent, but (as the word it ſelf rather importeth) from the immediateneſs of
their Miſſion, being ſent immediately by Chriſt himſelf, in reſpect whereof, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
ſake, and in Honour to their Perſons, it was thought fitter by thoſe that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
in common uſage to abſtain from that Denomination, and to be ſtyled rather by
the Name of Biſhops; That if the Apoſtles had no Succeſſors, the Presbyters (who are
their Succeſſors in part, mediately and ſubordinately to the Biſhops) will be very hard
ſet to prove the Warrant of their own Office and Miſſion; which if not derived from
the Apoſtles (who only received power of Miſſion from Chriſt) by a continued line of
Succeſſion, His Majeſty ſeeth not upon what other bottom it can ſtand.</p>

there were to be no more ſtanding Officers in the Church than the two in thoſe places
mentioned (<hi>viz.</hi>) Presbyters (who are there called Biſhops) and Deacons; whereunto
His Majeſties Anſwer was, <hi>That there might be other, tho not mentioned in thoſe places:</hi>
which Anſwer tho it were alone ſufficient, yet, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> His Majeſty ſhewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that ſuppoſing your interpretation of the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in both the places (<hi>viz.</hi>) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the Office of Presbyter only) there might yet be given ſome probable conjectures,
which (likewiſe ſuppoſed true) might ſatisfie us, why that of Biſhop in the diſtinct ſenſe
ſhould not be needful or proper to be named in thoſe places.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſties former Reaſon, tho in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> and as applied to the Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi>
it be but conjectural, yet upon the credit of all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Condition of thoſe times, as it is ſet forth in the Scriptures alſo, it will
appear in <hi>Theſi</hi> to be undoubtedly true (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Apoſtles themſelves firſt planted
Churches; That they were perpetual Governours, and, in chief, of all the Churches
whilſt they lived; That as the burthen grew greater by the propagation of the Goſpel,
they aſſumed others in <hi>partem curae,</hi> committing to their charge the peculiar overſight
of the Churches in ſome principal Cities, and the Towns and Villages adjacent, as
<hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and others in other places, ſooner or later, as they ſaw it expedient
for the ſervice of the Church; That the perſons ſo by them appointed to ſuch peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
charges did exerciſe the powers of Ordination, and other Government, under the
Apoſtles, and are therefore in the Church Stories called Biſhops of thoſe places in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſenſe; That in ſome places, where the Apoſtles were themſelves more frequently
converſant, they did for ſome while govern the Churches immediately by themſelves,
before they ſet Biſhops there; and that after the Apoſtles times, Biſhops only were the
ordinary Governours of the Churches of Chriſt: And His Majeſty believeth it cannot
be proved, either from clear evidence of Scripture, or credible teſtimonies of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ever any Presbyter or Presbytery exerciſed the power either of Ordination
at all without a Biſhop, or of that which they call Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and by their own ſole Authority, or otherwiſe than as it was delegated unto them
upon occaſion, and for the time, by Apoſtles or Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>For that place of <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. in particular, His Majeſties purpoſe being not to interpret
the place, (a work fitter for Divines) but to manifeſt the inconſequence of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby you would conclude but two ſtanding Officers only, becauſe but two
there named, He gave this as one probable conjecture why there might be no Biſhop in
diſtinct ſenſe there mentioned, becauſe poſſibly the Apoſtles had not as yet ſet any Biſhop
over that Church: which His Majeſty did not propoſe as the only, no, nor yet as the
moſt probable conjecture, (for which cauſe He delivered it ſo cautiouſly, ſaying only,
<hi>It might be probable</hi>) but as that which for the preſent came firſt into His thoughts,
and was ſufficient for His purpoſe, without the leaſt meaning thereby to prejudice other
interpretations; as, namely, of thoſe Expoſitors who take the words (<hi>with the Biſhops
and Deacons</hi>) as belonging to the perſons ſaluting, and not to the perſons ſaluted, to this
ſenſe, <hi>Paul and Timotheus, the ſervants of Jeſus Christ, with the Biſhops and Deacons, to the
Saints at Philippi, &amp;c.</hi> or of thoſe who affirm, and that with great probability too, that
<hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was then actually Biſhop of <hi>Philippi,</hi> but not to be mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Epiſtle, becauſe he was not then at <hi>Philippi,</hi> but with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <pb n="644" facs="tcp:60710:335"/>
when that Epiſtle was written. Any of which conjectures if they be true, (as there is
none of them utterly improbable) that place of <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. will not do you much
ſervice in this Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>In the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the Apoſtle directeth and admoniſheth them as
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> particularly concerning Ordination of Miniſters, that they do it adviſedly, and
ordain none but ſuch as are meetly qualified for the Service of the Church; which Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Admonitions His Majeſty believeth for the ſubſtance to belong to all Biſhops of
after-times as well as unto them: But His Majeſty ſeeth no neceſſity why in thoſe
Epiſtles there ſhould be any particular directions given concerning the Ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
at leaſt unleſs it could be made appear that they were to ordain ſome ſuch in thoſe
places, nor perhaps if that could be made to appear, inaſmuch as in thoſe Epiſtles there
is not the leaſt ſignification of any difference at all between Presbyters and Deacons in
the manner of their Ordination, both being to be performed by the Biſhop, and by
Impoſition of Hands, and ſo both comprehended under that general Rule (<hi>Lay hands
ſuddenly on no man</hi>) but only, and that very little, and ſcarce conſiderable (as to the
making of diſtinct Offices) in the qualification of their perſons.</p>
                     <p>The Ordination therefore of Biſhops, Presbyters and Deacons, being to be performed
in the ſame manner, and the ſame Qualifications after a ſort, ſaving ſuch differences as
the importance of their ſeveral Offices make, (which is more in the degree than in the
things) being required in both, it had been ſufficient if in thoſe Epiſtles there had
been direction given concerning the Ordination and Qualification of but one ſort of
Church-Officers only; as in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> we ſee there are of Presbyters only,
and no mention made of Deacons in the whole Epiſtle; whence it may be as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
That there was to be no other ſtanding Officer in the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> but
Presbyters only, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth no directions to <hi>Titus</hi> concerning any other,
as it can be concluded, That there were to be no other Officers in the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
but Presbyters and Deacons only, becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth no direction to <hi>Timothy</hi>
concerning any other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Judgment of Eccleſiaſtical Writers about the Divine Right of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
His Majeſty conceiveth the difference to be more in their Expreſſions than in
their Meaning, ſome calling it <hi>Divine,</hi> others <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and ſome (but not many)
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> But that the Superiority of Biſhops above Presbyters began in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
times, and had its foundation in the Inſtitution either of Chriſt himſelf or of his
Apoſtles, His Majeſty hath not heard (<hi>Aerius</hi> exceped) that any till theſe latter Ages
have denied.</p>
                     <p>For that which you touch upon concerning the word <hi>Infallible,</hi> His Majeſty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
you knew His meaning, and He delighteth not to contend about words.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Catalogues,</hi> ſome uncertainties in a few (a frailty which all human Hiſtories
are ſubject to) His Majeſty taketh to be inſufficient to diſcredit all. Differences there
are in Hiſtoriographers, in reciting the Succeſſion of the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian, and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi>
Kings, and of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings in <hi>England.</hi> And we find far more inextricable
intricacies in the <hi>Faſti Conſulares,</hi> the Catalogues of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their great care in keeping of the publick Records, and the exactneſs of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories) than are to be found in Epiſtcopal Catalogues, thoſe eſpecially of the
chiefeſt Cities, as <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. Yet as all
men believe there were Kings in thoſe Countries, and Conſuls in <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe times;
ſo (as you might well foreſee would be anſwered) the diſcrediting of the Catalogues of
Biſhops in reſpect of ſome uncertainties, (although His Majeſty doubteth not but many
of the differences you inſtance in may be fairly reconciled) tendeth rather to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the thing it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That which you ſay in Anſwer hereunto, that the Eccleſiaſtical Writers called them <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
in compliance to the Language of their own Times, after the names of Presbyters
and Biſhops were diſtinguiſhed, but that they were not indeed Biſhops in the proper ſenſe
now in Queſtion; His Majeſty, who believeth the diſtinction of thoſe names to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
preſently after the Apoſtles times (if not rather whilſt ſome of them were living)
doth conſequently believe, that as they were called, ſo they were indeed Biſhops in that
proper ſenſe. It appeareth by <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles every where, how wide the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was in his time between a Biſhop and a mere Presbyter. If <hi>Hierom</hi> only, and
ſome a little ancienter than he, had applied the name Biſhop to perſons that lived ſome
Ages before them, there might have been the more colour to have attributed it to ſuch
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:60710:335"/>
a compliance as you ſpeak of; but that they received both the Name and the truth of
their relations from unqueſtionable Teſtimonies and Records, His Majeſty thinketh it may
be made good by many inſtances. For example, to inſtance in one only, <hi>Polycarp</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who is thought to be the <hi>Angel</hi> of that Church in the <hi>Revelations; Ignatius,</hi>
who was contemporary with him, wrote one Epiſtle to him, and ſends ſalutation to him
in another, as Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Many years after, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
(whoſe Writings were never yet called in queſtion by any) not only affirms
him to have been conſtituted Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> by the Apoſtles, but ſaith, <hi>That he
himſelf when he was a Boy had ſeen him a very old man. Tertullian</hi> next, a very ancient
Writer, affirmeth <hi>That he was Biſhop of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>there placed by Saint</hi> John. After
cometh <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory not only Hiſtorically reporteth of
his being Biſhop there, as he doth of other Biſhops; but citeth alſo for it the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
both of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (which, by the way, giveth good credit to <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
his Epiſtles too.) Then <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo and others, laſtly, atteſt the ſame. And
it cannot be doubted but <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> had in their times the like certain
Teſtimonies and Grounds for ſundry others, whom they report to have been Biſhops;
which Teſtimonies and Records are not all come to our hands.</p>
                     <p>For the Teſtimonies of <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> His Majeſty ſaith, Firſt, That tho it be
not reaſonable that the Teſtimony of one ſingle Epiſtle ſhould be ſo made the adequate
meaſure of <hi>Clemens</hi> his Opinion, as to exclude all other proof from his Example, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
yet His Majeſty, ſince <hi>Clemens</hi> was firſt named by you, and the weight of the main cauſe
lieth not much upon it, is content alſo for that matter to refer Himſelf to that Epiſtle.
Secondly, That His Majeſty could not but uſe ſome earneſtneſs of expreſſion in the
cauſe of <hi>Ignatius</hi> againſt ſome who have rejected the whole Volume of his Epiſtles,
but upon ſuch Arguments as have more leſſened the Reputation of their own Learning,
than the Authority of thoſe Epiſtles, in the opinion of moderate and judicious men:
And yet <hi>Blondellus,</hi> a very Learned man, tho he reject thoſe Epiſtles, confeſſeth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Ancient Fathers gave full Credence thereunto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Apoſtles,</hi> you ſay, <hi>did not ordain themſelves Biſhops of any particular places; and
yet the Biſhops of ſome particular places are reported in the Catalogues to have been Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeſſors
to ſuch or ſuch of the Apostles, and even the Names of ſuch Apoſtles are entred into
the Catalogues.</hi> To this His Majeſty ſaith, That the Apoſtles were formerly Biſhops by
virtue of their Miſſion from Chriſt, as hath been already declared, but did neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
themſelves, nor could be ordained of others, Biſhops of ſuch or ſuch particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Although His Majeſty knoweth not but that they might, without prejudice to their
Apoſtleſhip, and by mutual conſent, make choice of their ſeveral quarters wherein to
exerciſe that Function, as well as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by conſent went, the one to
the Circumciſion, the other to the Gentiles. But ſuch apportionments did not intitle them
to be properly called Biſhops of thoſe places, unleſs any of them by ſuch agreement
did fixedly reſide in ſome City; of which there is not in the Hiſtory of the Church
any clear unqueſtionable Example. If <hi>James</hi> the Lord's Brother (who was certainly
Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) were not one of the twelve Apoſtles, as the more general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is that he was not; yet did the Churches of ſucceeding times, for the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Sees, and the memory of ſo great Benefactors, enter in the Head of
the Liſts or Catalogues of their Biſhops, the Names of ſuch of the Apoſtles as had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
firſt planted the Faith, or placed Biſhops, or made any long abode and continuance,
or ended their days among them: yet doth not the true Title of being Succeſſors to
the Apoſtles thereby accrue to the Biſhops of thoſe places more than to other Biſhops,
but all Biſhops are equally Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in two other reſpects; the one,
for that they derive their Ordination by a continued Line of Succeſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
the other, for that they ſucceed into the ſame Apoſtolical Power and Function,
which the Apoſtles as ordinary Paſtors had.</p>
                     <p>Your motion, to reduce this whole Diſpute to Scripture alone, were the more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
if the matter in queſtion were properly a Point of Faith: And yet even in
points of Faith (as the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture, and ſundry
other) the uniform judgment of the Church hath been ever held of very conſiderable
regard. But being a matter of Fact, as before was ſaid, which the Scriptures do not
deliver entirely and perſpicuouſly in any one place together, but obſcurely and by parts,
ſo that the underſtanding thereof dependeth merely upon conjectural Interpretations
and uncertain probabilities, nor aſſure any certain diſtinguiſhing Characters whereby
to diſcern what therein is extraordinary, what prudential, and what of neceſſary and
perpetual Obligation, there ſeemeth to His Majeſty to be a neceſſity of admitting
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:60710:336"/>
the ſubſequent Judgment and Practice of the Chriſtian Churches into the Trial.</p>
                     <p>As to the Three Queſtions propoſed by His Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty reſteth very much unſatisfied,<note place="margin">12. Reply, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>
 that you have now again wholly declined
the anſwering of thoſe three Queſtions ſo clearly propoſed by Him, which your ſelves
alſo conſeſs to be of great importance, upon this only pretence, <hi>That the whole Volume
of Eccleſiaſtical Policy is contained in them:</hi> Whereas His Majeſty did neither expect
nor require from you any large or Polemical Diſcourſe concerning thoſe Queſtions;
but yet did conceive you were (in order to His Satisfaction in your own Undertaking)
in ſome ſort obliged to have declared in few words what your Judgment was therein,
with the grounds thereof, that ſo His Majeſty might have taken the ſame into His fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conſideration, than which nothing could have more conduced to the informing
of His Judgment, and the ſatisfaction of His Conſcience: which His Majeſty alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceives you might have done with the tenth part of that pains you have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
beſtowed to other purpoſes, and therein have given full as much ſatisfaction to His
deſires as he expected, and in all likelihood better ſatisfaction to His Judgment, than
He yet findeth, or can hope to find from you, ſo long as you hold off from declaring
your Opinions concerning thoſe Queſtions. For certainly until one of theſe three
things can be clearly evidenced unto His Majeſty, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Either that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Form of Church-Government at all preſcribed in the Word; or if there be, that
the Civil Power may change the ſame as they ſee cauſe; or if it be unchangeable, that
it was not Epiſcopal, but ſome other; His Majeſty thinks himſelf excuſeable in the
judgment of all reaſonable men, if He cannot as yet be induced to give his Aſſent
to the utter Abolition of that Government in the Church which He found here ſetled
to His hands, which hath continued all over the Chriſtian World from the times of
the Apoſtles until this laſt Age, and in this Realm ever ſince the firſt plantation of
Chriſtianity, as well ſince the Reformation as before, which hath been confirmed by ſo
many Acts of Parliament, approved as conſonant to the holy Word of God in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of our Religion, and by all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well by
their perſonal Subſcriptions as otherwiſe, ſo atteſted and declared, and which Himſelf in
His Judgment and Conſcience hath for ſo many years been, and yet is, perſwaded to
be at leaſt of Apoſtolical Inſtitution and Practice. Truly, His Majeſty cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what ſhould be the reaſon of your great ſhineſs and unwillingneſs to diſcover your

this whole Diſpute (which His Majeſty thinketh fit to ſhut up with this Paper) He
muſt plainly tell you, That your endeavours to have given Him ſatisfaction in the
Queſtions propoſed would have added much, in His opinion, to the reputation of your
Ingenuity in the whole undertaking; it being not probable you ſhould work much
upon His Judgment, whilſt you are fearful to declare your own; nor poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
His Conſcience, but by a free diſcharge of yours.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, His Majeſty liketh well of your Prayer in the cloſe of your Paper,

                     <head>I. Vpon His MAJESTIES Calling this laſt PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</head>
                     <p>THIS laſt Parliament I called, not more by others advice, and neceſſity
of my Affairs, than by my own choice and inclination; who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought the right way of Parliaments moſt ſafe for my Crown, as
beſt pleaſing to my People. And altho I was not forgetful of thoſe
ſparks which ſome mens diſtempers formerly ſtudied to kindle in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(which by forbearing to convene for ſome years I hoped to have extinguiſhed;)
yet reſolving with My ſelf to give all juſt ſatisfaction to modeſt and ſober deſires, and
to redreſs all publick Grievances in Church and State, I hoped (by my freedom and
their moderation) to prevent all miſunderſtandings and miſcarriages in this: In which
as I feared affairs would meet with ſome Paſſion and Prejudice in other men, ſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
they ſhould find leaſt of them in My ſelf; not doubting but by the weight of
Reaſon I ſhould counterpoiſe the over-balancings of any Factions.</p>
                     <p>I was, inded, ſorry to hear with what Partiality and Popular heat Elections were
carried in many places: yet hoping that the Gravity and Diſcretion of other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would allay and fix the Commons to a due temperament (guiding ſome mens
well-meaning zeal by ſuch rules of moderation as are beſt both to preſerve and reſtore
the health of all States and Kingdoms) no man was better pleaſed with the convening
of this Parliament than My ſelf, who knowing beſt the Largeneſs of my own Heart
toward my Peoples good and juſt contentment, pleaſed My ſelf moſt in that good and
firm underſtanding which would hence grow between Me and my People.</p>
                     <p>All Jealouſies being laid aſide, My own and My Childrens Intereſts gave Me many
obligations to ſeek and preſerve the Love and welfare of my Subjects; the only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Bleſſing that is left to the ambition of juſt Monarchs, as their greateſt Honour
and Safety, next Gods Protection. I cared not to leſſen My ſelf in ſome things of my
wonted Prerogative, ſince I knew I could be no loſer, if I might gain but a recompence
in my Subjects Affections.</p>
                     <p>I intended not only to oblige my Friends, but mine Enemies alſo; exceeding even
the deſires of thoſe that were factiouſly diſcontented, if they did but pretend to any
modeſt and ſober ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Odium</hi> and offences which ſome mens Rigor or Remiſneſs in Church and State
had contracted upon my Government, I reſolved to have expiated by ſuch Laws and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
for the future, as might not only rectify what was amiſs in Practice, but
ſupply what was defective in the Conſtitution: No man having a greater zeal to ſee
Religion ſetled, and preſerved in Truth, Unity and Order, than My ſelf, whom it moſt
concerns both in Piety and Policy; as knowing that, No flames of civil Diſſentions
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:60710:337"/>
are more dangerous than thoſe which make Religious pretenſions the grounds of
Factions.</p>
                     <p>I reſolved to reform what I ſhould by free and full advice in Parliament be oonvinced
of to be amiſs, and to grant whatever my Reaſon and Conſcience told Me was fit to
be deſired. I wiſh I had kept My ſelf within thoſe bounds, and not ſuffered my own
Judgment to have been overborn in ſome things, more by others importunities than
their Arguments: My confidence had leſs betrayed My ſelf and my Kingdomes to
thoſe advantages which ſome men ſought for, who wanted nothing but Power and
Occaſions to do miſchief.</p>
                     <p>But our Sins being ripe, there was no preventing of Gods Juſtice from reaping that
Glory in our Calamities which we robb'd him of in our Proſperity.</p>
                     <p>For Thou (O Lord) haſt made us ſee, that Reſolutions of future Reforming do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſatisfie thy Juſtice, nor prevent thy Vengeance for former miſcarriages.</p>
                     <p>Our Sins have overlaid our Hopes. Thou haſt taught us to depend on thy Mercies to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
not on our purpoſe to amend.</p>
                     <p>When Thou haſt vindicated thy Glory by thy Judgments, and haſt ſhewed us how unſafe it
is to offend Thee, upon preſumptions afterwards to pleaſe Thee; then I truſt thy Mercies will
restore thoſe Bleſſings to us, which we have ſo much abuſed as to force Thee to deprive us of
them.</p>
                     <p>For want of timely Repentance of our ſins, Thou givest us cauſe to repent of thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
we too late apply.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not repent of my calling this laſt Parliament; becauſe, O Lord, I did it with an
upright intention, to thy Glory and my peoples good.</p>
                     <p>The Miſeries which have enſued upon Me and My Kingdoms, are the juſt effects of thy
diſpleaſure upon us; and may be yet (through thy mercy) preparative of us to future Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
and better hearts to enjoy them.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, tho Thou haſt deprived us of many former comforts, yet grant Me and My people
the benefit of our afflictions and thy chaſtiſements; that thy rod as well as thy ſtaff may
comfort us. Then ſhall we dare to account them the ſtrokes not of an Enemy, but a Father,
when thou giveſt us thoſe humble affections, that meaſure of Patience in Repentance, which
becomes thy Children. I ſhall have no cauſe to repent the Miſeries this Parliament hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned,
when by them thou hast brought Me and My people unfeignedly to repent of the Sins
we have committed.</p>
                     <p>Thy Grace is infinitely better with our Sufferings, than our Peace could be with our Sins.</p>
                     <p>O thou ſoveraign Goodneſs and Wiſdom, who over-ruleſt all our Counſels, over-rule
alſo all our hearts; That the worſe things we ſuffer by thy Justice, the better we may be
by thy Mercy.</p>
                     <p>As our Sins have turned our Antidotes into poyſon, ſo let thy Grace turn our poyſons into
Antidotes.</p>
                     <p>As the Sins of our Peace diſpoſed us to this unhappy War, ſo let this War prepare us for
thy bleſſed Peace.</p>
                     <p>That although I have but troubleſom Kingdoms here, yet I may attain to that Kingdom
of Peace in my Heart and in thy Heaven, which Christ hath purchaſed, and thou wilt give
to thy Servant (tho a Sinner) for my Saviours ſake, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <head>II. Vpon the Earl of STRAFFORD's Death.</head>
                     <p>I Looked upon my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as a Gentleman whoſe great Abilities might
make a Prince rather afraid than aſhamed to employ him in the greateſt affairs of
State.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe were prone to create in him great confidence of undertakings, and this
was like enough to betray him to great errors and many enemies: Whereof he could
not but contract good ſtore, while moving in ſo high a ſphear and with ſo vigorous a
luſtre, he muſt needs (as the Sun) raiſe many envious exhalations, which condenſed
by a Popular <hi>Odium,</hi> were capable to caſt a cloud upon the brighteſt Merit and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
                     <p>Though I cannot in my Judgment approve all he did, driven (it may be) by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of Times and the Temper of that People, more than led by his own diſpoſition
to any height and rigor of actions: yet I could never be convinced of any ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minouſneſs
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:60710:337"/>
in him, as willingly to expoſe his life to the ſtroke of Juſtice, and Malice
of his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>I never met with a more unhappy conjuncture of affairs than in the buſineſs of that
unfortunate Earl; when between my own unſatisfiedneſs in Conſcience, and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
(as ſome told Me) of ſatisfying the importunities of ſome people, I was perſwaded
by thoſe that I think wiſhed Me well, to chuſe rather what was ſafe, than what ſeemed
juſt; preferring the outward Peace of my Kingdoms with men, before that inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
of Conſcience before God.</p>
                     <p>And indeed I am ſo far from excuſing or denying that compliance on My part (for
plenary conſent it was not) to his deſtruction, whom in my Judgment I thought not,
by any clear Law, guilty of Death; that I never bare any touch of Conſcience with
greater regret: which, as a ſign of my Repentance, I have often with ſorrow confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both to God and men, as an act of ſo ſinful frailty, that it diſcovered more a fear of
Man than of God, whoſe name and place on Earth no man is worthy to bear who will
avoid inconveniencies of State by acts of ſo high injuſtice as no publick convenience
can expiate or compenſate.</p>
                     <p>I ſee it a bad exchange to wound a mans own Conſcience, thereby to ſalve State ſores;
to calm the ſtorms of Popular diſcontents, by ſtirring up a tempeſt in a mans own
boſome.</p>
                     <p>Nor hath Gods Juſtice failed in the event and ſad conſequences, to ſhew the world
the fallacy of that Maxime, <hi>Better one man periſh (tho unjuſtly) than the people be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
or deſtroyed.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p>In all likelihood, I could never have ſuffered, with my people, greater calamities,
(yet with greater comfort) had I vindicated <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Innocency, at leaſt by denying
to ſign that deſtructive BILL, according to that Juſtice which my Conſcience ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to Me, than I have done ſince I gratified ſome mens unthankful importunities
with ſo cruel a favour. And I have obſerved, that thoſe who counſelled Me to ſign that
BILL, have been ſo far from receiving the rewards of ſuch ingratiatings with the
People, that no men have been haraſſed and cruſhed more than they; He only hath
been leaſt vexed by them, who counſelled Me not to conſent againſt the Vote of my
own Conſcience. I hope God hath forgiven Me and them the ſinful raſhneſs of that
buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>To which being in my Soul ſo fully conſcious, thoſe Judgments God hath pleaſed to
ſend upon Me, are ſo much the more welcome, as a means (I hope) which his Mercy
hath ſanctified ſo to Me, as to make Me repent of that unjuſt Act, (for ſo it was to
Me) and for the future to teach Me, That the beſt rule of Policy is to prefer the doing
of Juſtice before all enjoyments, and the Peace of my Conſcience before the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>Nor hath any thing more fortified my reſolutions againſt all thoſe violent importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which ſince have ſought to gain a like conſent from Me to Acts wherein my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is unſatisfied, than the ſharp touches I have had for what paſſed Me in my Lord
of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Not that I reſolved to have employed him in my Affairs, againſt the advice of my
Parliament; but I would not have had any hand in his Death, of whoſe Guiltleſneſs I
was better aſſured than any man living could be.</p>
                     <p>Nor were the Crimes objected againſt him ſo clear, as after a long and fair hearing
to give convincing ſatisfaction to the Major part of both Houſes; eſpecially that of
the Lords, of whom ſcarce a third part were preſent when the Bill paſſed that Houſe.
And for the Houſe of Commons, many Gentlemen, diſpoſed enough to diminiſh my
Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s greatneſs and power, yet unſatisfied of his guilt in Law, durſt not
condemn him to die: who for their Integrity in their Votes, were, by Poſting their
Names, expoſed to the popular calumny, hatred and fury; which grew then ſo exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in their clamours for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (that is, to have both My ſelf and the two Houſes
Vote and do as they would have us) that many ('tis thought) were rather terrified to
concur with the condemning party, than ſatisfied that of right they ought ſo to
do.</p>
                     <p>And that after-Act vacating the Authority of the precedent for future imitation,
ſufficiently tells the world, that ſome remorſe touched even his moſt implacable Enemies,
as knowing he had very hard meaſure, and ſuch as they would be very loath ſhould be
repeated to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This tenderneſs and regret I find in my Soul, for having had any hand (and
that very unwillingly, God knows) in ſhedding one mans blood unjuſtly, (tho under
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:60710:338"/>
the colour and formalities of Juſtice, and pretences of avoiding publick miſchiefs;)
which may (I hope) be ſome evidence before God and Man, to all Poſterity, that I am
far from bearing juſtly the vaſt load and guilt of all that Blood which hath been ſhed in
this unhappy War, which ſome men will needs charge on <hi>Me,</hi> to eaſe their own Souls,
who am, and ever ſhall be, more afraid to take away any mans life unjuſtly, than to
loſe My own.</p>
                     <p>But Thou, O God of infinite mercies, forgive Me that act of ſinful compliance, which
hath greater aggravations upon Me than any man. Since I had not the leaſt temptation of
Envy or Malice againſt him, and by My place ſhould at least ſo far have been a preſerver
of him, as to have denied my conſent to his deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, I acknowledg my tranſgreſſion, and my ſin is ever before Me.</p>
                     <p>Deliver Me from blood-guiltineſs, O God, thou God of my ſalvation, and my tongue ſhall
ſing of thy righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Against Thee have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight; for Thou ſawest the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
between my heart and my hand.</p>
                     <p>Yet cast Me not away from thy preſence, purge Me with the Blood of my Redeemer, and I
ſhall be clean; waſh Me with that precious effuſion, and I ſhall be whiter than ſnow.</p>
                     <p>Teach Me to learn Righteouſneſs by thy Judgments, and to ſee my frailty in thy Juſtice:
While I was perſwaded by ſhedding one mans blood to prevent after-troubles, thou hast
for that, among other ſins, brought upon Me and upon my Kingdoms great, long and
heavy troubles.</p>
                     <p>Make Me to prefer Juſtice, which is thy Will, before all contrary clamors, which are but
the diſcoveries of mans injurious will.</p>
                     <p>It is too much that they have once overcome Me, to pleaſe them by diſpleaſing Thee: O
never ſuffer Me for any reaſon of State, to go againſt my Reaſon of Conſcience, which is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſin againſt Thee, the God of Reaſon and Judg of our Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Whatever, O Lord, Thou ſeeſt fit to deprive Me of, yet restore unto Me the joy of thy
Salvation, and ever uphold Me with thy free Spirit, which ſubjects my Will to none but thy
Light of Reaſon, Justice and Religion, which ſhines in my Soul; for Thou deſireſt Truth in
the inward parts, and Integrity in the outward expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Lord, hear the voice of thy Sons and my Saviours Blood, which ſpeaks better things; O
make Me and my People to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that the bones which thou
hast broken may rejoyce in thy Salvation.</p>

COMMONS.</head>
                     <p>MY going to the Houſe of Commons to demand Juſtice upon the Five Members,
was an act which my Enemies loaded with all the obloquies and exaſperations
they could.</p>
                     <p>It filled indifferent men with great jealouſies and fears; yea, and many of My
Friends reſented it as a motion riſing rather from Paſſion than Reaſon, and not guided
with ſuch diſcretion as the touchineſs of thoſe times required.</p>
                     <p>But theſe men knew not the juſt motives and pregnant grounds, with which I
thought My ſelf ſo furniſhed, that there needed nothing to ſuch evidence as I could
have produced againſt thoſe I charged, ſave only a free and legal Tryal, which was all
I deſired.</p>
                     <p>Nor had I any temptation of diſpleaſure or revenge againſt thoſe mens Perſons,
further than I had diſcovered thoſe (as I thought) unlawful correſpondencies they had
uſed, and engagements they had made, to embroyl My Kingdoms: of all which I
miſſed but little to have produced writings under ſome mens own hands, who were the
chief Contrivers of the following Innovations.</p>
                     <p>Providence would not have it ſo: yet I wanted not ſuch probabilities as were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to raiſe jealouſies in any Kings heart, who is not wholly ſtupid and neglective of the
publick Peace, which to preſerve by calling in queſtion half a dozen men in a fair and
Legal way (which God knows was all my deſign) could have amounted to no worſe
effect, had it ſucceeded, than either to do Me and My Kingdom right, in caſe they
had been found guilty; or elſe to have cleared their Innocency, and removed My Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions;
which, as they were not raiſed out of any Malice, ſo neither were they in

What flames of Diſcontent this ſpark (tho I ſought by all ſpeedy and poſſible means
to quench it) ſoon kindled, all the world is witneſs. The aſperſion which ſome men
caſt upon that action, as if I had deſigned by force to aſſault the Houſe of Commons,
and invade their Privilege, is ſo falſe, that as God beſt knows I had no ſuch intent, ſo
none that attended Me could juſtly gather from any thing I then ſaid or did, the leaſt
intimation of any ſuch thoughts.</p>
                     <p>That I went attended with ſome Gentlemen, as it was no unwonted thing for the
Majeſty and Safety of a King ſo to be attended, eſpecially in diſcontented times; ſo were
My Followers at that time ſhort of my ordinary Guard, and no way proportionable to
hazard a tumultuary conflict. Nor were they more ſcared at my coming, than I was
unaſſured of not having ſome affronts caſt upon Me, if I had none with Me to preſerve
a Reverence to Me: For many people had (at that time) learn'd to think thoſe hard
thoughts, which they have ſince abundantly vented againſt Me both by words and
deeds.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of that buſineſs was this:</p>
                     <p>Thoſe men and their adherents were then looked upon by the affrighted Vulgar as
greater Protectors of their Laws and Liberties than My ſelf, and ſo worthier of their
protection. I leave them to God and their own Conſciences, who, if guilty of evil
machinations, no preſent impunity or Popular vindications of them will be ſubterfuge
ſufficient to reſcue them from thoſe exact Tribunals.</p>
                     <p>To which, in the obſtructions of Juſtice among men, we muſt religiouſly appeal,
as being an argument to us Chriſtians of that after unavoidable Judgement, which ſhall
re-judge what among men is but corruptly decided, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>I endeavoured to have prevented, if God had ſeen fit, thoſe future Commotions
which I foreſaw. would in all likelihood follow ſome mens activity (if not reſtrained)
and ſo now have done, to the undoing of many thouſands; the more is the pity.</p>
                     <p>But to over-awe the Freedom of the Houſes, or to weaken their juſt Authority by
any violent impreſſions upon them, was not at all My deſign: I thought I had ſo
much Juſtice and Reaſon on My ſide, as ſhould not have needed ſo rough aſſiſtance;
and I was reſolved rather to bear the repulſe with Patience, than to uſe ſuch hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
extremities.</p>
                     <p>But thou, O Lord, art my witneſs in heaven, and in my heart: If I have purpoſed
any violence or oppreſſion against the Innocent, or if there were any ſuch wickedneſs in my
thoughts;</p>
                     <p>Then let the Enemy perſecute my Soul, and tread my life to the ground, and lay mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <p>Thou that ſeest not as man ſeeth, but lookeſt beyond all popular appearances, ſearching the
heart and trying the reins, and bringing to light the hidden things of darkneſs, ſhew thy

                     <p>Let not my Afflictions be eſteemed (as with wiſe and godly men they cannot be) any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

                     <p>But forgive them wherein they have done amiſs, though they are not puniſhed for it in this

                     <p>Which thoſe Tumults did to ſo high degrees of Inſolence, that they ſpared
not to invade the Honour and Freedom of the two Houſes, menacing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
ſhaking, yea and aſſaulting ſome Members of both Houſes, as they
fancied or diſliked them: Nor did they forbear moſt rude and unſeemly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
both in contemptuous words and actions, to My ſelf and My
Court.</p>
                     <p>Nor was this a ſhort fit or two of ſhaking, as an Ague, but a Quotidian Fever, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
encreaſing to higher inflammations, impatient of any mitigation, reſtraint, or
remiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they muſt be a Guard againſt thoſe Fears which ſome men ſcared themſelves
and others withall; when indeed nothing was more to be feared, and leſs to be
uſed by wiſe men, than thoſe Tumultuary confluxes of mean and rude people, who are
taught firſt to petition, then to protect, then to dictate, at laſt to command and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe
the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>All obſtructions in Parliament (that is, all freedom of differing in Votes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
matters with Reaſon and Candor) muſt be taken away with theſe Tumults:
By theſe muſt the Houſes be purged, and all Rotten Members (as they pleaſed to count
them) caſt out; by theſe the obſtinacy of men reſolved to diſcharge their Conſciences
muſt be ſubdued; by theſe all factious, ſeditious and ſchiſmatical Propoſals againſt
Government Eccleſiaſtical or Civil muſt be backed and abetted, till they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Generally, whoever had moſt mind to bring forth Confuſion and Ruin upon Church
and State, uſed the midwifery of thoſe Tumults: whoſe riot and impatience was
ſuch, that they would not ſtay the ripening and ſeaſon of Counſels, or fair production
of Acts in the order, gravity, and deliberateneſs befitting a Parliament; but ripped
up with barbarous cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive Votes, ſuch as their Inviters
and Encouragers moſt fancied.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſo enormous and deteſtable were their Outrages, that no ſober man could be
without an infinite ſhame and ſorrow to ſee them ſo tolerated and connived at by ſome;
countenanced, incouraged, and applauded by others.</p>
                     <p>What good man had not rather want any thing he moſt deſired for the publick good,
than obtain it by ſuch unlawful and irreligious means? But mens Paſſions and Gods
directions ſeldom agree: violent deſigns and motions muſt have ſuitable engines; ſuch
as too much attend their own Ends, ſeldom confine themſelves to Gods Means. Force
muſt crowd in what Reaſon will not lead.</p>
                     <p>Who were the chief Demagogues and Patrons of Tumults, to ſend for them, to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and embolden them, to direct and tune their clamorous importunities, ſome men
yet living are too conſcious to pretend ignorance: God in his due time will let theſe
ſee, that thoſe were no fit Means to be uſed for attaining his Ends.</p>
                     <p>But, as it is no ſtrange thing for the Sea to rage when ſtrong Winds blow upon it;
ſo neither for Multitudes to become inſolent, when they have men of ſome Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Parts and Piety to ſet them on.</p>
                     <p>That which made their Rudeneſs moſt formidable, was, that many complaints being
made, and Meſſages ſent by My ſelf and ſome of both Houſes, yet no order for redreſs
could be obtained with any vigor and efficacy, proportionable to the malignity of that
now far ſpread diſeaſe and predominant Miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Such was ſome mens Stupidity, that they feared no inconvenience; others Petulancy,
that they joyed to ſee their Betters ſhamefully outraged and abuſed, while they knew
their only ſecurity conſiſted in vulgar flattery: So inſenſible were they of Mine or the
two Houſes common Safety and Honours.</p>
                     <p>Nor could ever any order be obtained, impartially to examine, cenſure and puniſh
the known Boutefeus and impudent Incendiaries, who boaſted of the influence they
had, and uſed to convoke thoſe Tumults as their advantages ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſome (who ſhould have been wiſer Stateſmen) owned them as friends, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
their Courage, Zeal and Induſtry; which to ſober men could ſeem no better
than that of the Devil, who <hi>goes about ſeeking whom he may</hi> deceive and <hi>devour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confeſs, when I found ſuch a deafneſs, that no Declaration from the Biſhops, who
were firſt foully inſolenced and aſſaulted, nor yet from other Lords and Gentlemen of
Honour, nor yet from My ſelf, could take place for the due repreſſion of theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:60710:339"/>
and ſecuring not only Our freedom in Parliament, but Our very Perſons in
the ſtreets; I thought My ſelf not bound by My preſence to provoke them to higher
boldneſs and contempts; I hoped by My withdrawing, to give time both for the ebbing
of their tumultuous Fury, and others regaining ſome degrees of Modeſty and ſober
ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Some may interpret it as an effect of Puſillanimity in any man for Popular terrors,
to deſert his publick ſtation: But I think it a hardineſs beyond true Valour, for a wiſe
man to ſet himſelf againſt the breaking in of a Sea; which to reſiſt at preſent, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
imminent danger; but to withdraw, gives it ſpace to ſpend its fury, and gains a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time to repair the breach. Certainly, a Gallant man had rather fight to great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for number and place in the field, in an orderly way, than ſcuffle with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined
rabble.</p>
                     <p>Some ſuſpected and affirmed that I meditated a War, when I went from <hi>Whitehall</hi>
only to redeem My Perſon and Conſcience from violence: God knows I did not then
think of a War. Nor will any prudent man conceive that I would by ſo many former,
and ſome after Acts, have ſo much weakned My ſelf, if I had purpoſed to engage in a
War, which to decline by all means, I denied My ſelf in ſo many particulars: 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I had then no Army to flie unto for Protection or Vindication.</p>
                     <p>Who can blame Me, or any other, for withdrawing our ſelves from the daily bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Tumults, not knowing whether their Fury and Diſcontent might not flie ſo
high, as to worry and tear thoſe in pieces, whom as yet they but played with in their
paws? God, who is my ſole Judge, is my Witneſs in Heaven, that I never had any
thoughts of going from my houſe at <hi>White-hall,</hi> if I could have had but any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fair quarter: I was reſolved to bear much, and did ſo; but I did not think My ſelf
bound to proſtitute the Majeſty of My Place and Perſon, the ſafety of My Wife and
Children, to thoſe who are prone to inſult moſt, when they have objects and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
moſt capable of their rudeneſs and petulancy.</p>
                     <p>But this buſineſs of the Tumults (whereof ſome have given already an account to
God, others yet living know themſelves deſperately guilty) Time and the guilt of
many hath ſo ſmothered up and buried, that I think it beſt to leave it as it is; Only I
believe the juſt Avenger of all diſorders will in time make thoſe men and that City ſee
their Sin in the glaſs of their Puniſhment. 'Tis more than an even lay, that they may
one day ſee themſelves puniſhed by that way they offended.</p>
                     <p>Had this Parliament, as it was in its firſt Election and Conſtitution, ſate full and
free, the Members of both Houſes being left to their freedom of Voting, as in all
Reaſon, Honour and Religion they ſhould have been, I doubt not but things would
have been ſo carried, as would have given no leſs content to all good men than they
wiſhed or expected.</p>
                     <p>For I was reſolved to hear Reaſon in all things, and to conſent to it ſo far as I could
comprehend it: But as Swine are to Gardens and orderly Plantations, ſo are Tumults
to Parliaments, and Plebeian Concourſes to publick Counſels, turning all into Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and ſordid Confuſions.</p>
                     <p>I am prone ſometimes to think, that had I called this Parliament to any other place
in <hi>England</hi> (as I might opportunely enough have done) the ſad Conſequences in all
likelihood, with Gods Bleſſing, might have been prevented. A Parliament would have
been welcom in any place; no place afforded ſuch confluence of various and vicious
humours as that where it was unhappily convened. But we muſt leave all to God,
who orders our Diſorders, and magnifies his Wiſdom moſt when our Follies and miſeries
are moſt diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>But thou, O Lord, art my refuge and defence; to Thee I may ſafely fly, who ruleſt the
raging of the Sea, and the Madneſs of the People.</p>
                     <p>The floods, O Lord, the floods are come in upon Me, and are ready to overwhelm Me.</p>
                     <p>I look upon My Sins and the Sins of My People (which are the tumults of our Souls
againſt Thee, O Lord) as the juſt cauſe of theſe Popular inundations which Thou permitteſt
to over-bear all the banks of Loyalty, Modeſty, Laws, Juſtice and Religion.</p>
                     <p>But Thou that gatheredſt the waters into one place, and madeſt the dry land to appear,
and after didſt aſſwage the Flood which drowned the World by the word of thy power,
rebuke thoſe Beaſts of the People, and deliver Me from the Rudeneſs and ſtrivings of the
Multitude.</p>
                     <p>Reſtore, we beſeech Thee, unto us the freedoms of our Councels and Parliaments, make
us unpaſſionately to ſee the light of Reaſon and Religion, and with all order and gravity to
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:60710:340"/>
follow it, as it becomes Men and Chriſtians; ſo ſhall we praiſe thy Name, who art the God
of Order and Counſel.</p>
                     <p>What man cannot or will not repreſs, thy Omnipotent Juſtice can and will.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, give them that are yet living a timely ſenſe and ſorrow for their great ſin,
whom Thou knoweſt guilty of raiſing or not ſuppreſſing thoſe Diſorders: Let Shame here,
and not Suffering hereafter, be their Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Set bounds to our Paſſions by Reaſon, to our Errors by Truth, to our Seditions by Laws
duly executed, and to our Schiſms by Charity; that we may be, as thy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City

and after ſetling this, during the pleaſure of the Two
Houſes.</head>
                     <p>THAT the World might be fully confirmed in my purpoſes at firſt, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
what in Juſtice, Reaſon, Honour and Conſcience I could to the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of this Parliament, (which had in Me no other deſign but the general Good of
my Kingdoms) I willingly paſſed the BILL for Triennial Parliaments: which, as
gentle and ſeaſonable Phyſick, might (if well applied) prevent any diſtempers from
getting any head or prevailing; eſpecially, if the Remedy proved not a Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all remedy.</p>
                     <p>I conceived this Parliament would find work with convenient receſſes for the firſt
three years; but I did not imagine that ſome men would thereby have occaſioned
more work than they found to do, by undoing ſo much as they found well done to
their hands. Such is ſome mens activity, that they will needs make work rather
than want it; and chuſe to be doing amiſs, rather than do nothing.</p>
                     <p>When that firſt Act ſeemed too ſcanty to ſatisfie ſome mens Fears, and compaſs
publick Affairs; I was perſwaded to grant that BILL of Sitting during the pleaſure
of the Houſes, which amounted in ſome mens ſenſe to as much as the perpetuating
this Parliament. By this Act of higheſt Confidence, I hoped for ever to ſhut out and
lock the door upon all preſent Jealouſies and future Miſtakes: I confeſs I did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intend to ſhut My ſelf out of doors, as ſome men have now requited Me.</p>
                     <p>True, it was an Act unparallel'd by any of my Predeceſſors; yet cannot in reaſon
admit of any worſe interpretation than this, of an extreme Confidence I had, that
My Subjects would not make ill uſe of an Act, by which I declared ſo much to truſt
them, as to deny My ſelf in ſo high a point of my Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>For good Subjects will never think it juſt or fit, that My condition ſhould be worſe
by my bettering theirs: Nor indeed would it have been ſo in the events, if ſome men
had known as well with moderation to uſe, as with earneſtneſs to deſire, advantages
of doing good or evil.</p>
                     <p>A continual Parliament (I thought) would but keep the Common-weal in tune,
by preſerving Laws in their due execution and vigor, wherein My intereſt lies more
than any mans, ſince by thoſe Laws My Rights as a KING would be preſerved no
leſs than My Subjects; which is all I deſired. More than the Law gives Me I would
not have, and leſs the meaneſt Subject ſhould not.</p>
                     <p>Some (as I have heard) gave it out, that I ſoon repented Me of that ſetling Act;
and many would needs perſwade Me, I had cauſe ſo to do: but I could not eaſily nor
ſuddenly ſuſpect ſuch ingratitude in men of Honour, that the more I granted them,
the leſs I ſhould have and enjoy with them. I ſtill counted My ſelf undiminiſhed by
My largeſt Conceſſions, if by them I might gain and confirm the love of my People.</p>
                     <p>Of which I do not yet deſpair, but that God will ſtill bleſs Me with increaſe of it,
when Men ſhall have more leiſure and leſs prejudice; that ſo with unpaſſionate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
they may reflect upon thoſe (as I think) not more Princely than friendly
contributions which I granted towards the perpetuating of their Happineſs, who are
now only miſerable in this, That ſome mens ambition will not give them leave to enjoy
what I intended for their good.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I doubt but that in Gods due time, the Loyal and cleared affections of My
People will ſtrive to return ſuch retributions of Honour and Love to Me or My Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:60710:340"/>
as may fully compenſate both the acts of My Confidence and My Sufferings for
them; which (God knows) have been neither few, nor ſmall, nor ſhort; occaſioned
chiefly by a perſwaſion I had, that I could not grant too much, or diſtruſt too little,
to men, that being profeſſedly My Subjects, pretended ſingular Piety and Religious
ſtrictneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Injury of all Injuries is, that which ſome men will needs load Me withal, as if
were a wilful and reſolved Occaſioner of My own and My Subjects Miſeries; while
(as they confidently, but (God knows) falſly divulge) I repining at the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Parliament, endeavoured by force and open hoſtility to undo what by My
Royal aſſent I had done. Sure it had argued a very ſhort ſight of things, and extream
fatuity of mind in Me, ſo far to bind My own hands at their requeſt, if I had ſhortly
meant to have uſed a Sword againſt them. God knows, tho I had then a ſenſe of
Injuries; yet not ſuch, as to think them worth vindicating by a War: I was not then
compelled, as ſince, to injure My ſelf by their not uſing favours with the ſame Candor
wherewith they were conferred. The Tumults indeed threatned to abuſe all Acts of
Grace, and turn them into wantonneſs; but I thought at length their own Fears, whoſe
Black arts firſt raiſed up thoſe turbulent Spirits, would force them to conjure them
down again.</p>
                     <p>Nor if I had juſtly reſented any indignities put upon Me or others, was I then in
any capacity to have taken juſt revenge in an Hoſtile and Warlike way upon thoſe
whom I knew ſo well fortified in the love of the meaner ſort of the people, that I
could not have given My Enemies greater and more deſired advantages againſt Me,
than by ſo unprincely Inconſtancy to have aſſaulted them with Arms, thereby to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, whom but lately I had ſolemnly ſetled by an Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>God knows I longed for nothing more, than that My ſelf and My Subjects might
quietly enjoy the fruits of My many Condeſcendings.</p>
                     <p>It had been a courſe full of Sin, as well as of Hazard and Diſhonour, for Me to go
about the cutting up of that by the Sword which I had ſo lately planted, ſo much (as
I thought) to My Subjects content, and Mine own too, in all probability; if ſome
men had not feared where no fear was, whoſe ſecurity conſiſted in ſcaring others.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, I know ſo well the ſincerity and uprightneſs of My own Heart, in
paſſing that great BILL, which exceeded the very thoughts of former times, that
although I may ſeem leſs a Politician to men, yet I need no ſecret diſtinctions or evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before God. Nor had I any reſervations in My own Soul when I paſſed it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings
after, till I ſaw that My letting ſome men go up to the Pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was a temptation to them to caſt Me down headlong; concluding, that without a
Miracle, Monarchy it ſelf, together with Me, could not but be daſhed in pieces by
ſuch a precipitious fall as they intended. Whom God in mercy forgive, and make
them ſee at length, That as many Kingdoms as the Devil ſhewed our Saviour, and the
glory of them, (if they could be at once enjoyed by them) are not worth the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by ways of ſinful ingratitude and diſhonour, which hazards a Soul worth more
Worlds than this hath Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>But God hath hitherto preſerved Me, and made Me to ſee, that it is no ſtrange thing
for men left to their own Paſſions, either to do much evil themſelves, or abuſe the
overmuch goodneſs of others, whereof an ungrateful Surfeit is the moſt deſperate and
incurable diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſay properly that I repent of that Act, ſince I have no reflections upon it
as a Sin of my Will, tho an Error of too charitable a Judgment: Only I am ſorry
other mens eyes ſhould be evil, becauſe Mine were good.</p>
                     <p>To Thee (O my God) do I ſtill appeal, whoſe all-diſcerning Juſtice ſees through all the
diſguiſes of mens pretenſions, and deceitful darkneſſes of their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Thou gaveſt Me a heart to grant much to my Subjects; and now I need a heart fitted to
ſuffer much from ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>Thy will be done, tho never ſo much to the croſſing of ours, even when we hope to do what
might be moſt conformable to thine and theirs too who pretended they aimed at nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Let thy Grace teach Me wiſely to enjoy as well the fruſtratings, as the fulfillings of my
beſt hopes and moſt ſpecious deſires.</p>
                     <p>I ſee while I thought to allay others Fears, I have raiſed mine own; and by ſetling them,
have unſetled My ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus have they requited me evil for good, and hatred for my good will towards them.</p>

                     <p>I had formerly declared to ſober and moderate minds, how deſirous I was to give all

                     <p>So far am I from thinking the Majeſty of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to be bound by any
Coronation-Oath, in a blind and brutiſh formality to conſent to whatever its Subjects
in Parliament ſhall require, as ſome men will needs infer; while denying me any power
of a Negative voice as King, they are not aſhamed to ſeek to deprive Me of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of uſing My Reaſon with a good Conſcience, which themſelves and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of <hi>England</hi> enjoy proportionable to their influence on the publick, who would
take it very ill to be urged, not to deny whatever My ſelf as King, or the Houſe of
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:60710:341"/>
Peers with Me ſhould, not ſo much deſire as enjoyn them to paſs. I think My Oath
fully diſcharged in that point, by my Governing only by ſuch Laws as My People with
the Houſe of Peers have choſen, and My ſelf conſented to. I ſhall never think My
ſelf conſcientiouſly tied to go as oft againſt My Conſcience, as I ſhould conſent to ſuch
new Propoſals which My reaſon, in Juſtice, Honour and Religion bids Me deny.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſo tender I ſee ſome men are of their being ſubject to Arbitrary Government,
(that is, the Law of anothers will, to which themſelves give no conſent) that they
care not with how much diſhonour and abſurdity they make their King the only man
that muſt be ſubject to the will of others, without having power left him to uſe his own
Reaſon, either in Perſon, or by any Repreſentation.</p>
                     <p>And if my diſſentings at any time were (as ſome have ſuſpected and uncharitably
avowed) out of Error, Opinionativeneſs, Weakneſs, or Wilfulneſs, and what they
call Obſtinacy in Me (which not true Judgment of things, but ſome vehement Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
or Paſſion hath fixed on My Mind;) yet can no man think it other than the
badg and method of Slavery, by ſavage Rudeneſs and importunate obtruſions of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to have the miſt of his Error and Paſſion diſpelled, which is a ſhadow of Reaſon,
and muſt ſerve thoſe that are deſtitute of the ſubſtance. Sure that man cannot be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God or Man, who ſeriouſly endeavours to ſee the beſt reaſon of things, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
follows what he takes for Reaſon: The uprightneſs of his Intentions will excuſe the
poſſible failings of his Underſtanding. If a Pilot at Sea cannot ſee the Pole-ſtar, it can be no
fault in him to ſteer his courſe by ſuch Stars as do beſt appear to him. It argues rather thoſe
men to be conſcious of their defects of Reaſon and convincing Arguments, who call in
the aſſiſtance of mere force to carry on the weakneſs of their Counſels and Propoſals. I
may in the truth and uprightneſs of my Heart proteſt before God and Men, that I never
wilfully oppoſed or denied any thing that was in a fair way, after full and free debates,
propounded to Me by the Two Houſes, further than I thought in good Reaſon I might
and was bound to do.</p>
                     <p>Nor did any thing ever pleaſe Me more, than when My Judgment ſo concurred
with theirs, that I might with good Conſcience conſent to them: yea in many things,
where not abſolute and moral neceſſity of Reaſon, but temporary convenience on
point of Honour was to be conſidered, I choſe rather to deny My ſelf than them; as
preferring that which they thought neceſſary for My Peoples good, before what I ſaw
but convenient for My ſelf.</p>
                     <p>For I can be content to recede much from My own Intereſts and Perſonal Rights, of
which I conceive My ſelf to be Maſter; but in what concerns Truth, Juſtice, the
Rights of the Church, and my Crown, together with the general good of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
(all which I am bound to preſerve as much as morally lies in Me) here I am
and ever ſhall be fixt and reſolute; nor ſhall any man gain my conſent to that wherein
my Heart gives my Tongue or Hand the Lye; nor will I be brought to affirm that
to Men, which in my Conſcience I denied before God. I will rather chuſe to wear a
Crown of Thorns with My Saviour, than to exchange that of Gold (which is due
to Me) for one of Lead, whoſe embaſed flexibleneſs ſhall be forced to bend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the various and oft contrary dictates of any Factions; when in ſtead of Reaſon
and Publick Concernments, they obtrude nothing but what makes for the intereſt of
Parties, and flows from the partialities of private Wills and Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>I know no reſolutions more worthy a Chriſtian King, than to prefer his Conſcience
before his Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>O my God, preſerve thy Servant in this Native, Rational and Religious Freedom; for
this I believe is thy will that we ſhould maintain: who, though Thou doſt juſtly require us to
ſubmit our Vnderſtandings and Wills to thine, whoſe Wiſdom and Goodneſs can neither err
nor miſguide us, and ſo far to deny our carnal Reaſon in order to thy Sacred Myſteries and
Commands, that we ſhould believe and obey rather than diſpute them; yet dost Thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from us only ſuch a reaſonable Service of Thee, as not to do any thing for Thee againſt
our Conſciences; and as to the deſires of men, enjoineſt us to try all things by the touch-ſtone
of Reaſon and Laws, which are the Rules of Civil Juſtice, and to declare our Conſents to
that only which our Judgments approve.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt, O Lord, how unwilling I was to deſert that place in which Thou haſt ſet
Me, and whereto the Affairs of My Kingdoms at preſent do call Me.</p>
                     <p>My People can witneſs how far I have been content for their good, to deny My ſelf in what
Thou haſt ſubjected to My diſpoſal.</p>
                     <p>O let not the unthankful importunities and Tumultuary Violence of ſome mens Immoderate
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:60710:342"/>
demands, ever betray Me to that dangerous and unmanly ſlavery, which ſhould make Me
ſtrengthen them by my Conſent in thoſe things which I think in my Conſcience to be againſt
thy Glory, the good of my Subjects, and the diſcharge of my own duty to Reaſon and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Make Me willing to ſuffer the greateſt Indignities and Injuries they preſs upon Me, rather
than commit the least ſin againſt my Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Let the just Liberties of my People be (as well they may) preſerved in fair and equal
ways, without the ſlavery of my Soul.</p>
                     <p>Thou that hast inveſted Me by thy Favours in the power of a Chriſtian King, ſuffer Me
not to ſubject my Reaſon to other mens Paſſions and Deſigns, which to Me ſeem unreaſonable,
unjuſt and irreligious: So ſhall I ſerve Thee in the truth and uprightneſs of my Heart, tho
I cannot ſatisfie theſe men.</p>
                     <p>Though I be driven from among them, yet give Me grace to walk always uprightly before
Thee.</p>
                     <p>Lead Me in the way of Truth and Juſtice: for theſe, I know, will bring Me at laſt to
Peace and Happineſs with Thee; though for theſe I have much trouble among men.</p>

ENGLAND.</head>
                     <p>ALthough I have much cauſe to be troubled at my Wifes departure from Me, and
out of my Dominions; yet not her abſence ſo much as the ſcandal of that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
which drives Her away, doth afflict Me: That She ſhould be compelled by My
own Subjects, and thoſe pretending to be Proteſtants, to withdraw for her Safety:
This being the firſt example of any Proteſtant Subjects that have taken up Arms againſt
their King, a Proteſtant. For I look upon this now done in <hi>England,</hi> as another Act
of the ſame Tragedy which was lately begun in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the brands of that fire being
ill quenched, have kindled the like flames here. I fear ſuch motions (ſo little to the
adorning of the Proteſtant profeſſion) may occaſion a further alienation of Mind and
divorce of Affections in Her from that Religion, which is the only thing wherein We
differ.</p>
                     <p>Which yet God can, and I pray he would, in time take away, and not ſuffer theſe
practices to be any obſtruction to her Judgment, ſince it is the motion of thoſe men
(for the moſt part) who are yet to ſeek and ſettle their Religion for Doctrine, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and good Manners, and ſo not to be imputed to the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants,
who continue firm to their former ſetled Principles and Laws.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry my relation to ſo deſerving a Lady ſhould be any occaſion of her Danger
and Affliction, whoſe Merits would have ſerved her for a protection among the ſavage
<hi>Indians,</hi> while their Rudeneſs and Barbarity knows not ſo perfectly to hate all Virtues
as ſome mens Subtilty doth; among whom I yet think few are ſo malicious as to hate
Her for Her ſelf. The fault is, That She is my Wife.</p>
                     <p>All Juſtice then as well as Affection commands Me to ſtudy Her Security, who is
only in danger for My ſake. I am content to be toſſed, weather-beaten, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt,
ſo as She may be in ſafe Harbor.</p>
                     <p>This comfort I ſhall enjoy by Her Safety in the midſt of My Perſonal Dangers, that
I can periſh but half if She be preſerved: In whoſe Memory and hopeful Poſterity
I may yet ſurvive the Malice of My Enemies, altho they ſhould be ſatiated with my
Blood.</p>
                     <p>I muſt leave her and Them to the Love and Loyalty of my good Subjects, and to
his Protection who is able to puniſh the Faults of Princes, and no leſs ſeverely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Injuries done to Them by thoſe who in all duty and Allegiance ought to
have made good that Safety which the Laws chiefly provide for Princes.</p>
                     <p>But common Civility is in vain expected from thoſe that diſpute their Loyalty:
Nor can it be ſafe (for any relation) to a King, to tarry among them who are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hands with their Allegiance, under pretence of laying faſter hold on their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis pity ſo noble and peaceful a Soul ſhould ſee, much more ſuffer the Rudeneſs of
thoſe who muſt make up their want of Juſtice with Inhumanity and Impudence.</p>
                     <p>Her ſympathy with Me in my Afflictions will make her Virtues ſhine with greater
luſtre, as Stars in the darkeſt nights, and aſſure the envious world that She loves Me,
not my Fortunes.</p>

Neither of Us but can eaſily forgive, ſince We do not much blame the unkindneſs
of the Generality and Vulgar: for we ſee God is pleaſed to try both our Patience by
the moſt ſelf-puniſhing ſin, the Ingratitude of thoſe, who having eaten of our Bread,
and being enriched with our Bounty, have ſcornfully lift up themſelves againſt Us; and
thoſe of our own Houſhold are become our Enemies. I pray God lay not their ſin to
their charge, who think to fatisfie all obligations to duty by their Corban of Religion;
and can leſs endure to ſee, than to ſin againſt, their Benefactors as well as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</p>
                     <p>But even that Policy of my Enemies is ſo far venial as it was neceſſary to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,

                     <p>The leſs I may be bleſt with her company, the more I will retire to God, and my own

                     <p>Let both our hearts agree in the Love of thy ſelf, and Christ crucified for us.</p>

                     <p>Let neither Ignorance of what is neceſſary to be known, nor Vnbelief or Diſobedience to

                     <p>Let not this great Scandal of thoſe my Subjects which profeſs the ſame Religion with Me,
be any hindrance to her love of any Truth thou wouldſt have Her to learn, nor any hardning
of Her in any Error Thou wouldst have cleared to Her.</p>
                     <p>Let mine and other mens Conſtancy be an Antidote against the poyſon of their Example.</p>
                     <p>Let the truth of that Religion I profeſs be repreſented to Her Judgment with all the
beauties of Humility, Loyalty, Charity, and Peaceableneſs; which are the proper fruits and
ornaments of it: not in the odious diſguiſes of Levity, Schiſm, Hereſie, Novelty, Cruelty,
and Diſloyalty, which ſome mens practices have lately put upon it.</p>
                     <p>Let Her ſee thy Sacred and Saving Truths as Thine, that She may believe, love and obey

                     <p>The experience We have of the vanity and uncertainty of all human Glory and Greatneſs

fates of the HOTHAMS.</head>
                     <p>MY repulſe at <hi>Hull</hi> ſeemed at the firſt view an act of ſo rude Diſloyalty, that my
greateſt Enemies had ſcarce confidence enough to abet or own it: It was the
firſt overt Eſſay to be made, how patiently I could bear the loſs of my Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>God knows it affected Me more with ſhame and ſorrow for others, than with Anger
for My ſelf: nor did the Affront done to Me trouble Me ſo much as their Sin, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no colour or excuſe.</p>
                     <p>I was reſolved how to bear this and much more with Patience: But I foreſaw they
could hardly contain themſelves within the compaſs of this one unworthy act, who
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:60710:343"/>
had effrontery enough to commit or countenance it. This was but the hand of that
Cloud which was ſoon after to overſpread the whole Kingdom, and caſt all into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis among the wicked Maxims of bold and diſloyal undertakers, That bad acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt always be ſeconded with worſe, and rather not be begun, than not carried on;
for they think the retreat more dangerous than the aſſault, and hate repentance more
than perſeverance in a Fault.</p>
                     <p>This gave me to ſee clearly through all the pious diſguiſes and ſoft palliations
of ſome men; whoſe words were ſometime ſmoother than oyl, but now I ſaw they
would prove very Swords.</p>
                     <p>Againſt which I having (as yet) no defence but that of a good Conſcience,
thought it my beſt Policy, with Patience to bear what I could not remedy. And in this
(I thank God) I had the better of <hi>Hotham,</hi> that no diſdain or emotion of Paſſion
tranſported Me, by the indignity of his carriage, to do or ſay any thing unbeſeeming
My ſelf, or unſuitable to that temper which in greateſt Injuries, I think, beſt becomes
a Chriſtian, as coming neareſt to the great example of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, I deſire always more to remember I am a Chriſtian than a King: for
what the Majeſty of the one might juſtly abhor, the Charity of the other is willing to
bear; what the height of a King tempteth to revenge, the humility of a Chriſtian
teacheth to forgive. Keeping in compaſs all thoſe impotent Paſſions, whoſe exceſs
injures a man more than his greateſt enemies can: for theſe give their Malice a full
impreſſion on our Souls, which otherways cannot reach very far, nor do us much
hurt.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but obſerve how God not long after ſo pleaded and avenged my Cauſe in
the eye of the world, that the moſt wilfully blind cannot avoid the diſpleaſure to ſee
it, and with ſome remorſe and fear to own it as a notable ſtroke, and prediction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance.</p>
                     <p>For Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> unreproached, unthreatned, uncurſed by any language or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
imprecation of Mine, only blaſted with the Conſcience of his own Wickedneſs,
and falling from one Inconſtancy to another, not long after pays his own and his eldeſt
Sons heads as forfeitures of their Diſloyalty, to thoſe men from whom ſurely he
might have expected another reward, than thus to divide their Heads from their bodies,
whoſe Hearts with them were divided from their KING.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it ſtrange, that they who imployed them at firſt in ſo high a ſervice and ſo
ſucceſsful to them, ſhould not find mercy enough to forgive him who had ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
of them: For Apoſtaſie unto Loyalty ſome men account the moſt unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſin.</p>
                     <p>Nor did a ſolitary Vengeance ſerve the turn; the cutting off one Head in a Family
is not enough to expiate the affront done to the Head of the Common-weal: The eldeſt
Son muſt be involved in the puniſhment, as he was infected with the ſin of the Father
againſt the Father of his Country: Root and Branch God cuts off in one day.</p>
                     <p>Theſe obſervations are obvious to every fancy. God knows, I was ſo far from rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the <hi>Hothams</hi> ruin, (tho it were ſuch as was able to give the greateſt thirſt for
revenge a full draught, being executed by them who firſt employed him againſt Me)
that I ſo far pitied him, as I thought he at firſt acted more againſt the light of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
than I hope many other men do in the ſame Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>For he was never thought to be of that ſuperſtitious ſowreneſs which ſome men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to in matters of Religion; which ſo darkens their Judgment, that they cannot
ſee any thing of Sin and Rebellion in thoſe means they uſe, with intents to reform to
their Models, of what they call Religion, who think all is gold of Piety, which doth
but gliſter with a ſhew of Zeal and fervency.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> was (I think) a man of another temper, and ſo moſt liable to
thoſe down-right temptations of Ambition, which have no cloak or cheat of Religion
to impoſe upon themſelves or others.</p>
                     <p>That which makes Me more pity him is, that after he began to have ſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
towards a repentance for his ſin and reparation of his Duty to Me, he ſhould be
ſo unhappy as to fall into the hands of their Juſtice, and not My Mercy, who could
as willingly have forgiven him as he could have asked that favour of Me.</p>
                     <p>For I think Clemency a debt which we ought to pay to thoſe that crave it, when
we have cauſe to believe they would not after abuſe it; ſince God himſelf ſuffers us not
to pay any thing for his Mercy, but only Prayers and Praiſes.</p>
                     <p>Poor Gentleman, he is now become a notable monument of unproſperous Diſloyalty,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:60710:343"/>
teaching the world by ſo ſad and unfortunate a ſpectacle, That the rude carriage of a
Subject towards his Soveraign carries always its own Vengeance as an unſeparable ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
with it; and thoſe oft prove the moſt fatal and implacable Executioners of it,
who were the firſt Employers in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>After-times will diſpute it, whether <hi>Hotham</hi> were more infamous at <hi>Hull</hi> or at <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill:</hi>

moſt indeleble characters of infamy the name and memory to Poſterity, who not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Factions of the times, have the moſt impartial reflections on the actions.</p>
                     <p>But Thou, O Lord, who haſt in ſo remarkable a way avenged thy Servant, ſuffer Me
not to take any ſecret pleaſure in it; for as his death hath ſatisfied the Injury he did
to Me, ſo let Me not by it gratifie any Paſſion in Me, lest I make thy vengeance to be mine,
and conſider the affront againſt Me more than the ſin againſt Thee.</p>
                     <p>Thou indeed, without any deſire or endeavour of Mine, hast made his miſchief to return on

                     <p>Thou haſt pleaded my Cauſe, even before the ſons of men, and taken the matter into thine

                     <p>Lord, lay not their ſins (who yet live) to their charge for condemnation, but to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
for amendment: Let the lightning of this thunderbolt, which hath been ſo ſevere a

                     <p>Diſcover to them their ſin, who know not they have done amiſs; and ſcare them from their

                     <p>That preventing thy Judgments by their true Repentance, they may eſcape the ſtrokes of

                     <p>Hear my Prayer, O Lord, who haſt taught us to pray for, to do good to, and to love our

                     <head>IX. Vpon the liſting and raiſing Armies againſt the KING.</head>
                     <p>I Find that I am at the ſame point and poſture I was when they forced Me to leave
<hi>White-hall:</hi> what Tumults could not do, an Army muſt; which is but Tumults
liſted, and enrolled to a better order, but as bad an End. My receſs hath given them
confidence that I may be conquered.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I eaſily may, as to any outward ſtrength, which, God knows, is little or
none at all: But I have a Soul invincible through Gods grace enabling Me; here I am
ſure to be Conqueror, if God will give Me ſuch a meaſure of Conſtancy as to fear
him more than man, and to love the inward peace of my Conſcience before any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>And muſt I be oppoſed with Force, becauſe they have not Reaſon wherewith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Me? O my Soul be of good courage; they confeſs their known weakneſs as
to Truth and Juſtice, who chuſe rather to contend by Armies than by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Is this the reward and thanks that I am to receive for thoſe many Acts of Grace I
have lately paſſed, and for thoſe many Indignities I have endured? Is there no way left
to make Me a Glorious KING, but by my Sufferings?</p>
                     <p>It is hard and diſputable choice for a King, that loves his People, and deſires their
love, either to kill his own Subjects, or to be killed by them.</p>
                     <p>Are the hazards and miſeries of Civil War in the bowels of my moſt flouriſhing
Kingdom, the fruits I muſt now reap after Seventeen years living and Reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:60710:344"/>
them with ſuch a meaſure of Juſtice, Peace, Plenty and Religion, as all Nations
about either admired or envied? Notwithſtanding ſome Miſcarriages in Government,
which might eſcape rather through ill counſel of ſome men driving on their private
ends, or the peeviſhneſs of others, envying the Publick ſhould be managed without
them, or the hidden and inſuperable neceſſities of State, than any propenſity, I hope,
of My ſelf either to Injuriouſneſs or Oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe innocent blood during my Reign have I ſhed to ſatisfy my Luſt, Anger, or
Covetouſneſs? What Widows or Orphans tears can witneſs againſt Me, the juſt cry of
which muſt now be avenged with My own Blood? For the hazards of War are equal,
nor doth the Cannon know any reſpect of Perſons.</p>
                     <p>In vain is my Perſon excepted by a Parentheſis of Words, when ſo many hands are
Armed againſt Me with Swords.</p>
                     <p>God knows how much I have ſtudied, to ſee what Ground of Juſtice is alledged for
this War againſt Me; that ſo I might (by giving juſt ſatisfaction) either prevent, or
ſoon end ſo unnatural a motion: which (to many men) ſeems rather the production
of a ſurfeit of Peace, and wantonneſs of minds, or of private diſcontents, Ambition
and Faction (which eaſily find or make cauſes of quarrel) than any real obſtruction of
publick Juſtice or Parliamentary Priviledg.</p>
                     <p>But this is pretended, and this I muſt be able to avoid and anſwer before God in my
own Conſcience, however ſome men are not willing to believe Me, leſt they ſhould
condemn themſelves.</p>
                     <p>When I firſt withdrew from <hi>White-hall,</hi> to ſee if I could allay the Inſolency of the
Tumults, (of the not ſuppreſſing of which no account in Reaſon can be given, (where
an orderly Guard was granted) but only to oppreſs both Mine and the Two Houſes
freedom of declaring and voting according to every mans Conſcience) what obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Juſtice were there further than this, that what ſeemed juſt to one man, might
not ſeem ſo to another?</p>
                     <p>Whom did I by power protect againſt the Juſtice of Parliament?</p>
                     <p>That ſome men withdrew, who feared the partiality of their tryal, (warned by my
Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s death) while the Vulgar threatned to be their Oppreſſors, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of their Judges, was from that inſtinct which is in all creatures to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
If any others refuſed to appear, where they evidently ſaw the current of
Juſtice and Freedom ſo ſtopped and troubled by the Rabble, that their lawful Judges
either durſt not come to the Houſes, or not declare their ſenſe with liberty and ſafety;
it cannot ſeem ſtrange to any reaſonable man, when the ſole expoſing them to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Odium</hi> was enough to ruine them, before their Cauſe could be heard or tried.</p>
                     <p>Had not factious Tumults overborn the Freedom and Honor of the Two Houſes;
had they aſſerted their Juſtice againſt them, and made the way open for all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
quietly to come and declare their Conſciences; I know no man ſo dear to Me,
whom I had the leaſt inclination to adviſe either to withdraw himſelf, or deny appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their Summons, to whoſe Sentence according to Law (I think) every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
bound to ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Diſtempers (indeed) were riſen to ſo great a height, for want of timely repreſſing
the vulgar Inſolencies, that the greateſt guilt of thoſe which were Voted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
as Delinquents was this, That they would not ſuffer themſelves to be over-aw'd
with the Tumults and their Patrons, nor compelled to abet by their ſuffrages or
preſence, the deſigns of thoſe men who agitated Innovations and Ruin both in Church
and State.</p>
                     <p>In this point I could not but approve their generous Conſtancy and Cautiouſneſs:
further than this I did never allow any mans refractorineſs againſt the Priviledges and
Orders of the Houſes; to whom I wiſhed nothing more than Safety, Fulneſs and Freedom.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, ſome men, and thoſe not many, deſpairing in fair and Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ways, by free deliberations and Votes, to gain the concurrence of the major part
of Lords and Commons, betook themſelves (by the deſperate activity of factious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults)
to ſift and terrifie away all thoſe Members whom they ſaw to be of contrary
minds to their purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>How oft was the buſineſs of the Biſhops enjoying their Ancient places and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Priviledges in the Houſe of Peers carried for them by far the major part of Lords?
Yet after five repulſes, contrary to all Order and Cuſtom, it was by tumultuary inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
obtruded again, and by a few carried, when moſt of the Peers were forced to
abſent themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="663" facs="tcp:60710:344"/>
In like manner was the Bill againſt Root and Branch brought on by tumultuary Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and ſchiſmatical Terrors, which could never paſs till both Houſes were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
thinned and over-awed.</p>
                     <p>To which Partiality while in all Reaſon, Juſtice and Religion, my Conſcience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
Me by conſenting to make up their Votes to Acts of Parliament; I muſt now be
urged with an Army, and conſtrained either to hazard My own and My Kingdoms
ruine by My Defence; or proſtrate My Conſcience to the blind obedience of thoſe
men, whoſe zealous Superſtition thinks, or pretends, they cannot do God and the
Church a greater ſervice, than utterly to deſtroy that Primitive, Apoſtolical, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently-Univerſal
Government of the Church by Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Which if other mens Judgments bind them to maintain, or forbid them to conſent
to the aboliſhing of it, Mine much more; who, beſides the grounds I have in My
Judgment, have alſo a moſt ſtrict and indiſpenſable Oath upon my Conſcience, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that Order and the Rights of the Church: to which moſt Sacrilegious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
Perjury, moſt unbeſeeming a Chriſtian King, ſhould I ever by giving My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be betrayed, I ſhould account it infinitely greater Miſery than any hath or can
befal Me; inaſmuch as the leaſt Sin hath more evil in it than the greateſt Affliction.
Had I gratified their Anti-epiſcopal Faction at firſt in this point with My Conſent, and
ſacrificed the Eccleſiaſtical Government and Revenues to the fury of their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Ambition and Revenge, I believe they would then have found no colourable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of raiſing an Army to fetch in and puniſh Delinquents.</p>
                     <p>That I conſented to the Bill of putting the Biſhops out of the Houſe of Peers, was
done with a firm perſwaſion of their contentedneſs to ſuffer a preſent diminution in
their Rights and Honour for My ſake and the Common-weals; which I was confident
they would readily yield unto, rather than occaſion (by the leaſt obſtruction on their
part) any danger to Me or to My Kingdom. That I cannot add my conſent for the
total Extirpation of that Government, (which I have often offered to all fit Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
hath ſo much further tie upon My Conſcience, as what I think Religious and
Apoſtolical, and ſo very Sacred and Divine, is not to be diſpenſed with or deſtroyed,
when what is only of civil Favour and priviledg of Honour granted to men of that
Order, may with their Conſent who are concerned in it be annulled.</p>
                     <p>This is the true ſtate of thoſe Obſtructions pretended to be in point of Juſtice and
Authority of Parliament; when I call God to witneſs, I knew none of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as was worth ſpeaking of to make a War, being only ſuch as Juſtice, Reaſon
and Religion had made in My own and other mens Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards indeed a great ſhew of Delinquents was made; which were but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
neceſſarily following upon Mine or others withdrawing from, or defence
againſt Violence: but thoſe could not be the firſt occaſion of raiſing an Army againſt
Me. Wherein I was ſo far from preventing them, (as they have declared often, that
they might ſeem to have the advantage and Juſtice of the defenſive part, and load Me
with all the Envy and Injuries of firſt aſſaulting them) that God knows, I had not ſo
much as any hopes of an Army in my thoughts. Had the Tumults been honourably
and effectually repreſſed by exemplary Juſtice, and the Liberty of the Houſes ſo vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
that all Members of either Houſe might with Honour and Freedom, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a Senate, have come and diſcharged their Conſciences, I had obtained all that
I deſigned by my withdrawing, and had much more willingly and ſpeedily returned
than I retired; this being my Neceſſity driving, the other my Choice deſiring.</p>
                     <p>But ſome men knew, I was like to bring the ſame Judgment and Conſtancy which I
carried with Me, which would never fit their Deſigns; and ſo while they invited Me
to come, and grievouſly complained of my Abſence, yet they could not but be pleaſed
with it; eſpecially when they had found out that plauſible and popular pretext, of
raiſing an Army to fetch in Delinquents: when all that while they never puniſhed the
greateſt and moſt intolerable Delinquency of the Tumults and their Exciters, which
drave My ſelf, and ſo many of both Houſes from their places, by moſt barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities;
which yet in all Reaſon and Honour they were as loath to have deſerted, as
thoſe others were willing they ſhould, that ſo they might have occaſion to perſecute
them with the Injuries of an Army, for not ſuffering more tamely the Injuries of the
Tumults.</p>
                     <p>That this is the true ſtate and firſt drift and deſign in raiſing an Army againſt Me, is
by the ſequel ſo evident that all other pretences vaniſh. For when they declared by
Propoſitions, or Treaties, what they would have to appeaſe them; there was nothing
of conſequence offered to Me, or demanded of Me, as any original difference in any
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:60710:345"/>
point of Law or order of Juſtice. But among other leſſer Innovations, this chiefly
was urged, The Abolition of Epiſcopal, and the Eſtabliſhment of Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>All other things at any time propounded were either impertinent as to any ground
of a War, or eaſily granted by Me, and only to make up a number; or elſe they
were merely conſequential and acceſſary, after the War was by them unjuſtly begun.</p>
                     <p>I cannot hinder other mens thoughts, whom the noiſe and ſhew of Piety and heat
for Reformation and Religion might eaſily ſo fill with Prejudice, that all equality and
clearneſs of Judgment might be obſtructed. But this was and is, as to my beſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the true ſtate of affairs between us, when they firſt raiſed an Army, with this
deſign, either to ſtop my mouth, or to force my Conſent. And in this truth, as to
my Conſcience, (who was (God knows) as far from meditating a War, as I was
in the eye of the world from having any preparation for one) I find that comfort, that
in the midſt of all the unfortunate ſucceſſes of this War on My ſide, I do not think
My Innocency any whit prejudiced or darkned; nor am I without that Integrity and
Peace before God, as with humble confidence to addreſs my Prayer to him.</p>
                     <p>For Thou, O Lord, ſeeſt clearly through all the cloudings of humane affairs; Thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
without prejudice: Thy Omniſcience eternally guides thy unerrable Judgment.</p>
                     <p>O my God, the proud are riſen againſt Me, and the aſſemblies of violent men have ſought
after my Soul, and have not ſet Thee before their eyes.</p>
                     <p>Conſider my Enemies, O Lord, for they are many; and they hate Me with a deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
without a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>For thou knoweſt, I had no Paſſion, Deſign or Preparation to embroil My Kingdoms in a
Civil War; whereto I had leaſt temptation, as knowing I muſt adventure more than any,
and could gain leaſt of any by it.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, art my witneſs how oft I have deplored, and ſtudied to divert the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
thereof; wherein I cannot well be thought ſo prodigally thirſty of my Subjects blood, as
to venture my own Life, which I have been oft compelled to do in this unhappy War; and
which were better ſpent to ſave, than to deſtroy my People.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, I need much of thy grace, with Patience to bear the many Afflictions Thou haſt
ſuffered ſome men to bring upon Me: but much more to bear the unjuſt reproaches of thoſe,
who not content that I ſuffer moſt by the War, will needs perſwade the world that I have
raiſed it firſt, or given juſt cauſe to raiſe it.</p>
                     <p>The confidence of ſome mens falſe tongues is ſuch, that they would make Me almoſt ſuſpect
my own Innocency: Yea, I could be content (at leaſt by my ſilence) to take upon Me ſo great
a guilt before men, if by that I might allay the Malice of my Enemies, and redeem my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from this miſerable War; ſince thou, O Lord, knoweſt my Innocency in this thing.</p>
                     <p>Thou wilt find out bloody and deceitful men; many of whom have not lived out half their
days, in which they promiſed themſelves the enjoyment of the fruits of their violent and
wicked Counſels.</p>
                     <p>Save, O Lord, thy Servant, as hitherto Thou haſt; and in thy due time ſcatter the
people that delight in War.</p>
                     <p>Ariſe, O Lord, lift up thy ſelf, becauſe of the rage of mine Enemies, which encreaſeth
more and more: Behold them that have conceived miſchief, travelled with iniquity, and
brought forth falſhood.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt the chief deſign of this War is, either to deſtroy My Perſon, or force My
Judgment, and to make Me renege My Conſcience and Thy Truth.</p>
                     <p>I am driven to croſs <hi>David</hi>'s choice, and deſire rather to fall into the hands of men, by
denying them, (tho their mercies be cruel) than into thy hands, by ſinning againſt My
Conſcience, and in that againſt Thee, who art a conſuming fire: Better they deſtroy Me,
than thou ſhouldſt damn Me.</p>
                     <p>Be thou ever the defence of My Soul, who wilt ſave the upright in heart.</p>
                     <p>If nothing but My Blood will ſatisfie My Enemies, or quench the flames of My Kingdoms,
or Thy temporal Justice, I am content, if it be Thy will, that it be ſhed by Mine own
Subjects hands.</p>
                     <p>But O let the Blood of Me, tho their King, yet a Sinner, be waſhed with the Blood of
My innocent and peace-making Redeemer; for in that Thy Juſtice will find not only a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
expiation, but an eternal plenary ſatisfaction, both for My ſins and the ſins of My
People: whom I beſeech thee ſtill own for Thine; and when Thy wrath is appeaſed by My
Death, O remember thy great Mercies toward them, and forgive them, O My Father, for
they know not what they do.</p>

and Militia.</head>
                     <p>HOW untruly I am charged with the firſt raiſing of an Army, and beginning the
Civil War, the eyes that only pity Me, and the Loyal hearts that durſt only
pray for Me at firſt, might witneſs, which yet appear not ſo many on My ſide, as
there were men in Arms lifted againſt Me. My unpreparedneſs for a War may well
diſhearten thoſe that would help Me; while it argues (truly) my unwillingneſs to
fight, yet it teſtifies for Me, that I am ſet on the defenſive part; having ſo little hopes
or power to offend others, that I have none to defend My ſelf, or to preſerve what is
Mine own from their prereption.</p>
                     <p>No man can doubt but they prevented Me in their purpoſes as well as their injuries,
who are ſo much before-hand in their Preparations againſt Me, and ſurprizals of My
ſtrength. Such as are not for Them, yet dare not be for Me; ſo over-aw'd is their
Loyalty by the others Numbers and Terrors. I believe My Innocency and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs
to aſſert My Rights and Honour, makes Me the more guilty in their eſteem;
who would not ſo eaſily have declared a War againſt Me, if I had firſt aſſaulted
them.</p>
                     <p>They knew My chiefeſt Arms left Me, were thoſe only which the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
were wont to uſe againſt their Perſecutors, <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears.</hi> Theſe may ſerve
a good mans turn, if not to Conquer as a Soldier, yet to Suffer as a Martyr.</p>
                     <p>Their preventing of Me, and ſurprizing My Caſtles, Forts, Arms and Navy, with
the Militia, is ſo far beſt for Me, that it may drive Me from putting any truſt in the
arm of fleſh, and wholly to caſt My ſelf into the protection of the living God, who
can ſave by few or none, as well as by many.</p>
                     <p>He that made the greedy Ravens to be <hi>Elias</hi>'s Caterers, and bring him food, may
alſo make their ſurpriſal of outward Force and Defence, an opportunity to ſhew Me
the ſpecial ſupport of his Power and Protection.</p>
                     <p>I thank God I reckon not now the want of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſo much in reference to My
own protection, as My Peoples.</p>
                     <p>Their many and ſore Oppreſſions grieve Me; I am above My own: what I want in
the hands of Force and Power, I have in the wings of Faith and Prayer.</p>
                     <p>But this is the ſtrange method theſe men will needs take, to reſolve their Riddle of
making Me a Glorious King, by taking away My Kingly Power: Thus I ſhall become
a Support to My Friends, and a Terror to my Enemies, by being unable to ſuccour the
one, or ſuppreſs the other.</p>
                     <p>For thus have they deſigned and propoſed to Me the new modelling of Soveraignty
and Kingſhip, as without any reality of Power, ſo without any neceſſity of Subjection
and Obedience: That the Majeſty of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> might hereafter hang, like
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, by a magnetick Charm, between the Power and Priviledges of the
Two Houſes, in an aiery imagination of Regality.</p>
                     <p>But I believe the ſurfeit of too much Power which ſome men have greedily ſeized
on, and now ſeek wholly to devour, will ere long make the Common-wealth ſick both
of it and them, ſince they cannot well digeſt it; Soveraign Power in Subjects ſeldom
agreeing with the ſtomacks of fellow-Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Yet I have even in this point of the conſtant <hi>Militia</hi> ſought, by ſatisfying
their Fears and importunities, both to ſecure My Friends, and overcome Mine
Enemies, to gain the peace of all, by depriving My ſelf of a ſole power
to help or hurt any; yielding the <hi>Militia</hi> (which is My undoubted Right no
leſs than the Crown) to be diſpoſed of as the Two Houſes ſhall think fit during
My time.</p>
                     <p>So willing am I to bury all Jealouſies in them of Me, and to live above all
Jealouſies of them as to My ſelf: I deſire not to be ſafer than I wiſh them
and My People. If I had the ſole actual diſpoſing of the <hi>Militia,</hi> I could not
protect My People further than they protected Me and themſelves: ſo that the uſe
of the <hi>Militia</hi> is mutual. I would but defend My ſelf ſo far, as to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
My good Subjects from thoſe mens violence and fraud, who, conſcious to their
own evil merits and deſigns, will needs perſwade the World, That none but Wolves
are fit to be truſted with the cuſtody of the Shepherd and his Flock. Miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:60710:346"/>
hath taught My Subjects, ſince Power hath been wreſted from Me, and
employed againſt Me and them, That neither can be ſafe, if both be not in ſuch a way
as the Law hath entruſted the publick ſafety and welfare.</p>
                     <p>Yet even this Conceſſion of Mine as to the exerciſe of the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo vaſt and
large, is not ſatisfactory to ſome men; which ſeem to be Enemies not to Me only,
but to all Monarchy; and are reſolved to tranſmit to Poſterity ſuch Jealouſies of
the Crown, as they ſhould never permit it to enjoy its juſt and neceſſary Rights in
point of Power, to which (at laſt) all Law is reſolved, while thereby it is beſt
protected.</p>
                     <p>But here Honour and Juſtice due to My Succeſſors forbid Me to yield to ſuch a total
alienation of that Power from them, which Civility and Duty (no leſs than Juſtice
and Honour) ſhould have forbad them to have asked of Me.</p>
                     <p>For although I can be content to eclipſe My own beams, to ſatisfie their fears,
who think they muſt needs be ſcorched or blinded, if I ſhould ſhine in the full luſtre
of Kingly Power wherewith God and the Laws have inveſted Me: yet I will never
conſent to put out the Sun of Soveraignty to all Poſterity and ſucceeding Kings,
whoſe juſt recovery of their Rights from unjuſt Uſurpations and Extortions, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be prejudiced or obſtructed by any Act of Mine; which indeed would not be
more injurious to ſucceeding Kings than to my Subjects, whom I deſire to leave in a
condition not wholly deſperate for the future, ſo as by a Law to be ever ſubjected to
thoſe many factious Diſtractions which muſt needs follow the many-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> of
Government: which, as it makes a ſhew to the People to have more eyes to foreſee,
ſo they will find it hath more mouths too which muſt be ſatisfied; and (at beſt)
it hath rather a monſtroſity, than any thing of perfection beyond that of right Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
where Counſel may be in many as the Senſes, but the Supreme Power can be
but in One as the Head.</p>
                     <p>Haply, when men have tried the horrors and malignant influence which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow my enforced Darkneſs and Eclipſe (occaſioned by the interpoſition and
ſhadow of that Body, which, as the Moon, receiveth its chiefeſt light from Me)
they will at length more eſteem and welcome the reſtored glory and bleſſing of the
Sun's light.</p>
                     <p>And if at preſent I may ſeem by my receding ſo much from the uſe of my Right
in the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to come ſhort of the diſcharge of that Truſt to
which I am ſworn for my Peoples protection; I conceive thoſe men are guilty
of the enforced Perjury, (if ſo it may ſeem) who compel Me to take this new
and ſtrange way of diſcharging My Truſt, by ſeeming to deſert it; of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
My Subjects, by expoſing My ſelf to Danger or Diſhonour for their ſafety and
quiet.</p>
                     <p>Which in the conflicts of Civil War, and advantages of Power, cannot be effected
but by ſome ſide yielding: to which the greateſt love of the Publick-Peace, and
the firmeſt aſſurance of God's protection (ariſing from a good Conſcience) doth
more invite Me, than can be expected from other mens Fears, which ariſing from
the Injuſtice of their actions (tho never ſo ſucceſsful) yet dare not adventure
their Authors upon any other way of ſafety than that of the Sword and <hi>Militia;</hi>
which yet are but weak defences againſt the ſtroaks of Divine Vengeance, which
will overtake, or of mens own Conſciences, which always attend injurious perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>For My ſelf, I do not think that I can want any thing which providential
neceſſity is pleaſed to take from Me, in order to My Peoples tranquility and
God's Glory, whoſe protection is ſufficient for Me; and he is able, by his being
with Me, abundantly to compenſate to Me, as he did to <hi>Job,</hi> whatever Honour,
Power, or Liberty the <hi>Chaldoeans,</hi> the <hi>Saboeans,</hi> or the Devil himſelf can deprive
Me of.</p>
                     <p>Although they take from Me all defence of Arms and <hi>Militia,</hi> all refuge by Land
of Forts and Caſtles, all flight by Sea in My Ships and Navy, yea tho they ſtudy to
rob Me of the Hearts of my Subjects, the greateſt treaſure and beſt ammunition of a
King; yet cannot they deprive Me of My own Innocency or God's Mercy, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
My way to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, O My God, to Thee I flie for help: if Thou wilt be on my ſide, I ſhall have
more with Me than can be againſt Me.</p>

There is none in Heaven or in Earth that I deſire in compariſon of Thee. In the loſs of
all, be Thou more than all to Me. Make haſt to ſuccor Me, Thou that never faileſt them
that put their truſt in Thee.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt I have no power to oppoſe them that come againſt Me, who are encouraged to
fight under the pretence of fighting for Me: But my eyes are toward Thee.</p>
                     <p>Thou needest no help, nor ſhall I, if I may have thine; if not to conquer, yet at leaſt to
ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>If Thou delightest not in my ſafety and proſperity, behold here I am willing to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to what Thou wilt have Me, whoſe Judgments oft begin with thy own Children.</p>
                     <p>I am content to be nothing, that Thou mayeſt be all.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt taught Me, That no King can be ſaved by the multitude of an Hoſt; but yet
Thou canſt ſave me by the multitude of thy Mercies, who art the Lord of Hoſts, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>Help Me, O Lord, who am ſore distreſſed on every ſide: yet be Thou on my ſide, and I
ſhall not fear what man can do unto Me.</p>
                     <p>I will give thy Juſtice the glory of my diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>O let thy Mercy have the glory of my deliverance from them that perſecute my Soul.</p>
                     <p>By my ſins have I fought againſt Thee, and robbed Thee of thy Glory, who am thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;

                     <p>But ſhew thy ſelf, O my hope and only refuge. Let not mine Enemies ſay, There is no

                     <p>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps ſlip not.</p>
                     <p>Keep Me as the apple of thine eye, hide Me under the ſhadow of thy wings.</p>
                     <p>Shew thy marvellous loving-kindneſs, O Thou that ſaveſt by thy right hand them that put
their truſt in Thee, from thoſe that riſe up againſt them;</p>

                     <head>XI. Vpon the Nineteen Propoſitions firſt ſent to the KING; and more
afterwards.</head>
                     <p>ALtho there be many things they demand, yet if theſe be all, I am glad to ſee
at what price they ſet My own ſafety and My Peoples peace; which I cannot
think I buy at too dear a rate, ſave only the parting with My Conſcience and Honour.
If nothing elſe will ſatisfie, I muſt chuſe rather to be as miſerable and inglorious as My
Enemies can make or wiſh Me.</p>
                     <p>Some things here propounded to Me have been offered by Me; others are eaſily
granted: The reſt (I think) ought not to be obtruded upon Me with the point of
the Sword, nor urged with the injuries of a War; when I have already declared that
I cannot yield to them, without violating my Conſcience. 'Tis ſtrange, there can be
no method of Peace, but by making War upon my Soul.</p>
                     <p>Here are many things required of Me, but I ſee nothing offer'd to Me by the way
of grateful exchange of Honour; or any requital for thoſe Favours I have, or can yet
grant them.</p>
                     <p>This Honour they do Me, to put Me on the giving part, which is more Princely
and Divine. They cannot ask more than I can give, may I but reſerve to My ſelf the
incommunicable Jewel of my Conſcience, and not be forced to part with that whoſe
loſs nothing can repair or requite.</p>
                     <p>Some things (which they are pleaſed to propound) ſeem unreaſonable to Me; and
while I have any maſtery of my Reaſon, how can they think I can conſent to them? who
know they are ſuch as are inconſiſtent with being either a King, or a good Chriſtian.
My yielding ſo much as I have already, makes ſome men confident I will deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>The love I have of my Peoples Peace hath (indeed) great influence upon Me; but
the love of Truth and inward Peace hath more.</p>
                     <p>Should I grant ſome things they require, I ſhould not ſo much weaken my outward
ſtate of a King, as wound that inward quiet of my Conſcience, which ought to be,
is, and ever ſhall be (by Gods grace) dearer to Me than my Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="668" facs="tcp:60710:347"/>
Some things which a King might approve, yet in Honour and Policy are at ſome
time to be denied to ſome men; leſt he ſhould ſeem not to dare to deny any thing, and
give too much incouragement to unreaſonable demands and importunities.</p>
                     <p>But to bind My ſelf to a general and implicit conſent to whatever they ſhall deſire
or propound, (for ſuch is one of their Propoſitions) were ſuch a latitude of blind
obedience as never was expected from any Freeman, nor fit to be required of any man,
much leſs of a King by his own Subjects; any of whom he may poſſibly exceed as
much in Wiſdom, as he doth in Place and Power.</p>
                     <p>This were as if <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſhould have conſented, not only to bind his own hands,
and cut off his hair, but to put out his own eyes, that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> might with the
more ſafety mock and abuſe him; which they choſe rather to do, than quite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
him, when he was become ſo tame an object, and fit occaſion for their ſport and
ſcorn.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, to exclude all power of denial, ſeems an arrogancy leaſt of all becoming
thoſe who pretend to make their Addreſſes in an humble and loyal way of petitioning;
who by that ſufficiently confeſs their own inferiority, which obligeth them to reſt,
if not ſatisfied, yet quietted, with ſuch an anſwer as the will and reaſon of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
thinks fit to give; who is acknowledged to have a freedom and power of Reaſon
to conſent or diſſent, elſe it were very fooliſh and abſurd to ask, what another having
not liberty to deny, neither hath power to grant.</p>
                     <p>But if this be My right belonging to Me in Reaſon as a Man, and in Honour as a
Soveraign King, (as undoubtedly it doth) how can it be other than extreme injury to
confine my Reaſon to a neceſſity of granting all they have a mind to ask, whoſe minds
may be as differing from Mine both in Reaſon and Honour, as their aims my be, and
their qualities are? which laſt God and the Laws have ſufficiently diſtinguiſht, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Me their Soveraign, and them My Subjects: whoſe Propoſitions may ſoon prove
violent Oppoſitions, if once they gain to be neceſſary Impoſitions upon the Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
ſince no man ſeeks to limit and confine his King in Reaſon, who hath not
a ſecret aim to ſhare with him, or uſurp upon him in Power and Dominion.</p>
                     <p>But they would have Me truſt to their moderation, and abandon Mine own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that ſo I might verifie what repreſentations ſome have made of Me to the world,
that I am fitter to be their Pupil than their Prince. Truly I am not ſo confident of My
own ſufficiency, as not willingly to admit the Counſel of others: But yet I am not ſo
diffident of my ſelf, as bruitiſhly to ſubmit to any mens dictates, and at once to betray
the Soveraignty of Reaſon in My Soul, and the Majeſty of my own Crown to any of
My Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Leaſt of all have I any ground of credulity, to induce Me fully to ſubmit to all the
deſires of thoſe men who will not admit or do refuſe and neglect to vindicate, the
freedom of their own and others ſitting and voting in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, all men that know them, know this, how young Stateſmen the moſt part of
theſe propounders are; ſo that till experience of one ſeven years hath ſhewed Me how
well they can Govern Themſelves, and ſo much Power as is wreſted from Me, I ſhould
be very fooliſh indeed, and unfaithful in my Truſt, to put the reins of both Reaſon
and Government wholly out of my own into their hands, whoſe driving is already too
much like <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, and whoſe forwardneſs to aſcend the throne of Supremacy portends
more of <hi>Phaeton</hi> than of <hi>Phoebus.</hi> God divert the Omen if it be his will.</p>
                     <p>They may remember, that at beſt they ſit in Parliament as my Subjects, not my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors;
called to be my Counſellors, not Dictators: Their Summons extends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
their Advice, not to command My Duty.</p>
                     <p>When I firſt heard of Propoſitions to be ſent me, I expected either ſome good Laws
which had been antiquated by the courſe of time or overlaid by the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
had been deſired to a reſtauration of their vigor and due execution; or ſome
evil Cuſtoms preterlegal and abuſes perſonal had been to be removed, or ſome inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
done by My ſelf and others to the Common-weal were to be repaired; or ſome
equable offertures were to be tendred to Me, wherein the advantages of my Crown
being conſidered by them, might fairly induce Me to condeſcend to what tended to
My Subjects good, without any great diminution of My ſelf, whom Nature, Law,
Reaſon and Religion bind Me (in the firſt place) to preſerve, without which 'tis
impoſſible to preſerve My People according to My place.</p>
                     <p>Or (at leaſt) I looked for ſuch moderate deſires of due Reformation of what was
(indeed) amiſs in Church and State, as might ſtill preſerve the Foundation and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of Government in both; not ſhake and quite overthrow either of them, without
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:60710:347"/>
any regard to the Laws in force, the Wiſdom and Piety of former Parliaments, the
ancient and univerſal practice of Chriſtian Churches, the Rights and Priviledges of
particular men: nor yet any thing offered in lieu or in the room of what muſt be
deſtroyed, which might at once reach the good end of the others Inſtitution, and
alſo ſupply its pretended defects, reform its abuſes, and ſatisfie ſober and wiſe men, not
with ſoft and ſpecious words, pretending zeal and ſpecial piety, but with pregnant
and ſolid Reaſons, both Divine and humane, which might juſtifie the abruptneſs and
neceſſity of ſuch vaſt alterations.</p>
                     <p>But in all their Propoſitions I can obſerve little of theſe kinds or to theſe ends: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of any Laws dis-jointed, which are to be reſtored, of any Right invaded, of
any Juſtice to be unobſtructed, of any Compenſations to be made, of any impartial
Reformation to be granted; to all or any of which Reaſon, Religion, true Policy, or
any other human motives might induce Me.</p>
                     <p>But as to the main matters propounded by them at any time, in which is either great
Novelty or Difficulty; I perceive that what were formerly look'd upon as Factions in
the State, and Schiſms in the Church, and ſo puniſhable by the Laws, have now the
confidence, by vulgar clamors and aſſiſtance (chiefly) to demand not only Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of themſelves in their vanity, novelty and confuſion, but alſo Abolition of the
Laws againſt them, and a total extirpation of that Government whoſe Rights they
have a mind to invade.</p>
                     <p>This, as to the main. Other Propoſitions are (for the moſt part) but as
waſte paper, in which thoſe are wrapped up, to preſent them ſomewhat more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I ſo much wonder at the variety and horrible novelty of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
(there being nothing ſo monſtrous, which ſome fancies are not prone to
long for:)</p>
                     <p>This caſts Me into, not an Admiration, but an Extaſie, how ſuch things ſhould have
the fortune to be propounded in the name of the Two Houſes of the Parliament of
<hi>England;</hi> among whom I am very confident there was not a fourth part of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of either Houſe, whoſe Judgments, free, ſingle and apart, did approve or deſire
ſuch deſtructive changes in the Government of the Church.</p>
                     <p>I am perſwaded there remains in far the major part of both Houſes (if free and
full) ſo much Learning, Reaſon, Religion, and juſt Moderation, as to know how to
ſever between the uſe and the abuſe of things, the inſtitution and the corruption, the
Government and the miſ-government, the Primitive Patterns and the aberrations or
blottings of after Copies.</p>
                     <p>Sure they could not all, upon ſo little or no Reaſon (as yet produced to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
ſo ſoon renounce all regard to the Laws in force, to Antiquity, to the Piety of
their Reforming Progenitors, to the Proſperity of former times in this Church and
State under the preſent Government of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Yet by a ſtrange fatality, theſe men ſuffer, either by their abſence, or ſilence, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence,
or ſupine credulity, (believing that all is good which is gilded with ſhews
of Zeal and Reformation) their private diſſenting in Judgment to be drawn into the
common Sewer or ſtream of the preſent vogue and humor; which hath its chief riſe and
abetment from thoſe popular Clamors and Tumults, which ſerved to give life and
ſtrength to the infinite activity of thoſe men, who ſtudied with all diligence and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
to improve to their Innovating deſigns the preſent Diſtractions.</p>
                     <p>Such Armies of Propoſitions having ſo little, in my Judgment, of Reaſon, Juſtice
and Religion on their ſide, as they had Tumult and Faction for their riſe, muſt not
go alone, but ever be back'd and ſeconded with Armies of Soldiers. Tho the ſecond
ſhould prevail againſt my Perſon, yet the firſt ſhall never overcome Me, further than I
ſee cauſe; for I look not at their Number and Power ſo much, as I weigh their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Had the Two Houſes firſt ſued out their Livery, and once effectually redeemed
themſelves from the Wardſhip of the Tumults, (which can be no other than the
Hounds that attend the Cry and Hollow of thoſe men who hunt after Factious and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Deſigns, to the ruin of Church and State:)</p>
                     <p>Did my Judgment tell Me, that the Propoſitions ſent to Me were the Reſults of
the major part of their Votes, who exerciſe their freedom, as well as they have a right
to ſit in Parliament; I ſhould then ſuſpect My own Judgment, for not ſpeedily and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concurring with every one of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="670" facs="tcp:60710:348"/>
For I have Charity enough to think there are wiſe men among them; and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to think that, as in ſome things I may want, ſo 'tis fit I ſhould uſe their Advice,
which is the end for which I called them to a Parliament. But yet I cannot allow
their wiſdom ſuch a compleatneſs and inerrability as to exclude My ſelf; ſince none of
them hath that Part to act, that Truſt to diſcharge, nor that Eſtate and Honour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
as My ſelf; without whoſe Reaſon concurrent with theirs (as the Suns influence
is neceſſary in all Natures productions) they cannot beget or bring forth any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and authoritative Act of publick Wiſdom, which makes the Laws.</p>
                     <p>But the unreaſonableneſs of ſome Propoſitions is not more evident to Me than this is,
That they are not the joynt and free deſires of thoſe in their Major number, who are of
right to ſit and Vote in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>For many of them ſavor very ſtrong of that old leaven of Innovations, masked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Reformation, which in my two laſt famous Predeceſſors days heaved
at, and ſometime threatned both Prince and Parliaments; but, I am ſure, was never
wont ſo far to infect the whole maſs of the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom,
however it diſperſed among the Vulgar: Nor was it likely ſo ſuddenly to taint the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of both Houſes, as that they ſhould unanimouſly deſire and affect ſo enormous
and dangerous Innovations in Church and State, contrary to their former education,
practice and judgment.</p>
                     <p>Not that I am ignorant how the choice of many Members was carried by much
Faction in the Countreys; ſome thirſting after nothing more than a paſſionate revenge
of whatever diſpleaſure they had conceived againſt Me, My Court, or the Clergy.</p>
                     <p>But all Reaſon bids Me impute theſe ſudden and vaſt deſires of change to thoſe few,
who armed themſelves with the many-headed and many-handed Tumults.</p>
                     <p>No leſs doth Reaſon, Honour, and Safety both of Church and State, command Me
to chew ſuch morſels before I let them down. If the ſtreightneſs of my Conſcience
will not give Me leave to ſwallow down ſuch Camels as others do of Sacriledg and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
both to God and Man, they have no more cauſe to quarrel with Me than for
this, that My throat is not ſo wide as theirs. Yet by Gods help I am reſolved, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Paſſion, or Peeviſhneſs, or liſt to contradict, or vanity to ſhew my Negative
Power, ſhall have any biaſs upon my Judgment, to make Me gratifie My Will, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
any thing which my Reaſon and Conſcience commands Me not.</p>
                     <p>Nor on the other ſide will I conſent to more than Reaſon, Juſtice, Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
perſwade Me to be for Gods Glory, the Churches good, my Peoples welfare, and
my own Peace.</p>
                     <p>I will ſtudy to ſatisfie My Parliament and My People; but I will never, for fear or
flattery, gratifie any Faction, how potent ſoever; for this were to nouriſh the Diſeaſe,
and oppreſs the body.</p>
                     <p>Altho many mens Loyalty and prudence are terrified from giving Me that free and
faithful Counſel which they are able and willing to impart, and I may want; yet none
can hinder Me from craving of the Counſel of that mighty Counſellor, who can both
ſuggeſt what is beſt, and incline My Heart ſtedfaſtly to follow it.</p>
                     <p>O Thou first and Eternal Reaſon, whoſe Wiſdom is fortified with Omnipotency, furniſh thy
Servant firſt with clear diſcoveries of Truth, Reaſon and Justice in My Vnderſtanding;
then ſo confirm My Will and Reſolution to adhere to them, that no Terrors, Injuries or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of My Enemies may ever inforce Me againſt thoſe rules which Thou by them haſt
planted in My Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Thou never madeſt Me a King, that I ſhould be leſs than a Man, and not dare to ſay Yea
or Nay, as I ſee cauſe; which freedom is not denied to the meaneſt creature that hath the uſe
of Reaſon and liberty of Speech.</p>
                     <p>Shall that be blamable in Me, which is commendable veracity and conſtancy in others?</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt, O Lord, with what Partiality and Injuſtice they deny that freedom to Me
their KING, which Thou haſt given to all men, and which themſelves pertinaciouſly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to themſelves, while they are ſo tender of the leaſt breach of their Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>To Thee I make my Supplication, who canſt guide us by an un-erring rule through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
Labyrinths of our own thoughts and other mens Propoſals; which I have ſome cauſe
to ſuſpect are purpoſely caſt as Snares, that by my granting or denying them, I might be
more entangled in thoſe difficulties wherewith they lie in wait to afflict Me.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, make thy way plain before Me.</p>

                     <head>XII. Vpon the Rebellion and Troubles in IRELAND.</head>
                     <p>THE Commotions in <hi>Ireland</hi> were ſo ſudden and ſo violent, that it was hard at
firſt either to diſcern the riſe, or apply a remedy to that precipitant Rebellion.
Indeed that ſea of Blood which hath there been cruelly and barbarouſly ſhed, is
enough to drown any man in eternal both infamy and miſery, whom God ſhall find the
malicious Author or Inſtigator of its effuſion.</p>
                     <p>It fell out, as a moſt unhappy advantage to ſome mens Malice againſt Me, that
when they had impudence enough to lay any thing to My charge, this bloodyoppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ſhould be offered them, with which I muſt be aſperſed. Altho there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which could be more abhorred to Me, being ſo full of ſin againſt God, Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to My ſelf, and deſtructive to My Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Some men took it very ill not to be believed, when they affirmed that what the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels did was done with My privity (at leaſt) if not by My Commiſſion. But
theſe knew too well, that it is no news for ſome of My Subjects to fight, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
My Commiſſion, but againſt My Command and Perſon too; yet all the while to
pretend they fight by My Authority, and for My Safety.</p>
                     <p>I would to God the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had nothing to alledg for their imitation againſt thoſe
whoſe blame muſt needs be the greater, by how much Proteſtant Principles are more
againſt all Rebellion againſt Princes than thoſe of Papiſts. Nor will the goodneſs of
mens intentions excuſe the ſcandal and contagion of their Examples.</p>
                     <p>But whoever fail of their Duty toward Me, I muſt bear the blame; this Honour
My Enemies have always done Me, to think moderate injuries not proportionate to Me,
nor competent trials either of My Patience under them, or My Pardon of them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore with exquiſite malice they have mixed the gall and vinegar of Falſity and
Contempt with the cup of My Affliction; charging Me not only with Untruths, but
ſuch as wherein I have the greateſt ſhare of Loſs and Diſhonour by what is committed;
whereby (in all Policy, Reaſon and Religion, having leaſt cauſe to give the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and moſt grounds of utter deteſtation) I might be repreſented by them to the
World the more inhumane and barbarous; like ſome Cyclopick Monſter, whom nothing
will ſerve to eat and drink but the fleſh and blood of My own Subjects, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Welfare My Intereſt lies as much as ſome mens doth in their Perturbations; who
think they cannot do well but in evil times, nor ſo cunningly, as in laying the <hi>odium</hi> of
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:60710:349"/>
thoſe ſad events on others, wherewith themſelves are moſt pleaſed, and whereof they
have been not the leaſt occaſion.</p>
                     <p>And certainly, 'tis thought by many wiſe men, that the prepoſterous rigor and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
ſeverity which ſome men carried before them in <hi>England,</hi> was not the leaſt
Incentive that kindled and blew up into thoſe horrid flames the ſparks of Diſcontent,
which wanted not prediſpoſed fewel for Rebellion, in <hi>Ireland:</hi> where Deſpair being
added to their former Diſcontents, and the fears of utter Extirpation to their wonted
Oppreſſions, it was eaſy to provoke to an open Rebellion a people prone enough to
break out to all exorbitant violence, both by ſome Principles of their Religion, and
the natural deſires of Liberty; both to exempt themſelves from their preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints,
and to prevent thoſe after Rigors wherewith they ſaw themſelves apparently
threatned by the covetous Zeal and uncharitable Fury of ſome men, who think it
a great Argument of the truth of their Religion, to endure no other but their
own.</p>
                     <p>God knows, as I can with truth waſh My hands in Innocency as to any Guilt in that
Rebellion; ſo I might waſh them in my Tears, as to the ſad apprehenſions I had to ſee it
ſpread ſo far and make ſuch waſte. And this in a time when Diſtractions and Jealouſies
here in <hi>England</hi> made moſt men rather intent to their own ſafety, or deſigns they were
driving, than to the relief of thoſe who were every day inhumanly butchered in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
whoſe Tears and Blood might, if nothing elſe, have quenched, or at leaſt for
a time repreſſed and ſmothered, thoſe ſparks of Civil Diſſentions and Jealouſies which
in <hi>England</hi> ſome men moſt induſtriouſly ſcattered.</p>
                     <p>I would to God no man had been leſs affected with <hi>Ireland</hi>'s ſad eſtate than My ſelf
I offered to go My ſelf in Perſon upon that expedition: But ſome men were either
afraid I ſhould have any one Kingdom quieted; or loath they were to ſhoot at any
mark here leſs than My ſelf; or that any ſhould have the glory of my Deſtruction but
themſelves. Had My many offers been accepted, I am confident neither the Ruine had
been ſo great, nor the Calamity ſo long, nor the Remedy ſo deſperate.</p>
                     <p>So that, next to the ſin of thoſe who began that Rebellion, theirs muſt needs be,
who either hindred the ſpeedy ſuppreſſing of it by Domeſtick Diſſentions, or diverted
the Aids, or exaſperated the Rebels to the moſt deſperate reſolutions and actions, by
threatning all Extremities, not only to the known Heads and chief Incendiaries, but
even to the whole community of that Nation; reſolving to deſtroy Root and branch,
men, women and children, without any regard to thoſe uſual pleas for Mercy which
Conquerors, not wholly barbarous, are wont to hear from their own breaſts in behalf
of thoſe whoſe oppreſſive Fears, rather than their Malice, engaged them; or whoſe
imbecillity for Sex and Age was ſuch, as they could neither lift up a hand againſt them,
nor diſtinguiſh between their right hand and their left. Which prepoſterous and (I
think) un-evangelical Zeal is too like that of the rebuked Diſciples, who would go no
lower in their revenge, than to call for fire from Heaven upon whole Cities for the
repulſe or neglect of a few; or like that of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s sons, which the Father both bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and curſed: chuſing rather to uſe all extremities which might drive men to deſperate
obſtinancy, than to apply moderate remedies; ſuch as might puniſh ſome with exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
Juſtice, yet diſarm others, with tenders of mercy upon their ſubmiſſion, and our
protection of them from the fury of thoſe who would ſoon drown them if they refuſed
to ſwim down the popular ſtream with them.</p>
                     <p>But ſome kind of Zeal counts all merciful moderation Lukewarmneſs, and had rather
be cruel than counted cold, and is not ſeldom more greedy to kill the Bear for his skin,
than for any harm he hath done; the confiſcation of mens Eſtates being more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
than the Charity of ſaving their Lives, or reforming their Errors.</p>
                     <p>When all proportionable ſuccors of the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (who were daily
maſſacred, and overborn with numbers of now deſperate Enemies) was diverted and
obſtructed here, I was earneſtly entreated and generally adviſed by the chief of the
Proteſtant party there, to get them ſome reſpite and breathing by a ceſſation, without
which they ſaw no probability (unleſs by Miracle) to preſerve the remnant that had yet
eſcaped. God knows with how much Commiſeration and ſolicitous Caution I carried on
that buſineſs, by perſons of Honour and Integrity, that ſo I might neither incourage the
Rebels Inſolence, nor diſcourage the Proteſtants Loyalty and Patience.</p>
                     <p>Yet when this was effected in the beſt ſort that the neceſſity and difficulty of affairs
would then permit, I was then to ſuffer again in my Reputation and Honour, becauſe I
ſuffered not the Rebels utterly to devour the remaining handfuls of the Proteſtants there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="673" facs="tcp:60710:349"/>
I thought that in all reaſon, the gaining of that reſpite could not be ſo much to the
Rebels advantages (which ſome have highly calumniated againſt Me) as it might have
been for the Proteſtants future as well as preſent ſafety; if during the time of that
Ceſſation, ſome men had had the grace to have laid <hi>Ireland</hi>'s ſad condition more to heart,
and laid aſide thoſe violent motions which were here carried on by thoſe that had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skill to let blood than to ſtanch it.</p>
                     <p>But in all the miſconſtructions of my Actions, (which are prone to find more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
in men to what is falſe and evil, than love or charity to what is true and good)
as I have no Judg but God above Me; ſo I can have comfort to appeal to his Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who doth not therefore deny my Innocence, becauſe he is pleaſed ſo far to try my
Patience, as he did his ſervant <hi>Job</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>I have enough to do to look to My own Conſcience, and the faithful diſcharge of
My Truſt as a KING: I have ſcarce leiſure to conſider thoſe ſwarms of reproaches
which iſſue out of ſome mens mouths and hearts, as eaſily as ſmoke or ſparks do out of
a furnace; much leſs to make ſuch prolix Apologies as might give thoſe men ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who conſcious to their own depth of wickedneſs, are loath to believe any man not
to be as bad as themſelves.</p>
                     <p>'Tis Kingly to do well, and hear ill; if I can but act the one, I ſhall not much regard
to hear the other.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, I can hear with patience as bad as my worſt Enemies can falſly ſay:
and I hope I ſhall ſtill do better than they deſire or deſerve I ſhould.</p>
                     <p>I believe it will at laſt appear, that they who firſt began to embroil my other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
are in great part guilty, if not of the firſt letting out, yet of the not timely
ſtopping, thoſe horrid effuſions of blood in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which (whatever my Enemies pleaſe to ſay or think) I look upon, as that of my
other Kingdoms, exhauſted out of My own veins; no man being ſo much weakned
by it as My ſelf. And I hope, tho mens unſatiable Cruelties never will, yet the Mercy
of God will at length ſay to his Juſtice, <hi>It is enough;</hi> and command the Sword of
Civil wars to ſheath it ſelf: his merciful Juſtice intending, I truſt, not our utter
Confuſion, but our Cure; the abatement of our Sins, not the deſolating of theſe
Nations.</p>
                     <p>O my God, let thoſe infinite Mercies prevent us once again, which I and My Kingdoms
have formerly abuſed, and can never deſerve ſhould be reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt how much Cruelty among Chriſtians is acted under the colour of Religion; as if
we could not be Chriſtians, unleſs we crucifie one another.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe we have not more loved thy Truth, and practiſed in Charity, Thou
haſt ſuffered a ſpirit of Error and bitterneſs, of mutual and mortal Hatred to riſe
among us.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, forgive wherein we have ſinned, and ſanstifie what we have ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>Let our Repentance be our Recovery, as our great Sins have been onr Ruine.</p>
                     <p>Let not the Miſeries I and My Kingdoms have hitherto ſuffered ſeem ſmall to Thee: but
make our Sins appear to our Conſciences as they are repreſented in the glaſs of thy Judgments;
for Thou never puniſhest ſmall failings with ſo ſevere Afflictions.</p>
                     <p>O therefore, according to the multitude of thy great Mercies pardon our Sins; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thy Judgments, which are very many and very heavy.</p>
                     <p>Yet let our Sins be ever more grievous to us than thy Judgments; and make us more will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to repent, than to be relieved: firſt give us the Peace of penitent Conſciences, and then
the tranquillity of united Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>In the ſea of our Saviours Blood drown our Sins; and through this Red ſea of our own blood
bring us at laſt to a ſtate of Piety, Peace and Plenty.</p>
                     <p>As My publick relations to all make Me ſhare in all My Subjects ſufferings; ſo give Me
ſuch a pious ſenſe of them as becomes a Chriſtian King, and a loving Father of My People.</p>
                     <p>Let the ſcandalous and unjuſt Reproaches caſt upon Me be as a breath, more to kindle My
Compaſſion: Give Me grace to heap Charitable coals of fire upon their heads to melt them,
whoſe Malice or cruel Zeal hath kindled, or hindred the quenching of thoſe Flames, which
have ſo much waſted My Three Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>O reſcue and aſſiſt thoſe poor Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> whom Thou haſt hitherto preſerved.</p>
                     <p>And lead thoſe in the ways of Thy ſaving Truths, whoſe Ignorance or Errors have filled
them with Rebellious and deſtructive Principles; which they act under an opinion that they
do Thee good ſervice.</p>

Let the hand of Thy Juſtice be againſt thoſe who maliciouſly and deſpitefully have raiſed or

                     <p>Thou art far from deſtroying the innocent with tho guilty, and the erroneous with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious;

                     <p>THE <hi>Scots</hi> are a Nation upon whom I have not only common ties of
Nature, Soveraignty and Bounty, with my Father of Bleſſed memory;
but alſo ſpecial and late obligations of Favours, having gratified the active Spirits
among them ſo far, that I ſeemed to many to prefer the deſires of that Party before
My own Intereſt and Honour. But, I ſee, Royal bounty emboldens ſome men to ask
and act beyond all bounds of Modeſty and Gratitude.</p>
                     <p>My Charity and Act of Pacification forbids Me to reflect on former paſſages; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I ſhall ever be far from letting any mans ingratitude or inconſtancy make Me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of what I granted them for the publick good. I pray God it may ſo prove.</p>
                     <p>The coming again of that Party into <hi>England</hi> with an Army, only to conform this
Church to their late New model, cannot but ſeem as unreaſonable, as they would have
thought the ſame meaſure offered from hence to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Other Errand I could never underſtand they had, (beſides thoſe common and vulgar
flouriſhes for Religion and Liberty) ſave only to confirm the Presbyterian Copy they
had ſet, by making this Church to write after them, tho it were in bloody Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
                     <p>Which Deſign and End, whether it will juſtifie the uſe of ſuch violent Means before
the Divine Juſtice, I leave to their Conſciences to judg who have already felt the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Means, but not reaped the benefit of the End, either in this Kingdom or
that.</p>
                     <p>Such knots and croſneſs of grain being objected here, as will hardly ſuffer that Form
which they cry up as the only juſt Reformation, and ſetling of Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in Churches, to go on ſo ſmoothly here as it might do in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and was by
them imagined would have done in <hi>England,</hi> when ſo many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy,
through levity or diſcontent, if no worſe Paſſion, ſuddenly quitted their former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to Epiſcopacy, and faced about to their Presbytery.</p>
                     <p>It cannot but ſeem either Paſſion or ſome Self-ſeeking, more than true Zeal and pious
Diſcretion, for any foreign State or Church to preſcribe ſuch medicines only for
others, which themſelves have uſed rather ſucceſsfully than commendably; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the ſame Phyſick on different conſtitutions will have different operations;
that may kill one, which doth but cure another.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I know any ſuch tough and malignant Humours in the conſtitution of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which gentler applications than thoſe of an Army might not eaſily
have removed: Nor is it ſo proper to hew out religious Reformations by the Sword,
as to poliſh them by fair and equal Diſputations among thoſe that are moſt concerned
in the Differences, whom not Force but Reaſon ought to convince.</p>
                     <p>But their deſign now ſeemed rather to cut off all Diſputation here, than to procure
a fair and equal one: For it was concluded there, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy muſt conform
to the <hi>Scots</hi> pattern, before ever they could be heard what they could ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or againſt the others Way.</p>

I could have wiſhed fairer proceedings, both for their credits who urge things with
ſuch Violence; and for other mens Conſciences too, who can receive little ſatisfaction
in theſe Points, which are maintained rather by Soldiers fighting in the Field, than
Scholars diſputing in free and learned Synods.</p>
                     <p>Sure, in matters of Religion, thoſe Truths gain moſt on mens Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
which are leaſt urged with ſecular Violence, which weakens Truth with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices;
and is unreaſonable to be uſed, till ſuch means of rational Conviction have
been applied, as leaving no excuſe for Ignorance, condemns mens Obſtinacy to deſerved
penalties.</p>
                     <p>Which no Charity will eaſily ſuſpect of ſo many Learned and Pious Church-men in
<hi>England;</hi> who being always bred up, and conformable to the Government of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
cannot ſo ſoon renounce both their former Opinion and practice, only becauſe
that Party of the <hi>Scots</hi> will needs by Force aſſiſt a like Party here, either to drive all
Miniſters as ſheep into the common fold of Presbytery, or deſtroy them, at leaſt fleece
them, by depriving them of the benefit of their Flocks. If the <hi>Scotch</hi> ſole Presbytery
were proved to be the only inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt for all Churches Government;
yet I believe it would be hard to prove that Chriſt had given thoſe <hi>Scots,</hi> or any other
of My Subjects, Commiſſion by the Sword to ſet it up in any of My Kingdoms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
My conſent.</p>
                     <p>What reſpect and obedience Chriſt and his Apoſtles pay'd to the chief Governors
of States where they lived, is very clear in the Goſpel: but that he or they ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſet up ſuch a Parity of Presbyters, and in ſuch a way as thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
I think is not very diſputable.</p>
                     <p>If Presbytery, in ſuch a ſupremacy, be an inſtitution of Chriſt, ſure it differs from
all others, and is the firſt and only Point of Chriſtianity that was to be planted and
watered with ſo much Chriſtian blood; whoſe effuſions run in a ſtream ſo contrary to
that of the Primitive Planters both of Chriſtianity and Epiſcopacy, which was with
patient ſhedding of their own blood, not violent drawing other mens. Sure there is
too much of Man in it, to have much of Chriſt, none of whoſe inſtitutions were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on or begun with the temptations of Covetouſneſs or Ambition; of both which
this is vehemently ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>Yet was there never any thing upon the point which thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> had by Army or
Commiſſioners to move Me with, by their many ſolemn Obteſtations and pious Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
but only this, To repreſent to Me the wonderful neceſſity of ſetting up their
Presbytery in <hi>England,</hi> to avoid the further miſeries of a War; which ſome men chiefly
on this deſign at firſt had begun, and now further engaged themſelves to continue.</p>
                     <p>What hinders that any Sects, Schiſms or Hereſies, if they can get but numbers,
ſtrength and opportunity, may not, according to this opinion and pattern, ſet up their
ways by the like methods of violence? All which Presbytery ſeeks to ſuppreſs, and
render odious under thoſe Names: when Wiſe and Learned men think that nothing
hath more marks of Schiſm and Sectariſm than this Presbyterian way, both as to the
Ancient, and ſtill moſt Univerſal way of the Church-Government, and ſpecially as to
the particular Laws and Conſtitutions of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; which are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
nor are like to be for Me, till I ſee more Rational and Religious motives than
Soldiers uſe to carry in their Knapſacks.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt leave the ſucceſs of all to God, who hath many ways (having firſt
taken us off from the folly of our Opinions, and fury of our Paſſion) to teach us
thoſe Rules of true Reaſon and peaceable Wiſdom which is from above, tending moſt to
Gods glory and his Churches good: which I think My ſelf ſo much the more bound
in Conſcience to attend with the moſt judicious zeal and care, by how much I eſteem
the Church above the State, the glory of Chriſt above Mine own, and the Salvation
of mens Souls above the Preſervation of their Bodies and Eſtates.</p>
                     <p>Nor may any men, I think, without ſin and preſumption, forcibly endeavour to
caſt the Churches under My care and tuition, into the moulds they have fancied and

own and other mens Conſciences by the ſtrength of their Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Other violent motions, which are neither Manly, Chriſtian nor Loyal, ſhall never
either ſhake or ſettle My Religion; nor any mans elſe who knows what Religion means,
and how far it is removed from all Faction, whoſe proper engine is Force, the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Beaſts, not of reaſonable Men, much leſs of humble Chriſtians and loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in matters of Religion.</p>

But men are prone to have ſuch high conceits of themſelves, that they care not
what coſt they lay out upon their Opinions; eſpecially thoſe that have ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Gain, to recompence their loſſes and hazards.</p>
                     <p>Yet I was not more ſcandalized at the <hi>Scots</hi> Armies coming in againſt my will, and
their forfeiture of ſo many Obligations of Duty and Gratitude to Me, than I wondred
how thoſe here could ſo much diſtruſt Gods aſſiſtance, who ſo much pretended Gods
Cauſe to the People, as if they had the certainty of ſome Divine Revelation: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
they were more than competently furniſhed with My Subjects Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
My Navy by Sea, My Forts, Caſtles and Cities by Land.</p>
                     <p>But I find, that men jealous of the juſtifiableneſs of their doings and deſigns before
God, never think they have humane ſtrength enough to carry their work on, ſeem it
never ſo plauſible to the People. What cannot be juſtified in Law or Religion, had
need be fortified with Power.</p>
                     <p>And yet ſuch is the inconſtancy that attends all minds engaged in violent motion,
that whom ſome of them one while earneſtly invite to come in to their Aſſiſtance,
others of them ſoon after are weary of, and with nauſeating caſt them out: what one
Party thought to rivet to a ſetledneſs by the ſtrength and influence of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that
the other rejects and contemns; at once deſpiſing the Kirk-Government and Diſcipline
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and fruſtrating the Succeſs of ſo chargeable, more than charitable, Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
For ſure the Church of <hi>England</hi> might have purchaſed at a far cheaper rate
the Truth and Happineſs of Reformed Government and Diſcipline (if it had been
wanting,) tho it had entertained the beſt Divines of Chriſtendom for their Advice in
a full and free Synod: which I was ever willing to, and deſirous of, that matters being
impartially ſetled, might be more ſatisfactory to all, and more durable.</p>
                     <p>But much of Gods Juſtice and Mans folly will at length be diſcovered through all
the films and pretenſions of Religion, in which Politicians wrap up their deſigns: In
vain do men hope to build their Piety on the ruines of Loyalty. Nor can thoſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
or deſigns be durable, when Subjects make Bankrupt of their Allegiance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of ſetting up a quicker trade for Religion.</p>
                     <p>But as my beſt Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> never deſerted Me; ſo I cannot think that the
moſt are gone ſo far from Me, in a Prodigality of their love and reſpects toward Me, as
to make Me to deſpair of their return: when beſides the bonds of Nature and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which they have to Me, all Reaſon and true Policy will teach them, that their
chiefeſt intereſt conſiſts in their Fidelity to the Crown, not in their ſerviceableneſs to
any Party of the People, to a neglect and betraying of my Safety and Honour for their
own advantages. However, the leſs cauſe I have to truſt to men, the more I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

                     <p>The troubles of My Soul are enlarged: O Lord, bring Thou Me out of My diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Lord, direct Thy Servant in the ways of that Pious Simplicity, which is the beſt Policy.</p>
                     <p>Deliver Me from the combined ſtrength of thoſe, who have ſo much of the Serpents Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
that they forget the Doves Innocency.</p>
                     <p>Tho hand joyn in hand, yet let them not prevail againſt My Soul, to the betraying of My
Conſcience and Honour.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, canſt turn the hearts of thoſe Parties in both Nations, as Thou didſt the
men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to reſtore <hi>David</hi> with as much loyal zeal, as they did with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy

                     <p>Preſerve the love of thy Truth and Vprightneſs in Me, and I ſhall not deſpair of My
Subjects affections returning towards Me.</p>
                     <p>Thou canſt ſoon cauſe the overflowing Seas to ebb, and retire back again to the bounds
which Thou haſt appointed for them.</p>
                     <p>O My God, I truſt in Thee: let Me not be aſhamed; let not My Enemies triumph over Me.</p>

                     <head>XIV. Vpon the COVENANT.</head>
                     <p>THE Presbyterian <hi>Scots</hi> are not to be hired at the ordinary rate of Auxiliaries;
nothing will induce them to engage, till thoſe that call them in have pawned
their Souls to them by a Solemn League and Covenant:</p>
                     <p>Where many engines of Religious and fair pretenſions are brought, chiefly to batter
or raſe Epiſcopacy. This they make the grand evil Spirit, which, with ſome other
Imps purpoſely added, to make it more odious and terrible to the Vulgar, muſt by ſo
ſolemn a Charm and Exorciſm be caſt out of this Church, after more than a Thouſand
years poſſeſſion here, from the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity in this Iſland, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
preſcription of time and practice in all other Churches ſince the Apoſtles times
till this laſt Century.</p>
                     <p>But no Antiquity muſt plead for it: Presbytery, like a young Heir, thinks the Father
hath lived long enough; and impatient not to be in the Biſhops Chair and Authority
(tho Lay-men go away with the Revenues) all Art is uſed to ſink Epiſcopacy, and
lanch Presbytery in <hi>England,</hi> which was lately boyed up in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the like arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Altho I am unſatisfied with many paſſages in that Covenant (ſome referring to My
ſelf with very dubious and dangerous limitations) yet I chiefly wonder at the deſign
and drift touching the Diſcipline and Government of the Church; and ſuch a manner
of carrying them on to new ways, by Oaths and Covenants, where it is hard for men
to be engaged by no leſs than ſwearing for or againſt thoſe things which are of no
clear Moral neceſſity, but very diſputable, and controverted among Learned and
Godly men: whereto the application of Oaths can hardly be made and enjoined
with that Judgment and certainty in ones ſelf, or that Charity and candor to
others of different Opinion, as I think Religion requires; which never refuſes
fair and equable Deliberations, yea and Diſſentings too in matters only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                     <p>The enjoyning of Oaths upon People, muſt needs in things doubtful be dangerous,
as in things unlawful damnable; and no leſs ſuperfluous, where former Religious and
Legal Engagements bound men ſufficiently to all neceſſary duties. Nor can I ſee
how they will reconcile ſuch an Innovating Oath and Covenant with that
former Proteſtation which was ſo lately taken, To maintain the Religion
eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſince they count Diſcipline ſo great a part
of Religion.</p>
                     <p>But ambitious minds never think they have laid ſnares and gins enough to catch
and hold the Vulgar credulity; for by ſuch politick and ſeemingly-pious Stratagems
they think to keep the populacy faſt to their Parties, under the terror of Perjury: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
certainly all honeſt and wiſe men ever thought themſelves ſufficiently bound by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ties of Religion, Allegiance, and Laws, to God and Man.</p>
                     <p>Nor can ſuch after-Contracts, deviſed and impoſed by a few men in a declared
Party, without My conſent, and without any like power or precedent from God's or
Mans Laws, be ever thought by judicious men ſufficient either to abſolve or ſlacken
thoſe Moral and Eternal bonds of Duty, which lie upon all my Subjects Conſciences,
both to God and Me.</p>
                     <p>Yet as things now ſtand, good men ſhall leaſt offend God or Me by keeping their
Covenant in honeſt and lawful ways; ſince I have the Charity to think, that the chief
End of the Covenant in ſuch mens intentions was, To preſerve Religion in Purity,
and the Kingdoms in Peace: To other than ſuch ends and means they cannot think
themſelves engaged. Nor will thoſe that have any true touches of Conſcience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to carry on the beſt deſigns (much leſs ſuch as are and will be daily more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
factious and ambitious) by any unlawful means, under that Title of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi>
unleſs they dare prefer ambiguous, dangerous and unauthorized Novelties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their known and ſworn Duties, which are indiſpenſable, both to God and My
ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I am prone to believe and hope, that many who took the Covenant are yet firm to
this Judgment, That ſuch later Vows, Oaths or Leagues, can never blot out thoſe
former gravings and characters which by juſt and lawful Oaths were made upon their
Souls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="678" facs="tcp:60710:352"/>
That which makes ſuch Confederations by way of Solemn Leagues and Covenants
more to be ſuſpected is, That they are the common road uſed in all Factions and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Perturbations of State or Church: Where formalities of extraordinary Zeal and
Piety are never more ſtudied and elaborate, than when Politicians moſt agitate deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
deſigns againſt all that is ſetled or ſacred in Religion and Laws; which by ſuch
ſcrews are cunningly, yet forcibly, wreſted by ſecret ſteps and leſs ſenſible degrees
from their known Rule and wonted Practice, to comply with the Humours of thoſe
men who aim to ſubdue all to their own Will and Power, under the diſguiſes of Holy
Combinations.</p>
                     <p>Which cords and withes will hold mens Conſciences no longer than Force attends
and twiſts them: For every man ſoon grows his own Pope, and eaſily abſolves himſelf
of thoſe ties which, not the commands of God's Word, or the Laws of the Land, but
only the ſubtilty and terror of a Party caſts upon him; either ſuperfluous and vain,
when they were ſufficiently tied before; or fraudulent and injurious, if by ſuch after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligaments
they find the Impoſers really aiming to diſſolve or ſuſpend their former juſt
and neceſſary Obligations.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, ſuch Illegal ways ſeldom or never intend the engaging men more to Duties,
but only to Parties; therefore it is not regarded how they keep their Covenants
in point of Piety pretended, provided they adhere firmly to the Party and Deſign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>I ſee the Impoſers of it are content to make their Covenant like Manna (not that it
came from Heaven as this did) agreeable to every mans palate and reliſh who will but
ſwallow it: They admit any mens ſenſes of it, tho divers or contrary, with any Salvo's,
Cautions and Reſervations; ſo as they croſs not their chief Deſign, which is laid againſt
the Church and Me.</p>
                     <p>It is enough, if they get but the reputation of a ſeeming encreaſe to their Party:
So little do men remember that God is not mocked.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch latitudes of ſenſe, I believe many that love Me and the Church well may
have taken the Covenant, who yet are not ſo fondly and ſuperſtitiouſly taken by it, as
now to act clearly againſt both all Piety and Loyalty: who firſt yielded to it, more to
prevent that imminent Violence and Ruine which hung over their heads, in caſe they
wholy refuſed it, than for any value of it or devotion to it.</p>
                     <p>Wherein the latitude of ſome general clauſes may (perhaps) ſerve ſomewhat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, as of <hi>Doing and endeavouring what lawfully they may, in their Places and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
and <hi>according to the Word of God:</hi> For theſe (indeed) carry no man beyond thoſe
bounds of good Conſcience which are certain and fixed, either in Gods Laws, as to the
general, or the Laws of the State and Kingdom, as to the particular regulation and
exerciſe of mens duties.</p>
                     <p>I would to God ſuch as glory moſt in the name of <hi>Covenanters,</hi> would keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within thoſe lawful bounds to which God hath called them; ſurely it were the
beſt way to expiate the raſhneſs of taking it: which muſt needs then appear, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the want of a full and lawful Authority at firſt to enjoyn it, it ſhall actually be
carried on beyond and againſt thoſe Ends which were in it ſpecified and pretended. I
willingly forgive ſuch mens taking the Covenant, who keep it within ſuch bounds of
Piety, Law and Loyalty, as can never hurt either the Church, My ſelf, or the Publick
Peace: againſt which no mans lawful Calling can engage him.</p>
                     <p>As for that Reformation of the Church which the Covenant pretends, I cannot
think it juſt or comely, that by the partial Advice of a few Divines, (of ſo ſoft and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
tempers, as diſpoſed them to ſo ſudden acting and compliance, contrary to their
former Judgments, Profeſſion and Practice) ſuch foul Scandals and Suſpicions ſhould
be caſt upon the Doctrine and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as was never
done (that I have heard) by any that deſerved the name of <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad,
nor by any men of Learning and Candor at home: all whoſe Judgments I cannot but
prefer before any mens now factiouſly engaged.</p>
                     <p>No man can be more forward than My ſelf, to carry on all due Reformations with
mature Judgment and a good Conſcience, in what things I ſhall (after impartial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)
be by God's Word and right Reaſon convinced to be amiſs. I have offered more
than ever the fulleſt, freeſt, and wiſeſt Parliaments did deſire.</p>
                     <p>But the ſequel of ſome mens Actions makes it evident, that the main Reformation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
is, The abaſing of Epiſcopacy into Presbytery, and the robbing the Church of
its Lands and Revenues: For, no men have been more injuriouſly uſed, as to their
legal Rights, than the Biſhops and Church-men. Theſe, as the fatteſt Deer,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:60710:352"/>
muſt be deſtroyed; the other Raſcal-herd of Schiſms, Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being lean, may
enjoy the benefit of a Toleration. Thus <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard made him the only Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer
of his City, and fit to dye. Still, I ſee, while the breath of Religion fills the
Sails, Profit is the Compaſs by which Factious men ſteer their courſe in all ſeditious
Commotions.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, as no man lay more open to the Sacrilegious temptations of uſurping
the Churches Lands and Revenues, (which iſſuing chiefly from the Crown, are held
of it, and legally can revert only to the Crown with My Conſent;) ſo I have always
had ſuch a perfect abhorrence of it in my Soul, that I never found the leaſt inclination
to ſuch Sacrilegious Reformings: yet no man hath a greater deſire to have Biſhops and
all Church-men ſo reformed, that they may beſt deſerve and uſe, not only what the
pious Munificence of My Predeceſſors hath given to God and the Church, but all other
additions of Chriſtian Bounty.</p>
                     <p>But no neceſſity ſhall ever, I hope, drive Me or Mine to invade or ſell the Prieſts
Lands, which both <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s divinity, and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s true Piety abhorred to do. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
I think it both in the eye of Reaſon and Religion, to deprive the moſt Sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of all due encouragements; and like that other hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to
withdraw the Straw, and encreaſe the Task; ſo purſuing the oppreſſed Church, as ſome
have done, to the Red ſea of a Civil War, where nothing but a Miracle can ſave ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
It, or Him who eſteems it his greateſt Title to be called, and his chiefeſt glory to
be, <hi>The Deſender of the Church, both in its true Faith and its juſt Fruitions, equally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Sacriledg and Apoſtaſy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had rather live, as My Predeceſſor <hi>Henry</hi> the Third ſometime did, on the Churches
Alms, than violently to take the bread out of Biſhops and Miniſters mouths.</p>
                     <p>The next work will be <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Reformation, conſecrating the meaneſt of the
People to be Prieſts in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſerve thoſe Golden Calves who have enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Churches Patrimony and Dowry; which how it thrived both with
Prince, Prieſts and People, is well enough known: And ſo it will be here, when from
the tuition of Kings and Queens, which have been nurſing Fathers and Mothers of this
Church, it ſhall be at their allowance who have already diſcovered what hard Fathers
and Stepmothers they will be.</p>
                     <p>If the Poverty of <hi>Scotland</hi> might, yet the Plenty of <hi>England</hi> cannot excuſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Rapine of the Churches Rights and Revenues.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſo much as pray God to prevent thoſe ſad Conſequences which will inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follow the Parity and Poverty of Miniſters, both in Church and State; ſince I
think it no leſs than a mocking and tempting of God, to deſire him to hinder thoſe
miſchiefs whoſe occaſions and remedies are in our own power; it being every mans
ſin not to avoid the one, and not to uſe the other.</p>
                     <p>There are ways enough to repair the Breaches of the State without the Ruines of
the Church: as I would be a Reſtorer of the one, ſo I would not be an Oppreſſor of
the other, under the pretence of Publick Debts: The occaſions contracting them were
bad enough, but ſuch a diſcharging of them would be much worſe. I pray God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I nor Mine may be acceſſary to either.</p>
                     <p>To Thee, O Lord, do I addreſs my Prayer, beſeeching Thee to pardon the raſhneſs of
my Subjects Swearings, and to quicken their ſenſe and obſervation of thoſe juſt, moral, and
indiſpenſable bonds, which thy Word and the Laws of this Kingdom have laid upon their
Conſciences: From which no pretenſions of Piety and Reformation are ſufficient to abſolve
them, or to engage them to any contrary practices.</p>
                     <p>Make them at length ſeriouſly to conſider, that nothing Violent and Injurious, can be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
                     <p>Thou alloweſt no mans committing Sacriledg, under the zeal of abhorring Idols.</p>
                     <p>Suffer not Sacrilegious deſigns to have the countenance of Religious ties.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt taught us by the wiſeſt of Kings, that it is a ſnare to take things that are holy,
and after Vows to make enquiry.</p>
                     <p>Ever keep thy Servant from conſenting to Perjurious and Sacrilegious Rapines, that I
may not have the brand and curſe to all poſterity, of robbing Thee and Thy Church of what
thy Bounty hath given us, and thy Clemency hath accepted from us, wherewith to encourage
Learning and Religion.</p>
                     <p>Tho my Treaſures are exhausted, my Revenues diminiſhed, and my Debts encreaſed, yet
never ſuffer Me to be tempted to uſe ſuch profane Reparations; lest a Coal from thine Altar

adventures; while I am rendred to them ſo fit to be deſtroyed, that many are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
to merit the name of my Deſtroyers, imagining they then fear God moſt, when
they leaſt honour their King.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, I never found but my Pity was above my Anger; nor have my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ever ſo prevailed againſt Me, as to exclude my moſt compaſſionate Prayers for them
whom devout Errors, more than their own Malice, have betrayed to a moſt Religious
Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>I had the Charity to interpret, that moſt part of my Subjects fought againſt my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Errors, not my Perſon; and intended to mend Me, not to end Me. And I hope
that God pardoning their Errors, hath ſo far accepted and anſwered their good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that as he hath yet preſerved Me, ſo he hath by theſe Afflictions prepared Me
both to do Him better ſervice, and My people more good than hitherto I have
done.</p>
                     <p>I do not more willingly forgive their ſeductions, which occaſioned their loyal Injuries,
than I am ambitious by all Princely merits to redeem them from their unjuſt Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
and reward them for their good Intentions.</p>
                     <p>I am too conſcious to My own Affections towards the generality of my People, to
ſuſpect theirs to Me; nor ſhall the Malice of my Enemies ever be able to deprive
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:60710:353"/>
Me of the comfort which that confidence gives Me. I ſhall never gratifie the ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of a few, with any ſiniſter thoughts of all their Allegiance whom Pious frauds
have ſeduced.</p>
                     <p>The worſt ſome mens Ambition can do ſhall never perſwade Me to make ſo bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of moſt of my Subjects actions; who poſſibly may be Erroneous, but not
Heretical in point of Loyalty.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe of the Injuries done to my Subjects is as ſharp as thoſe done to My ſelf;
our welfares being inſeperable; in this only they ſuffer more than My ſelf, that they
are animated by ſome Seducers to injure at once both themſelves and Me.</p>
                     <p>For this is not enough to the Malice of my Enemies, that I be afflicted; but it muſt
be done by ſuch inſtruments, that my Afflictions grieve Me not more than this doth,
that I am afflicted by thoſe whoſe Proſperity I earneſtly deſire, and whoſe Seduction I
heartily deplore.</p>
                     <p>If they had been my open and forein Enemies, I could have born it; bur they muſt
be my own Subjects, who are, next to my Children, dear to Me; and for the reſtoring
of whoſe Tranquility I could willingly be the <hi>Jonah,</hi> if I did not evidently foreſee,
that by the divided Intereſts of their and Mine Enemies, as by contrary winds, the ſtorm
of their Miſeries would be rather encreaſed than allayed.</p>
                     <p>I had rather prevent my Peoples Ruine than rule over them; nor am I ſo ambitious
of that Dominion which is but my Right, as of their Happineſs, if it could expiate or
countervail ſuch a way of obtaining it, by the higheſt Injuries of Subjects committed
againſt their Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>Yet I had rather ſuffer all the miſeries of Life, and die many Deaths, than ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to deſert or diſhonourably to betray my own juſt Rights and Soveraignty,
thereby to gratify the Ambition, or juſtifie the Malice of my Enemies; between
whoſe Malice and other mens Miſtakes I put as great a difference, as between an
ordinary Ague and the Plague, or the Itch of Novelty and the Leproſie of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.</p>
                     <p>As Liars need have good memories, ſo Malicious perſons need good inventions, that
their Calumnies may fit every mans fancy; and what their Reproaches want of truth,
they may make up with number and ſhew.</p>
                     <p>My Patience (I thank God) will better ſerve Me to bear, and my Charity to forgive,
than my Leiſure to anſwer the many falſe aſperſions which ſome men have caſt upon
Me.</p>
                     <p>Did I not more conſider my Subjects Satisfaction than My own Vindication, I ſhould
never have given the Malice of ſome men that pleaſure, as to ſee Me take notice of, or
remember what they ſay or object.</p>
                     <p>I would leave the Authors to be puniſhed by their own evil Manners and ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
which will, I believe, in a ſhorter time than they be aware of, both confute
and revenge all thoſe black and falſe Scandals which they have caſt on Me; and make
the world ſee, there is as little truth in them, as there was little worth in the broaching
of them, or Civility (I need not ſay Loyalty) in the not-ſuppreſſing of them: whoſe
credit and reputation, even with the People, ſhall ere long be quite blaſted by the breath
of that ſame fornace of Popular obloquy and detraction, which they have ſtudied to
heat and inflame to the higheſt degree of infamy, and wherein they have ſought to caſt
and conſume my Name and Honour.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, nothing gave Me more cauſe to ſuſpect and ſearch My own Innocency, than
when I obſerved ſo many forward to engage againſt Me who had made great profeſſions
of ſingular Piety: For this gave to vulgar minds ſo bad a reflection upon Me and My
Cauſe, as if it had been impoſſible to adhere to Me, and not withal depart from God;
to think or ſpeak well of Me, and not to blaſpheme him; ſo many were perſwaded
that theſe two were utterly inconſiſtent, to be at once Loyal to Me, and truly Religious
toward God.</p>
                     <p>Not but that I had (I thank God) many with Me which were both Learned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
(much above that ordinary ſize and that vulgar proportion wherein ſome men
glory ſo much) who were ſo well ſatisfied in the cauſe of my Sufferings, that they choſe
rather to ſuffer with Me than forſake Me.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it ſtrange, that ſo religious Pretenſions as were uſed againſt Me ſhould be to
many well-minded men a great temptation to oppoſe Me; eſpecially being urged by
ſuch popular Preachers as think it no ſin to lye for God, and what they pleaſe to call
Gods Cauſe, curſing all that will not curſe with them; looking ſo much at, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the goodneſs of the End propounded, that they conſider not the lawfulneſs of
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:60710:354"/>
the Means uſed, nor the depth of the Miſchief chiefly plotted and intended.</p>
                     <p>The weakneſs of theſe mens Judgments muſt be made up by their Clamors and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
                     <p>It was a great part of ſome mens Religion to ſcandalize Me and Mine, they thought
theirs could not be true, if they cryed not down Mine as falſe.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, I have had more tryal of his Grace as to the conſtancy of My Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Proteſtant profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both abroad and at home,
than ever they are like to have.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I know any Exception I am ſo lyable to in their opinion, as too great a Fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in that Religion; whoſe judicious and ſolid grounds, both from Scripture and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
will not give My Conſcience leave to approve or conſent to thoſe many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and divided Innovations, which the bold ignorance of ſome men would needs
obtrude upon Me and My People.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to thoſe well-tryed foundations both of Truth and Order, which men of
far greater Learning and clearer Zeal have ſetled in the Confeſſion and Conſtitution of
this Church in <hi>England,</hi> which many former Parliaments, in the moſt calm and unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
times, have oft confirmed; in which I ſhould ever, by Gods help, perſevere, as
believing it hath moſt of Primitive Truth and Order.</p>
                     <p>Nor did My uſing the aſſiſtance of ſome Papiſts which were my Subjects any way
fight againſt My Religion, as ſome men would needs interpret it; eſpecially thoſe who
leaſt of all men cared whom they imployed, or what they ſaid or did, ſo they might
prevail.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſtrange that ſo wiſe men as they would be eſteemed, ſhould not conceive, that
differences of perſwaſion in matters of Religion may eaſily fall out, where there is the
ſameneſs of Duty, Allegiance and Subjection. The firſt they owe as Men and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to God; the ſecond they owe to Me in common, as their KING. Different
profeſſions in point of Religion cannot (any more than in civil Trades) take away the
community of Relations either to Parents or to Princes: And where is there ſuch an
<hi>Oglio</hi> or medly of various Religions in the World again, as thoſe men entertain in their
ſervice (who find moſt fault with Me) without any ſcruple, as to the diverſity of their
Sects and Opinions?</p>
                     <p>It was, indeed, a foul and indeleble ſhame for ſuch as would be counted Proteſtants,
to enforce Me, a declared Proteſtant, their Lord and King, to a neceſſary uſe of Papiſts
or any other, who did but their duty to help Me to defend My ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Nor did I more than is lawful for any King in ſuch exigents, to uſe the aid of any his
Subjects.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry the Papiſts ſhould have a greater ſenſe of their Allegiance than many
Proteſtant Profeſſors, who ſeem to have learned and to practiſe the worſt Principles of
the worſt Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, it had been a very impertinent and unſeaſonable ſcruple in Me (and very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
no doubt to My Enemies) to have been then diſputing the points of different Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs
in My Subjects, when I was diſputed with by Swords points; and when I needed
the help of My Subjects as Men, no leſs than their Prayers as Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe of my Evil Counſellors was another uſeful device for thoſe who were
impatient any mens counſels but their own ſhould be followed in Church or State; who
were ſo eager in giving Me better counſel, that they would not give Me leave to take it
with Freedom, as a Man, or Honour, as a King; making their counſels more like a
Drench, that muſt be poured down, than a Draught, which might be fairly and leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drank, if I liked it.</p>
                     <p>I will not juſtifie beyond humane errors and frailties My ſelf or my Counſellors:
They might be ſubject to ſome Miſcarriages, yet ſuch as were far more reparable by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and better thoughts, than thoſe enormous Extravagances wherewith ſome men
have now even wildred and almoſt quite loſt both Church and State.</p>
                     <p>The event of things at laſt will make it evident to my Subjects, that had I followed
the worſt counſels that My worſt Counſellors ever had the boldneſs to offer to Me, or
My ſelf any inclination to uſe, I could not ſo ſoon have brought both Church and
State in Three flouriſhing Kingdoms to ſuch a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſions and Hell of Miſeries
as ſome have done; out of which they cannot, or will not, in the midſt of their many
great advantages, redeem either Me or my Subjects.</p>
                     <p>No men were more willing to complain, than I was to redreſs what I ſaw in
Reaſon was either done or adviſed amiſs: and this I thought I had done even beyond
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:60710:354"/>
the expectation of moderate men, who were ſorry to ſee Me prone even to injure My
ſelf out of a Zeal to relieve my Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But other mens inſatiable deſire of Revenge upon Me, My Court and My Clergy,
hath wholly beguiled both Church and State of the benefit of all my either Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Conceſſions; and withal, hath deprived all thoſe (now ſo zealous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors)
both of the comfort and reward of their former pretended Perſecutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they ſo much gloried among the Vulgar; and which indeed a truly-humble
Chriſtian will ſo highly prize, as rather not to be relieved than be revenged, ſo as to
be bereaved of that Crown of Chriſtian Patience which attends humble and injured
Sufferers.</p>
                     <p>Another artifice uſed to withdraw My Peoples Affections from Me to their deſigns
was, The noiſe and oſtentation of Liberty, which men are not more prone to deſire,
than unapt to bear in the Popular ſenſe; which is to do what every man liketh
beſt.</p>
                     <p>If the divineſt Liberty be to will what men ſhould, and to do what they ſo will,
according to Reaſon, Laws and Religion, I envy not my Subjects that Liberty, which
is all I deſire to enjoy My ſelf; ſo far am I from the deſire of oppreſſing theirs: Nor
were thoſe Lords and Gentlemen which aſſiſted Me ſo prodigal of their Liberties, as
with their Lives and Fortunes to help on the enſlaving of Themſelves and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities.</p>
                     <p>As to Civil Immunities, none but ſuch as deſire to drive on their Ambitious and
Covetous Deſigns over the Ruines of Church and State, Prince, Peers and People, will
ever deſire greater Freedoms than the Laws allow; whoſe bounds good men count their
Ornament and Protection, others their Manacles and Oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it juſt any man ſhould expect the Reward and Benefit of the Law, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
its Rule and Direction; loſing juſtly his Safety, while he ſeeks an unreaſonable
Liberty.</p>
                     <p>Time will beſt inform my Subjects, that thoſe are the beſt preſervers of their true
Liberties, who allow themſelves the leaſt licentiouſneſs againſt or beyond the
Laws.</p>
                     <p>They will feel it at laſt to their coſt, that it is impoſſible thoſe men ſhould be really
tender of their fellow-Subjects Liberties, who have the hardineſs to uſe their King with
ſo ſevere reſtraints, againſt all Laws, both Divine and Humane; under which yet I will
rather periſh, than complain to thoſe who want nothing to compleat their mirth and
Triumph but ſuch Muſick.</p>
                     <p>In point of true Conſcientious Tenderneſs (attended with Humility and Meekneſs,
not with proud and arrogant activity, which ſeeks to hatch every egg of different
opinion to a Faction or Schiſm) I have oft declared, how little I deſire my Laws and
Scepter ſhould intrench on Gods Soveraignty, which is the only King of mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and yet He hath laid ſuch reſtraints upon men, as commands them to be ſubject
for Conſcience ſake, giving no men liberty to break the Law eſtabliſhed, further than
with Meekneſs and Patience they are content to ſuffer the Penalties annexed, rather than
perturb the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, ſome mens thirſt after Novelties, others deſpair to relieve the neceſſities
of their Fortunes, or ſatisfie their Ambition in Peaceable times, (diſtruſting Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
as well as their own Merits) were the ſecret (but principal) impulſives to
theſe Popular Commotions, by which Subjects have been perſwaded to expend much
of thoſe plentiful Eſtates they got and enjoyed under My Government in peaceable
times; which yet muſt now be blaſted with all the odious Reproaches which impotent
Malice can invent, and My ſelf expoſed to all thoſe Contempts which may moſt dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Majeſty of a King, and encreaſe the ungrateful inſolences of my People.</p>
                     <p>For mine Honour, I am well aſſured that as mine Innocency is clear before God in
point of any Calumnies they object; ſo My Reputation ſhall, like the Sun, (after Owls
and Bats have had their freedom in the night and darker times) riſe and recover
it ſelf to ſuch a degree of ſplendor as thoſe feral Birds ſhall be grieved to behold
and unable to bear. For never were any Princes more glorious than thoſe whom God
hath ſuffer'd to be tried in the furnace of Afflictions by their injurious Subjects.</p>
                     <p>And who knows but the juſt and merciful God will do Me good for ſome mens hard,
falſe and evil ſpeeches againſt Me? Wherein they ſpeak rather what they wiſh, than
what they believe or know.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="684" facs="tcp:60710:355"/>
Nor can I ſuffer ſo much in point of Honour by thoſe rude and ſcandalous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
(which, like fire in great Conflagrations, flie up and down to ſet all places on like
flames) as thoſe men do, who pretending to ſo much Piety, are ſo forgetful of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God and Me: by no way ever vindicating the Majeſty of their KING againſt
any of thoſe who, contrary to the precept of God and precedent of Angels, <hi>ſpeak
evil of dignities, and bring railing accuſations againſt</hi> thoſe who are honoured with the
name of <hi>Gods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis no wonder if men not fearing GOD, ſhould not Honour their KING.</p>
                     <p>They will eaſily contemn ſuch ſhadows of God, who reverence not that Supreme
and adorable Majeſty, in compariſon of whom all the Glory of Men and Angels is but
obſcurity; yet hath he graven ſuch Characters of Divine Authority and Sacred power
upon Kings, as none may without ſin ſeek to blot them out. Nor ſhall their black
veils be able to hide the ſhining of My face, while God gives Me a heart frequently and
humbly to converſe with him, from whom alone are all the irradiations of true Glory
and Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, knoweſt my reproach and my diſhonour, my Adverſaries are all before Thee.</p>
                     <p>My Soul is among Lions, among them that are ſet on fire, even the ſons of men; whoſe
teeth are ſpears and arrows, their tongue a ſharp ſword.</p>
                     <p>Mine Enemies reproach Me all the day long, and thoſe that are mad against Me are
ſworn together.</p>
                     <p>O my God, how long ſhall the ſons of men turn my glory into ſhame? how long ſhall they
love vanity, and ſeek after lies?</p>
                     <p>Thou hast heard the reproaches of wicked men on every ſide, Hold not thy peace, leſt
my Enemies prevail againſt Me, and lay mine honour in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeak lies; the Lord will abhor both the Blood-thirsty
and Deceitful men.</p>
                     <p>Make my Righteouſneſs to appear as the light, and mine Innocency to ſhine forth as the
Sun at noon-day.</p>
                     <p>Suffer not my ſilence to betray mine Innocency, nor my diſpleaſure my Patience: That
after my Saviours example, being reviled, I may not revile again; and being curſed by them,
I may bleſs them.</p>
                     <p>Thou that wouldst not ſuffer <hi>Shimei's</hi> tongue to go unpuniſhed, when by thy Judgments on
<hi>David</hi> he might ſeem to juſtifie his diſdainful reproaches; give Me grace to intercede with
thy Mercy for theſe my Enemies, that the reward of falſe and lying tongues, even hot burning
coals of eternal fire, may not be brought upon them.</p>
                     <p>Let my Prayers and Patience be as water to cool and quench their tongues, who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <p>Teach Me <hi>David's</hi> Patience and <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Devotion; that I may look to thy Mercy

                     <p>Though they curſe, do Thou bleſs; and I ſhall be bleſſed, and made a Bleſſing to my People:</p>
                     <p>That the ſtone which ſome builders refuſe, may become the head-ſtone of the corner.</p>

Hence our publick <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Forms of conſtant Prayers, muſt be (not amended,
in what upon free and publick advice might ſeem to ſober men inconvenient for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or manner, to which I ſhould eaſily conſent, but) wholly caſhiered and aboliſhed:
and after many Popular contempts offered to the Book and thoſe that uſed it according
to their Conſciences and the Laws in force, it muſt be crucified by an Ordinance, the
better to pleaſe either thoſe men who gloried in their extemporary vein and fluency; or
others, who conſcious to their own formality in the uſe of it, thought they fully expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
their ſin of not uſing it aright, by laying all the blame upon it, and a total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
of it as a dead letter, thereby to excuſe the deadneſs of their hearts.</p>
                     <p>As for the matter contained in the Book, ſober and Learned men have ſufficiently
vindicated it againſt the Cavils and exceptions of thoſe, who thought it a part of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make what profane objections they could againſt it, eſpecially for Popery and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
whereas no doubt the Liturgy was exactly conformed to the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and this by all Reformed Churches is confeſſed to be moſt

                     <p>For the manner of uſing Set and Preſcribed Forms, there is no doubt but that
wholeſom words being known and fitted to mens Underſtandings, are ſooneſt received

                     <p>Nor do I ſee any reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould be weary of a well-compoſed Liturgy

nothing of the Excellency and Uſefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>I could never ſee any Reaſon why any Chriſtian ſhould abhor, or be forbidden to

Saviour, profeſſeth the ſame Truths, reads the ſame Scriptures, hath the ſame Duties
upon him, and feels the ſame daily wants for the moſt part, both inward and outward,
which are common to the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>Sure we may as well beforehand know what we pray as to whom we pray, and in
what words as to what ſenſe; when we deſire the ſame things, what hinders we may
not uſe the ſame Words? our appetite and digeſtion too may be good when we uſe, as
we pray for, <hi>our daily bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some men I hear are ſo impatient not to uſe in all their Devotions their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and gifts, that they not only diſuſe (as too many) but wholly caſt away and
contemn the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> whoſe great guilt is, that it is the warrant and original
Pattern of all ſet Liturgies in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>I ever thought that the proud oſtentation of mens abilities for invention, and the
vain affectations of variety for expreſſions in Publick Prayer, or any ſacred adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
merits a greater brand of ſin than that which they call Coldneſs and Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Nor are men in thoſe Novelties leſs ſubject to formal and ſuperficial tempers
(as to their hearts) than in the uſe of conſtant Forms, where not the words, but
mens hearts are to blame.</p>
                     <p>I make no doubt but a man may be very Formal in the moſt extemporary variety,
and very fervently Devout in the moſt wonted expreſſions: nor is God more
a God of variety than of conſtancy: nor are conſtant Forms of Prayers more likely
to flat and hinder the Spirit of Prayer and Devotion, than unpremeditated and confuſed
variety to diſtract and loſe it.</p>
                     <p>Tho I am not againſt a grave, modeſt, diſcreet and humble uſe of Miniſters gifts
even in publick, the better to fit and excite their own and the Peoples affections to
the preſent occaſions; yet I know no neceſſity why private and ſingle abilities ſhould
quite juſtle out and deprive the Church of the joynt abilities and concurrent gifts of
many Learned and Godly men, ſuch as the Compoſers of the Service-Book were, who
may in all reaſon be thought to have more of Gifts and Graces enabling them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
with ſerious deliberation and concurrent advice, ſuch Forms of Prayers as may
beſt fit the Churches common wants, inform the Hearers underſtanding, and ſtir up
that fiduciary and fervent application of their ſpirits (wherein conſiſts the very life
and ſoul of Prayer, and that ſo much pretended Spirit of Prayer) than any private
man by his ſolitary abilities can be preſumed to have: which what they are many times,
(even there where they make a great noiſe and ſhew) the affectations, emptineſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency,
rudeneſs, confuſions, flatneſs, levity, obſcurity, vain and ridiculous repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
the ſenſleſs and oft-times blaſphemous expreſſions, all theſe burthened with a
moſt tedious and intolerable length, do ſufficiently convince all men but thoſe who
glory in that Phariſaick way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="686" facs="tcp:60710:356"/>
Wherein men muſt be ſtrangely impudent and flatterers of themſelves, not to have
an infinite ſhame of what they ſo do and ſay, in things of ſo ſacred a nature, before
God and the Church, after ſo ridiculous and (indeed) profane a manner.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it be expected but that in duties of frequent performance, as Sacramental
adminiſtrations and the like, which are ſtill the ſame, Miniſters muſt either come to uſe
their own Forms conſtantly, which are not like to be ſo ſound or comprehenſive of
the nature of the Duty, as Forms of Publick compoſure; or elſe they muſt every time
affect new expreſſions when the Subject is the ſame: which can hardly be preſumed
in any mans greateſt ſufficiencies, not to want (many times) much of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs,
order and gravity becoming thoſe Duties, which by this means are expoſed
at every celebration to every Miniſters private Infirmities, Indiſpoſitions, Errors, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and Defects, both for Judgment and Expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>A ſerious ſenſe of which inconveniences in the Church unavoidably following every
mans ſeveral manner of officiating, no doubt, firſt occaſioned the Wiſdom and Piety of
the Ancient Churches, to remedy thoſe miſchiefs by the uſe of conſtant Liturgies of
Publick compoſure.</p>
                     <p>The want of which, I believe, this Church will ſufficiently feel, when the unhappy
fruits of many mens ungoverned Ignorance and confident defects ſhall be diſcovered in
more Errors, Schiſms, Diſorders and uncharitable Diſtractions in Religion, which are
already but too many, the more is the pity.</p>
                     <p>However, if Violence muſt needs bring in and abet thoſe Innovations (that men
may not ſeem to have nothing to do) which Law, Reaſon and Religion forbids at
leaſt to be ſo obtruded, as wholly to juſtle out the Publick Liturgy:</p>
                     <p>Yet nothing can excuſe that moſt unjuſt and partial ſeverity of thoſe men, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lately had ſubſcribed to, uſed and maintained the Service-book; or refuſing to uſe
it, cryed out of the rigor of the Laws and Biſhops, which ſuffered them not to uſe the
liberty of their Conſciences in not uſing it.</p>
                     <p>That theſe men (I ſay) ſhould ſo ſuddenly change the Liturgy into a Directory;
as if the Spirit needed help for Invention, tho not for Expreſions; or as if matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
did not as much ſtint and obſtruct the Spirit, as if it were cloathed in and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to fit words: (So ſlight and eaſie is that Legerdemain which will ſerve to delude
the Vulgar.)</p>
                     <p>That further, they ſhould uſe ſuch ſeverity, as not to ſuffer without penalty any to
uſe the Common-prayer-Book publickly, although their Conſciences bind them to it,
as a duty of Piety to God and Obedience to the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Thus I ſee no men are prone to be greater Tyrants, and more rigorous exacters
upon others to conform to their illegal Novelties, than ſuch whoſe Pride was formerly
leaſt diſpoſed to the obedience of lawful conſtitutions, and whoſe licentious humors
moſt pretended conſcientious liberties: which freedom with much regret they now
allow to Me and my Chaplains, when they may have leave to ſerve Me, whoſe Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
even in their extemporary way comes not ſhort of the others, but their Modeſty
and Learning far exceeds the moſt of them.</p>
                     <p>But this matter is of ſo popular a nature, as ſome men knew it would not bear
learned and ſober Debates; leſt being convinced by the evidence of Reaſon as well as
Laws, they ſhould have been driven either to ſin more againſt their Knowledg, by
taking away the Liturgy; or to diſpleaſe ſome Faction of the People, by continuing
the uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Tho I believe they have offended more conſiderable men, not only for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and eſtates, but for their weighty and judicious Piety, than thoſe are whoſe Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Giddineſs they ſought to gratify by taking it away.</p>
                     <p>One of the greateſt faults ſome men found with the Common-Prayer-Book, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
was this, that it taught them to pray ſo oft for Me: to which Petitions they had
not Loyalty enough to ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> nor yet Charity enough to forbear Reproaches, and
even Curſings of Me in their own Forms, in ſtead of praying for Me.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh their Repentance may be their only Puniſhment; that ſeeing the miſchiefs
which the diſuſe of Publick Liturgies hath already produced, they may reſtore that
credit, uſe and reverence to them, which by the ancient Churches were given to Set
Forms of ſound and wholeſom words.</p>
                     <p>And Thou, O Lord, which art the ſame God, bleſſed for ever, whoſe Mercies are full of
variety, and yet of conſtancy; Thou denieſt us not a new and freſh ſenſe of our old and
daily wants, nor deſpiſeſt renewed affections joyned to conſtant expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="687" facs="tcp:60710:356"/>
Let us not want the benefit of thy Churches united and well-adviſed Devotions.</p>
                     <p>Let the matters of our Prayers be agreeable to thy will, which is always the ſame; and
the fervency of our ſpirits to the motions of thy Holy Spirit in us.</p>
                     <p>And then we doubt not but thy Spiritual perfections are ſuch, as Thou art neither to be
pleaſed with affected Novelties for matter or manner, nor offended with the Pious conſtancy of
our Petitions in them both.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe variety or conſtancy Thou haſt no where either forbidden or commanded, but left
them to the Piety and Prudence of thy Church, that both may be uſed, neither deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>Keep men in that pious moderation of their Judgments in matters of Religion, that their
Ignorance may not offend others, nor their opinion of their own Abilities tempt them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
others of what they may lawfully and devoutly uſe to help their infirmities.</p>
                     <p>And ſince the advantage of Error conſiſts in Novelty and Variety, as Truth's in Vnity
and Conſtancy; ſuffer not thy Church to be peſtered with Errors, and deformed with Vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
in thy Service, under the pretence of Variety and Novelty: nor to be deprived of
Truth, Vnity and Order, under this fallacy, That Conſtancy is the cauſe of Formality.</p>
                     <p>Lord, keep us from formal Hypocrifie in our own hearts; and then we know that praying
to Thee, or praiſing of Thee (with <hi>David</hi> and other Holy men) in the ſame Forms cannot
hurt us.</p>
                     <p>Give us Wiſdom to amend what is amiſs within us, and there will be leſs to mend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <head>XVII. Of the Differences between the KING and the Two Houſes, in
point of CHURCH-GOVERNMENT.</head>
                     <p>TOuching the Government of the Church by Biſhops, the common Jealouſie hath
been, that I am earneſt and reſolute to maintain it, not ſo much out of Piety,
as Policy and reaſon of State.</p>
                     <p>Wherein ſo far indeed reaſon of State doth induce Me to approve that Government
above any other, as I find it impoſſible for a Prince to preſerve the State in quiet, unleſs
he hath ſuch an influence upon Church-men, and they ſuch a dependance on Him, as
may beſt reſtrain the ſeditious exorbitancies of Miniſters tongues; who with the Keys
of Heaven have ſo far the Keys of the Peoples Hearts, as they prevail much by their
Oratory to let in or ſhut out both Peace and Loyalty.</p>
                     <p>So that I being (as KING) intruſted by God and the Laws with the good both
of Church and State; I ſee no reaſon I ſhould give up, or weaken by any change, that
power and influence which in right and reaſon I ought to have over both.</p>
                     <p>The removing Biſhops out of the Houſe of Peers (of which I have elſewhere given
an account) was ſufficient to take off any ſuſpicion, that I encline to them for any uſe
to be made of their Votes in State-affairs: Tho indeed I never thought any Biſhop
worthy to ſit in that Houſe, who would not Vote according to his Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now in Charity be thought deſirous to preſerve that Government in its right
conſtitution, as a matter of Religion, wherein both my Judgment is fully ſatisfied that
it hath of all other the fulleſt Scripture grounds, and alſo the conſtant Practice of all
Chriſtian Churches; till of late years the Tumultuarineſs of people, or the Factiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Pride of Presbyters, or the Covetouſneſs of ſome States and Princes, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſome mens wits to invent new models, and propoſe them under the ſpecious
titles of <hi>Chriſts Government, Scepter and Kingdom,</hi> the better to ſerve their turns, to
whom the change was beneficial.</p>
                     <p>They muſt give Me leave, having none of their temptations to invite Me to alter the
Government of Biſhops, (that I may have a title to their Eſtates) not to believe
their pretended grounds to any new ways; contrary to the full and conſtant teſtimony
of all Hiſtories, ſufficiently convincing unbiaſſed men, that as the Primitive Churches
were undoubtedly governed by the Apoſtles, and their immediate Succeſſors,
the firſt and beſt Biſhops, ſo it cannot in Reaſon or Charity be ſuppoſed that all
Churches in the world ſhould either be ignorant of the Rule by them preſcribed, or
ſo ſoon deviate from their Divine and Holy Pattern: That ſince the firſt Age, for
fifteen hundred years, not one Example can be produced of any ſetled Church, wherein
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:60710:357"/>
were many Miniſters and Congregations, which had not ſome Biſhop above them,
under whoſe Juriſdiction and Government they were.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe conſtant and univerſal practice agreeing with ſo large and evident Scripture-Directions
and Examples, as are ſet down in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the
ſetling of that Government, not in the Perſons only of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> but in the
Succeſſion; (the want of Government being that which the Church can no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe
with in point of well-being, than the want of the Word and Sacraments in
point of being:)</p>
                     <p>I wonder how men came to look with ſo envious an eye upon Biſhops power and
authority, as to overſee both the Eccleſiaſtical uſe of them, and Apoſtolical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which to Me ſeems no leſs evidently ſet forth, as to the main ſcope and deſign
of thoſe Epiſtles, for the ſetling of a peculiar Office, Power and Authority in them,
as Preſident-Biſhops above others, in point of Ordination, Cenſures, and other acts of
Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; than thoſe ſhorter characters of the qualities and duties of
Presbyter-Biſhops and Deacons are deſcribed in ſome parts of the ſame Epiſtles; who in
the latitude and community of the name were then, and may now, not improperly
be call'd <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as to the overſight and care of ſingle Congregations committed to
them by the Apoſtles, or thoſe Apoſtolical Biſhops who (as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them in that ordinary power, there aſſigned over larger diviſions, in which
were many Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>The Humility of thoſe firſt Biſhops avoiding the eminent title of Apoſtles, as a
name in the Churches ſtyle appropriated from its common notion (of <hi>a Meſſenger,</hi> or
<hi>one ſent</hi>) to that ſpecial Dignity which had extraordinary Call, Miſſion, Gifts, and
Power immediately from Chriſt; they contented themſelves with the ordinary titles of
Biſhops and Presbyters: until uſe (the great arbitrator of words and maſter of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
finding reaſon to diſtinguiſh by a peculiar name, thoſe Perſons whoſe Power
and Office were indeed diſtinct from and above all other in the Church, as ſucceeding
the Apoſtles in the ordinary and conſtant power of governing the Churches, (the
honour of whoſe name they moderately, yet commendably, declined) all Chriſtian
Churches (ſubmitting to that ſpecial authority) appropriated alſo the name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
without any ſuſpicion or reproach of arrogancy, to thoſe who were by Apoſtolical
propagation rightly deſcended and inveſted into that higheſt and largeſt power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
even the moſt pure and Primitive Churches: which, without all doubt, had
many ſuch holy Biſhops, after the pattern of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> whoſe ſpecial power
is not more clearly ſet down in thoſe Epiſtles (the chief grounds and limits of all Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
claim as from Divine Right) than are the characters of theſe perilous times, and
thoſe men that make them ſuch, who not enduring ſound Doctrine, and clear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of all Churches practice, are moſt perverſe Diſputers, and proud Uſurpers againſt
true Epiſcopacy: who, if they be not Traitors and Boaſters, yet they ſeem to be very
covetous, heady, high-minded, inordinate and fierce, lovers of themſelves, having
much of the Form, little of the power of Godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Who, by popular heaps of weak, light and unlearned Teachers, ſeek to over-lay
and ſmother the pregnancy and authority of that power of Epiſcopal Government,
which, beyond all equivocation and vulgar fallacy of names, is moſt convincingly ſet
forth both by Scripture and all after-Hiſtories of the Church.</p>
                     <p>This I write rather like a Divine than a Prince, that Poſterity may ſee (if ever theſe
Papers be publick) that I had fair grounds, both from Scripture-Canons and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Examples, whereon my Judgment was ſtated for Epiſcopal Government.</p>
                     <p>Nor was it any Policy of State, or obſtinacy of Will, or partiality of Affection,
either to the men or their Function, which fixed Me; who cannot in point of worldly
reſpects be ſo conſiderable to Me, as to recompence the injuries and loſſes I and My
deareſt Relations, with My Kingdoms, have ſuſtained and hazarded, chiefly at firſt
upon this quarrel.</p>
                     <p>And not only in Religion, of which Scripture is the beſt rule, and the Churches
Univerſal Practice the beſt commentary; but alſo in right Reaſon and the true nature
of Government, it cannot be thought that an orderly Subordination among Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Miniſters ſhould be any more againſt Chriſtianity, than it is in all ſecular and
Civil Governments, where Parity breeds Confuſion and Faction.</p>
                     <p>I can no more believe that ſuch Order is inconſiſtent with true Religion, than good
Features are with Beauty, or Numbers with Harmony.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it likely that God, who appointed ſeveral orders and a Prelacy in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Church among the Jewiſh Prieſts, ſhould abhor or forbid them
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:60710:357"/>
among Chriſtian Miniſters, who have as much of the Principles of Schiſm and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as other men; for preventing and ſuppreſſing of which, the Apoſtolical Wiſdom
(which was divine) after that Chriſtians were multiplied to many Congregations, and
Presbyters with them, appointed this way of Government, which might beſt preſerve
Order and Union with Authority.</p>
                     <p>So that I conceive it was not the Favour of Princes or Ambition of Presbyters, but
the Wiſdom and Piety of the Apoſtles, that firſt ſetled Biſhops in the Church; which
Authority they conſtantly uſed, and enjoyed in thoſe times which were pureſt for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
tho ſharpeſt for Perſecution.</p>
                     <p>Not that I am againſt the managing of this Preſidency and Authority in one man
by the joynt counſel and conſent of many Presbyters: I have offered to reſtore that,
as a fit means to avoid thoſe Errors, Corruptions and Partialities, which are incident
to any one man; alſo to avoid Tyranny, which becomes no Chriſtians, leaſt of all
Church-men; beſides, it will be a means to take away that burthen and <hi>odium</hi> of affairs
which may lie too heavy on one mans ſhoulders, as indeed I think it formerly did on
the Biſhops here.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I ſee what can be more agreeable both to Reaſon and Religion, than ſuch
a frame of Government which is Paternal, not Magiſterial: and wherein not only the
neceſſity of avoiding Faction and Confuſion, Emulations and Contempts, which are
prone to ariſe among equals in Power and Function; but alſo the differences of ſome
Miniſters gifts, and aptitudes for Government above others, doth invite to employ
them, in reference to thoſe Abilities wherein they are eminent.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this Judgment of Mine touching Epiſcopacy any pre-occupation of Opinion
which will not admit any oppoſitions againſt it: It is well known I have endeavoured
to ſatisfie My ſelf in what the chief Patrons for other ways can ſay againſt this or for
theirs: And I find as they have far leſs of Scripture grounds and of Reaſon, ſo for
Examples, and Practice of the Church, or teſtimonies of Hiſtories, they are wholly
deſtitute, wherein the whole ſtream runs ſo for Epiſcopacy, that there is not the leaſt
rivulet for any others.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe obtruded Examples of ſome late Reformed Churches, (for many
retain Biſhops ſtill) whom neceſſity of times and affairs rather excuſeth than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
for their Inconformity to all Antiquity; I could never ſee any reaſon why
Churches orderly reformed, and governed by Biſhops, ſhould be forced to conform to
thoſe few, rather than to the Catholick example of all Ancient Churches which needed
no Reformation, and to thoſe Churches at this day, who governed by Biſhops in all the
Chriſtian world, are many more than Presbyterians or Independents can pretend to be:
All whom the Churches in My Three Kingdoms lately governed by Biſhops would
equalize, (I think) if not exceed.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it any point of Wiſdom or Charity, where Chriſtians differ, (as many do in
ſome points) there to widen the differences, and at once to give all the Chriſtian
world (except a handful of ſome Proteſtants) ſo great a ſcandal in point of Church-Government;
whom tho you may convince of their Errors in ſome points of Doctrine,
yet you ſhall never perſwade them, that to compleat their Reformation, they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
deſert and wholly caſt off that Government which they and all before them
have ever owned as Catholick, Primitive and Apoſtolical, ſo far, that never Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
nor Hereticks (except thoſe <hi>Aerians</hi>) have ſtrayed from the Unity and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Church in that point, ever having Biſhops above Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the late general Approbation and Submiſſion to this Government of Biſhops
by the Clergy as well as the Laity of theſe Kingdoms, is a great confirmation of My
Judgment; and their Inconſtancy is a great prejudice againſt their Novelty. I cannot
in charity ſo far doubt of their Learning or Integrity, as if they underſtood not what
heretofore they did, or that they did conform contrary to their Conſciences: So that
their facility and Levity is never to be excuſed, who before ever the point of Church-government
had any free and impartial debate, contrary to their former Oaths and
Practice, againſt their obedience to the Laws in force, and againſt My Conſent, have
not only quite cried down the Government by Biſhops, but have approved and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
the violent and moſt illegal ſtripping all the Biſhops, and many other Church-men,
of all their due Authority and Revenues, even to the ſelling away and utter
alienation of thoſe Church-lands from any Ecleſiaſtical uſes. So great a power hath
the ſtream of Times and the prevalency of Parties over ſome mens Judgments; of
whoſe ſo ſudden and ſo total change little reaſon can be given, beſides the <hi>Scots</hi> Army
coming into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="690" facs="tcp:60710:358"/>
But the Folly of theſe men will at laſt puniſh it ſelf, and the Deſertors of Epiſcopacy
will appear the greateſt Enemies to and Betrayers of their own Intereſt: for Presbytery is
never ſo conſiderable or effectual as when it is joined to and crowned with Epiſcopacy.
All Miniſters will find as great a difference in point of thriving between the favour of
the People and of Princes, as Plants do between being watered by hand, or by the ſweet
and liberal dews of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The tenuity and contempt of Clergy-men will ſoon let them ſee, what a poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs
they are when parted from the influence of that Head to whoſe Supremacy they
have been ſworn.</p>
                     <p>A little Moderation might have prevented great miſchiefs. I am firm to Primitive
Epiſcopacy, not to have it extirpated, (if I can hinder it.) Diſcretion without Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might eaſily reform whatever the ruſt of Times or indulgence of Laws or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Manners have brough upon it. It being a groſs vulgar Error, to impute to or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
upon the Function the faults of Times or Perſons; which Seditious and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Principle and Practice all wiſe men abhor.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe Secular additaments and ornaments of Authority, Civil Honour and
Eſtate, which My Predeceſſors and Chriſtian Princes in all Countries have annexed to
Biſhops and Church-men, I look upon them but as juſt Rewards of their Learning and
Piety, who are fit to be in any degree of Church-Government; alſo enablements to
works of Charity and Hoſpitality, meet ſtrengthenings of their Authority in point of
Reſpect and Obſervance, which in peaceful times is hardly payed to any Governors by
the meaſure of their Virtues ſo much as by that of their Eſtates; poverty and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
expoſing them and their Authority to the contempt of licentious minds and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which perſecuting Times much reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>I would have ſuch men Biſhops as are moſt worthy of thoſe encouragements, and
beſt able to uſe them. If at any time My Judgment of men failed, My good Intention
made my error venial: And ſome Biſhops I am ſure I had, whoſe Learning, Gravity
and Piety no men of any worth or forehead can deny. But of all men, I would have
Church-men, eſpecially the Governors, to be redeemed from that vulgar Neglect,
which (beſides an innate principle of vicious oppoſition which is in all men againſt
thoſe that ſeem to reprove or reſtrain them) will neceſſarily follow both the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Parity, which makes all Miniſters equal, and the Independent Inferiority, which
ſets their Paſtors below the People.</p>
                     <p>This for my Judgment touching Epiſcopacy; wherein (God knows) I do not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
any deſign or Paſſion with the leaſt perverting of Truth.</p>
                     <p>And now I appeal to God above, and all the Chriſtian World, whether it be juſt for
Subjects, or pious for Chriſtians, by Violence and infinite Indignities, with ſervile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
to ſeek to force Me their KING and Soveraign, as ſome men have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to do, againſt all theſe grounds of My Judgment, to conſent to their weak and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Novelties.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Pretender of them deſires not more than I do, that the Church ſhould
be governed as Chriſt hath appointed, in true Reaſon and in Scripture; of which I
could never ſee any probable ſhew for any other ways: who either content themſelves
with the examples of ſome Churches in their infancy and ſolitude, when one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might ſerve one Congregation, in a City or Countrey; or elſe they deny theſe
moſt evident Truths, That the Apoſtles were Biſhops over thoſe Presbyters they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well as over the Churches they planted; and That Government being neceſſary
for the Churches well-being, when multiplied and ſociated, muſt alſo neceſſarily deſcend
from the Apoſtles to others, after the example of that power and ſuperiority they had
above others; which could not end with their Perſons, ſince the uſe and Ends of ſuch
Government ſtill continue.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt ſure, that the pureſt Primitive and beſt Churches flouriſhed under Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy;
and may ſo ſtill, if Ignorance, Superſtition, Avarice, Revenge, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
and diſloyal Paſſions had not ſo blown up ſome mens minds againſt it, that
what they want of Reaſons or Primitive Patterns, they ſupply with Violence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
wherein ſome mens zeal for Biſhops Lands, Houſes and Revenues, hath
ſet them on work to eat up Epiſcopacy; which (however other men eſteem) to
Me is no leſs ſin than Sacriledg, or a Robbery of God (the giver of all we have)
of that portion which devout minds have thankfully given again to him in giving it
to his Church and Prophets; through whoſe hands he graciouſly accepts even a cup of
cold water as a libation offered to himſelf.</p>

ſome men boldly, but weakly, calumniate) I could ſoon with Judgment break that

perſwade Me at once to ſo notorious and combined ſins of Sacriledg and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury?
beſides the many perſonal Injuſtices I muſt do to many worthy men, who are as
legally inveſted in their Eſtates as any who ſeek to deprive them; and they have by no
Law been convicted of thoſe Crimes which might forfeit their Eſtates and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
                     <p>I have oft wondred, how men pretending to Tenderneſs of Conſcience and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
can at once tell Me, that My Coronation-Oath binds Me to conſent to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they ſhall propound to Me (which they urge with ſuch Violence) tho contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all that Rational and Religious Freedom which every man ought to preſerve, and
of which they ſeem ſo tender in their own Votes; yet at the ſame time theſe men will
needs perſwade Me, that I muſt and ought to diſpenſe with, and roundly break that part
of My Oath, which binds Me (agreeable to the beſt light of Reaſon and Religion I
have) to maintain the Government and legal Rights of the Church. 'Tis ſtrange My
Oath ſhould be valid in that part, which both My ſelf and all men in their own caſe
eſteem injurious and unreaſonable, as being againſt the very natural and eſſential liberty
of our Souls; yet it ſhould be invalid and to be broken in another clauſe, wherein I
think My ſelf juſtly obliged both to God and Man.</p>
                     <p>Yet upon this Rack chiefly have I been held ſo long, by ſome mens ambitious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
and Sacrilegious Cruelty, torturing (with Me) both Church and State in
Civil diſſentions, till I ſhall be forced to conſent, and declare that I do approve what
(God knows) I utterly diſlike and in my Soul abhor, as many ways highly againſt
Reaſon, Juſtice, and Religion; and whereto if I ſhould ſhamefully and diſhonourably
give my Conſent, yet ſhould I not by ſo doing ſatisfie the divided Intereſts and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of thoſe Parties which contend with each other, as well as both againſt Me and
Epiſcopacy.</p>
                     <p>Nor can My late condeſcending to the <hi>Scots</hi> in point of Church-Government be
rightly objected againſt Me, as an inducement for Me to conſent to the like in my
other Kingdoms: for it ſhould be conſidered, that Epiſcopacy was not ſo rooted and
ſetled there as 'tis here; nor I (in that reſpect) ſo ſtrictly bound to continue it in that
Kingdom as in this: for what I think in my Judgment beſt, I may not think ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for all places and at all times.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall impute My yielding to them as My Failing and Sin, I can eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it; but that is no argument to do ſo again, or much worſe, I being now more
convinced in that point: nor indeed hath My yielding to them been ſo happy and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
as to encourage Me to grant the like to others.</p>
                     <p>Did I ſee any thing more of Chriſt, as to Meekneſs, Juſtice, Order, Charity and
Loyalty, in thoſe that pretend to other modes of Government, I might ſuſpect My
Judgment to be biaſſed or foreſtalled with ſome Prejudice and wontedneſs of Opinion:
but I have hitherto ſo much cauſe to ſuſpect the contrary in the Manners of many of
thoſe men, that I cannot from them gain the leaſt reputation for their new ways of
Government.</p>
                     <p>Nor can I find that in any Reformed Churches (whoſe patterns are ſo cried up and
obtruded upon the Churches under my Dominion) either Learning or Religion, works
of Piety or Charity, have ſo flouriſhed beyond what they have done in My Kingdoms,
(by Gods bleſſing) which might make Me believe either Presbytery or Independency
have a more benign influence upon the Church and mens hearts and lives, than Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
in its right conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The Abuſes of which deſerve to be extirpated as much as the uſe retained; for I think
it far better to hold to Primitive and Uniform Antiquity, than to comply with divided
Novelty.</p>
                     <p>A right Epiſcopacy would at once ſatisfie all juſt deſires and intereſts of good Biſhops,
humble Presbyters, and ſober People; ſo as Church affairs ſhould be managed neither
with Tyranny, Parity, nor Popularity; neither Biſhops ejected, nor Presbyters deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

like Men, whoſe ſtrength ſhould be more in their Underſtandings than in
their Limbs.</p>
                     <p>And tho I could ſeldom get opportunities to Treat, yet I never wanted either deſire
or diſpoſition to it: having greater confidence of my Reaſon, than my Sword:
I was ſo wholly reſolved to yield to the firſt, that I thought neither My ſelf nor
others ſhould need to uſe the ſecond, if once we rightly underſtood each other.</p>
                     <p>Nor did I ever think it a diminution of Me, to prevent them with expreſſes of My
Deſires, and even Importunities to Treat: It being an office not only of Humanity,
rather to uſe Reaſon than Force; but alſo of Chriſtianity, to <hi>ſeek peace and enſue it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I was very unwillingly compelled to defend My ſelf with Arms, ſo I very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced any thing tending to Peace.</p>
                     <p>The events of all War by the Sword being very dubious, and of a Civil War uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable;
the End hardly recompencing, and late repairing the miſchief of the Means.</p>
                     <p>Nor did any ſucceſs I had, ever enhaunce with Me the price of Peace, as earneſtly
deſired by Me as any man, tho I was like to pay dearer for it than any man: All that
I ſought to reſerve was Mine Honour and My Conſcience; the one I could not part
with as a KING, the other as a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>The Treaty at <hi>Vxbridg</hi> gave the faireſt hopes of an happy Compoſure; had others
applied themſelves to it with the ſame Moderation as I did, I am confident the War had
then ended.</p>

                        <pb n="693" facs="tcp:60710:359"/>
I was willing to condeſcend as far as Reaſon, Honour and Conſcience would give
Me leave: nor were the remaining Differences ſo eſſential to my Peoples Happineſs,
or of ſuch conſequence as in the leaſt kind to have hindred My Subjects either Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Proſperity: for they better enjoyed both many years before ever thoſe demands
were made; ſome of which to deny, I think the greateſt Juſtice to My ſelf, and Favor
to my Subjects.</p>
                     <p>I ſee Jealouſies are not ſo eaſily allayed as they are raiſed: Some men are more afraid
to retreat from violent Engagements, than to engage; what is wanting in Equity, muſt
be made up in Pertinacy. Such as had little to enjoy in Peace, or to loſe in War, ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to render the very name of <hi>Peace</hi> odious and ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>In Church affairs, where I had leaſt liberty of Prudence, having ſo many ſtrict ties
of Conſcience upon Me, yet I was willing to condeſcend ſo far to the ſetling of them
as might have given fair ſatisfaction to all men whom Faction, Covetouſneſs, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
had not engaged more than any true Zeal, Charity, or love of Reformation.</p>
                     <p>I was content to yield to all that might ſeem to advance true Piety: I only ſought to
continue what was neceſſary in point of Order, Maintenance and Authority, to the
Churches Government; and what, I am perſwaded (as I have elſewhere ſet down My
thoughts more fully) is moſt agreeable to the true Principles of all Government, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to its full ſtature and perfection, as alſo to the primitive Apoſtolical Pattern, and the
practice of the Univerſal Church conform thereto.</p>
                     <p>From which wholly to recede, without any probable reaſon urged or anſwered, only
to ſatisfie ſome mens wills and phantaſies (which yet agree not among themſelves in
any point, but that of extirpating Epiſcopacy, and fighting againſt Me) muſt needs
argue ſuch a ſoftneſs and infirmity of Mind in Me, as will rather part with Gods
Truth than Mans Peace; and rather loſe the Churches Honour, than croſs ſome mens
Factious humors.</p>
                     <p>God knows, and time will diſcover, who were moſt to blame for the unſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that Treaty, and who muſt bear the guilt of after-calamities. I believe, I am
very excuſable both before God and all unpaſſionate men, who have ſeriouſly weighed
thoſe Tranſactions, wherein I endeavoured no leſs the reſtauration of Peace to My People,
than the preſervation of My own Crowns to My Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Some men have that height, as to interpret all fair Condeſcendings as Arguments of
Feebleneſs, and glory moſt in an unflexible ſtifneſs, when they ſee others moſt ſupple
and inclinable to them.</p>
                     <p>A grand Maxime with them was, always to ask ſomething which in reaſon and
Honour muſt be denied, that they might have ſome colour to refuſe all that was in
other things granted; ſetting Peace at as high a rate as the worſt effects of War; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
firſt to make Me deſtroy My ſelf by diſhonourable Conceſſions, that ſo they
might have the leſs to do.</p>
                     <p>This was all which that Treaty or any other produced, to let the world ſee how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
I would deny, or they grant, in order to the Publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>That it gave occaſion to ſome mens further reſtiveneſs, is imputable to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
tempers, not to any Conceſſions or Negations of Mine: I have always the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of what I offered, and they the regret and blame for what they refuſed.</p>
                     <p>The higheſt tide of Succeſs ſet Me not above a Treaty, nor the loweſt ebb below a
Fight: tho I never thought it any ſign of true Valor to be prodigal of mens lives, rather
than to be drawn to produce our own Reaſons, or ſubſcribe to other mens.</p>
                     <p>That which made Me for the moſt part preſage the unſucceſsfulneſs of any Treaty
was, ſome mens unwillingneſs to Treat: which implied ſome things were to be gained
by the Sword, whoſe unreaſonableneſs they were loath to have fairly ſcanned, being more
proper to be acted by Soldiers than by Counſellors.</p>
                     <p>I pray God forgive them that were guilty of that Treaties breaking, and give them
grace to make their advantages gotten by the Sword, a better opportunity to uſe ſuch
Moderation as was then wanting; that ſo, tho Peace were for our ſins juſtly deferred,
yet at laſt it may be happily obtain'd: What we could not get by our Treaties, we may
gain by our Prayers.</p>
                     <p>O Thou that art the God of Reaſon and of Peace, who diſdaineſt not to Treat with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
preventing them with offers of Atonement, and beſeeching them to be reconciled with
thy ſelf, who wanteſt not Power or Juſtice to deſtroy them, yet aboundeſt in Mercy to ſave;

                     <p>THE various Succeſſes of this unhappy War have at leaſt afforded Me variety of
good Meditations. Sometimes God was pleaſed to try Me with Victory, by
worſting my Enemies, that I might know how with Moderation and thanks to own
and uſe his Power, who is only the true <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> able when he pleaſes to repreſs
the Confidence of thoſe that fought againſt Me with ſo great advantages for Power and
Number.</p>
                     <p>From ſmall beginnings on My part he let me ſee, that I was not wholly forſaken by
My Peoples Love or his Protection.</p>
                     <p>Other times God was pleaſed to exerciſe my Patience, and teach Me not to truſt in
the arm of Fleſh, but in the living God.</p>
                     <p>My Sins ſometimes prevailed againſt the Juſtice of my Cauſe: and thoſe that were
with Me wanted not matter and occaſion for his juſt Chaſtiſement both of them and
Me. Nor were my Enemies leſs puniſhed by that Proſperity, which hardened them to
continue that Injuſtice by open Hoſtility, which was begun by moſt riotous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary
Tumults.</p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but perſonal and private Sins may oft-times over-balance the
Juſtice of publick engagements; nor doth God account every gallant man (in the
worlds eſteem) a fit inſtrument to aſſert in the way of War a righteous Cauſe. The
more men are prone to arrogate to their own Skill, Valour and Strength, the leſs doth
God ordinarily work by them for his own Glory.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure the Event or Succeſs can never ſtate the Juſtice of any Cauſe, nor the
peace of mens Conſciences, nor the eternal fate of their Souls.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe with Me had (I think) clearly and undoubtedly for their Juſtification the
Word of Cod and the Laws of the Land, together with their own Oaths; all requiring
Obedience to My juſt Commands; but to none other under Heaven without Me, or
againſt Me, in the point of raiſing Arms.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe on the other ſide are forced to flie to the ſhifts of ſome pretended Fears, and
wild fundamentals of State (as they call them) which actually overthrow the preſent
Fabrick both of Church and State; being ſuch imaginary Reaſons for ſelf-defence as
are moſt impertinent for thoſe men to alledg, who being My Subjects, were manifeſtly
the firſt aſſaulters of Me and the Laws, firſt by unſuppreſſed Tumults, after by liſted
Forces. The ſame Allegations they uſe, will fit any Faction that hath but power and
Confidence enough to ſecond with the Sword all their demands againſt the Preſent
Laws and Governors; which can never be ſuch as ſome Side or other will not find fault
with, ſo as to urge what they call a Reformation of them, to a Rebellion againſt
them.</p>
                     <p>Some paraſitick Preachers have dared to call thoſe Martyrs who died fighting againſt
Me, the Laws, their Oaths, and the Religion eſtabliſhed: But ſober Chriſtians know,
that glorious Title can with truth be applied only to thoſe who ſincerely preferred
God's Truth and their Duty in all theſe particulars before their Lives and all that was
dear to them in this world; who having no advantagious deſigns by any Innovation,
were religiouſly ſenſible of thoſe ties to God, the Church, and My ſelf, which lay
upon their Souls, both for Obedience and juſt Aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>God could, and I doubt not but he did, through his Mercy, crown many of them

true Chriſtian grounds, which conflict with, and accuſe them in their own thoughts,
than they oft were in a deſperate bravery to fight againſt thoſe Forces which ſometimes
God gave Me.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe condition conquered and dying I make no queſtion but is infinitely more to
be choſen by a ſober man (that duly values his Duty, his Soul and Eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the enjoyments of this preſent Life) than the moſt triumphant glory wherein
their and Mine Enemies ſupervive; who can hardly avoid to be daily tormented by that
horrid guilt wherewith their ſuſpitious or now-convincted Conſciences do purſue them;
eſpecially ſince they and all the World have ſeen how falſe and un-intended thoſe
pretenſions were which they firſt ſet forth as the only plauſible (tho not juſtifiable)
grounds of raiſing a War, and continuing it thus long againſt Me and the Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
in whoſe ſafety and preſervation all honeſt men think the welfare of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
doth conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>For and with all which it is far more honourable and comfortable to ſuffer, than to
proſper in their ruine and ſubverſion.</p>
                     <p>I have often prayed, that all on My ſide might joyn true Piety with the ſenſe of
their Loyalty, and be as faithful to God and their own Souls as they were to Me:
That the defects of the one might not blaſt the endeavours of the other.</p>
                     <p>Yet I cannot think that any ſhews or truth of Piety on the other ſide were ſufficient
to diſpence with, or expiate the defects of their Duty and Loyalty to Me, which have
ſo pregnant convictions on mens Conſciences, that even profaner men are moved by
the ſenſe of them to venture their lives for Me.</p>
                     <p>I never had any Victory which was without My Sorrow, becauſe it was on mine own
Subjects, who, like <hi>Abſolom,</hi> died many of them in their ſin: And yet I never ſuffered
any Defeat which made Me deſpair of Gods Mercy and Defence.</p>
                     <p>I never deſired ſuch Victories as might ſerve to conquer, but only reſtore the Laws
and Liberties of My People; which I ſaw were extremely oppreſſed, together with My
Rights, by thoſe men who were impatient of any juſt reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>When Providence gave Me or denied Me Victory, My deſire was neither to boaſt
of My Power, nor to charge God fooliſhly; who I believe at laſt would make all
things to work together for My good.</p>
                     <p>I wiſhed no greater advantages by the War, than to bring My Enemies to Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and My Friends to Peace.</p>
                     <p>I was afraid of the temptation of an abſolute Conqueſt, and never prayed more for
Victory over others than over My ſelf. When the firſt was denied, the ſecond was
granted Me, which God ſaw beſt for Me.</p>
                     <p>The different events were but the methods of Divne Juſtice, by contrary winds
to winnow us: That by puniſhing our Sins he might purge them from us; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deferring
Peace, he might prepare us more to prize and better to uſe ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p>My often Meſſages for Peace ſhewed that I delighted not in War: as my former
Conceſſions ſufficiently teſtified how willingly I would have prevented it; and my to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
unpreparedneſs for it, how little I intended it.</p>
                     <p>The conſcience of my Innocency forbade Me to fear a War; but the love of My
Kingdoms commanded Me (if poſſible) to avoid it.</p>
                     <p>I am guilty in this War of nothing but this, That I gave ſuch advantages to ſome
men by confirming their Power, which they knew not to uſe with that modeſty and
gratitude which became their Loyalty and My Confidence.</p>
                     <p>Had I yielded leſs, I had been oppoſed leſs; had I denied more, I had been more
obeyed.</p>
                     <p>'Tis now too late to review the Occaſions of the War; I wiſh only a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of ſo unhappy Beginnings. The inevitable fate of our Sins was (no doubt)
ſuch, as would no longer ſuffer the Divine Juſtice to be quiet: we having conquered his
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:60710:361"/>
Patience, are condemned by mutual conquerings to deſtroy one another; for the moſt
proſperous Succeſſes on either ſide impair the welfare of the whole.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Victories are ſtill miſerable that leave our Sins un-ſubdued, fluſhing our Pride,
and animating to continue Injuries.</p>
                     <p>Peace it ſelf is not deſirable, till Repentance have prepared us for it.</p>
                     <p>When we fight more againſt our ſelves and leſs againſt God, we ſhall ceaſe fighting
one againſt another. I pray God theſe may all meet in our hearts, and ſo diſpoſe us
to an happy concluſion of theſe Civil Wars, that I may know better to obey God,
and govern my People, and they may learn better to obey both God and
Me.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I deſire any man ſhould be further ſubject to Me, than all of us may be ſubject
to God.</p>
                     <p>O my God, make Me content to be overcome, when Thou wilt have it ſo.</p>
                     <p>Teach Me the nobleſt Victory over My ſelf and my Enemies by Patience; which was
Chriſts Conquest, and may well become a Christian King.</p>
                     <p>Between both thy hands, the right ſometimes ſupporting, and the left afflicting, faſhion us
to that frame of Piety Thou likeſt beſt.</p>
                     <p>Forgive the Pride that attends our proſperous, and the Repinings which follow our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous
events; when going forth in our own strength, Thou withdraweſt thine, and goeſt not
forth with our Armies.</p>
                     <p>Be Thou all, when we are ſomething, and when we are nothing; that Thou mayeſt have
the Glory, when we are in a victorious or inglorious condition.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, knoweſt how hard it is for Me to ſuffer ſo much evil from my Subjects, to
whom I intend nothing but good; and I cannot but ſuffer in thoſe Evils which they compel
Me to inflict upon them, puniſhing My ſelf in their Puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore both in conquering and being conquered I am ſtill a Sufferer; I beſeech
Thee to give Me a double portion of thy Spirit, and that meaſure of Grace which only can
be ſufficient for Me.</p>
                     <p>As I am moſt afflicted, ſo make Me moſt reformed; that I may be not only happy to ſee
an end of theſe Civil Diſtractions, but a chief inſtrument to restore and eſtabliſh a firm and
bleſſed Peace to My Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>Stir up in all parties pious ambitions to overcome each other with Reaſon, Moderation,
and ſuch Self-denial as becomes thoſe who conſider, that our mutual Diviſions are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Distractions, and the Vnion of all is every good mans chiefest Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>If, O Lord, as for the ſins of our Peace Thou haſt brought upon us the miſeries of War,
ſo for the ſins of War Thou ſhouldſt ſee fit ſtill to deny us the bleſſing of Peace, and ſo keep
us in a circulation of Miſeries; yet give Me thy Servant, and all Loyal (tho afflicted)
Subjects, to enjoy that Peace which the world can neither give to us nor take from us.</p>
                     <p>Impute not to Me the Blood of My Subjects, which with infinite unwillingneſs and grief
hath been ſhed by Me in My juſt and neceſſary Defence; but waſh Me with that precious
Blood which hath been ſhed for Me by my great Peace-maker, Jeſus Christ: who will, I truſt,
redeem Me ſhortly out of all My Troubles; for I know the triumphing of the Wicked is but
ſhort, and the joy of Hypocrites is but for a moment.</p>

                     <p>NO Glory is more to be envied than that of due Reforming either Church or State,
when Deformities are ſuch that the Perturbation and Novelty are not like to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

                     <p>Altho God ſhould not honour Me ſo far as to make Me an inſtrument of ſo good a

                     <p>As I was well pleaſed with this Parliaments firſt intentions, to reform what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of Times and corruption of Manners might have depraved; ſo I am ſorry to
ſee, after the freedom of Parliament was by factious Tumults oppreſſed, how little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
was had to the good Laws eſtabliſhed and the Religion ſetled, which ought to be
the firſt Rule and Standard of Reforming: with how much Partiality and popular
Compliance the Paſſions and Opinions of men have been gratified, to the detriment of
the Publick, and the infinite Scandal of the Reformed Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="697" facs="tcp:60710:361"/>
What diſſolutions of all Order and Government in the Church; what Novelties of
Schiſms and corrupt Opinions; what Undecencies and Confuſions in Sacred Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations;
what Sacrilegious invaſions upon the Rights and Revenues of the Church;
what Contempt and Oppreſſions of the Clergy; what injurious Diminutions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutings
of Me, have followed (as ſhowres do warm gleams) the talk of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all ſober men are Witneſſes, and with My ſelf ſad Spectators hitherto.</p>
                     <p>The great miſcarriage, I think, is, that Popular clamors and fury have been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Reputation of Zeal and the publick Senſe; ſo that the ſtudy to pleaſe ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
hath indeed injured all.</p>
                     <p>Freedom, Moderation and Impartiality, are ſure the beſt tempers of Reforming
Counſels and endeavours: What is acted by Factions cannot but offend more than it
pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>I have offered to put all differences in Church affairs and Religion to the free conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Synod or Convocation rightly choſen; the reſults of whoſe Counſels as
they would have included the Votes of all, ſo it's like they would have given moſt
ſatisfaction to all.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſembly of Divines, whom the Two Houſes have applied (in an unwonted
way) to adviſe of Church Affairs, I diſlike not further than that they are not legally
convened and choſen, nor act in the name of all the Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> nor with
freedom and impartiality can do any thing, being limited and confined, if not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed,
to do and declare what they do.</p>
                     <p>For I cannot think ſo many men, cried up for Learning and Piety, who formerly
allowed the Liturgy and Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as to the main, would
have ſo ſuddenly agreed quite to aboliſh both of them, (the laſt of which they knew to
be of Apoſtolical inſtitution at leaſt, as of Primitive and Univerſal practice) if they
had been left to the liberty of their own ſuſſrages; and if the influence of contrary
Factions had not by ſecret encroachments of hopes and fears prevailed upon them, to
comply with ſo great and dangerous Innovations in the Church, without any regard to
their own former Judgment and Practice, or to the common Intereſt and Honour of
all the Clergy, and in them of Order, Learning and Religion; againſt examples of all
Ancient Churches, the Laws in force, and My Conſent, which is never to be gained
againſt ſo pregnant light as in that point ſhines on My Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>For I conceive that where the Scripture is not ſo clear and punctual in Precepts, there
the conſtant and univerſal Practice of the Church in things not contrary to Reaſon,
Faith, Good Manners, or any poſitive Command, is the beſt Rule that Chriſtians can
follow.</p>
                     <p>I was willing to grant or reſtore to Presbytery what with Reaſon or Diſcretion it can
pretend to, in a conjuncture with Epiſcopacy: but for that wholly to invade the
Power, and by the Sword to arrogate and quite abrogate the Authority of that Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Order, I think neither juſt as to Epiſcopacy, nor ſafe for Presbytery, nor yet any
way convenient for this Church or State.</p>
                     <p>A due Reformation had eaſily followed moderate Counſels, and ſuch (I believe) as
would have given more content even to the moſt of thoſe Divines who have been led
on with much Gravity and Formality to carry on other mens deſigns: which no doubt
many of them by this time diſcover, tho they dare not but ſmother their fruſtrations
and diſcontents.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecious and popular titles of Chriſt's Government, Throne, Scepter and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(which certainly is not divided, nor hath two faces, as their Parties now have at
leaſt) as alſo the noiſe of a thorough Reformation, may as eaſily be fixed on new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
as fair colours may be put to ill-favoured figures.</p>
                     <p>The breaking of Church-Windows, which time had ſufficiently defaced; pulling
down of Croſſes, which were but Civil, not Religious marks; defacing of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Inſcriptions of the Dead, which ſerved but to put Poſterity in mind to
thank God for that clearer light wherein they live; the leaving of all Miniſters to
their liberties and private abilities in the Publick Service of God, where no Chriſtian
can tell to what he may ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> nor what adventure he may make of ſeeming, at
leaſt, to conſent to the Errors, Blaſphemies and ridiculous Undecencies, which bold
and ignorant men liſt to vent in their Prayers, Preaching, and other Offices; the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth alſo of old Catechiſms and Confeſſions of Faith new dreſt, importing as much
as if there had been no ſound or clear Doctrine of Faith in this Church, before ſome
four or five years conſultation had matured their thoughts touching their firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="698" facs="tcp:60710:362"/>
All theſe and the like are the effects of popular, ſpecious and deceitful Reformations
(that they might not ſeem to have nothing to do) and may give ſome ſhort flaſhes of
content to the Vulgar (who are taken with Novelties, as Children with Babies, very
much, but not very long:) but all this amounts not to, nor can in Juſtice merit the
glory of the Churches thorough Reformation; ſince they leave all things more deformed,
diſorderly and diſcontented than when they began, in point of Piety, Morality, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and good Order.</p>
                     <p>Nor can they eaſily recompence or remedy the Inconveniencies and Miſchiefs which
they have purchaſed ſo dearly, and which have and ever will neceſſarily enſue, till due
Remedies be applied.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh they would at laſt make it their Unanimous work to do Gods work, and not
their own: Had Religion been firſt conſidered (as it merited) much trouble might
have been prevented.</p>
                     <p>But ſome men thought that the Government of this Church and State, fixed by ſo
many Laws and long Cuſtoms, would not run into their new moulds, till they had
firſt melted it in the fire of a Civil War; by the advantages of which they reſolved, if
they prevailed, to make My ſelf and all My Subjects fall down and worſhip the Images
they ſhould form and ſet up. If there had been as much of Chriſts Spirit for Meekneſs,
Wiſdom and Charity, in mens hearts, as there was of his Name uſed in the pretenſions
to reform all to Chriſts Rule, it would certainly have obtained more of God's Bleſſing,
and produced more of Chriſts Glory, the Churches good, the Honour of Religion,
and the Unity of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Publick Reformers had need firſt act in private, and practiſe that on their own hearts
which they purpoſe to try on others; for Deformities within will ſoon betray the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
of publick Reformation to ſuch private Deſigns as muſt needs hinder the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure the right methods of Reforming the Church cannot conſiſt with that of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing
the Civil State, nor can Religion be juſtly advanced by depreſſing Loyalty,
which is one of the chiefeſt Ingredients and Ornaments of true Religion; for next to
<hi>Fear God,</hi> is, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doubt not but Chriſts Kingdom may be ſet up without pulling down Mine; nor
will any men in impartial times appear good Chriſtians, that approve not themſelves
good Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt's Government will confirm Mine, not overthrow it; ſince as I own Mine
from Him, ſo I deſire to Rule for his Glory and his Churches good.</p>
                     <p>Had ſome men truly intended Chriſt's Government, or knew what it meant in their
hearts, they could never have been ſo ill governed in their words and actions both
againſt Me and one another.</p>
                     <p>As good Ends cannot juſtifie evil Means, ſo nor will evil Beginnings ever bring forth
good Concluſions; unleſs God, by a miracle of Mercy, create Light out of Darkneſs,
Order out of our Confuſions, and Peace out of our Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, who only canſt give us beauty for aſhes, and Truth for Hypocriſie, ſuffer
us not to be miſerably deluded with Phariſaical waſhings, in ſtead of Chriſtian Reformings.</p>
                     <p>Our greateſt Deformities are within: make us the ſevereſt Cenſurers and firſt Reformers
of our own Souls.</p>
                     <p>That we may in clearneſs of Judgment and Vprightneſs of heart be a means to reform
what is indeed amiſs in Church and State.</p>
                     <p>Create in us clean hearts, O Lord, and renew right ſpirits within-us; that we may do
all by thy directions, to thy Glory, and with thy Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Pity the Deformities which ſome raſh and cruel Reformers have brought upon this Church
and State; quench the fires which Factions have kindled under the pretence of Reforming.</p>
                     <p>As thou haſt ſhewed the world by their Diviſions and Confuſions what is the pravity of
ſome mens Intentions, and weakneſs of their Judgments; ſo bring us at laſt more refined out
of theſe fires, by the methods of Chriſtian and charitable Reformations; wherein nothing of
Ambition, Revenge, Covetouſneſs or Sacrilege may have any influence upon their counſels
whom thy Providence in juſt and lawful ways ſhall entrnſt with ſo great, good, and now moſt
neceſſary a work. That I and My People may be ſo bleſt with inward Piety, as may beſt teach
us how to uſe the Bleſſing of outward Peace.</p>

                     <p>THE taking of My Letters was an opportunity, which as the malice of Mine
Enemies could hardly have expected, ſo they knew not how with honour and
civility to uſe it. Nor do I think, with ſober and worthy minds, any thing in them
could tend ſo much to My Reproach, as the odious divulging of them did to the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the Divulgers: The greateſt experiments of Virtue and Nobleneſs being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the greateſt advantages againſt an Enemy; and the greateſt Obligations being
thoſe which are put upon us by them from whom we could leaſt have expected them.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch I ſhould have eſteemed the concealing of My Papers: The freedom and
ſecrecy of which commands a Civility from all men not wholly barbarous; nor is
there any thing more inhumane than to expoſe them to publick view.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſince Providence will have it ſo, I am content ſo much of My Heart (which I
ſtudy to approve to Gods Omniſcience) ſhould be diſcovered to the world, without
any of thoſe dreſſes or popular captations which ſome men uſe in their Speeches and
Expreſſes. I wiſh my Subjects had yet a clearer ſight into My moſt retired Thoughts:</p>
                     <p>Where they might diſcover how they are divided between the Love and Care I have,
not more to preſerve My own Rights, than to procure their Peace and Happineſs; and
that extreme Grief to ſee them both deceived and deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Nor can any mens Malice be gratified further by My Letters, than to ſee My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
to my Wife, the Laws and Religion. Bees will gather Honey where the Spider
ſucks Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>That I endeavour to avoid the preſſures of my Enemies by all fair and juſt Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
no man can blame who loves Me or the Commonwealth; ſince My Subjects
can hardly be happy if I be miſerable, or enjoy their Peace and Liberty while I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>The World may ſee how ſome Mens deſign, like <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s, is by enormous Actions
to widen differences, and exaſperate all Sides to ſuch diſtances, as may make all Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
deſperate.</p>
                     <p>Yet I thank God I can not only with Patience bear this as other Indignities, but with
Charity forgive them.</p>
                     <p>The Integrity of My Intentions is not jealous of any injury My Expreſſions can do
them; for although the confidence of Privacy may admit greater freedom in Writing
ſuch Letters which may be liable to envious exceptions; yet the Innocency of My
chief Purpoſes cannot be ſo ſtained or miſ-interpreted by them, as not to let all men ſee,
that I wiſh nothing more than an happy compoſure of Differences with Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
not more to My own than My Peoples content, who have any ſparks of Love or
Loyalty left in them: who by thoſe My Letters may be convinced, that I can both
mind and act My own and My Kingdoms Affairs, ſo as becomes a Prince; which Mine
Enemies have always been very loth ſhould be believed of Me, as if I were wholly
confined to the Dictates and Directions of others, whom they pleaſe to brand with the
name of Evil Counſellors.</p>
                     <p>It's probable ſome men will now look upon Me as My own Counſellor, and having
none elſe to quarrel with, under that notion they will hereafter confine their anger to
My ſelf: Altho I know they are very unwilling I ſhould enjoy the liberty of My own
Thoughts, or follow the light of My own Conſcience, which they labour to bring
into an abſolute captivity to themſelves; not allowing Me to think their Counſels to be
other than good for Me, which have ſo long maintained a War againſt Me.</p>
                     <p>The Victory they obtained that day when My Letters became their prize, had been
enough to have ſatiated the moſt ambitious thirſt of Popular glory among the Vulgar,
with whom Proſperity gains the greateſt eſteem and applauſe, as Adverſity expoſeth to
their greateſt ſlighting and diſreſpect: As if good fortune were always the ſhadow of
Virtue and Juſtice, and did not oftner attend Vicious and Injurious actions as to this
world.</p>
                     <p>But I ſee no Secular advantages ſeem ſufficient to that Cauſe which began with Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and depends chiefly upon the reputation with the Vulgar.</p>
                     <p>They think no Victories ſo effectual to their deſigns as thoſe that moſt rout and
waſte My Credit with My People; in whoſe hearts they ſeek by all means to ſmother
and extinguiſh all ſparks of Love, Reſpect and Loyalty to Me, that they may never
kindle again, ſo as recover Mine, the Laws and the Kingdoms Liberties, which ſome
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:60710:363"/>
men ſeek to overthrow. The taking away of My Credit is but a neceſſary prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the taking away of My Life and My Kingdoms: firſt I muſt ſeem neither fit to
Live, nor worthy to Reign; by exquiſite methods of Cunning and Cruelty I muſt be
compelled firſt to follow the Funerals of My Honour, and then be deſtroyed. But I
know God's un-erring and impartial Juſtice can and will over-rule the moſt perverſe
wills and deſigns of men; He is able, and (I hope) will turn even the worſt of Mine
Enemies thoughts and actions to My good.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I think that by the ſurprize of My Letters I have loſt any more than ſo many
Papers: How much they have loſt of that reputation for Civility and Humanity,
(which ought to be paid to all men, and moſt becomes ſuch as pretend to Religion)
beſides that of Reſpect and Honour which they owe to their <hi>King,</hi> preſent and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will judge. And I cannot think that their own Conſciences are ſo ſtupid, as not
to inflict upon them ſome ſecret impreſſions of that Shame and Diſhonour which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
all unworthy actions, have they never ſo much of publick flattery and popular
countenance.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure they can never expect the Divine approbation of ſuch indecent actions, if
they do but remember how God bleſt the modeſt reſpect and filial tenderneſs which
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons bare to their Father; nor did his open infirmity juſtify <hi>Cham</hi>'s impudency,
or exempt him from that Curſe of being <hi>Servant of Servants:</hi> which Curſe muſt needs
be on them who ſeek by diſhonourable actions to pleaſe the Vulgar, and confirm by
ignoble acts their dependance upon the People.</p>
                     <p>Nor can their Malicious intentions be ever either excuſable or proſperous, who
thought by this means to expoſe Me to the higheſt Reproach and Contempt of my
People; forgetting that duty of Modeſt concealment which they owed to the Father
of their Country, in caſe they had diſcovered any real Uncomelineſs, which, I thank
God, they did not; who can, and, I believe, hath made Me more reſpected in the
hearts of many, (as he did <hi>David</hi>) to whom they thought, by publiſhing My private
Letters, to have rendred me as <hi>a vile Perſon,</hi> not fit to be truſted, or conſidered under
any notion of Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>But Thou, O Lord, whoſe wiſe and all-diſpoſing Providence ordereth the greateſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of humane affairs, make Me to ſee the conſtancy of Thy Mercies to Me in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
advantages Thou ſeemest to give the Malice of My Enemies against Me.</p>
                     <p>As Thou didst blast the counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> turning it to <hi>David</hi>'s good and his own
ruine; ſo canst Thou defeat their deſign who intended by publiſhing My private Letters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to render Me more odious and contemptible to my People.</p>
                     <p>I muſt firſt appeal to thy Omniſcience, who canſt witneſs with my Integrity, how unjuſt and
falſe thoſe ſcandalous Miſconſtructions are, which My Enemies endeavour by thoſe Papers of
Mine to repreſent to the world.</p>
                     <p>Make the evil they imagined, and diſpleaſure they intended thereby against Me, ſo to
return on their own heads, that they may be aſhamed, and covered with their own Confuſion
as with a cloak.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſeest how Mine Enemies uſe all means to cloud Mine Honour, to pervert My purpoſes,
and to ſlander the footſteps of thine Anointed.</p>
                     <p>But give Me an heart content to be diſhonoured for thy ſake and thy Churches good.</p>
                     <p>Fix in Me a purpoſe to honour Thee, and then I know Thou wilt honour Me, either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
to Me the enjoyment of that Power and Majeſty which Thou haſt ſuffered ſome men to
ſeek to deprive Me of; or by beſtowing on Me that crown of Chriſtian Patience, which knows
how to ſerve Thee in honour or diſhonour, in good report or evil.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, art the fountain of Goodneſs and Honour, Thou art clothed with excellent
Majeſty; make Me to partake of thy Excellency for Wiſdom, Juſtice and Mercy, and I ſhall
not want that degree of Honour and Majeſty which becomes the Place in which thou haſt ſet
Me, who art the lifter up of my head, and my Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Lord, by thy Grace lead Me to thy Glory, which is both true and eternal.</p>

SCOTS.</head>
                     <p>ALtho God hath given Me Three Kingdoms, yet in theſe He hath not now left
Me any place where I may with ſafety and Honor reſt My Head; ſhewing Me
that Himſelf is the ſafeſt Refuge, and the ſtrongeſt Tower of Defence, in which I may
put My Truſt.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Extremities I look not to man ſo much as to God: He will have it thus;
that I may wholly caſt My ſelf, and My now diſtreſſed Affairs upon his Mercy, who
hath both the hearts and hands of all men in his diſpoſe.</p>
                     <p>What Providence denies to Force, it may grant to Prudence: Neceſſity is now My
Counſellor, and commands Me to ſtudy My Safety by a diſguiſed withdrawing from
My chiefeſt Strength, and adventuring upon their Loyalty who firſt began my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Haply God may make them a means honourably to compoſe them.</p>
                     <p>This My Confidence of them may diſarm and overcome them: My rendring My
Perſon to them may engage their Affections to Me, who have oft profeſſed, <hi>They fought
not againſt Me, but for Me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt now reſolve the riddle of their Loyalty, and give them opportunity to let the
world ſee they mean not what they do, but what they ſay.</p>
                     <p>Yet muſt God be My chiefeſt Guard, and My Conſcience both My Counſellor and
My Comforter. Tho I put my Body into their hands, yet I ſhall reſerve My Soul to
God and My ſelf; nor ſhall any Neceſſities compel Me to deſert mine Honour, or ſwerve
from My Judgment.</p>
                     <p>What they ſought to take by Force, ſhall now be given them in ſuch a way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Confidence of them, as may make them aſhamed not to be really ſuch as they
ought, and profeſſed to be.</p>
                     <p>God ſees it not enough to deprive Me of all Military Power, to defend My ſelf; but
to put Me upon uſing their power, who ſeem to fight againſt Me, yet ought in duty
to defend Me.</p>
                     <p>So various are all human affairs, and ſo neceſſitous may the ſtate of Princes be, that
their greateſt Danger may be in their ſuppoſed Safety, and their Safety in their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Danger.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now leave thoſe that have adhered to Me, and apply to thoſe that have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Me: this method of Peace may be more proſperous than that of War, both to ſtop
the effuſion of blood, and to cloſe thoſe wounds already made. And in it I am no leſs
ſolicitous for My Friends ſafety than Mine own; chuſing to venture My ſelf upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hazards, rather than expoſe their reſolute Loyalty to all extremities.</p>
                     <p>It is ſome skill in play to know when a game is loſt: better fairly to give over, than
to conteſt in vain.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now ſtudy to re-inforce my Judgment, and fortifie my Mind with Reaſon and
Religion; that I may not ſeem to offer up My Souls Liberty, or make My Conſcience
their Captive, who ought at firſt to have uſed Arguments, nor Arms, to have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
My Conſent to their new demands.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, no Succeſs darkens or diſguiſes Truth to Me; and I ſhall no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my words to my inward dictates now, than if they had been, as the words of a
KING ought to be among Loyal Subjects, <hi>full of power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reaſon is the Divineſt power: I ſhall never think My ſelf weakned, while I may
make full and free uſe of that. No eclipſe of outward fortune ſhall rob me of that
light: what God hath denied of outward Strength, his Grace, I hope, will ſupply
with inward Reſolutions; not moroſely to deny what is fit to be granted, but not to
grant any thing which Reaſon and Religion bids me deny.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall never think My ſelf leſs than My ſelf, while I am able thus to preſerve
the Integrity of My Conſcience, the only Jewel now left Me which is worth
keeping.</p>
                     <p>O Thou Soveraign of our Souls, the only Commander of our Conſciences; tho I know not
what to do, yet mine eyes are toward Thee: To the protection of thy Mercy I ſtill commend
My ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As Thou haſt preſerved Me in the day of Battel, ſo Thou canſt ſtill ſhew Me thy ſtrength
in My weakneſs.</p>

Me, for I never truſted to them further than to men: If I am ſold by them, I am
only ſorry they ſhould do it; and that My price ſhould be ſo much above my Saviour's.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are but further Eſſays which God will have Me make of mans Uncertainty,
the more to fix Me on Himſelf, who never faileth them that truſt in him. Tho the Reeds
of <hi>Egypt</hi> break under the hand of him that leans on them; yet the Rock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will
be an everlaſting ſtay and defence.</p>
                     <p>Gods Providence commands Me to retire from all to himſelf, that in him I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
My ſelf, whom I loſe while I let out my hopes to others.</p>
                     <p>The Solitude and Captivity to which I am now reduced, gives Me leiſure enough to
ſtudy the World's Vanity and Inconſtancy.</p>
                     <p>God ſees it fit to deprive Me of Wife, Children, Army, Friends and Freedom, that I
may be wholly His, who alone is all.</p>
                     <p>I care not much to be reckoned among the Unfortunate, if I be not in the black liſt
of Irreligious and Sacrilegious Princes.</p>
                     <p>No Reſtraint ſhall enſnare My Soul in ſin, nor gain that of Me which may make My
Enemies more inſolent, My Friends aſhamed, or My Name accurſed.</p>
                     <p>They have no great cauſe to triumph that they have got My Perſon into their power,
ſince My Soul is ſtill My own: nor ſhall they ever gain My Conſent againſt My Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>What they call Obſtinacy, I know God accounts honeſt Conſtancy, from which
Reaſon and Religion, as well as Honour, forbid Me to recede.</p>
                     <p>'Tis evident now, that it was not Evil Counſellors with Me, but a good Conſcience
in Me, which hath been fought againſt; nor did they ever intend to bring Me to My
Parliament, till they had brought My Mind to their obedience.</p>
                     <p>Should I grant what ſome men deſire, I ſhould be ſuch as they wiſh Me; not more

                     <p>What Tumults and Armies could not obtain, neither ſhall Reſtraint; which tho it
have as little of Safety to a Prince, yet it hath not more of Danger.</p>
                     <p>The Fear of men ſhall never be My Snare, nor ſhall the love of any Liberty entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
my Soul: Better others betray Me than My ſelf, and that the price of my Liberty
ſhould be My Conſcience. The greateſt Injuries My Enemies ſeek to inflict upon Me
cannot be without My own Conſent.</p>
                     <p>While I can deny with Reaſon, I ſhall defeat the greateſt impreſſions of their Malice,
who neither know how to uſe worthily what I have already granted, nor what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more of Me but this, that I would ſeem willing to help them to deſtroy My ſelf
and Mine.</p>
                     <p>Altho they ſhould deſtroy Me, yet they ſhall have no cauſe to deſpiſe Me.</p>

more than any War can do, while I gratifie a few to oppreſs all.</p>
                     <p>The Laws will, by God's bleſſing, revive, with the Love and Loyalty of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

                     <p>Give Me that meaſure of Patience and Conſtancy which my condition now requires.</p>
                     <p>My ſtrength is ſcattered, my expectation from men defeated, my Perſon reſtrained: O be

                     <p>WHen Providence was pleaſed to deprive Me of all other civil Comforts and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Attendants, I thought the abſence of them all might beſt be ſupplied by
the attendance of ſome of My Chaplains; whom for their Function I reverence, and
for their Fidelity I have cauſe to love. By their Learning, Piety and Prayers I hoped
to be either better enabled to ſuſtain the want of all other enjoyments, or better fitted
for the recovery and uſe of them in God's good time: ſo reaping by their Pious help
a ſpiritual harveſt of Grace, amidſt the thorns and after the plowings of temporal
Croſſes.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I never needed or deſired more the ſervice and aſſiſtance of men ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
Pious and ſoberly Devout.</p>
                     <p>The Solitude they have confined Me unto, adds the Wilderneſs to My Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
For the company they obtrude upon Me is more ſad than any Solitude
can be.</p>
                     <p>If I had asked My Revenues, My Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or any one of My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
it had been no wonder to have been denied in thoſe things, where the evil Policy
of men forbids all juſt reſtitution, leſt they ſhould confeſs an injurious Uſurpation: But
to deny Me the Ghoſtly comfort of My Chaplains, ſeems a greater Rigor and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than is ever uſed by Chriſtians to the meaneſt Priſoners and greateſt Malefactors;
whom tho the Juſtice of the Law deprives of worldly comforts, yet the Mercy of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:60710:365"/>
allows them the benefit of their Clergy, as not aiming at once to deſtroy their
Bodies, and to damn their Souls.</p>
                     <p>But My Agony muſt not be relieved with the preſence of any one good Angel;
for ſuch I account a Learned, Godly, and diſcreet Divine: and ſuch I would have all
mine to be.</p>
                     <p>They that envy My being a King, are loth I ſhould be a Chriſtian; while they ſeek
to deprive Me of all things elſe, they are afraid I ſhould ſave My Soul.</p>
                     <p>Other ſenſe Charity it ſelf can hardly pick out of thoſe many harſh Repulſes I
received, as to that Requeſt ſo often made for the attendance of ſome of My Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</p>
                     <p>I have ſometime thought, the Unchriſtianneſs of thoſe denials might ariſe from a
diſpleaſure ſome men had to ſee Me prefer My own Divines before their Miniſters:
whom tho I reſpect for that worth and piety which may be in them; yet I cannot
think them ſo proper for My preſent Comforters or Phyſicians, who have (ſome of
them at leaſt) had ſo great an influence in occaſioning theſe Calamities, and inflicting
theſe Wounds upon Me.</p>
                     <p>Nor are the ſobereſt of them ſo apt for that Devotional compliance and juncture of
hearts, which I deſire to bear in thoſe holy Offices to be performed with Me and for Me;
ſince their Judgments ſtanding at a diſtance from Me, or in jealouſie of Me, or in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
againſt Me, their Spirits cannot ſo harmoniouſly accord with Mine, or Mine
with theirs, either in Prayer or other holy Duties, as is meet and moſt comfortable;
whoſe Golden Rule and bond of Perfection conſiſts in that of mutual Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>Some Remedies are worſe than the Diſeaſe, and ſome Comforters more miſerable
than Miſery it ſelf: when like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, they ſeek not to fortifie ones mind with
Patience, but perſwade a man, by betraying his own Innocency, to deſpair of God's
Mercy; and by juſtifying their injuries, to ſtrengthen the hands and harden the hearts
of inſolent Enemies.</p>
                     <p>I am ſo much a friend to all Church-men that have any thing in them beſeeming
that Sacred Function, that I have hazarded My own Intereſt chiefly upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and Conſtancy to maintain their Rights: whom the more I looked upon
as Orphans, and under the Sacrilegious eyes of many cruel and rapacious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;
the more I thought it My duty to appear as a Father and a Patron for
them and the Church. Although I am very unhandſomly requited by ſome of
them, who may live to repent no leſs for My Sufferings than their own ungrateful
Errors, and that injurious Contempt and Meanneſs which they have brought upon their
Calling and Perſons.</p>
                     <p>I pity all of them, I deſpiſe none; only I thought I might have leave to make choice
of ſome for my ſpecial Attendants, who were beſt approved in My Judgment, and
moſt ſuitable to My Affection. For I held it better to ſeem undevout, and to hear no
mens Prayers, than to be forced, or ſeem to comply with thoſe Petitions to which the
Heart cannot conſent, nor the Tongue ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> without contradicting a mans own
Underſtanding, or belying his own Soul.</p>
                     <p>In Devotions I love neither Profane Boldneſs, nor Pious Nonſenſe; but ſuch an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and judicious Gravity, as ſhews the Speaker to be at once conſiderate of God's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
the Churches Honour, and his own Vileneſs; both knowing what things God
allows him to ask, and in what manner it becomes a Sinner to ſupplicate the Divine
Mercy for himſelf and others.</p>
                     <p>I am equally ſcandalized with all Prayers that ſound either imperiouſly, or rudely,
or paſſionately; as either wanting Humility to God, or Charity to men, or Reſpect to
the Duty.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs I am better pleaſed, as with ſtudied and premeditated Sermons, ſo with ſuch
publick Forms of Prayer as are fitted to the Churches and every Chriſtians daily and
common neceſſities; becauſe I am by them better aſſured what I may joyn my Heart
unto, than I can be of any mans Extemporary ſufficiency; which as I do not wholly
exclude from publick occaſions, ſo I allow its juſt liberty and uſe in private and devout
retirements, where neither the ſolemnity of the Duty, nor the modeſt regard to others
do require ſo great exactneſs as to the outward manner of performance. Tho the light
of Underſtanding and the fervency of Affection, I hold the main and moſt neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
both in conſtant and occaſional, ſolitary and ſocial Devotions.</p>
                     <p>So that I muſt needs ſeem to all equal minds, with as much Reaſon to prefer the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of My own Chaplains before that of their Miniſters, as I do the Liturgy before
their Directory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="705" facs="tcp:60710:365"/>
In the one I have been always educated and exerciſed; in the other I am not yet Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed
nor acquainted: And if I were, yet ſhould I not by that, as by any certain
Rule and Canon of Devotion, be able to follow or find out the indirect extravagancies
of moſt of thoſe men who highly cry up that as a piece of rare compoſure and uſe,
which is already as much deſpiſed and diſuſed by many of them, as the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer
ſometimes was by thoſe men, a great part of whoſe piety hung upon that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
pin of railing againſt and contemning the Government and Liturgy of this
Church. But I had rather be condemned to the woe of <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> than to that of <hi>Vae
vobis, Hypocritae,</hi> by ſeeming to pray what I do not approve.</p>
                     <p>It may be, I am eſteemed by my Deniers ſufficient of My ſelf to diſcharge My Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God as a Prieſt, tho not to Men as a Prince.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I think both Offices, Regal and Sacerdotal, might well become the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
as anciently they were under one name, and the united rights of primogeniture:
Nor could I follow better precedents, if I were able, than thoſe two eminent Kings,
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> not more famous for their Scepters and Crowns, than one was for
devout Pſalms and Prayers, the other for his Divine Parables and Preaching: whence
the one merited and aſſumed the name of a Prophet, the other of a Preacher.
Titles indeed of greater honour, where rightly placed, than any of thoſe the Roman
Emperors affected from the Nations they ſubdued; it being infinitely more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to convert Souls to Gods Church by the Word, than to conquer men to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
by the Sword.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſince the order of Gods Wiſdom and Providence hath, for the moſt part, always
diſtinguiſhed the gifts and Offices of Kings and Prieſts, of Princes and Preachers, both
in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches; I am ſorry to find My ſelf reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of being both, or enjoying neither.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch as ſeek to deprive Me of My Kingly Power and Soveraignty, would no leſs
enforce Me to live many months without all Prayers, Sacraments and Sermons, unleſs
I become My own Chaplain.</p>
                     <p>As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Chriſtian KING, ſo I deſire to enjoy from
them the benefit of their Gifts and Prayers; which I look upon as more prevalent than
My own or other mens, by how much they flow from Minds more enlightned, and
Affections leſs diſtracted than thoſe which are encumbred with Secular affairs: beſides,
I think a greater Bleſſing and acceptableneſs attends thoſe Duties, which are rightly
performed, as proper to and within the limits of that calling to which God and the
Church have ſpecially deſigned and conſecrated ſome men. And however, as to that
Spiritual Government by which the Devout Soul is ſubject to Chriſt, and through
his Merits daily offers it ſelf and its ſervices to God, every private believer is a King
and a Prieſt, inveſted with the honour of a Royal Prieſthood; yet as to Eccleſiaſtical
order and the outward Polity of the Church, I think confuſion in Religion will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow every mans turning Prieſt or Preacher, as it will in the State where every
one affects to rule as King.</p>
                     <p>I was always bred to more modeſt, and, I think, more Pious Principles: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
to my Spiritual defects makes Me more prize and deſire thoſe Pious aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which holy and good Miniſters, either Biſhops or Presbyters, may afford Me; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in theſe Extremities to which God hath been pleaſed to ſuffer ſome of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to reduce Me, ſo as to leave them nothing more but my Life to take from Me;
and to leave Me nothing to deſire, which I thought might leſs provoke their Jealouſy
and offence to deny Me than this, of having ſome means afforded Me for my Souls
comfort and ſupport.</p>
                     <p>To which end I made choice of men, as no way (that I know) ſcandalous, ſo every
way eminent for their Learning and Piety, no leſs than for their Loyalty: nor can I
imagine any exceptions to be made againſt them but only this, That they may ſeem
too able, and too well-affected toward Me and my Service.</p>
                     <p>But this is not the firſt ſervice (as I count it the beſt) in which they have forced Me
to ſerve My ſelf: tho I muſt conſeſs, I bear with more grief and impatience the want of
my Chaplains than of any other my Servants, and next (if not beyond in ſome things)
to the being ſequeſtred from my Wife and Children; ſince from theſe indeed more of
human and temporary Affections, but from thoſe more of Heavenly and Eternal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
may be expected.</p>
                     <p>My comfort is, that in the enforced (not neglected) want of ordinary means, God is
wont to afford extraordinary ſupplies of his Gifts and Graces.</p>

If his Spirit will teach Me, and help my infirmities in Prayer, Reading and Meditation,
(as I hope he will) I ſhall need no other either Orator or Inſtructor.</p>
                     <p>To Thee therefore, O My God, do I direct my now ſolitary Prayers: What I want of
others help, ſupply with the more immediate aſſiſtances of thy Spirit, which alone can both
enlighten my darkneſs, and quicken my dulneſs.</p>
                     <p>O thou Sun of Righteouſneſs, thou Sacred Fountain of Heavenly Light and Heat, at once
clear and warm my Heart, both by instructing of Me, and interceding for Me. In Thee is
all Fulneſs, from Thee is all Sufficiency, by Thee is all Acceptance. Thou art company
enough, and comfort enough: Thou art my King, be alſo my Prophet and my Prieſt. Rule
Me, teach Me, pray in Me, for Me, and be Thou ever with Me.</p>
                     <p>The ſingle wreſtlings of <hi>Jacob</hi> prevailed with Thee in that Sacred Duel, when he had
none to ſecond him but Thy ſelf, who didst aſſiſt him with power to overcome Thee, and by a
welcome violence to wreſt a Bleſſing from Thee,</p>
                     <p>O look on Me thy Servant in infinite mercy, whom Thou didſt once bleſs with the joint and
ſociated Devotions of others, whoſe fervency might inflame the coldneſs of my Affections
towards Thee; when we went to or met in thy Houſe with the Voice of joy and gladneſs,
worſhipping Thee in the unity of Spirits and with the bond of Peace.</p>
                     <p>O forgive the neglect and not improving of thoſe happy Opportunities.</p>
                     <p>It is now thy pleaſure that I ſhould be as a Pelican in the wilderneſs, as a Sparrow on
the houſe top, and as a Coal ſcattered from all thoſe pious glowings and devout reflections
which might beſt kindle, preſerve and encreaſe the holy fire of thy Graces on the Altar of my
Heart, whence the ſacrifice of Prayers and incenſe of Praiſes might be duly offered up to Thee.</p>
                     <p>Yet, O Thou that breakeſt not the bruiſed Reed, nor quencheſt the ſmoaking Flax, do not
deſpiſe the weakneſs of my Prayers, nor the ſmotherings of my Soul in this uncomfortable
loneneſs, to which I am conſtrained by ſome mens uncharitable denials of thoſe helps which I
much want, and no leſs deſire.</p>
                     <p>O let the hardneſs of Their Hearts occaſion the ſoftnings of mine to Thee and for them.
Let their Hatred kindle my Love, let their unreaſonable denials of my Religious deſires the
more excite my Prayers to Thee. Let their inexorable deafneſs encline thine ear to Me, who
art a God eaſy to be entreated: Thine Ear is not heavy, that it cannot, nor thy Heart hard,
that it will not hear; nor thy Hand ſhortned, that it cannot help Me thy deſolate Suppliant.</p>
                     <p>Thou permitteſt men to deprive Me of thoſe outward means which Thou haſt appointed in
thy Church; but they cannot debar Me from the communion of that inward Grace which Thou
alone breatheſt into humble hearts.</p>
                     <p>O make Me ſuch, and Thou wilt teach Me, Thou wilt hear Me, Thou wilt help Me: the
broken and contrite heart, I know, Thou wilt not deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, canſt at once make Me thy Temple, thy Priest, thy Sacrifice, and thine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
while from an humble Heart I (alone) daily offer up in holy Meditations, fervent
Prayers, and unfeigned Tears, my ſelf to Thee, who prepareſt Me for Thee, dwelleſt in Me,
and accepteſt of Me.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O Lord, didſt cauſe by ſecret ſupplies and miraculous infuſions, that the handful
of meal in the veſſel ſhould not ſpend, nor the little Oyl in the cruiſe fail the Widow, during
the time of drought and dearth.</p>
                     <p>O look on my Soul, which, as a Widow, is now deſolate and forſaken: let not thoſe ſaving
truths I have formerly learned now fail my memory; nor the ſweet effuſions of thy Spirit,
which I have ſometime felt, now be wanting to my Heart in this Famine of ordinary and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

                     <p>GIve ear to my words, O Lord, conſider my Meditation, and hearken to the voice of my cry,
my King and my God; for unto Thee will I pray.</p>

there is mercy with Thee, that Thou mayeſt be feared; therefore ſhall ſinners fly unto Thee.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledg my Sins before Thee, which have the aggravation of my Condition; the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of my Place adding weight to my Offences.</p>
                     <p>Forgive, I beſeech Thee, my perſonal and my peoples Sins, which are ſo far Mine, as I
have not improved The power thou gaveſt Me to thy Glory and my Subjects good. Thou haſt now
brought Me from the glory and freedom of a King, to be a Priſoner to my own Subjects: juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
O Lord, as to thy over-ruling hand, becauſe in many things I have rebelled againſt Thee.</p>
                     <p>Tho Thou hast reſtrained my Perſon, yet enlarge my Heart to Thee, and thy Grace
towards Me.</p>
                     <p>I come far ſhart of <hi>David</hi>'s Piety; yet ſince I may equal <hi>David</hi>'s Afflictions, give Me alſo

                     <p>Let not the Evils which I and my Kingdoms have ſuffered ſeem little unto Thee, the Thou
haſt not puniſhed us according to our Sins.</p>
                     <p>Turn Thee (O Lord) unto Me; have mercy upon Me, for I am deſolate and afflicted.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrows of my Heart are enlarged; O bring Thou Me out of my Troubles.</p>
                     <p>Haſt Thou forgotten to be gracious, and ſhut up thy loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure?</p>
                     <p>O remember thy Compaſſions of old, and thy loving kindneſſes which have been for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>

                     <p>Let this fiery trial conſume the droſs which in long Peace and Plenty we had contracted.</p>

make up in Patience and Repentance.</p>
                     <p>And if thy Anger be not yet to be turned away, but thy hand of Juſtice muſt be ſtretched
out still; let it, I beſeech Thee, be against Me and my Fathers houſe: as for theſe Sheep
what have they done?</p>
                     <p>Let my Sufferings ſatiate the malice of mine and thy Churches Enemies.</p>

                     <p>So impoſſible is to for lines to be drawn from the Center, and not to divide from each
other ſo much the wider, by how much they go farther from the point of union.</p>
                     <p>That the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould from Diviſion fall fall to Confuſion is no wonder;
but for thoſe that pretend to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to divide their tongues and hands, is but

                     <p>Well may I change My Keepers and Priſon, but not my captive Condition; only
with this hope of bettering, that thoſe who are ſo much profeſſed Patrons for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

ſoon after acting over again that former part of tumultuary motions, (never queſtioned,

the former. Such as were content to ſee Me and many Members of both Houſes dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away by the firſt unſuppreſſed Tumults, are now forced to fly to an Army, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves againſt them.</p>
                     <p>But who can unfold the riddle of ſome mens Juſtice? The Members of both Houſes
who at firſt withdrew (as My ſelf was forced to do) from the rudeneſs of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
were counted Deſertors, and outed of their Places in Parliament: ſuch as ſtayed
then, and enjoyed the benefit of the Tumults, were aſſerted for the only Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Now the Fliers from, and Forſakers of their Places carry the Parliamentary
power along with them, complain highly againſt the Tumults, and vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by an Army: ſuch as remained and kept their ſtations, are looked upon as Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of tumultuary inſolencies, and betrayers of the freedom and honour of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Thus is Power above all Rule, Order and Law; where men look more to preſent
Advantages than their Conſciences, and the unchangeable rules of Juſtice: while they
are Judges of others, they are forced to condemn themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now the Plea againſt Tumults holds good, the Authors and Abettors of them are
guilty of prodigious Inſolencies; whenas before they were counted as Friends and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Aſſiſtants.</p>
                     <p>I ſee Vengeance purſues and overtakes (as the Mice and Rats are ſaid to have done a
Biſhop in <hi>Germany</hi>) them that thought to have eſcaped, and fortified themſelves moſt
impregnably againſt it both by their Multitude and Compliance.</p>
                     <p>Whom the Laws cannot, God will puniſh by their own Crimes and hands.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but obſerve this Divine Juſtice, yet with ſorrow and pity; for I always
wiſhed ſo well to Parliament and City, that I was ſorry to ſee them do or ſuffer any
thing unworthy ſuch great and conſiderable Bodies in this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>I was glad to ſee them only ſcared and humbled, not broken by that ſhaking: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had ſo ill a thought of thoſe Cities as to deſpair of their Loyalty to Me; which
Miſtakes might eclipſe, but I never believed Malice had quite put out.</p>
                     <p>I pray God the Storm be yet wholly paſſed over them; upon whom I look, as
Chriſt did ſometime over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as objects of My Prayers and Tears, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
Grief, foreſeeing thoſe ſeverer ſcatterings which will certainly befall ſuch as
wantonly refuſe to be gathered to their Duty: fatal blindneſs frequently attending and
puniſhing wilfulneſs, ſo that men ſhall not be able at laſt to prevent their Sorrows,
who would not timely repent of their Sins; nor ſhall they be ſuffered to enjoy the
Comforts, who ſecurely neglect the Counſels belonging to their Peace. They will find
that Brethren in iniquity are not far from becoming inſolent Enemies; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
harder than to keep ill men long in one mind.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it poſſible to gain a fair period for thoſe motions which go rather in a round
and circle of Fancy, than in a right line of Reaſon tending to the Law, the only Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of publick conſiſtency; whither I pray God at laſt bring all ſides.</p>
                     <p>Which will eaſily be done, when we ſhall fully ſee how much more happy we are to
be ſubject to the known Laws, than to the various Wills of any men, ſeem they never
ſo plauſible at firſt.</p>
                     <p>Vulgar compliance with any illegal and extravagant ways, like violent motions in
Nature, ſoon grows weary of it ſelf, and ends in a refractory ſullenneſs: Peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
are oft in their faces who firſt put them upon thoſe violent ſtrokes.</p>
                     <p>For the Army (which is ſo far excuſable as they act according to Soldiers Principles
and Intereſts, demanding Pay and Indemnity) I think it neceſſary, in order to the
Publick Peace, that they ſhould be ſatisfied as far as is juſt; no man being more prone
to conſider them than My ſelf: tho they have fought againſt Me, yet I cannot but ſo
far eſteem that Valour and Gallantry they have ſome time ſhewed, as to wiſh I may
never want ſuch men to maintain My ſelf, My Laws, and My Kingdoms, in ſuch a
Peace as wherein they may enjoy their ſhare and proportion as much as any men.</p>
                     <p>But Thou, O Lord, who art perfect Vnity in a Sacred Trinity, in Mercy behold thoſe
whom thy Juſtice hath divided.</p>
                     <p>Deliver Me from the ſtrivings of my People, and make Me to ſee how much they need my
Prayers and Pity, who agreed to fight againſt Me, and yet are now ready to fight againſt
one another, to the continuance of my Kingdoms Diſtractions.</p>

Diſcover to all ſides the ways of Peace from which they have ſwerved: which conſiſts not
in the divided Wills of Parties, but in the joynt and due obſervation of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Make Me willing to go whither Thou wilt lead Me by thy Providence; and be Thou ever
with Me, that I may ſee thy Conſtancy in the worlds variety and Changes.</p>
                     <p>Make Me even ſuch as Thou wouldſt have Me, that I may at laſt enjoy that Safety and

                     <p>Divert, I pray Thee, O Lord, thy heavy Wrath juſtly hanging over thoſe populous Cities,
whoſe Plenty is prone to add fewel to their Luxury, their Wealth to make them wanton,
their Multitudes tempting them to Security, and their Security expoſing them to unexpected
Miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Give them eyes to ſee, hearts to conſider, wills to embrace, and courage to act thoſe things
which belong to thy Glory and the publick Peace; leſt their Calamity come upon them as an

                     <p>Teach them, that they cannot want Enemies who abound in Sin; nor ſhall they be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſarmed

clear convictions of their own Conſciences, fight more againſt themſelves than ever they did
againſt Me.</p>
                     <p>Their Sins expoſing them to thy Juſtice, their Riches to others Injuries, their Number to

                     <p>Tho they have with much forwardneſs helped to deſtroy Me, yet let not my Fall be their
Ruine.</p>
                     <p>Let Me not ſo much conſider either what they have done or I have ſuffered, (chiefly at
firſt by them) as to forget to imitate my crucified Redeemer, to plead their Ignorance for
their Pardon; and in my dying extremities to pray to Thee, O Father, to forgive them,
for they knew not what they did.</p>
                     <p>The tears they have denied Me in my ſaddeſt condition, give them grace to beſtow upon

Me by my Sufferings, which have more in them of thy Mercy, than of mans Cruelty or thy

                     <p>It is ſome kind of deceiving and leſſening the injury of My long Reſtraint, when I
find My leiſure and Solitude have produced ſomething worthy of My ſelf and uſeful to
You; that neither You nor any other may hereafter meaſure My Cauſe by the Succeſs,

of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> the one prepared by many Afflictions for a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdom; the other ſoftned by the unparallel'd proſperity of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Court, and
ſo corrupted, to the great diminution both for Peace, Honour and Kingdom, by thoſe
Flatteries which are as unſeparable from proſperous Princes as Flies are from Fruit in
Summer, whom Adverſity, like cold weather, drives away.</p>
                     <p>I had rather You ſhould be <hi>Charles le Bon</hi> than <hi>le Grand,</hi> Good than Great; I hope
God hath deſigned You to be both, having ſo early put You into that exerciſe of his
Graces and Gifts beſtowed upon You, which may beſt weed out all vicious inclinations,
and diſpoſe You to thoſe Princely Endowments and Employments which will moſt gain
the love and intend the welfare of thoſe over whom God ſhall place You.</p>
                     <p>With God I would have You begin and end, who is King of Kings, the Soveraign
Diſpoſer of the Kingdoms of the world, who pulleth down one and ſetteth up another.</p>
                     <p>The beſt Government and higheſt Soveraignty You can attain to is, to be ſubject to
Him, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit may rule in your Heart.</p>
                     <p>The true Glory of Princes conſiſts in advancing God's Glory, in the maintenance of
true Religion and the Churches good; alſo in the diſpenſation of Civil Power with
Juſtice and Honour to the publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>Piety will make You proſperous; at leaſt it will keep You from being miſerable:
nor is he much a loſer that loſeth all, yet ſaveth his own Soul at laſt.</p>
                     <p>To which center of true Happineſs, God (I truſt) hath and will graciouſly direct
all theſe black lines of Affliction which he hath been pleaſed to draw on Me, and by
which he hath (I hope) drawn Me nearer to Himſelf. You have already taſted of
that Cup whereof I have liberally drank, which I look upon as God's Phyſick, having
that in Healthfulneſs which it wants in Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Above all, I would have You, as I hope You are already, well grounded and ſetled
in your Religion: the beſt Profeſſion of which I have ever eſteemed that of <hi>the Church
of England,</hi> in which You have been educated: Yet I would have your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reaſon now ſeal to that ſacred Bond which Education hath written, that it
may be judiciouſly your own Religion, and not other mens Cuſtom or Tradition, which
You profeſs.</p>
                     <p>In this I charge You to perſevere, as coming neareſt to God's Word for Doctrine, and
to the Primitive examples for Government, with ſome little Amendment, which I
have other-where expreſſed, and often offered, tho in vain. Your fixation in matters
of Religion will not be more neceſſary for your Souls than your Kingdoms Peace, when
God ſhall bring You to them.</p>
                     <p>For I have obſerved, that the Devil of Rebellion doth commonly turn himſelf into an
Angel of Reformation, and the old Serpent can pretend new Lights. When ſome mens
Conſciences accuſe them for Sedition and Faction, they ſtop its mouth with the name
and noiſe of Religion; when Piety pleads for Peace and Patience, they cry out Zeal.</p>
                     <p>So that unleſs in this point You be well ſetled, You ſhall never want temptations
to deſtroy You and Yours, under pretenſions of Reforming matters of Religion; for
that ſeems, even to worſt men, as the beſt and moſt auſpicious beginning of their
worſt Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Where beſides the Novelty, which is taking enough with the Vulgar, every one
hath an affectation, by ſeeming forward to an outward Reformation of Religion, to
be thought Zealous; hoping to cover thoſe Irreligious deformities whereto they are
conſcious, by a ſeverity of cenſuring other mens opinions or actions.</p>
                     <p>Take heed of abetting any Factions, or applying to any publick Diſcriminations in
matters of Religion, contrary to what is in your Judgment, and the Church well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Your partial adhering, as Head, to any one ſide, gains You not ſo great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
in ſome men hearts (who are prone to be of their King's Religion) as it loſeth
You in others, who think themſelves and their profeſſion firſt deſpiſed, then perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by You. Take ſuch a courſe as may either with Calmneſs and Charity quite
remove the ſeeming differences and offences by impartiality; or ſo order affairs in point
of Power, that You ſhall not need to fear or flatter any Faction. For if ever You
ſtand in need of them, or muſt ſtand to their courteſie, You are undone: The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
will devour the Dove. You may never expect leſs of Loyalty, Juſtice, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
than from thoſe who engage into Religious Rebellion: Their Intereſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

Nothing ſeemed leſs conſiderable than the Presbyterian Faction in <hi>England</hi> for many
years, ſo compliant they were to publick Order: nor indeed was their Party great
either in Church or State, as to mens Judgments. But as ſoon as Diſcontents drave
men into Sidings, as ill Humors fall to the diſaffected part, which cauſes Inflammations,
ſo did all at firſt who affected any Novelties adhere to that Side, as the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſpecious note of difference (then) in point of Religion.</p>
                     <p>All the leſſer Factions at firſt were officious Servants to Presbytery, their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
till Time and Military ſucceſs diſcovering to each their peculiar Advantages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
them to part ſtakes, and leaving the joynt ſtock of Uniform Religion, pretended
each to drive for their Party the trade of Profits and Preferments, to the breaking and
undoing not only of the Church and State, but even of Presbytery it ſelf, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hoped at firſt to have ingroſſed all.</p>
                     <p>Let nothing ſeem little or deſpicable to You in matters which concern Religion and
the Churches Peace; ſo as to neglect a ſpeedy reforming and effectual ſuppreſſing Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Schiſms, which ſeem at firſt but as a hand-breadth, yet by Seditious Spirits, as
by ſtrong winds, are ſoon made to cover and darken the whole Heaven.</p>
                     <p>When You have done Juſtice to God, Your own Soul, and his Church, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and preſervation both of Truth and Unity in Religion; the next main hinge on
which Your Proſperity will depend and move is that of Civil Juſtice, wherein the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Laws of theſe Kingdoms, to which You are rightly Heir, are the moſt excellent
Rules You can Govern by: which by an admirable temperament, give very much to
Subjects Induſtry, Liberty and Happineſs, and yet reſerve enough to the Majeſty and
Prerogative of any King, who owns his People as Subjects, not as Slaves: whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
as it preſerves their Property, Peace and Safety, ſo it will never diminiſh
Your Rights, nor their ingenuous Liberties, which conſiſt in the enjoyment of the fruits
of their Induſtry, and the benefit of thoſe Laws to which themſelves have conſented.</p>
                     <p>Never charge Your head with ſuch a Crown as ſhall by its heavineſs oppreſs
the whole Body; the weakneſs of whoſe parts cannot return any thing of ſtrength,
honour or ſafety to the Head, but a neceſſary debilitation and Ruin.</p>
                     <p>Your Prerogative is beſt ſhewed and exerciſed in remitting, rather than exacting the
rigor of the Laws; there being nothing worſe than Legal Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>In theſe two points, the preſervation of eſtabliſhed Religion and Laws, I may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vanity) turn the reproach of My Sufferings, as to the worlds cenſure, into the
honour of a kind of Martyrdom, as to the teſtimony of My own Conſcience; the
Troublers of My Kingdoms having nothing elſe to object againſt Me but this, That
I prefer Religion and Laws eſtabliſht before thoſe Alterations they propounded.</p>
                     <p>And ſo indeed I do and ever ſhall, till I am convinced by better Arguments than
what hitherto have been chiefly uſed towards Me, Tumults, Armies, and Priſons.</p>
                     <p>I cannot yet learn that Leſſon, nor I hope ever will You, That it is ſafe for a King
to gratifie any Faction with the Perturbation of the Laws, in which is wrap'd up the
publick Intereſt and the good of the Community.</p>
                     <p>How God will deal with Me as to the removal of theſe Preſſures and Indignities,
which his Juſtice by the very unjuſt hands of ſome of My Subjects hath been pleaſed
to lay upon Me, I cannot tell: nor am I much ſolicitous what Wrong I ſuffer from
men, while I retain in My Soul what I believe is right before God.</p>
                     <p>I have offered all for Reformation and Safety that in Reaſon, Honour and Conſcience
I can; reſerving only what I cannot conſent unto without an irreparable injury to My
own Soul, the Church, and My People, and to You alſo, as the next and undoubted
Heir of My Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>To which if the Divine Providence, to whom no Difficulties are inſuperable, ſhall
in his due time after My deceaſe bring You, as I hope he will, My Counſel and Charge
to You is, that You ſeriouſly conſider the former real or objected Miſcarriages which
might occaſion My Troubles, that You may avoid them.</p>
                     <p>Never repoſe ſo much upon any mans ſingle Counſel, Fidelity, and Diſcretion, in
managing affairs of the firſt magnitude, (that is, matters of Religion and Juſtice) as
to create in Your ſelf or others a diffidence of Your own Judgment, which is likely
to be always more conſtant and impartial to the intereſts of Your Crown and Kingdom
than any mans.</p>
                     <p>Next, beware of exaſperating any Factions by the croſneſs and aſperity of ſome
mens Paſſions, Humors, or private Opinions, imployed by You, grounded only upon

                     <p>I would have You always propenſe to the ſame way; whenever it ſhall be deſired
and accepted, let it be granted not only as an Act of State-policy and Neceſſity, but of
Chriſtian Charity and Choice.</p>
                     <p>It is all I have now left Me, a power to forgive thoſe that have deprived Me of all;
and I thank God I have a heart to do it, and joy as much in this Grace which God hath
given Me, as in all my former enjoyments; for this is a greater argument of God's
love to Me, than any Proſperity can be.</p>
                     <p>Be confident (as I am) that the moſt of all ſides who have done amiſs, have done
ſo not out of Malice, but Miſ-information, or Miſ-apprehenſion of things.</p>
                     <p>None will be more loyal and faithful to Me and You than thoſe Subjects, who ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their Errors and our Injuries, will feel in their own Souls moſt vehement motives
to Repentance, and earneſt deſires to make ſome reparations for their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

As Your quality ſets you beyond any Duel with any Subject; ſo the Nobleneſs of
Your Mind muſt raiſe You above the meditating any Revenge, or executing Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon the many.</p>
                     <p>The more conſcious You ſhall be to Your own Merits upon Your People, the more
prone You will be to expect all Love and Loyalty from them, and to inflict no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon them for former Miſcarriages: You will have more inward complacency
in Pardoning one, than in Puniſhing a thouſand.</p>
                     <p>This I write to You, not deſpairing of God's Mercy and My Subjects affections
towards You; both which I hope You will ſtudy to deſerve, yet we cannot merit of
God but by his own Mercy.</p>
                     <p>If God ſhall ſee fit to reſtore Me, and You after Me, to thoſe enjoyments which
the Laws have aſſigned to Us, and no Subjects without an high degree of Guilt and
Sin, can diveſt Us of; then may I have better opportunity, when I ſhall be ſo happy
to ſee You in Peace, to let You more fully underſtand the things that belong to God's
Glory, Your own Honour, and the Kingdoms Peace.</p>
                     <p>But if You never ſee My face again, and God will have Me buried in ſuch a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Impriſonment and Obſcurity, (which the perfecting ſome mens Deſigns requires)
wherein few hearts that love Me are permitted to exchange a word or a look with Me;
I do require and entreat You as Your Father and Your KING, that You never ſuffer
Your Heart to receive the leaſt check againſt or diſaffection from the true Religion
eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I tell You, I have tried it, and after much ſearch and many Diſputes, have concluded
it to be the beſt in the world: not only in the Community, as Chriſtian, but alſo in
the ſpecial notion as Reformed; keeping the middle way, between the pomp of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Tyranny, and the meanneſs of Fantaſtick Anarchy.</p>
                     <p>Not but that (the draught being excellent as to the main, both for Doctrine and
Government, in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) ſome lines, as in very good Figures may
haply need ſome ſweetning or poliſhing, which might here have eaſily been done by a
ſafe and gentle hand, if ſome mens Precipitancy had not violently demanded ſuch rude
Alterations as would have quite deſtroyed all the Beauty and Proportions of the
whole.</p>
                     <p>The ſcandal of the late Troubles, which ſome may object and urge to You againſt
the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> is eaſily anſwered to them or Your own
thoughts in this, That ſcarce any one who hath been a Beginner, or an active Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of this late War againſt the Church, the Laws and Me, either was or is a true
Lover, Embracer, or Practiſer of the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England:</hi> which
neither gives ſuch Rules, nor ever before ſet ſuch Examples.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, ſome heretofore had the boldneſs to preſent threatning Petitions to their
Princes and Parliaments, which others of the ſame Faction (but of worſe Spirits)
have now put in execution. But let not counterfeit and diſorderly Zeal abate your value
and eſteem of true Piety: both of them are to be <hi>known by their fruits.</hi> The ſweetneſs
of the Vine and Fig-tree is not to be deſpiſed, tho the Brambles and Thorns ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to bear Figs and Grapes, thereby to rule over the Trees.</p>
                     <p>Nor would I have you to entertain any averſation or diſlike of Parliaments; which
in their right conſtitution, with Freedom and Honour, will never injure or diminiſh
your Greatneſs; but will rather be as interchangings of Love, Loyalty and Confidence
between a Prince and his People.</p>
                     <p>Nor would the events of this Black Parliament have been other than ſuch (however
much biaſſed by Factions in the Elections) if it had been preſerved from the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Popular dictates and Tumultuary impreſſions: The ſad effects of which will, no
doubt, make all Parliaments after this more cautious to preſerve that Freedom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which belongs to ſuch Aſſemblies (when once they have fully ſhaken off this yoke
of Vulgar encroachment) ſince the Publick Intereſt conſiſts in the mutual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good both of Prince and People.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more happy for all, than in fair, grave and honourable ways to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
their Counſels in common, enacting all things by publick conſent, without Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
or Tumults. We muſt not ſtarve our ſelves, becauſe ſome men have ſurfeited of
wholſom food.</p>
                     <p>And if neither I nor You be ever reſtored to Our Rights, but God in his ſevereſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
will puniſh My Subjects with continuance in their Sin, and ſuffer them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
with the proſperity of their Wickedneſs: I hope God will give Me and You that
Grace, which will teach and enable Us to want as well as to wear a Crown, which is
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:60710:370"/>
not worth taking up or enjoying upon ſordid, diſhonourable and irreligious terms.</p>
                     <p>Keep You to true Principles of Piety, Virtue and Honour, You ſhall never want
a Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>A Principal point of Your Honour will conſiſt in Your conferring all Reſpect, Love
and Protection on Your Mother, My Wife; who hath many ways deſerved well of Me,
and chiefly in this, (that having been a means to bleſs Me with ſo many hopeful
Children, all which, with their Mother, I recommend to your Love and Care) She hath
been content, with incomparable Magnanimity and Patience, to ſuffer both for and
with Me and You.</p>
                     <p>My Prayer to God Almighty is, (whatever becomes of Me, who am, I thank God,
wrapt up and fortified in My own Innocency and his Grace) that he would be pleaſed
to make You an Anchor, or Harbour rather, to theſe toſſed and weather-beaten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
a Repairer, by Your Wiſdom, Juſtice, Piety and Valour, of what the Folly
and Wickedneſs of ſome men have ſo far ruined, as to leave nothing intire in Church
or State, to the Crown, the Nobility, the Clergy or the Commons, either as to Laws,
Liberties, Eſtates, Order, Honour, Conſcience, or Lives.</p>
                     <p>When they have deſtroyed Me (for I know not how far God may permit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Cruelty of My Enemies to proceed, and ſuch apprehenſions ſome mens words
and actions have already given Me) as I doubt not but My Blood will cry aloud for
Vengeance to Heaven; ſo I beſeech God not to pour out his Wrath upon the generality
of the People, who have either deſerted Me, or engaged againſt Me, through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
and hypocrifie of their Leaders, whoſe inward Horror will be their firſt Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
nor will they eſcape exemplary Judgments.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that loved Me, I pray God they may have no miſs of Me when I am gone:
ſo much I wiſh and hope that all good Subjects may be ſatisfied with the Bleſſings of
Your Preſence and Virtues.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe that repent of any defects in their Duty toward Me, as I freely forgive
them in the word of a Chriſtian King; ſo I believe You will find them truly zealous to
repay with intereſt that Loyalty and Love to You which was due to Me.</p>
                     <p>In ſum, what Good I intended, do You perform, when God ſhall give you Power.
Much Good I have offered, more I purpoſed to Church and State, if Times had been
capable of it.</p>
                     <p>The deception will ſoon vaniſh, and the Vizards will fall off apace: This mask of
Religion on the face of Rebellion (for ſo it now plainly appears, ſince My Reſtraint
and cruel Uſage, that they fought not for Me, as was pretended) will not long ſerve
to hide ſome mens Deformities.</p>
                     <p>Happy times, I hope, attend You, wherein Your Subjects (by their Miſeries) will
have learned, <hi>That Religion to their God and Loyalty to their King cannot be parted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
both their Sin and their Infelicity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I pray God bleſs You, and eſtabliſh Your Kingdoms in Righteouſneſs, Your Soul in
true Religion, and Your Honour in the Love of God and Your People.</p>
                     <p>And if God will have Diſloyalty perfected by My Deſtruction, let My Memory ever
with My Name live in You, as of Your Father that loves You, and once a KING of
Three flouriſhing Kingdoms; whom God thought fit to honour not only with the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Government of them, but alſo with the ſuffering many indignities and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Death for them, while I ſtudied to preſerve the rights of the Church, the power
of the Laws, the Honour of My Crown, the Priviledg of Parliaments, the Liberties
of My People, and My own Conſcience; which, I thank God, is dearer to Me than a
thouſand Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>I know God can, I hope he yet will reſtore Me to My Rights: I cannot deſpair either
of his Mercy, or of My Peoples Love and Pity.</p>
                     <p>At worſt, I truſt I ſhall but go before You to a better Kingdom, which God hath
prepared for Me, and Me for it, through My Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whoſe Mercies I
commend You and all Mine.</p>
                     <p>Farewell, till We meet, if not on Earth, yet in Heaven.</p>

                     <head>XXVIII. Meditations upon Death, after the Votes of Non-addreſſes,
and His MAJESTIES cloſer Impriſonment in
Carisbrook-Caſtle.</head>
                     <p>AS I have leiſure enough, ſo I have cauſe more than enough to meditate upon, and
prepare for my Death; for I know there are but few ſteps between the Priſons
and Graves of Princes.</p>
                     <p>It is God's Indulgence which gives Me the ſpace, but Man's Cruelty that gives Me the
ſad occaſions for theſe thoughts.</p>
                     <p>For beſides the common burthen of Mortality, which lies upon Me as a Man, I now
bear the heavy load of other mens Ambitions, Fears, Jealouſies, and cruel Paſſions,
whoſe Envy or Enmity againſt Me, makes their own lives ſeem deadly to them, while
I enjoy any part of Mine.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, My Proſperity made Me not wholly a ſtranger to the contemplations
of Mortality: Thoſe are never unſeaſonable, ſince this is always uncertain: Death being
an Eclipſe which oft happeneth as well in clear as cloudy days.</p>
                     <p>But My now long and ſharp Adverſity hath ſo reconciled in Me thoſe natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies
between Life and Death which are in all men, that, I thank God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
terrors of it are diſpelled, and the ſpecial horror of it as to My particular much
allayed: for altho My Death at preſent may juſtly be repreſented to Me with all thoſe
terrible aggravations which the policy of Cruel and Implacable enemies can put upon
it (affairs being drawn to the very dregs of Malice;) yet, I bleſs God, I can look
upon all thoſe ſtings as unpoiſonous, tho ſharp, ſince My Redeemer hath either pulled
them out, or given Me the Antidote of his Death againſt them; which as to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity,
Unjuſtice, Shame, Scorn and Cruelty of it, exceeded whatever I can fear.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, I never did find ſo much the Life of Religion, the Feaſt of a good Conſcience,
and the brazen wall of a judicious Integrity and Conſtancy, as ſince I came to theſe
cloſer conflicts with the thoughts of Death.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſo old as to be weary of Life; nor (I hope) ſo bad as to be either afraid to
dye, or aſhamed to live: true, I am ſo afflicted, as might make Me ſometime even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to dye; if I did not conſider, that it is the greateſt glory of a Chriſtians life to
<hi>die daily,</hi> in conquering, by a lively Faith and patient Hopes of a better life, thoſe
partial and quotidian deaths which kill us (as it were) by piece-meals, and make us
overlive our own fates; while we are deprived of Health, Honour, Liberty, Power,
Credit, Safety or Eſtate, and thoſe other Comforts of deareſt relations, which are as
the Life of our lives.</p>
                     <p>Tho, as a KING, I think My ſelf to live in nothing temporal ſo much as in the
Love and good will of My People; for which as I have ſuffered many deaths, ſo I hope
I am not in that point as yet wholly dead: notwithſtanding My Enemies have uſed all
the poiſon of Falſity and violence of Hoſtility to deſtroy, firſt the Love and Loyalty
which is in my Subjects, and then all that content of Life in Me which from theſe I
chiefly enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>Indeed they have left Me but little of Life, and only the husk and ſhell (as it were)
which their further Malice and Cruelty can take from Me; having bereaved Me of all
thoſe worldly Comforts for which Life it ſelf ſeems deſirable to men.</p>
                     <p>But, O my Soul, think not that life too long or tedious wherein God gives Thee any
opportunities, if not to do, yet to ſuffer with ſuch Chriſtian Patience and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in a good Cauſe, as are the greateſt Honour of our lives, and the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Deaths.</p>
                     <p>I knows that in point of true Chriſtian Valour it argues Puſillanimity to deſire to
dye out of wearineſs of life, and a want of that heroick greatneſs of ſpirit which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Chriſtian, in the patient and generous ſuſtaining thoſe Afflictions which as
ſhadows neceſſarily attend us while we are in this Body, and which are leſſened or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
as the Sun of our Proſperity moves higher or lower; whoſe total abſence is beſt
recompenced with the dew of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The aſſaults of Affliction may be terrible, like <hi>Sampſom's</hi> Lion, but they yield much
ſweetneſs to thoſe that dare to encounter and overcome them; who know how to
overlive the witherings of their Gourds without diſcontent or peeviſhneſs, while they
may yet converſe with God.</p>

                        <pb n="717" facs="tcp:60710:371"/>
That I muſt dye as a man is certain: that I may dye a King by the hands of my own
Subjects, a violent, ſudden and barbarous death, in the ſtrength of my years, in the
midſt of my Kingdoms, my Friends and loving Subjects, being helpleſs Spectators,
my Enemies inſolent Revilers and Triumphers over me, living, dying, and dead,
is ſo probable in humane reaſon, that God hath taught Me not to hope otherwiſe as to
mans Cruelty; however I deſpair not of God's infinite Mercy.</p>
                     <p>I know my Life is the object of the Devils and Wicked mens Malice; but yet under
God's ſole cuſtody and diſpoſal; whom I do not think to flatter for longer Life, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
prepared to die: but I humbly deſire to depend upon him, and to ſubmit to his
will both in life and death, in what order ſoever he is pleaſed to lay them out to Me.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs it is not eaſie for Me to contend with thoſe many horrors of Death where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God ſuffers Me to be tempted; which are equally horrid either in the ſuddenneſs
of a Barbarous Aſſaſſination, or in thoſe greater Formalities whereby my Enemies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more ſolemnly cruel) will, it may be, ſeek to add (as thoſe did who crucified
Chriſt) the Mockery of Juſtice to the Cruelty of Malice. That I may be deſtroyed,
as with greater Pomp and artifice, ſo with leſs Pity, it will be but a neceſſary policy,
to make my Death appear as an act of Juſtice done by Subjects upon their Soveraign;
who know that no Law of God or Man inveſts them with any power of Judicature
without Me, much leſs againſt Me; and who, being ſworn and bound by all that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
before God and Man to endeavour my preſervation, muſt pretend Juſtice to cover
their Perjury.</p>
                     <p>It is, indeed, a ſad fate for any man to have his Enemies to be his Accuſers, Parties
and Judges; but moſt deſperate, when this is acted by the inſolence of Subjects againſt
their Soveraign; wherein thoſe who have had the chiefeſt hand and are moſt guilty
of contriving the publick Troubles, muſt by ſhedding My Blood ſeem to waſh their
own hands of that innocent blood whereof they are now moſt evidently guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and man, and, I believe, in their own Conſciences too; while they carried
on unreaſonable demands, firſt by tumults, after by Armies. Nothing makes mean
ſpirits more cowardly-cruel in managing their uſurped power againſt their lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
than this, the <hi>Guilt of their unjuſt Vſurpation;</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe ſpecious and
popular pretenſions of Juſtice againſt Delinquents, applied only to diſguiſe at firſt the
monſtrouſneſs of their deſigns, who deſpaired, indeed, of poſſeſſing the power and
profits of the Vineyard, till the Heir, whoſe right it is, be caſt out and ſlain.</p>
                     <p>With them my greateſt Fault muſt be, that I would not either deſtroy My ſelf,
with the Church and State, by my word, or not ſuffer them to do it unreſiſted by the
Sword; whoſe covetous Ambition no Conceſſions of Mine could ever yet either ſatisfie
or abate.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it likely they will ever think that Kingdom of Brambles, which ſome men
ſeek to erect (at once, weak, ſharp, and fruitleſs either to God or man) is like to
thrive, till watered with the Royal Blood of thoſe whoſe right the Kingdom is.</p>
                     <p>Well, God's will be done; I doubt not but my innocency will find him both my
Protector and my Advocate, who is my onely Judge, whom I own as King of Kings;
not onely for the eminency of his Power and Majeſty above them, but alſo for that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Care and Protection which he hath over them; who knows them to be
expoſed to as many Dangers (being the greateſt Patrons of Law, Juſtice,
Order, and Religion on Earth) as there be either Men or Devils which love Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Nor will he ſuffer thoſe men long to proſper in their <hi>Babel,</hi> who build it with
the Bones, and cement it with the Blood of their KINGS.</p>
                     <p>I am confident they will find Avengers of my Death among themſelves: the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
I have ſuſtained from them, ſhall be firſt puniſhed by them, who agreed in nothing
ſo much as in oppoſing Me.</p>
                     <p>Their impatience to bear the loud cry of my Blood, ſhall make them think no way
better to expiate it then by Shedding theirs who with them moſt thirſted after Mine:</p>
                     <p>The ſad Confuſions following my Deſtruction are already preſaged and confirmed to
Me by thoſe I have lived to ſee ſince my Troubles, in which God alone (who onely
could) hath many ways pleaded my Cauſe; not ſuffering them to go unpuniſhed
whoſe confedaracy in Sin was their only Security; who have cauſe to fear that God
will both further divide, and by mutual Vengeance afterward deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>My greateſt conqueſt of Death is from the Power and Love of Chriſt, who hath
ſwallow'd up Death in the Victory of his Reſurrection, and the glory of his Aſcenſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="718" facs="tcp:60710:372"/>
My next Comfort is, That he gives Me not only the Honour to imitate his Example
<hi>in ſuffering for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> (though obſcured by the fouleſt charges of Tyranny
and Injuſtice) but alſo that Charity which is the nobleſt Revenge upon and Victory
over my Deſtroyers; by which, I thank God, I can both forgive them, and pray for
them, that God would not impute my Blood to them, further than to convince them
what need they have of Chriſts Blood to waſh their Souls from the guilt of ſhedding
Mine.</p>
                     <p>At preſent, the Will of my Enemies ſeems to be their only rule, their Power the
meaſure, and their Succeſs the exactor of what they pleaſe to call Juſtice; while they
flatter themſelves with the fancy of their own Safety by My Danger, and the ſecurity
of their Lives and Deſigns by My Death: forgetting, that as the greateſt temptations
to Sin are wrapped up in ſeeming Proſperities, ſo the ſevereſt Vengeances of God
are then moſt accompliſhed when men are ſuffered to compleat their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                     <p>I bleſs God, I pray not ſo much that this bitter cup of a Violent Death may paſs from
Me, as that of his Wrath may paſs from all thoſe whoſe hands by deſerting Me are
ſprinkled, or by acting and conſenting to my Death are embrued with my Blood.</p>
                     <p>The will of God hath confined and concluded Mine; I ſhall have the pleaſure of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without any pleaſure of deſired Vengeance.</p>
                     <p>This I think becomes a Chriſtian toward his Enemies, and a King toward his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                     <p>They cannot deprive Me of more than I am content to loſe, when God ſees fit by
their hands to take it from Me; whoſe Mercy, I believe, will more than infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
whatever by mans Injuſtice he is pleaſed to deprive me of.</p>
                     <p>The glory attending my Death will far ſurpaſs all I could enjoy or conceive in
Life.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not want the heavy and envied Crowns of this world, when my God hath
mercifully crowned and conſummated his Graces with Glory, and exchanged the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of my Earthly Kingdoms among men, for the ſubſtance of that Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>For the cenſures of the world, I know the ſharp and neceſſary Tyranny of my Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will ſufficienly confute the Calumnies of Tyranny againſt Me: I am perſwaded I
am happy in the judicious Love of the ableſt and beſt of my Subjects, who do not
only pity and pray for Me, but would be content even to die with Me or for
Me.</p>
                     <p>Theſe know how to excuſe my Failings as a man, and yet to retain and pay their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Me as their KING; there being no Religious neceſſity binding any Subjects, by
pretending to puniſh, infinitely to exceed the faults and errors of their Princes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
there where more than ſufficient Satisfaction hath been made to the publick; the
enjoyment of which private Ambitions have hitherto fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Others, I believe, of ſofter tempers, and leſs advantaged by My Ruin, do already
feel ſharp Convictions, and ſome remorſe in their Conſciences; where they cannot but
ſee the proportions of their evil dealings againſt Me in the meaſure of Gods retaliations
upon them, who cannot hope long to enjoy their own thumbs and toes, having
under pretence of paring others nails been ſo cruel as to cut off their chiefeſt
ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>The puniſhment of the more inſolent and obſtinate may be like that of <hi>Korah</hi> and
his Complices (at once mutining againſt both Prince and Prieſt) in ſuch a method of
Divine Juſtice as is not ordinary; the Earth of the loweſt and meaneſt People opening
upon them and ſwallowing them up in a juſt diſdain of their ill-gotten and worſ-uſed
Authority, upon whoſe ſupport and ſtrength they chiefly depended for their building
and eſtabliſhing their Deſings againſt Me, the Church, and State.</p>
                     <p>My chiefeſt comfort in Death conſiſts in My Peace, which, I truſt, is made with God,
before whoſe exact Tribunal I ſhall not fear to appear as to the Cauſe ſo long diſputed
by the Sword between Me and My cauſleſs Enemies, where I doubt not but his
Righteous Judgment will confute their fallacy, who from worldly Succeſs (rather like
Sophiſters than ſound Chriſtians) draw thoſe popular Concluſions for God's Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their actions; whoſe wiſe Providence (we know) oft permits many events
which his revealed Word, (the only clear, ſafe and fixed Rule of good Actions and good
Conſciences) in no ſort approves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="719" facs="tcp:60710:372"/>
I am confident, the Juſtice of my Cauſe and Clearneſs of my Conſcience before
God and toward my People will carry Me as much above them in God's deciſion, as their
Succeſſes have lifted them above Me in the Vulgar opinion: who conſider not that
many times thoſe undertakings of men are lifted up to Heaven in the proſperity and
applauſe of the world, whoſe riſe is from Hell as to the Injuriouſneſs and Oppreſſion of
the Deſign. The proſperous winds which oft fill the ſails of Pirats, do not juſtifie their
Piracy and Rapine.</p>
                     <p>I look upon it with infinite more content and quiet of Soul, to have been worſted
in my enforced Conteſtation for and Vindication of the Laws of the Land, the Freedom
and Honour of Parliaments, the Rights of my Crown, the juſt Liberty of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and the true Chriſtian Religion in its Doctrine, Government and due Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than if I had with the greateſt advantages of Succeſs over-born them all; as
ſome men have now evidently done, what-ever Deſigns they at firſt pretended.</p>
                     <p>The Prayers and Patience of my Friends and loving Subjects will contribute much
to the ſweetning of this bitter Cup, which I doubt not but I ſhall more cheerfully take,
and drink as from God's hand, (if it muſt be ſo) than they can give it to Me whoſe hands
are unjuſtly and barbarouſly lifted up againſt Me.</p>
                     <p>And as to the laſt event I may ſeem to owe more to my Enemies than my Friends;
while thoſe will put a period to the Sins and Sorrows attending this miſerable Life,
wherewith theſe deſire I might ſtill contend.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be more than Conqueror through Chriſt enabling Me, for whom I have hitherto
ſuffered, as he is the Author of Truth, Order and Peace; for all which I have been
forced to contend againſt Error, Faction and Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>If I muſt ſuffer a Violent Death, with my Saviour, it is but Mortality crowned
with Martyrdom: where the debt of Death which I owe for Sin to Nature, ſhall be
raiſed as a gift of Faith and Patience offered to God.</p>
                     <p>Which I humbly beſeech him mercifully to accept: and altho Death be the wages
of My own Sin as from God, and the effect of others Sins as men, both againſt God
and Me; yet as I hope My own Sins are ſo remitted that they ſhall be no ingredients
to imbitter the cup of my Death, ſo I deſire God to pardon their Sins who are moſt
guilty of my Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The Trophees of my Charity will be more glorious and durable over them, than
their ill-managed Victories over Me.</p>
                     <p>Tho their Sin be proſperous, yet they had need to be penitent, that they may be
pardoned. Both which I pray God they may obtain; that my Temporal Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
inflicted by them may not be revenged by God's juſt inflicting Eternal Death upon
them: for I look upon the Temporal Deſtruction of the greateſt King as far leſs depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
than the Eternal Damnation of the meaneſt Subject.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I wiſh other than the ſafe bringing of the Ship to ſhore, when they have
caſt Me over-board: though it be very ſtrange, that Mariners can find no other means
to appeaſe the Storm themſelves have raiſed, but by drowning their Pilot.</p>
                     <p>I thank God, my Enemies Cruelty cannot prevent my Preparation; whoſe Malice
in this I ſhall defeat, that they ſhall not have the ſatisfaction to have deſtroyed my
Soul with my Body: of whoſe Salvation while ſome of them have themſelves ſeemed
and taught others to deſpair, they have only diſcovered this, that they do not much
deſire it.</p>
                     <p>Whoſe uncharitable and cruel Reſtraints, denying Me even the aſſiſtance of any of
my Chaplains, hath rather enlarged than any way obſtructed my acceſs to the Throne
of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Where Thou dwelleſt, O King of Kings, who fillest Heaven and Earth, who art the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Eternal Life, in whom is no ſhadow of Death.</p>
                     <p>Thou, O God, art both the juſt Inflicter of Death upon us, and the merciful Saviour of
us in it and from it.</p>
                     <p>Yea it is better for us to be dead to our ſelves, and live in Thee, than by living in our
ſelves to be deprived of Thee.</p>
                     <p>O make the many bitter aggravations of my Death, as a Man and a King, the opportunities
and advantages of thy ſpecial Graces and Comforts in my Soul, as a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>If Thou, Lord, wilt be with Me, I ſhall neither fear nor feel any evil, tho I walk through
the valley of the ſhadow of Death.</p>
                     <p>To contend with Death, is the work of a weak and mortal man; to overcome it, is the
Grace of Thee alone, who art the Almighty and Immortal God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="720" facs="tcp:60710:373"/>
O my Saviour, who knoweſt what it is to die with Me as a man, make Me to know what
it is to paſs through Death to Life with Thee my God.</p>
                     <p>Tho I die, yet I know that Thou my Redeemer liveſt for ever: tho Thou ſlayest Me, yet
Thou haſt incouraged Me to trust in Thee for Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>O withdraw not thy Favour from Me, which is better than Life.</p>
                     <p>O be not far from Me, for I know not how near a violent and cruel Death is to Me.</p>
                     <p>As thy Omniſcience, O God, diſcovers, ſo thy Omnipotence can defeat the Deſigns of thoſe
who have, or ſhall conſpire my Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>O ſhew Me the goodneſs of thy Will, through the wickedneſs of theirs.</p>
                     <p>Thou giveſt Me leave, as a man, to pray that this Cup may paſs from Me; but Thou hast
taught Me, as a Chriſtian, by the example of Chriſt, to add, <hi>Not My will, but thine be
done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, Lord, let our wills be one, by wholly reſolving Mine into Thine: let not the deſire
of Life in Me be ſo great, as that of doing or ſuffering thy Will in either Life or Death.</p>
                     <p>As I believe Thou haſt forgiven all the Errors of my Life, ſo I hope Thou wilt ſave Me
from the Terrors of my Death.</p>
                     <p>Make Me content to leave the Worlds Nothing, that I may come really to enjoy All in Thee,
who hast made Chriſt unto Me in Life Gain, nnd in Death Advantage.</p>
                     <p>Tho my Deſtroyers forget their Duty to Thee and Me; yet do not Thou, O Lord, forget to
be merciful to them.</p>
                     <p>For what profit is there in my Blood, or in their gaining my Kingdoms, if they loſe their
own Souls?</p>
                     <p>Such as have not only reſisted my juſt Power, but wholly uſurped and turned it againſt My
ſelf, tho they may deſerve, yet let them not receive to themſelves Damnation.</p>
                     <p>Thou madeſt thy Son a Saviour to many that crucified Him, while at once He ſuffered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
by them, and yet willingly for them.</p>
                     <p>O let the voice of his Blood be heard for my Murtherers, louder than the Cry of Mine
againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Prepare them for thy Mercy by due Convictions of their Sin, and let them not at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and damn their own Souls, by fallacious pretenſions of Juſtice in destroying Me; while
the conſcience of their unjuſt Vſurpation of power againſt Me chiefly tempts them to uſe all
extremities againſt Me.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, Thou knoweſt I have found their Mercies to Me, as very falſe, ſo very cruel; who
pretending to preſerve Me, have meditated nothing but my Ruine.</p>
                     <p>O deal not with them as blood-thirſty and deceitful men; but overcome their Cruelty with
Thy Compaſſion and My Charity.</p>
                     <p>And when Thou makest inquiſition for my Blood, O ſprinkle their polluted, yet penitent,
Souls with the Blood of thy Son, that thy deſtroying Angel may paſs over them.</p>
                     <p>Tho they think my Kingdoms on Earth too little to entertain at once both them and Me; yet
let the capacious Kingdom of thy infinite Mercy at laſt receive both Me and my Enemies.</p>
                     <p>When being reconciled to Thee in the Blood of the ſame Redeemer, we ſhall live far above
theſe Ambitious deſires, which beget ſuch mortal Enmities.</p>
                     <p>When their hands ſhall be heavieſt and cruelleſt upon Me, O let Me fall into the arms of
thy tender and eternal Mercies.</p>
                     <p>That what is cut off of my Life in this miſerable moment, may be repayed in thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed
