            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know no great reason any hath to trifle out much time in admiration, that I peep out in print in this nature, I account it as lawful for me as for another, and for a third, as for me; and for any that can as wel as any of us all: let time witness whether my Predictions be true or false, mean season wise men will suspend, and the vain glorious only carp: I am not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible I have given just occasion of offence to any body, I was born a Gentleman, and brought up a Scholler, I hate a Sycophantick course of life, or to flatter any body, and can patiently pass by the Scandals cast upon me by such who keep <hi>Mendacium</hi> as a constant page to their tongues, I am sorry wise men should be so credulous to beleeve things they know no more of then I know what language is spoken in the <hi>Moon.</hi>

            <p>The Planets places did then Aspects are calculated for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> there is no harm in that; There is such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongst Ancient writers in this art, (almost as much as is between <hi>Episcopales, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi>) about the General Figure of the world, which I take to be the reason of their difference in calculating the Planets places, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> held his own, <hi>Copernicus</hi> derides and detrudes him, and sets up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>Ticho</hi> had a third, and <hi>Argol</hi> a fourth.

            <p>I give my reasons for most of my Predictions, and if any ask the reason why I do not always tell them, the reason is want of paper, not of good will, let young Students heed what I have written if they prove true, they may know how to do the like, if not true, they may know how to avoyd my errors; I scorn to assume any bodyes name to my writings, much more to fetch one from <hi>Utopia,</hi> or to write any thing that I am afraid or ashamed to set my own to, therefore take notice that the Author of the book is called</p>

            <p>WHilst such as fear God and admire at his Works in the Creation, beholding the lustre of the Creatures magnifying the Glory of the Creator, you spend your study and time in Railing at Astrologers (which although I can bear, yet let him of your <hi>Coat</hi> that hath no sin, throw the first stone at them) and against Astrology it self, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works of God in the harmony of the Creation, &amp; this is something intollerable: <hi>Let your MODERATION be made known to all men:</hi> You know who it was said so; but your Moderation herein was
<pb facs="tcp:120375:3"/>
so small, that it was not discernable by a Perspective-glass. I beseech you Consider with me in the Spirit of Meekness (if you know but what it means) The Spirit of God is Humble and Meek; Was yours so? The Spirit of Satan is Proud and Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous; Was not yours so? The Spirit of God is Peaceable &amp; Loving; Was yours so? The Spirit of Satan is Rash and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Was not yours so? The Spirit of Christ comes out of a sight of Weakness; Did yours so? The Spirit of Satan comes with Hatred &amp; Disdain, speaking evil of what it knows not; Did not yours so? The Spirit of Christ is still Enquiring; Was yours so? The Spirit of Antichrist is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident &amp; Raging; Was not yours so? And yet (forsooth) you would have the States to be your Boyes, as <hi>Pilate</hi> was your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, to act what you desire: You mistake Sir, they have more Wit, more Honesty: Be pleased to look your Face in a Glass, be

               <p>The next yeer 1652 appears a most formidable Eclips of the ‚òâ in ‚ôà 19. d. 15. m. 20. s. upon the 28. of March neer noon. ‚ôÇ upon the cusp of M. C. ‚ôÑ upon the cusp of the Ascendent, ‚ôÇ is lord of the Eclips, &amp; <hi>coelum Mars so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus habet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princes of Europe shall almost all drink deeply of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Eclips, and the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marims</hi> (ask Sr. <hi>Iohn Presbiter</hi> the meaning of the word) shall before hand like the three frogs mentioned in the <hi>Revelation</hi> go to gather them together to the battel of the Great God: Rejoyce √¥ ye Saints, in whom God dwels who are moved and guided by his Spirit, for a short work will your God make upon the face of the earth, &amp; the days shalbe shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened for mine &amp; your sakes.</p>
               <p>The Effects of this Eclips will begin speedily, because the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles are moveable, and operate violently, <hi>torrenti similes,</hi> as dreadfull will the effects of it be to Kings, as wel as Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon-people. <hi>Man that is in honor and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</hi> For my part I have not so learned Christ to be <hi>afraid of the signs of Heaven,</hi> let them look to it that lead a beastial life. If what I write now please, I shall hereafter write more of this Eclips.</p>

The part of Heaven afflicted is the Ninth House, which signifies Voyages beyond Sea, Clergy-men of all sorts, even from the Pope to the Journey-man-Priest, Church-Livings and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>Anglice,</hi> Gleabland and Tythes, all Authors hold it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, Religion, and I beleeve it signifies <hi>that Monster which People call Religion, viz.</hi> The Ordinances of men and the like; as also the predominant Religion of the Times and Countries, the <hi>States Religion</hi> be it what it will, <hi>Turkish, Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Popish,</hi> for it is at present my Opinion, That the true Religion will scarse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flourish by publick Authority, till Jesus Christ be set upon his holy hill of <hi>Zyon</hi>; in the mean season I look to see the beginning of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

(as it is so called) I am as yet ignorant of; I have as much Faith in the Synods <hi>Directory,</hi> as I have in the History of <hi>Bel and the Dragon,</hi> or the Fable of <hi>Arion and the Dolphin</hi>; I dare not Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie humane Learning, though my self have been an Accademick, nor make a little god-almighty of the present Clergy; a few, a very few Months will shew they are but men, and perhaps none of the best of men neither.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Planets afflicting are ‚ôÑ and ‚ôÇ, both bad, and therefore not like to do good, they doth hate one another, both hate the Sign and House they are in; of this, see more is the writings of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>My Iudgment I shall deliver,</hi> 1 <hi>Generally,</hi> 2 <hi>Particularly:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Generally, It sets hard on the Clergy, and before the Effects of it be half over, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> will find it wisdom to pawn his JUS DIVINUM for a SUPERSEDEAS DE NON MOLESTANDO. The Sea will be exceeding dangerous, both by Pyrates and Shipwarck; <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> look well to thy Dams, I fear the Sea will break in upon thee: God preserve <hi>York</hi> from Fire and Faction: And thou o <hi>Scotland</hi> (ingrateful <hi>Scotland</hi>) art now come into remembrance, thou couldest never find in thy heart to love thy Friends, therfore shalt thou now be forced to fear thy Enemies; for let whoever reads my writings, take notice what I say, <hi>If the Stars did ever in their courses fight against</hi> Sisera, <hi>so will they now against</hi> Scotland: The first is Scripture proof, and a little time will prove I am no Lyar in the second: In <hi>Scotland</hi> had <hi>Presbytery</hi> its beginning, there shall it expire; and very speedily may that saying that <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

of the Chariots armed with Sythes and Hooks be applyed to <hi>Presbytery, At first they were a Terror, and afterwards a Scorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dreadful Effects threatned by this Conjunction, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by the Book of the Creatures gives you fair warning of, according to <hi>Guido Bonatus</hi> are these, <hi>It signifies killing of Kings (for want of them take Supream Magistrates in their stead) subversion of Kingdoms, terrible Strifes, Contentions and wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings, ill Disposition in Creatures, Slaughters Captivities, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Towns, much effusion of Blood, Famine, Mortality, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence</hi>; thus honest <hi>Guido</hi>: And intruth the Conjunction hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Ninth House, I shrewdly suspect the Clergy wil have a great hand in this, and for ever defile their Ecclesiastical garb, with a purple stain.</p>
               <p>I told you before what Places were by the course of Nature sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Effects of this Conjunction, and which of them God may in mercy be pleased to spare is unknown to me, or whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: this I am confident, They are all threatned: God promiseth because he would perform: He threatens because he would not perform; And therefore <hi>O York, Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Amsterdam, &amp;c.</hi> Let my Counsel be acceptable to you, <hi>Break off your sins by repentance, and your iniquities by shewing mercy to the Poor, it may be a lengthning of your tranquility; be sure ye prepare to meet your God:</hi> And thou <hi>O Presbyter, Thou hast seen what God hath done to thy fathers the Bishops, how for their Pride and Ambition he laid their Honor in the dust, yet hast not thou humbled thy self for all thou knowest all this</hi>; I assure thee two years will not pass (for so long the Effects of this Conjunction will last) before thy name will be Odious to men (except thou make thy peace with God, for the angry Angel hath drawn his SWORD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee) You would be Statesmen, nay State-Rulers (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) would you not? Indeed it is denyed you, Repent, repent, I and that quickly before the dreadful writing, <hi>Mene, mene, tekel upharfin</hi> (you know the meaning of the words) be verified upon you also: I have delivered my own mind candidly, and drawn from rules of Nature: Look to your selves, or if you will not, I cannot help it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:120375:29"/>Whether this Conjunction should be the fore-runner of some new and Monstrous Tenents in Religion, worse then the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> if worse can be; or whether monstrous Pride and saucy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in our present Clergy I leave for time to determine, sure I am there will be much striving, contending, controverting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, and such Principles as shall bring neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nor felicity, but only vast expence of brain and time.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the general.</p>
               <p>As for Paariculars, I desire you to take them as in respect of Time, not in respect of particular Actions, which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> Cent. Aph. 1. affirms none but mad men ([<hi>Qui furore incitantur</hi>] which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lilly</hi> so learnedly translates men inspired (not with the spirit <hi>Python</hi>) but with the Spirit of God) will undertake to do.</p>

                  <p>NOw <hi>Mars</hi> hath newly left the <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and his <hi>Square</hi> to the place he was in at the Conjunction; now <hi>Mars</hi> marches through the Ninth House of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> it is something strange that so many Influences should threaten the Clergy; who knows but that is the reason they rail so at Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy? we use to do so when we were School-boyes against those that told tales of us. The propinquity of this Month to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or latter of the last year (if you will conclude the year at Christmass, which perhaps was first invented because they would end it merrily) is such, that this Month cannot chuse but partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the evil Influence of the former; I find <hi>Mars</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, though with <hi>Spica Virginis,</hi> a benevolent fixed Star, as if some honest minded People should labor to pacifie his fury; but he is in the Ninth of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the Twelfth of the Conjunction of himself and <hi>Saturn,</hi> in the Seventh of the inition of this present Parliament, as if the Clergy should go about to Oppose the State; nay, to set the World together by the ears: Oh Heavens! What the <hi>Pigmies</hi> assault <hi>Hercules</hi> again! Learn your duty (Clergy) from an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer, it is not allotted you to be Statesmen, your Office is to teach Jesus Christ, and he was, he is the Prince of Peace, your Commission reaches no further, if you go beyond your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, look to suffer for breach of it; if you be pressed in Spirit, then teach that Jesus is THE Christ, meddle with your Charge, but 'twas the Costome of your Fathers before you, go on in your Sins, they will be the sooner full, and your Judgment the sooner come; beleeve me, the time hastens when People will be Priest-ridden no longer.</p>
                  <p>I had forgotten that the last Month threatens great Dissention in <hi>Scotland,</hi> great ones against great ones: Do! fall out, and Fight to, it shall not trouble me.</p>

                  <p>I would willingly have ended this Month, but when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Charls</hi> the First lost his head on the latter end of this Month let me give a timely Admonition to his Son; Oh! that he would be but so wise to hear: I question not, but some will have the Honesty to him, or the Malice against me, to tell him of it.

I would have said Searchings.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but conclude some, nay much good to the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty this year, for if the Lord of the year be well seated, as here he is, he signifies a good fruitful year, Prosperity and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Surely Justice will this year come down again from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to visit the Earth: Peace, Plenty, and Prosperity seems to attend the English Nation, I aspire to no Kingdom; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to take a Publick Office for fear I should turn Knave as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done.</p>

                  <p>I will not deny but the <hi>Sun</hi> is very neer approaching to the <hi>Quartile</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> from Cardinal Signs, which according to <hi>Guldo Bonatus</hi> threatens such Places as are under the <hi>Sun</hi> &amp; <hi>Leo,</hi> viz. <hi>Room, Italy, Gallia Togata, &amp;c.</hi> If the Pestilence rage in those Places this year, I cannot help it.</p>
                  <p>My own Opinion is, That the year will be far more plentiful then healthful; mens bodies will be vexed exceedingly with Coughs, Catharrs, Asthmaes, and other Diseases proceeding of cold and moysture, will be Epidemical, and of long continuance.</p>

Well! If it do, look to it <hi>France,</hi> for thou wilt suffer: Beware <hi>Portugale:</hi> There's not a Nation under the <hi>Moon</hi> shall offend us, and escape unpunished.</p>

            <p>Vertues Conservative‚ÄîVital, Natural, Animal.</p>
            <p>By the Natural are bred‚ÄîBlood, Choller, Flegm, Melancholly.</p>
            <p>The Animal Vertue is‚ÄîIntelective, Sensitive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:120375:36"/>
The Intellective is‚ÄîImagination, Judgment, Memory.</p>
            <p>The Sensitive is‚ÄîCommon, Particular.</p>
            <p>The Particular is‚ÄîSeeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting. Feeling.</p>
            <p>THe Scope of this Treatise is, To preserve in soundness, vigor and acuity, the Mind and Understanding of Man, to strengthen the Brain, preserve the Body in health, to teach a man to be an able co-artificer, or helper of Nature, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and expel Diseases.</p>
            <p>I shall touch only the principal Faculties, both of Body and Mind, which being kept in a due decorum, preserve the Body in health, and the Mind in vigor.</p>
            <p>I shall in this place speak of them only in the general, as they are laid down to your view in the <hi>Synopsis,</hi> in the former Pages, and in the same order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vertue Procreative.</hi>] The first in order, is the Vertue Procreative; for Nature regards not only the conservation of its self, but to beget its like, and conserve its <hi>Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Seat of this is in the members of Generation, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned principally by the influence of <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is augmented and encreased by the strength of <hi>Venus,</hi> by her Herbs, Roots, Trees, Minerals, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is diminished and purged by those of <hi>Mars,</hi> and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by those of <hi>Saturn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe the Hour and Medicins of <hi>Venus,</hi> to Fortifie; of <hi>Mars,</hi> to Clense this Vertue; of <hi>Saturn,</hi> to Extinguish it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conservative.</hi>] The Conservative Vertue is, Vital, Natural, Animal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vital.</hi>] The Vital spirit hath its residence in the Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:120375:37"/>
and is dispersed from it by the Arteries; and is governed by the influence of the Sun. And it is so to the Body, as the Sun is to the Creation, as the Heart is in the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> so is the Sun in the <hi>Megacosm:</hi> for as the Sun gives Life, Light, and Motion to the Creation, so doth the Heart to the Body; therefore it is called, <hi>Sol Corporis,</hi> as the Sun is called, <hi>Cor Coeli,</hi> because their Operations are so like.</p>
            <p>Inimical and destructive to this Vertue, are <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Herbs and Plants of <hi>Sol,</hi> wonderfully fortifie it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural.</hi>] The Natural Faculty or Vertue, resides in the Liver, and is generally governed by <hi>Iupiter, Quasi juvans pater</hi>; its Office is to nourish the Body, and is dispersed through the Body by the Veins.</p>
            <p>From this are bred Four particular Humors, <hi>Blood, Choller, Flegm, Melancholly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blood</hi> is made of Meat perfectly Concocted, in quality hot and moist, governed by <hi>Iupiter:</hi> It is by a third Concoction tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smuted into Flesh, the superfluity of it into Seed, and its recept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle is the Veins, by which it is dispersed throughout the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Choller</hi> is made of Meat more then perfectly Concocted; it is the spume or froth of Blood: it clarifies all the Humors, heats the Body, nourisheth the Apprehension, as Blood doth the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It is in quality hot and dry; fortifieth the atractive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as Blood doth the disgestive; moves man to Activity and Valor: its receptacle is the Gall, and it is under the influence of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flegm</hi> is made of Meat not perfectly digested; it fortifies the Vertue Expulsive, makes the Body slippery, fit for Ejection; it fortifies the Brain by its consimilitude with it; yet it spoyles Apprehension by its Antipathy with it: It qualifies Choller, cools and moistens the Heart, therby sustaining it, and the whole Body, from the fiery Effects, which continual motion would produce: its receptacle is the Lungues, and is governed by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> some say by the <hi>Moon,</hi> perhaps it may be governed by them both; it is cold and moist in quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melancholly,</hi> is the sedement of Blood, cold and dry in quality, fortifying the Retentive Faculty, and Memory; makes men so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, solid and staid, fit for study; staies the unbridled toyes and
<pb facs="tcp:120375:37"/>
sooleries of lustful blood, stays the wandring thoughts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them home to the Centre: it is like a grave Counsellor to the whole Body: its receptacle is in the Spleen, and it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Saturn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all these Humors, Blood is the chief, all the rest are but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of Blood; yet are they necessary superfluities, for without any of them, man cannot live.</p>
            <p>Namely, Choller is the Fiery superfluity; Flegm, the Watery; Melancholly the Earthly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Animal.</hi>] The third principal Vertue remains, which is Animal; its residence is in the Brain, and <hi>Mercury</hi> is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Significator of it. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> held the <hi>Moon</hi> signified the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Vertue; and I am of an Opinion, both <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> dispose it: And my Reason is, 1 Because both of them in Nativities, either fortifie, or impedite it. 2 Ill directions to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or from either, afflict it, as good ones help it: Indeed the <hi>Moon</hi> rules the Bulk of it, as also the Sensitive part of it: <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> the Rational part; and that's the reason if in a Nativity the <hi>Moon</hi> be stronger then <hi>Mercury,</hi> Sence many times over-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers Reason; but if <hi>Mercury</hi> be strong, and the <hi>Moon</hi> weak, Reason will be master ordinarily in despite of Sence.</p>
            <p>It is divided into Intellective, and Sensitive:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Intellective.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The Intellective resides in the Brain, within the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> is governed generally by <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is divided into Imagination, Judgment and Memory.</p>
            <p>Imagination is seated in the fore-part of the Brain, it is hot and dry in quality, quick, active, alwayes working, it receives vapors from the Heart, and coyns them into Thoughts; it never sleeps, but alwayes is working, both when the man is sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; only when Judgment is awake it regulates the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which runs at random when Judgment is asleep, and forms any Thought according to the nature of the vapor sent up to it, <hi>Mercury</hi> is out of question the disposer of it.</p>
            <p>A man may easily perceive his Judgment asleep, before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self many times, and then he shall perceive his Thoughts run at random.</p>
            <p>Judgment alwayes sleeps when men doth, Imagination never
<pb facs="tcp:120375:38"/>
sleeps, Memory somtimes sleeps when men sleeps, and sometimes it doth not; so then, when Memory is awake, and the man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asleep, then Memory remembers, what Apprehension coyns, and that is a Dream: The Thoughts would have been the same, if Memory had not been awake to remember it.</p>
            <p>These Thoughts are commonly (I mean in sleep, when they are purely natural) framed according to the nature of the Humor called Complexion which is predominate in the Body; and if the Humor be peccant, it is alwayes so.</p>
            <p>So that it is one of the surest rules to know a mans own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, by his Dreams, I mean a man void of Distractions, or deep Studies: (this most assuredly shews <hi>Mercury</hi> to dispose the Imagination, as also because it is mutable applying it self to any object, as <hi>Mercury's</hi> nature is to do) for then the Imagination will follow its old bend; for if a man be bent upon a business, his Apprehension will work as much when he is asleep, and find out as many truths by study, as when the man is awake; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more too, because then it is not impedited by ocular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>For the notion of the predominate Complexion, by the dreams, I have read some most excellent Verses, made by <hi>Thomas May,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> which I shall here insert, by which, if the Complexion be not altered much in quantity nor quallity, you may know, by your most usual Dreams, not only your own Complexion, but also what every Complexion, is most prone and inclinable to: (I suppose, and really beleeve, That many Men and Women may know strange truths by their Dreams if their Nativities be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly either by Nature, or perhaps if the business be rectified by Art, of which I may happen to write somthing hereafter.)</p>
            <p>They are these:

                     <head>Sanguine Complexion.</head>
                     <l>There altogether fly in Companies,</l>
                     <l>Of different Colors, Shapes and Qualities,</l>
                     <l>Bright sanguine Dreams, that seem to cheer the night,</l>
                     <l>With beautious Shapes, and rosy wings as bright,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:120375:38"/>As in the Morning, or those Flowers that grace</l>

                     <l>Stealing by night, do thither come and love</l>
                     <l>With those bright sanguine Dreams, to pass away</l>

                     <l>With swift and angry motion, to and fro,</l>
                     <l>As if they sought within that place, a foe.</l>
                     <l>Sometimes up to the Temples roof, on high,</l>
                     <l>They soar, as if they meant to scale the sky:</l>
                     <l>Or some impossible Atchievment sought,</l>

                     <l>On dead mens Tombs, and every Sepulcher,</l>
                     <l>The dusky Dreams of Melancholy light,</l>
                     <l>With sable wings, like Bats or birds of night,</l>
                     <l>Fluttering in darkest corners, here and there,</l>

                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:120375:39"/>But slow, like slimy Snails, about do crawl,</l>
                     <l>And evermore, are thence afraid to fall,</l>
                     <l>And so be drown'd, for on the floor below,</l>

            </p>
            <p>And thus much for Imagination, which is governed by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and fortified by his Influence; and is also strong or weak in man, according as <hi>Mercury</hi> is strong or weak in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
            <p>Judgment is seated in the midst of the Brain, to shew that it ought to bear rule over all the other Faculties; it is the Judge of the little world, to approve of what is good, and reject what is bad; it is the seat of Reason, and the guide of Actions; so that all failings are committed through its infirmity, it not rightly judging between a real and an apparent good. It is hot and moist in quality, and under the influence of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Memory is seated in the hinder cell of the Brain, it is the great Register to the little World; and its Office is to Record things either done and past, or to be done.</p>
            <p>It is in quality cold and dry, Melancholick, and therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Melancholick men have best Memories, and most tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious every way. It is under the dominion of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by his Influence, but purged by the Luminaries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sensitive.</hi>] The second part of the Animal Vertue, is Sensitive, and it is divided into two Darts, Common and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Common Sence is an imaginary term, and that which gives Vertue to all the particular Sences, and knits or unites them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether within the <hi>pia Mater.</hi> It is Regulated by <hi>Mercury,</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this is one Reason why men are so fickle-headed) and its Office is to preserve a harmony among the Sences.</p>
            <p>Particular Sences are Five,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These Sences are united in one, in the Brain, by the Common Sence, but are operatively distinguished into their several seates, and places of Residence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:120375:39"/>The <hi>Sight</hi> resides in the Eyes, and particularly in the Christal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Humor; It is in quality cold and moist, and governed by the Luminaries: They who have them weak in their genesis, have alwayes weak sights; if one of them be so, the weakness possesseth but one Eye.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hearing</hi> resides in the Ears; is in quality, cold and dry, Melancholly, and under the dominion of <hi>Saturn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Smelling</hi> resides in the Nose, is in quality hot and dry, Chollerick, and that is the reason Chollerick Creatures have so good Smels, as Doggs. It is under the Influence of <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Taste</hi> resides in the Pallat which is placed at the root of the Tongue on purpose to discern what food is congruous for the Stomack, and what not; as the Meseraik Veins are placed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what nourishment is proper for the Liver to convert into Blood; in some very few men, and but a few, and in those few, but in a very few Meats these two Tasters agree not; and that is the reason some men cover Meats that make them sick, <hi>viz.</hi> The Taste craves them, and the Meseraik Veins reject them: In qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hot and moist, and is ruled by <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Feeling</hi> is deputed to no particular Organ, but is spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, over the whole Body; is of all qualities, hot, cold, dry, and moist, and is the Index of all tangible things; for if it were only hot, alone, it could not feel a quality contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> cold; and so might be spoken of other qualities. It is under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Venus,</hi> some say, <hi>Mercury:</hi> A thousand to one, but tis under <hi>Mercury.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Attractive</hi> Vertue is hot and dry, hot by quality active, or principal, and that appears because the fountain of all heat is Attractive, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun. Dry by a quality pasive, or an effect of its heat; its Office is to remain in the Body, and call for what Nature wants.</p>
            <p>It is under the Influence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> say Authors, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Mars,</hi> because he is of a corrupting nature, (Experience is more worth then Tradition ten thousand times told over) yet if we cast an impartial Eye upon Experience, we shall find, That

Martial men, call for Meat, none of the least; and for Drink the most of all other men, although many times they corrupt the Body by it; and therefore I see no reason why <hi>Mars</hi> being of the same quality with the <hi>Sun,</hi> should not have a share in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to Object, That the Influence of <hi>Mars</hi> is Evil, and therefore he should have no dominion over this Vertue; for then,
<list>
                  <item>1 By the same rule, he should have no dominion at all in the Body of man.</item>
                  <item>2 All the Vertues in man are naturall Evil, and corrupted by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Attractive</hi> Vertue ought to be fortified when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in fiery Signs, <hi>viz. Aries</hi> and <hi>Sagitary,</hi> but not in <hi>Leo,</hi> for the sign is so violent, that no Physick ought to be given when the <hi>Moon</hi> is there: (and why not <hi>Leo,</hi> seeing that is the most Attractive sign af all? and that's the reason such as have it ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their Genesis, are such greedy eaters) If you cannot stay till the <hi>Moon</hi> be in one of them, let one of them ascend when you administer the Medicine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Digestive</hi> Vertue is hot and moist, and is the principal of them all, the other like handmaids attend it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attractive</hi> Vertue draws that, which it should digest, and serves continually, to feed and supply it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Retentive</hi> Vertue, retains the substance with it, till it be perfectly digested.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Expulsive</hi> Vertue casteth out and expelleth, what is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous by digestion.</p>
            <p>It is under the influence of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and fortified by his Herbs and Plants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In fortifying it, let your <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Geminis, Aquary,</hi> or the first half of <hi>Libra,</hi> or if matters be come to that extremity, that you cannot stay till that time, let one of them ascend, but both of them together would do better, alwayes provided that the <hi>Moon</hi> be not in the Ascendent. I cannot beleeve the <hi>Moon</hi> afflicts the Ascendent so much as they talk of, if she be well dignified and in a sign she delights in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Retentive</hi> Vertue is in quality cold and dry; cold, because
<pb facs="tcp:120375:40"/>
the nature of cold is to compress, witness the Ice; dry, because the nature of driness, is to keep and hold what is compressed.</p>
            <p>It is under the Influence of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and that is the reason why usually Saturnine men are so covetous and tenacious.</p>
            <p>In fortifying of it, make use of the Herbs and Plants, &amp;c. of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and let the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Virgo, Capricorn</hi> is not so good, say Authors, (I can give no Reason for that neither) let not <hi>Saturn</hi> nor his ill Aspect molest the Ascendent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Expulsive</hi> Faculty is cold and moist; cold, because that compresseth the Superfluities; moist, because that makes the Body slippery and fit for Ejection, and disposeth it to it.</p>
            <p>It is under the dominion of <hi>Luna,</hi> with whom you may joyn <hi>Venus,</hi> because she is of the same nature.</p>
            <p>Also in whatsoever is before written, of the Nature of the Planets, take notice, That fixed Stars of the same Nature, work the same effects.</p>
            <p>In fortifying this, (which ought to be done in all Purgations) let the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> or <hi>Pises,</hi> or let one of these signs Ascend.</p>

            <p>COurteous Reader, if thou ever intendest to study Physick, and turn neither Fool nor Knave in that famous Science, be well skilled in this foregoing Discourse; here's enough for thee to whet thy Wits upon: Sympathy and Antypathy are the two Hinges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the whole Body of Physick turns: Thou hast the Radix of them here. Here's a Foundation for thee to erect the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick upon, if thou beest wise; if not, thou art unfit to make a Physitian: I love well, and am as willing to help all ingenious men, though their parts be never so weak: but I hate Pride in whomsoever I find it: I now bid thee Farewel for this time, only take Notice, in all this Treatise I have not spoken one Word of the <hi>Colledge of Physitians.</hi>
