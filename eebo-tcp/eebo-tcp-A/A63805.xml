            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHen a Roman Gentleman had, to please himself, written a book in Greek, and presented it to <hi>Cato</hi>; he desired him to pardon the faults of his expressions, since he wrote in Greek, which was a tongue in which he was not perfect Master. <hi>Cato</hi> told him he had better then to have let it alone, and written in Latine, by how much it is better not to commit a fault, then to make apologies. For if the thing be good, it needs not to be excus'd, if it be not good, a crude apologie will do nothing but confess the fault, but never make amends. I therefore make this address to all who will concern themselves in reading this Book, not to ask their pardon for my fault in doing it; I know of none; for if I had known them, I would have mended them before the Publication; and yet though I know not any, I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but much fault will be found by too many; I wish I have
<pb facs="tcp:35126:5"/>
given them no cause for their so doing. But I do not onely mean it in the particular periods (where every man that is not a Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> will, at least do as <hi>Apollonius</hi> did to the apparition that affrighted his company on the mountain <hi>Caucasus,</hi> he will revile and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me with evil words) but I mean it in the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and men will reasonably or capritiously ask, why any more controversies? Why this over again? Why against the Papists, against whom so very-many are already exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they cry out fiercely of persecution? And why can they not be suffered to enjoy their share of peace, which hath returned in the hands of his Sacred Majesty at his blessed Restauration? For as much of this as concerns my self, I make no excuse, but give my reasons, and hope to justifie this procedure with that modesty which <hi>David</hi> us'd to his angry Brother; saying, <hi>What have I now done? Is there not a cause</hi>? The cause is this.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Fathers my Lords the Bishops of <hi>Ireland</hi> in their circumspection and watchfulness over their Flocks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving espyed grievous Wolves to have entred in, some with Sheeps clothing, and some without, some secret enemies, and some open, at first endeavour'd to give check to those enemies which had put fire into the bed straw; and though God hath very much prosper'd their labours, yet they have work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do, and will have, till God shall call them home to the land of peace and unity. But <hi>it was soon remembred,</hi> that when King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory had discerned the Spirits of the English non-Conformists, &amp; found them peevish and factious, unreasonable and imperious, not only unable to govern, but as inconsistent with the Government, as greedy to snatch at it for themselves; resolved to take off their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise and put a difference between <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35126:5"/>
and to bring them to the measures and rules of Laws; and to this, the Council, and all wise men were consenting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the Kings great wisdome, and the conduct of the whole conference and enquiry, men saw there was reason on the Kings side, and necessity on all sides. But the Gun-powder Treason breaking out, a new zeal was enkindled against the Papists, and it shin'd so greatly, that the non-Conformists escaped by the light of it, and quickly grew warm by the heat of that flame, to which they added no small increase by their declamations, and other acts of insinuation: insomuch that they being neglected, multiply'd until they got power enough to do all those mischiefs which we have seen and felt. This <hi>being remembred and spoken of,</hi> it <hi>was soon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd</hi> that the Tables only were now turn'd, and that now the publick zeal and watchfulness against those men, and those persuasions, which so lately have afflicted us, might give to the emissaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> leisure and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to grow into numbers and strength to debauch many Souls, and to unhinge the safety and peace of the Kingdom. In <hi>Ireland</hi> we saw too much of it done, and found the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief growing too fast, and the most intolerable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but too justly apprehended, as near and imminent. We had reason at least to cry Fire when it flamed through our very Roofs, and to interpose with all care and diligence, when Religion and the eternal interest of Souls was at stake, as knowing we should be greatly unfit to appear and account to the <hi>great Bishop and Shepherd of souls,</hi> if we had suffered the enemies to sow tares in our fields, we standing and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. It was therefore consider'd how we might best serve God, and rescue our charges from their danger, and it was concluded presently to run to arms, I mean to the weapons of our warfare, to the armour of the Spirit, to the works of our calling, and to tell the people of their peril, to warn them
<pb facs="tcp:35126:6"/>
of the enemy, and to lead them in the wayes of truth and peace and holiness: that if they would be admonished, they might be safe, if they would not, they should be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, because they could not say but the Prophets have been amongst them.</p>
            <p>But then it was next enquired who should minister in this affair, and put in order all those things which they had to give in charge: It was easie to chuse many, but hard to chuse one; There were many fit to succeed in the vacant Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and though <hi>Barsabas the just</hi> was by all the Church nam'd as a fit and worthy man, yet the lot fell upon <hi>Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>; and that was my case, it fell to me to be their <hi>Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis,</hi> when persons most worthy were more readily excus'd; and in this my Lords the Bishops had reason, that (according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule) <hi>If there be judgements or controversies amongst us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1 Cor. 6.4.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>they should be employ'd who are least esteem'd in the Church</hi>; And upon this account I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left me but obedience; though I confess that I found regret in the nature of the employment, for I love not to be (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>disputers of this world.</hi> For I suppose skill in controversies (as they are now us'd) to be the worst part of Learning, and time is the worst spent in them, and men the least benefited by them; that is, when the Questions are curious and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, intricate, and inexplicable, not to make men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to make a Sect. But when the Propositions disputed are of the foundation of faith, or lead to good life, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do good to single persons or publick Societies, then they are part of the <hi>depositum</hi> of Christianity, of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith</hi>; and for this we are by the Apostle commanded <hi>to contend earnestly,</hi> and therefore controversies may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come necessary; but because they are not often so, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times useless, and alwayes troublesome, and as an ill diet
<pb facs="tcp:35126:6"/>
makes an ill habit of body, so does the frequent use of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies baffle the understanding, and makes it crafty to deceive others, it self remaining instructed in nothing but useless notions and words of contingent signification and distinctions without difference, which minister to pride and contention, and teach men to be pertinacious, troublesome and uncharitable, therefore I love them not.</p>
            <p>But because by the Apostolical Rule I am tyed <hi>to do all things without murmurings,</hi> as well as without <hi>disputings,</hi>

               </note> I consider'd it over again, and found my self reliev'd by the subject matter, and the grand consequent of the present Questions. For in the present affair, the case is not so as in the others; here the Questions are such that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> declares them to reach as far as eternity, and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I instance in their superaddition of Articles and Propositions, derived onely from a pretended tradition, and not contain'd in Scripture. Now the doing of this is a great sin, and a great danger. <hi>Adoro Scripturae ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudinem; Si non est scriptum timeat vae illud adjicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; detrahentibus destinatum, said</hi> Tertullian: <hi>I adore the fulness of Scripture, and if it be not written, let</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenus <hi>fear the wo that is destin'd to them that detract from or add to it.</hi>

               <hi>our blessed Saviour having said, My sheep hear my voice, and the voice of strangers they will not hear; and to detract from Scriptures, or add any thing to the Faith that is not there, is most vehemently forbidden by the Apostle, saying, If it be but a mans Testament,</hi> Nemo su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perordinat, <hi>no man adds to it.</hi> And says also, <hi>This was the will of the Testator.</hi> And <hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus</hi> says plainly,<note place="margin">

Now let any man judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not our duty and a necessary work of charity, and the proper Office of our Ministery, to persuade our charges from the <hi>immodesty of an evil heart,</hi> from having <hi>a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish spirit,</hi> from doing that <hi>which is vehemently forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Apostle,</hi> from <hi>Infidelity and pride,</hi> and lastly from that <hi>eternal wo which is denounc'd</hi> against them that add other words and doctrines than what is contain'd in the Scriptures, and say, <hi>Dominus dixit, The Lord hath said it, and he hath not said it.</hi> If we had put these severe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures upon the Popish Doctrine of Tradition, we should have been thought uncharitable; but because the holy Fathers do so, we ought to be charitable, and snatch our charges from the ambient flame.</p>

               </note> and S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> says, that <hi>he who receives the Mystery otherwayes than Christ appointed</hi> (that is, but in one kind, when he hath appointed it in two) <hi>is unworthy of the Lord, and he cannot have devotion</hi>: Now this thing we ought not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that our people by so doing should remain <hi>unworthy of the Lord,</hi> and for ever <hi>be indevout,</hi> or cozen'd with a false shew of devotion, or fall by following exil guides into the <hi>Sentence of Excommunication.</hi> These matters are not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, and when we see these errors frequently taught and own'd as the only true Religion, and yet are such evils, which the Fathers say are the way of damnation, we have reason to hope that all wise and good men, lovers of souls, will confess that we are within the circles of our duty, when we teach our people to decline the crooked wayes, and to walk in the wayes of Scripture and Christianity.</p>
            <p>But we have observed amongst the generality of the <hi>Irish,</hi> such a declension of Christianity, so great credulity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

every superstitious story, such confidence in vanity, such groundless pertinacy, such vitious lives, so little sense of true Religion and the fear of God, so much care to obey the Priests, and so little to obey God: such intolerable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, such fond Oathes and manners of swearing, thinking themselves more obliged by swearing on the Mass-Book, than the Four Gospels, and S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Mass-Book more than any new one; swearing by their Fathers Soul, by their Godsips hand, by other things which are the product of those many tales are told them; their not knowing upon what account they refuse to come to Church, but onely that now they are old and never did, or their Country-men do not, or their Fathers or Grandfathers never did, or that their Ancestors were Priests, and they will not alter from their Religion; and after all, can give no account of their Religion, what it is: onely they believe as their Priest bids them, and go to Mass which they understand not, and reckon their beads to tell the number and the tale of their prayers, and abstain from eggs and flesh in Lent, and visit S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Well, and leave pins and ribbands, yarn or thred in their holy welts, and pray to God, S. <hi>Mary</hi> and S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> S. <hi>Columbanus</hi> and S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and desire to be buried with S. <hi>Francis</hi>'s chord about them, and to fast on Saturdays in honour of our Lady. These and so many other things of like nature we see dayly, that we being conscious of the infinite distance which these things have from the spirit of Christianity, know that no Charity can be greater than to persuade the people to come to our Churches, were they shall be taught all the ways of godly wisdom, of peace and safety to their souls: whereas now there are many of them that know not how to say their prayers, but mutter like Pies and Parrots, words which they are taught, but they do not pretend to understand. But I shall give one particular instance of their miserable superstition and blindness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35126:8"/>I was lately within a few Moneths very much troubled with petitions and earnest requests, for the restoring a Bell which a Person of Quality had in his hands in the time of, and ever since the late Rebellion. I could not guess at the reasons of their so great and violent importunity, but told the petitioners, if they could prove that Bell to be theirs, the Gentleman was willing to pay the full value of it; though he had no obligation to do so (that I know of) but charity: but this was so far from satisfying them, that still the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity encreased, which made me diligently to inquire into the secret of it. The first cause I found was, that a dying person in the parish desired to have it rung before him to Church, and pretended he could not die in peace if it were deny'd him; and that the keeping of that Bell did anciently belong to that family from father to son: but because this seem'd nothing but a fond and an unreasonable superstition, I enquired farther, and at last found that they believ'd this Bell came from heaven, that it used to be carryed from place to place, to end controversies by oath, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the worst man durst not violate if they swore upon that Bell, and the best men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them durst not but believe him; that if this Bell was rung before the corpse to the grave, it would help him out of Purgatory, and that therefore when any one dyed, the friends of the deceased did, whilst the Bell was in their possession, hire it for the behoof of their dead, and that by this means that family was in part maintain'd. I was troubled to see under what spirit of delusion those poor souls do lie, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely their credulity is abused, how certainly they believe in trifles, and perfectly rely on vanity, and how little they regard the truths of God, and how not at all they drink of the waters of Salvation. For the numerous companies of Priests and Friers amongst them, take care they shall know nothing of Religion but what they design for them, they use all means
<pb facs="tcp:35126:9"/>
to keep them to the use of the <hi>Irish</hi> tongue, lest if they learn <hi>English,</hi> they might be supply'd with persons fitter to instruct them; the people are taught to make that also their excuse for not coming to our Churches, to hear our advises, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with us in religious intercourses, because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand us not, and they will not understand us, neither will they learn, that they may understand and live. And this and many other evils are made greater and more irremediable by the affrightment which their Priests put upon them by the issues of Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, by which (they now exercising it too publickly) they give them Laws, not onely for Religion, but even for Temporal things, and turn their Proselytes from the Mass, if they become farmers of the Tythes from the Minister or Proprietary without their leave. I speak that which I know to be true by their own confession and unconstrain'd and uninvited Narratives; so that as it is certain that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, as it stands in distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and separation from us, is a body of strange Propositions, having but little relish of true primitive and pure Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (as will be made manifest if the importunity of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries extort it) so it is here amongst us a faction and a State party and designe to recover their old Laws and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous manner of living, a device to enable them to dwell alone, and to be <hi>populus unius labii,</hi> a people of one language, and unmingled with others. And if this be Religion, it is such a one as ought to be reproved by all the severities of Reason and Religion, lest the people perish, and their souls be cheaply given away to them that make merchandize of souls, who were the purchase and price of Christs bloud.</p>
            <p>Having given this sad account why it was necessary that my Lords the Bishops should take care to do what they have done in this affair, and why I did consent to be engaged in this controversie, otherwise then I love to be, and since it is
<pb facs="tcp:35126:9"/>
not a love of trouble and contention, but charity to the souls of the poor deluded <hi>Irish,</hi> there is nothing remaining but that we humbly desire of God to accept and to bless this well meant <hi>Labour of Love,</hi> and that by some admirable wayes of his Providence, he will be pleas'd to convey to them the notices of their danger, and their sin, and to deobstruct the passages of necessary truth to them, for we know the arts of their Guides, and that it will be very hard that the notice of these things shall ever be suffer'd to arive to the common people, but <hi>that which hinders will hinder until it be taken away</hi>: however we believe and hope in God for remedy.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Edom</hi> would not let his brother <hi>Israel</hi> pass into his Countrey, and the Philistims would stop the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> Wells, and the wicked Shepherds of <hi>Midian</hi> would drive their neighbours flocks from the watering troughs, and the Emissaries of <hi>Rome</hi> use all arts to keep the people from the use of Scriptures, the Wells of Salvation, and from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the notices of such things which from the Scriptures we teach; yet as God found out a remedy for those of old, so he will also for the poor misled people of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and will take away the evil minds, or the opportunities of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, hindring the people from Instruction, and make way that the truths we have here taught may approach to their ears, and sink into their hearts, and make them wise unto Salvation.</p>

                  <p>To these we also add, not as Authors or Finishers, but as helpers of our Faith, and Heirs of the Doctrine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical, the Sentiments and Catholick Doctrine of the Church of God, in the Ages next after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Not that we think them or our selves bound to every private opinion, even of a Primitive Bishop and Martyr; but that we all acknowledg that the whole Church of God kept the Faith entire, and transmitted faithfully to the after-Ages the whole Faith, <gap reason="foreign">

delivered to the Saints</hi>; and was defective in nothing that belong'd unto salvation, and we believe that those Ages sent millions of Saints to the bosom of Christ, and seal'd the true faith with their lives and with their deaths, and by both, gave testimony unto Jesus, and had from him the testimony of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And this method of procedure we now choose, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because to them that know well how to use it, to the Sober and the Moderate, the Peaceable and the Wise, it is the best, the most certain, visible and tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, most humble and satisfactory, but also because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does with greatest noises pretend her Conformity to Antiquity. Indeed the present Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctrines, which are in difference, were invisible and unheard of in the <hi>first and best Antiquity,</hi> and with how ill success their quotations are out of the Fathers of the three first Ages, every inquiring Man may easily discern. But the noises therefore which they make are from the Writings of the succeeding Ages; where sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interest did more prevail, and the Writings of the Fathers were vast and voluminous, full of Controversie, and ambiguous senses, fitted to their own Times and Questions, full of proper Opinions, and such variety of Sayings, that both Sides eternally and inconfutably shall bring Sayings for themselves respectively. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though things being thus, it will be impossible for them to conclude from the Sayings of a number of Fathers, that their Doctrine, which they would prove thence, was the Catholick Doctrine of the Church; because any number that is less than all, does not prove a Catholick consent, yet the clear Sayings of one or two of these Fathers truly alledged by us to the contrary, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove that what many of them (suppose it) do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35126:13"/>
affirm, and which but two or three as good Catholicks, as the other do deny, was not then matter of Faith or a Doctrine of the Church; for if it had, these had been Hereticks accounted, and not have remain'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church. But although for the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the thing we have thought fit to take notice of it; yet we shall have no need to make use of it; since not only in the prime and purest Antiquity we are indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more than Conquerours; but even in the succeeding Ages, we have the advantage both <hi>numero, pondere, &amp; mensurâ,</hi> in number, weight, and measure.</p>
                  <p>We do easily acknowledge, that to dispute these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions from the sayings of the Fathers, is not the readiest way to make an end of them; but therefore we do wholly rely upon Scriptures as the foundation and final resort of all our perswasions, and from thence can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be confuted; but we also admit the Fathers as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable helps for the understanding of the Scriptures, and as good testimony of the Doctrine deliver'd from their fore-fathers down to them of what the Church esteem'd the way of Salvation: and therefore if we find any Doctrine now taught, which was not plac'd in their way of Salvation, we reject it as being no part of the Christian faith, and which ought not to be impos'd upon consciences. They were <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi> and <hi>fully instructed to every work</hi>; and therefore the faith which they profess'd and deriv'd from Scripture, we profess also; and in the same faith, <hi>we hope to be sav'd even as they.</hi> But for the new Doctors, we understand them not, we know them not: Our faith is the same from the beginning, and cannot become new.</p>
                  <p>But because we shall make it to appear that <hi>they do greatly innovate in all their points of controversie with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35126:13"/>
us,</hi> and shew nothing but shadowes instead of substances, and little images of things instead of solid arguments; we shall take from them their armour in which they trusted, and choose this sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> to combat their errors; for <hi>non est alter talis</hi>; It <hi>is not easie to finde a better than the Word of God, expounded by the prime and best Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first thing therefore we are to advertise is, That the Emissaries of the Roman Church endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the good people of our Dioceses from a Religion that is truly Primitive and Apostolick, and divert them to Propositions of their own, new and unheard of in the first ages of the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>For the Religion of our Church is <hi>therefore</hi> certainly Primitive and Apostolick, because it teaches us to believe the whole Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and nothing else as matter of faith; and therefore <hi>unless there can be new Scriptures, we can have no new matters of belief, no new articles of faith.</hi> Whatsoever we cannot prove from thence, we disclaim it, as not deriving from the Fountains of our Saviour. We also do believe the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> the <hi>Nicene</hi> with the additions of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and that which is commonly called the Symbol of S. <hi>Athanasius:</hi> and the <hi>four first General Councils</hi> are so intirely admitted by us, that they, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the plain words of Scripture, are made the rule and measure of judging Heresies amongst us: and in pursuance of these, it is commanded by our Church that the Clergy shall never teach any thing as matter of <hi>Faith religiously to be observed, but that which is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Old and New Testament, and collected out of the same Doctrine by the Ancient Fathers and Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Church.</hi>

P.</hi> All that believ'd this Doctrine were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Catholicks, <hi>viz.</hi> all they who believe in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, one Divinity of equal Majesty in the Holy Trinity; which indeed was the summe of what was decreed in explication of the Apostles Creed in the four first General Councils.</p>
                  <p>And what faith can be the foundation of a more solid peace, the surer ligaments of Catholick Communion, or the firmer <hi>basis</hi> of a holy Life and of the hopes of Heaven hereafter, than the measures which the Holy Primitive Church did hold, and <hi>and we after them?</hi> That which <hi>we</hi> rely upon is the same that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did acknowledg to be the adaequate foundation of their hopes in the matters of belief: The way which <hi>they</hi> thought sufficient to go to Heaven in, is the way which <hi>we</hi> walk: what <hi>they</hi> did not teach, <hi>we</hi> do not publish and impose; into this faith entirely and into no other, as <hi>they did theirs</hi>; so <hi>we</hi> baptize <hi>our</hi> Catechumens: The Discriminations of Heresie from Catholick Doctrine which <hi>they</hi> us'd, <hi>we</hi> use also, and <hi>we use no other</hi>: and in short, <hi>we believe all that Doctrine which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>believes, except those things which they have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduc'd upon the Old Religion,</hi> and in which we shall prove that they haue innovated. So that by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35126:14"/>
all the Doctrine which <hi>we teach</hi> the people, as matter of Faith, must be confessed to be Ancient, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Apostolick, or else <hi>theirs</hi> is not so: for <hi>ours is the same,</hi> and <hi>we both</hi> have received this Faith from the Fountains of Scripture, and Universal Tradition; <hi>not they from us, or we from them, but both of us from Christ and his Apostles.</hi> And therefore there can be no question whether the Faith of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Apostolick and Primitive; it is so, confessedly: But the Question is concerning many other particulars which were unknown to the Holy Doctors of the first Ages, which were <hi>no part of their Faith,</hi> which were never put into their Creeds, which were <hi>not determined in any of the four first General Councels,</hi> rever'd in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, and entertain'd every where with great Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and veneration, even next to the <hi>four Gospels</hi> and the Apostolical writings.</p>
                  <p>Of this sort, because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd <hi>many,</hi> and hath adopted them into their late Creed, and imposes them upon the people, not only <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the Scriptures and the Catholick Doctrine of the Church of God; laying heavie burdens on mens Consciences, and making the narrow way to Heaven, yet narrower by their own inventions; arrogating to themselves a <hi>Dominion over our Faith,</hi> and prescribing a method of Salvation which Christ and his Apostles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught; corrupting the Faith of the Church of God, and <hi>Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men</hi>; and lastly, having derogated from the Prerogative of Christ, <hi>who alone</hi> is the Author and Finisher of our faith, and hath perfected it in the revelations consign'd in the Holy Scriptures; therefore it is, that we esteem our selves oblig'd to warn the People of their danger, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35126:15"/>
to depart from it, and call upon them to stand upon the wayes, and ask after the <hi>old paths,</hi> and <hi>walk in them</hi>; lest they partake of that curse which is threatned by God to them, <hi>who remove the ancient Land-marks which our Fathers</hi> in Christ <hi>have set</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot pretend that <hi>all</hi> which she imposes is Primitive and Apostolick, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this; That <hi>in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence made to a power, not only of declaring new Articles of Faith, but of making new Symbols or Creeds, and imposing them as of necessity to Salvation.</hi> Which thing is evident in the Bull of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth against <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in which, amongst other things, he is condemn'd for saying, [<hi>It is certain that it is not in the power of the Church or Pope to constitute Articles of Faith.</hi>] We need not adde that this power is attributed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Turrecremata</hi>

                  <p>Now since it cannot be imagined that this power to which they pretend, should never have been reduc'd to act; and that it is not credible they should publish so inviduous and ill sounding Doctrine to no purpose, and to serve no end; it may without further evidence be believed by all discerning persons, that <hi>they have need of this Doctrine, or it would not have been taught,</hi> and that consequently without more adoe, it may be concluded that <hi>some of their Articles are parts of this New Faith</hi>; and that they can therefore in no sense be Apostolical, unless their being Roman makes them so.</p>

But that <hi>about this time Indulgences began,</hi> is more than probable; much before it is certain they were not. For in the whole Canon Law written by <hi>Graetian,</hi> and in the sentences of <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> there is nothing spoken of Indulgences: Now because they liv'd in the time of P. <hi>Alexander</hi> III. if he had introduc'd them, and much rather if they had been as antient as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> (as some vainly and weakly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, from no greater authority than their own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends) it is probable that these great Men, writing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Divinity and Law, would have made mention of so considerable a point, and so great a part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion, as things are now order'd.

that there is an infinite of degrees of Christs merit and satisfaction beyond what is necessary for the salvation of his servants: and (for fear Christ should not have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) the Saints have a surplusage of merits,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Now concerning their <hi>new foundation</hi> of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> the <hi>first stone</hi> of it was laid by P. <hi>Clement</hi> VI. in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant <hi>Vnigenitus, de poenitentiis &amp; remissionibus, A.

This constitution was published Fifty years after the first Jubilee, and was a new device to bring in customers to <hi>Rome</hi> at the second Jubilee, which was kept in <hi>Rome</hi> in this Popes time. What ends of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and interest it serv'd, we are not much concern'd to enquire; but this we know, that it had <hi>not yet passed into a Catholick Doctrine,</hi> for it was disputed against by <hi>Franciscus de Mayronis</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:35126:19"/>But as to the thing it self: it is <hi>so wholly new,</hi> so meerly devis'd and forged by themselves, so newly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of nothing, from great mistakes of Scripture, and dreams of shadows from antiquity; that we are to admonish our Charges, that <hi>they cannot reasonably expect many sayings of the primitive Doctors against them,</hi> any more than against the new fancies of the Quakers, which were born but yesterday. <hi>That which is not cannot be numbred,</hi> and <hi>that which was not could not be confuted.</hi> But the perfect <hi>silence of antiquity</hi> in this whole matter, is an abundant demonstration that this <hi>new nothing</hi> was made in the later laboratories of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ubi supra.</note> For as <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> said, the Holy Fathers, <hi>Ambrose, Hilary, Hierom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> speak <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And whereas it is said that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> DC. years after Christ, gave Indulgences at <hi>Rome</hi> in the stations; <hi>Magister Angularis,</hi> who lived about 200 years since, says, <hi>He never read of any such any where</hi>; and it is certain there is no such thing in the writings of S. <hi>Gregory, nor in any history</hi> of that age, or any other that is authentick: and we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see any history pretended for it by the Roman Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but a <hi>Legend</hi> of <hi>Ledgerus</hi> brought to us the other day by <hi>Surius:</hi> which is so ridiculous and weak, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their own parties dare not avow it as true story; and therefore they are fain to make use of <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> upon the Sentences, and <hi>Altisiodorensis</hi> for story and record. And it were strange, that if this power of giving Indulgences to <hi>take off the punishment,</hi> reserv'd by God <hi>after the sin is pardoned,</hi> were given by Christ to his Church, that <hi>no one of the antient Doctors</hi> should tell any thing of it: insomuch that there is no one Writer of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and credit, not the more antient Doctors we have already named, nor those who were much later, <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35126:20"/>
Tuitensis, Anselm</hi> or S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ever took notice of it; but it was a Doctrine wholly unknown to the Church for about MCC years after Christ: and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Cajetane</hi> told Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. that to him that readeth the Decretals it plainly appears, that <hi>an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is nothing else but an absolution from that penance which the Confessor hath imposed</hi>; and therefore can be nothing of that which is now a dayes pretended.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the <hi>Canonical penances</hi> were about the time of <hi>Burchard</hi> lessen'd add alter'd by <hi>commutations</hi>; and the antient discipline of the Church in imposing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances was made so loose, that the Indulgence was more than the Imposition, and began not to be an act of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy but <hi>remisness,</hi> an <hi>absolution without amends:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a trumpet, and a leavy for the holy War, in Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the Seconds time; for he gave a plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and remission of all sins to them that should go and fight against the Saracens: and yet no man could tell how much they were the better for these Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: for concerning the <hi>value of Indulgences,</hi> the complaint is both old and doubtful, said Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>; and he cites a famous gloss,<note place="margin">In lib. 4. sent.</note> which tells of four Opinions all Catholick, and yet vastly differing in this particular:<note place="margin">Verb. <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia.</hi>
                     </note> but the <hi>Summa Angelica</hi> reckons seven Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that penalty is which is taken off by Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: No man could then tell; and the point was but in the infancy, and since that, they have made it what they please: but it is <hi>at last turn'd into a Doctrine,</hi> and they have devised new propositions, as well as they can, to make sense of it; and yet it is a very strange thing; a solution, not an <hi>absolution</hi> (it is the distinction of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) that is, the sinner is let to go free without punishment in this World, or in the World to come; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35126:20"/>
in the end, it grew to be that which Christendom could not suffer: a heap of Doctrines without Grounds of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or Catholick Tradition; and not onely so, but they have introduc'd a way of remitting sins, that Christ and his Apostles taught not; a way <hi>destructive of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and remission of sins which was preached in the Name of Jesus: it brought into the Church, false and fantastick hopes, <hi>a hope that will make men asham'd</hi>; a <hi>hope</hi> that does not glorifie the merits and perfect satisfaction of Christ; a <hi>doctrine</hi> expresly dishonourable to the full and free pardon given us by God through Jesus Christ; a <hi>practise</hi> that supposes a new bunch of Keys given to the Church, besides that which the Apostles receiv'd to open and shut the Kingdome of Heaven; a Doctrine that introduces pride among the Saints, and advances the opinion of their works beyond the measures of Christ, who taught us,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now although the H.

For besides that they teach a repentance wholly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us to a good life; a faith that intirely relies upon Christs merits and satisfactions; a hope wholly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the plain promises of the Gospel, a service perfectly consisting in the works of a good conscience, a labor of love, a religion of justice and piety and moral virtues: they do also expresly teach that <hi>pilgrimages</hi> to holy places and such like inventions, which are now the earnings and <hi>price of Indulgences,</hi> are not required of us, and are not the way of salvation, as is to be seen in an Oration made by S. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> wholly against pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; in S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35126:21"/>To conclude this particular: Though the gains, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of Indulgences, be a heap almost as great as the abuses themselves, yet the greatest Patrons of this new doctrine could never give any <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> or <hi>reasonable comfort</hi> to the Conscience of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that could inquire into it. They never durst determine whether they were <hi>Absolutions,</hi> or <hi>Compensations</hi>; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they onely take off the penances <hi>actually</hi> impos'd by the Confessor, or <hi>potentially,</hi> and all that which might have been impos'd; whether all that may be paid in the <hi>Court of men</hi>; or all that can or will be required by the Laws and <hi>severity of God.</hi> Neither can they speak ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to the <hi>Great Question,</hi> Whether the Treasure of the Church consists of the Satisfactions of Christ onely, or of the Saints? For if of Saints, it will by all men be acknowledged to be a defeisible estate, and being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and limited, will be spent sooner than the needs of the Church can be served; and if therefore it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to adde the <hi>merits and satisfaction of Christ,</hi> since they are an Ocean of infinity, and can <hi>supply more than all our needs, to what purpose is it to adde the little minutes and droppings of the Saints?</hi> They cannot tell whether they may be given, if the Receiver do nothing, or give nothing for them: And though this last particular could better be resolv'd by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet all the Doctrines which built up this <hi>new Fabrick of Indulgences,</hi> were so dangerous to determine, so improbable, so unreasonable, or at best so uncertain and invidious, that according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Bishop of <hi>Modena,</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> left <hi>all the Doctrines,</hi> and all the cases of Conscience quite alone, and slubber'd the whole matter both in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Indulgences and Purgatory in <hi>general</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory</hi>

And in the mean time, <hi>they tell us not what is, and what is not Superstitious</hi>; nor what is <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> nor what they mean by the general term of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>; and they establish no Doctrine, neither curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor iucurious, nor <hi>durst they decree the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this whole matter, <hi>The Churches Treasure:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst they meddle with it, but left it as they found it, and <hi>continued</hi> in the abuses, and <hi>proceed</hi> in the <hi>practise,</hi> and set their Doctors, as well as they can, to defend all the new and curious and scandalous questions, and to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the gainful trade.

                  <p>But before we say any more in this Question, we are to premonish, That there are Two great causes of their mistaken pretensions in this Article from <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is, That the <hi>Ancient Churches</hi> in their Offices, and the Fathers in their Writings, did <hi>teach and practice</hi> respectively, <hi>prayer for the Dead.</hi> Now because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does so too, and more than so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates her prayers to the Doctrine of Purgatory, and for the souls there detain'd, her Doctors vainly suppose, that when ever the H. Fathers speak of prayer for the dead, that they conclude for Purgatory; which vain conjecture is as false as it is unreasonable: For it is true, the Fathers did pray for the dead; but how? <hi>That God would shew them mercy, and hasten the resurrection, and give a blessed sentence in the great day.</hi> But then it is also to be remembred, that they made prayers, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>for those, who by the confession of all sides, never were in Purgatory</hi>; euen for the Patriarchs and Prophets, for the Apostles and Evangelists, for Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,

                  <p>Upon what accounts the Fathers did pray for the Saints departed, and indeed generally for all, it is not now seasonable to discourse; but to say this onely, that such general prayers for the dead as those above reckon'd, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn by any express Article,<note place="margin">

Which thing is so certain, that in the <hi>very Roman Offices,</hi> we mean, <hi>the Vigils</hi> said for the dead, in which are Psalms and Lessons taken from the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35126:24"/>
Scripture, speaking of the miseries of this World, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reconciliation with God, the bliss after this life of them that dye in Christ, and the resurrection of the Dead; and in the <hi>Anthemes, Versicles,</hi> and <hi>Responses,</hi> there are prayers made, recommending to God the soul of the newly defunct, praying, <hi>he may be freed from Hell, and eternal death, that in the day of Iudgement he be not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned according to his sins, but that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear among the Elect in the glory of the Resurrection</hi>; but not one word of Purgatory, or its pains.</p>
                  <p>The other cause of their mistake is, That the Fathers often speak of a <hi>fire of Purgation</hi> after this life; but such a one that is <hi>not to be kindled until the day of judgement,</hi> and it is such a fire that destroyes the Doctrine of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedial Purgatory.

Now although this was publickly read at <hi>Rome</hi> before an hundred and fourteen Bishops, and by the Pope sent up and down the Churches of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> yet <hi>at this day it is renounc'd by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and unless it be well expounded</hi> (says the Gloss) <hi>will lead into a heresie, greater than what Berengarius</hi> was commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; and no interpretation can make it tolerable, but such an one, as is in another place of the Canon Law, <hi>statuimus, i.e. abrogamus</hi>; nothing but a plain denying it in the sense of Pope <hi>Nicolas.</hi> But however this may be, it is plain they understood it not, as it is <hi>now decreed.</hi> But as it happened to the Pelagians in the beginning of their heresie, they spake rudely, ignorantly, and easily to be reprov'd; but being asham'd and disputed into a more sober understanding of their <hi>hypothesis,</hi> spake more warily, but yet differently from what they said at first: so it was and is in this question; at first they understood it not; it was too unreasonable in any tolerable sense, to make any thing of it; but experience and necessity hath brought it to what it is.</p>

                  <p>Now from these premises we are not desirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any odious consequences in reproof of the Roman Church, but we think it our duty to give our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple caution and admonition; 1. That they be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35126:32"/>
by the rhetorical words and high expressions alledged out of the Fathers, calling the Sacrament, <hi>The body or the flesh of Christ.</hi> For we <hi>all believe it is so,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it. But the question is, <hi>after what manner it is so?</hi> whether after the manner of the flesh, or after the manner of spiritual grace, and sacramental consequence? We <hi>with</hi> the H. Scriptures and the primitive Fathers, affirm the later. The Church of <hi>Rome against</hi> the words of Scripture, and the explication of Christ <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 6 63.</note>, and the Doctrine of the primitive Church affirm the former. 2. That they be careful not to admit such Doctrines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of being Antient; since, although <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man error hath been too long admitted, and is antient in respect of our days, yet it is an innovation in Christianity,</hi> and brought in by ignorance, power and superstition, very many ages after Christ. 3. We exhort them that they remember the words of Christ, when he explicates the Doctrine of <hi>giving us his flesh for meat, and his blood for drink,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vbi supra.</hi>
                     </note> that he tells us, <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing; but the words which he speaks are spirit and they are life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if those antient and primitive Doctors above cited, say true, and that the symbols still remain the same in their natural substance and properties, even after they are blessed, and when they are receiv'd, and that Christs body and blood are onely present to faith and to the spirit, that then whoever tempts them to give Divine honour to these symbols or elements (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does) tempts them to give to a creature the due and incommunicable propriety of God; and that then, this evil passes further than an error in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it carries them to a <hi>dangerous practise,</hi> which cannot reasonably be excus'd from the crime of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> To conclude,</p>

As, if a Priest going by a Bakers Shop, and saying with intention, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> whether all the Bakers bread be turned into the body of Christ? Whether a Church Mouse does eat her Maker? Whether a man by eating the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated symbols does break his fast? For if it be not bread and wine, he does not: and if it be Christs body and blood naturally and properly, it is not bread and wine. Whether it may be said, the Priest is in some sense the Creator of God himself? Whether his power be greater than the power of Angels and Archangels? For that it is so, is expresly affirmed by <hi>Cassenaeus.</hi>

But we hope it may be sufficient, * to say, <hi>That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teaches of Transubstantiation, is absolutely impossible, and implies contradictions very many, to the belief of which no faith can oblige us, and no reason can endure.</hi> For Christs body being in heaven, glorious, spiritual and impassible, cannot be broken. And since
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35126:33"/>
by the Roman doctrine nothing is broken, but that which cannot be broken, that is, the colour, the taste, and other accidents of the elements; yet if they could be broken, since the accidents of bread and wine are not the substance of Christs body and blood, it is certain that on the Altar Christs body, naturally and properly cannot be broken. * And since they say that every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> consecrated Wafer is Christs whole body, and yet this Wafer is not that Wafer, therefore either this or that is not Christs body, or else Christ hath two bodies; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there are two Wafers. * But when Christ instituted the Sacrament, and said, <hi>This is my body which is broken:</hi> because at that time Christs body was not broken natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and properly, the very words of institution do force us to understand the Sacrament in a sense <hi>not natural</hi> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <hi>spiritual,</hi> that is, <hi>truly sacramental.</hi> * And all this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the plain demonstrations of sense, which tells us it is bread and it is wine naturally as much after, as before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> consecration. * And after all, the natural sense is such as our blessed Saviour reprov'd in the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and called them to a spiritual understanding; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense being not onely unreasonable and impossible, but also to no purpose of the spirit, or any ways perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the soul; as hath been clearly demonstrated by many learned men against the fond <hi>hypothesis</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Article.</p>

                  <p>OUr next instance of the novelty of the Roman Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Articles of division from us, is that of <hi>the half Communion.</hi> For they deprive the people of the <hi>chalice,</hi> and dismember the institution of Christ, and praevaricate his express law in this particular, and recede from the practise of the Apostles; and <hi>though they confess it was the practise of the primitive Church,</hi> yet they lay it aside, and <hi>curse</hi> all them that say they do amiss in it; that is, they curse them who follow Christ, and his Apostles, and his Church, while themselves deny to follow them.</p>

kinds of bread and wine.</hi>] The opposition is plain: <hi>Christs Testament ordains it: The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>forbids it:</hi> It was <hi>the primitive custom to obey</hi> Christ <hi>in this: a later custom is by the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>introduc'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> To say that the <hi>first</hi> practise and institution is necessary to be followed, is called <hi>Heretical:</hi> to refuse the <hi>later</hi> subintroduc'd custom incurres the sentence of <hi>Excommunication:</hi> and this they have pass'd not onely into a <hi>Law,</hi> but into an <hi>Article of Faith</hi>; and if this be not <hi>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> and <hi>worshipping God in vain with mens traditions</hi>; then there is, and there never was, and there can be no such thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>So that now the question is not, whether this doctrine and practise be an <hi>INNOVATION,</hi> but whether it be not better <hi>it should it so?</hi> Whether it be not <hi>better to drink new wine than old?</hi> Whether it be not better to obey man than Christ, <hi>who is God blessed for ever?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a late custom be not to be preferr'd before the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient? a custom dissonant from the institution of Christ, before that which is wholly consonant to what Christ did and taught?

What does it avail that man speak all, if the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers understand none; and there is no cause why a man should speak at all, if they, for whose understanding you do speak, understand it not.</hi> God understands the Priests thoughts when he speaks not, as well as when he speaks; he hears the prayer of the heart, and sees the word of the mind, and a dumb Priest can do all the ceremonies, and make the signs; and he that speaks aloud to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him not, does no more. Now since there is no use of vocal prayer in publick, but that all together may signifie their desires, and stirre up one another, and joyne in the expression of them to God; by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, a man who understands not what is said, can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray with his lips; for the heart cannot pray but by desiring, and it cannot desire what it understands not. So that in this case, prayer cannot be an act of the Soul: There is neither affection nor understanding, notice or desire: The heart sayes nothing and asks for nothing, and therefore receives nothing. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calls that <hi>the Sacrifice of fools,</hi> when men consider not; and they who understand not what is said, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take it into consideration.

                  <p>THe Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath to very bad purposes introduc'd and impos'd upon Christendom the worship and veneration of Images, kissing them, pulling off their hats, kneeling, falling down and praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which they call, <hi>giving them due honor and veneration.</hi> What <hi>external honor and veneration</hi> that is, which they call <hi>due,</hi> is express'd by the instances now reckon'd, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in their Decree enumerate and establish. What <hi>the inward honor and worship</hi> is, which they intend to them, is intimated in the same Decree. By the Images they worship Christ and his Saints; and therefore by these Images they pass that honor to Christ and his Saints which is their due: that is, as their Doctors explain it. <hi>Latria</hi> or Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God and Christ. <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> or more than ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the blessed Virgin Mary; and service or <hi>doulia</hi> to other canoniz'd persons. So that upon the whole, the case is this: What ever worship they give to God, and Christ and his Saints, they give it first to the Image, and from the Image they pass it unto Christ and Christs servants. And therefore we need not to enquire what actions they suppose to be fit or due. For whatsoever is due to God, to Christ or his Saints, that worship they give to their respective Images: all the same in external semblance and ministry; as appears in all their great Churches, and publick actions, and processions, and Temples and Festivals, and endowments, and censings,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35126:38"/>
and pilgrimages, and prayers, and vows made to them.</p>
                  <p>Now besides that these things are so like Idolatry, that they can no way be reasonably excused (of which we shall in the next Chapter give some account) besides that they are too like the Religion of the Heathens,<note place="margin">Chap. 2. Sect. 12.</note> and so plainly and frequently forbidden in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are so infinitely unlike the simple and wise, the natural and holy, the pure and the spiritual Religion of the Gospel; besides, that they are so infinite a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Jews and Turks, and reproach Christianity it self amongst all strangers that live in their communion, and observe their rites: besides that they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be lawful, but with the laborious artifices of many Metaphysical notions and distinctions, which the people who most need them, do least understand; and that therefore the people worship them without these distinctions, and directly put confidence in them; and that it is impossible that ignorant persons, who in all Christian countries make up the biggest number, should do otherwise, when otherwise they cannot understand it; and besides that, the thing it self, with or without distinctions, is a superstititious and forbidden, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unnatural worship of God, who will not be worshipped by an Image: we say that besides all this, This whole Doctrine and practice is an innovation in the Christian Church, not practis'd, not indured in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ages; but expresly condemned by them, and this is our present undertaking to evince.</p>

                  <p>When Christ founded his Church, he left it in the hands of his Apostles, without any prerogative given to one, or eminency above the rest, save onely of prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and orderly precedency, which of it self was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, necessary and incident. The Apostles govern'd all; their authority was the sanction, and their Decrees and writings were the Laws of the Church. They exercis'd a common jurisdiction, and divided it according to the needs and emergencies, and circumstances of the Church. In the Council of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> gave not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive Sentence; but S. <hi>Iames,</hi> who was the Bishop of that See. Christ sent all his Apostles as his Father sent him; and therefore he gave to every one of them the whole power which he left behind; and to the Bishops Congregated at <hi>Miletum,</hi>

                  <p>The consequent of this is, that by the law of Christ, one Bishop is not superior to another: Christ gave the power to all alike; he made no Head of the Bishops; he gave to none a supremacy of power or universality of jurisdiction.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35126:43"/>
delegated matters of order and jurisdiction to Monks and Friers; insomuch that the power of Bishops was greatly diminished at the erecting of the Cluniac and Cistercian Monks about the year ML: but about the year MCC, it was almost swallowed up by privileges granted to the begging Friers, and there kept by the power of the Pope: which power got one great step more above the Bishops, when they got it declared that the Pope is above a Council of Bishops: and at last it was turn'd into a new doctrine by <hi>Cajetane</hi> (who for his prosperous invention was made a Cardinal) that all the whole Apostolick or Episcopal power is radical and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Pope, in whom is the fulness of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical authority; and that Bishops receive their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it from him: and this was first boldly maintain'd in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> by the Jesuits; and it is now the opinion of their Order: but it is also that which the Pope challenges in practice, when he pretends to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all Bishops, and that this power is derived to him from Christ; when he calls himself the Universal Bishop, and the Vicarial head of the Church, the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Monarch, he from whom all Ecclesiastical authority is deriv'd, to whose sentence in things Divine every Christian under pain of damnation is bound to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>And therefore all the Church of God, when ever they reckon'd the several orders and degrees of Ministery in the Catholick Church, reckon the Bishop as the last and supreme, beyond whom there is no spiritual power but in Christ.

                  <p>THere are very many more things in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath greatly turn'd aside from the Doctrines of Scripture, and the practise of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Apostolick and primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Such are these: The Invocation of Saints: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of Scriptures without Traditions of Faith unto Salvation: their absolving sinners before they have by canonical penences and the fruits of a good life testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their repentance: their giving leave to simple Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by Papal dispensation, to give confirmation or chrism: selling Masses for Ninepences: Circumgesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35126:46"/>
of the Eucharist to be ador'd: The dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the necessity of the Priests intention in colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sacraments; by which device they have put it into the power of the Priest to damn whom he please of his own parish: their affirming that the Mass is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and the dead: Private Masses, or the Lords Supper without Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is against the doctrine and practise of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and contrary to the tradition of the Apostles, if we may believe Pope <hi>Calixtus,</hi> and is also forbiden under pain of Excommunication.<note place="margin">

                  <p>There are divers others; but we suppose that those Innovations which we have already noted, may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to verifie this charge of Novelty.

                  <p>But they have taught every Priest that can scarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his Breviary, (of which in <hi>Ireland</hi> there are but too many) and very many of the people, to ask where our Religion was before <hi>Luther</hi>?

               <head>CHAP. II. The Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> as it is at this day disordered, teaches Doctrines, and uses Practises, which are in themselves, or in their true and immediate Consequences, direct Impieties, and give Warranty to a wicked Life.</head>

                  <p>OUr first instance is in their Doctrines of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> For the Roman Doctors teach, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be by accident, or in respect of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligation, a sinner is not bound presently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his sin as soon as he hath committed it. Some time or other he must do it, and if he take care so to order his affairs that it be not wholly omitted, but so that it be done one time or other, he is not by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or grace of Repentance bound to do more. <hi>Scotus</hi> and his Scholars say that a sinner is bound, <hi>viz.</hi> by the precept of the Church, to repent on Holy dayes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the great ones. But this is thought too severe by <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> who teach that a sinner is bound
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35126:48"/>
to repent but once a year, that is, against Easter. These Doctors indeed do differ concerning the Churches sense; which according to the best of them is bad enough; full as bad as it is stated in the charge: but they agree in the worst part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That though the Church calls upon sinners to repent on Holy days, or at Easter; yet that by the Law of God they are not tyed to so much, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent in the danger or article of death. This is the express Doctrine taught in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by their famous <hi>Navar</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Enchir. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 31.</note> and for this he quotes Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and finally affirms it <hi>to be the sense of all men.</hi> The same also is taught by <hi>Reginaldus</hi>; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is true, and</hi> the opinion of all men, <hi>that the time in which a sinner is bound by the commandment of God to be contrite for his sins, is the imminent article of natural or violent death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We shall not need to aggravate this sad story by the addition of other words to the same purpose in a worse degree; such as those words are of the same <hi>Reginaldus, There is no precept that a sinner should not persevere in enmity against God. There is no negative precept for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding such a perseverance.</hi> These are the words of this man; but the proper and necessary consequent of that which they all teach, and to which they must consent. For since it is certain, that he who hath sinn'd against God and his Conscience, is in a state of enmity, we say he therefore ought to repent presently, because until he hath repented, he is an enemy to God. This they confess, but they suppose it concludes nothing; for though they consider and confess th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> yet they still saying, a man is no bound by Gods Law to repent till the article of death, do consequently say the same thing that <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi> does, and that a man is not bound to come out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35126:48"/>
of that state of enmity till he be in those circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that it is very probable if he does not then come out, he must stay in it for ever. It is somthing worse than this yet that <hi>Sotus</hi>

                  <p>If it be replyed to this, that though God hath left it to a sinners liberty to repent when he please, yet the Church hath been more severe than God hath been, and tyes a sinner to repent, by collateral positive Laws; for having bound every one to confess at <hi>Easter,</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently she hath tyed every one to repent at <hi>Easter</hi>; and so, by her Laws, can lye in the sin without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption but twelve moneths or thereabouts; yet there is a secret in this, which nevertheless themselves have been pleased to discover for the ease of tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church ordains but the means, the exteriour solemnity of it, and is satisfied if you obey her Laws by a Ritual repentance, but the holiness, and the inward repentance, which in charity we should have suppos'd to have been design'd by the Law of Festivals, <hi>non est id quod per praeceptum de observatione Festorum injungitur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reginald, <hi>lib. de contrit. c.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> is not that which is enjoyn'd by the Church in her Law of Holy dayes.

                     </gap>lves or our charges with confuting this impious Doctrine. For it is evident that this gives countenance and too much warranty to a wicked life; and that of it self is confutation enough,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35126:49"/>
and is that which we intended to represent.</p>
                  <p>If it be answered that this is not the doctrine of their Church, but of some private Doctors; we must tell you, that, if by the Doctrine of their Church they mean such things only as are decreed in their Councils; it is to be considered, that but few things are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in their Councils; nothing but Articles of Belief, and the practise of Sacraments relating to publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and if they will not be reprov'd for any thing but what we prove to be false in the Articles of their simple Belief, they take a liberty to say and to do what they list, and to corrupt all the World by their Rules of Conscience. But, that this is also the Doctrine of their Church, their own men tell us. <hi>Communis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> It is the Doctrine of all their men; so they affirm, as we have cited their own words above: who also undertake to tell us in what sense their Church intends to tye sinners to actual repentance; not as soon as the sin is committed, but at certain seasons, and then also to no more of it, than the external and ritual part. So that if their Church be injuriously charged, themselves have done it, not we. And besides all this: it is hard to suppose or expect that the innumerable cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which a whole Trade of Lawyers and Divines amongst them have made, can be entred into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Councils and publick Decrees. In these cases we are to consider, who teaches them? Their Gravest Doctors, in the face of the Sun, under the intuition of Authority in the publick conduct of souls, in their allowed Sermons, in their books licens'd by a curious and inquisitive Authority, not passing from them but by warranty from several hands intrusted to examine them, <hi>ne fides Ecclesiae aliquid detrimenti patiatur</hi>; that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35126:49"/>
nothing be publish'd but what is consonant to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith. And therefore these things cannot be esteem'd private Opinions: <note n="*" place="margin">

So <hi>this is the Roman Doctrine, though not the Roman Law.</hi> Which difference we desire may be observ'd in many of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing instances, that this objection may no more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for an escape, or an excuse. But we shall have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again to speak to it, upon new particulars.</p>
                  <p>But this, though it be infinitely intolerable, yet it is but the beginning of sorrows: for the guides of souls in the Roman Church, have prevaricated in all the parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, most sadly and dangerously.</p>
                  <p>The next things therefore that we shall remark, are their Doctrines concerning <hi>Contrition:</hi> which when it is genuine and true, that is, a true cordial sorrow for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinn'd against God; a sorrow proceeding from the love of God, and conversion to him, and ending in a dereliction of all our sins, and a walking in all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, both the Psalms and the Prophets, the Old Testament and the New, the Greek Fathers and the Latine have allowed as sufficient for the pardon of our sins through faith in Jesus Christ (as our Writers have often prov'd in their Sermons, and books of Conscience) yet first; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not allow it to be of any value, unless it be joyn'd with a desire to confess their sins to a Priest; saying that a man, by contrition
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35126:50"/>
is not reconcil'd to God, without their Sacramental or Ritual penance, actual or votive; and this is decreed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Session</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> which thing besides that it is against Scripture, and the promises of the Gospel, and not onely <hi>teaches for Doctrine the Commandments of Men</hi>; but evacuates the goodness of God by their Traditions, and weakens and discourages the best repentance, and prefers repentance towards men, before that which the Scripture calls, <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the malignity of this Doctrine, and its influence it hath on an evil life, appears in the other corresponding part of this Doctrine. For as contrition without their ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and sacramental confession will not reconcile us to God: so <hi>attrition</hi> (as they call it) or <hi>contrition imperfect,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from fear of damnation, together with their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament will reconcile the sinner. <hi>Contrition</hi> without it <hi>will not: attrition</hi> with it <hi>will</hi> reconcile us: and therefore by this doctrine, which is expresly decreed at <hi>Trent,</hi> there is no necessity of <hi>Contrition</hi> at all; and <hi>attrition</hi> is as good to all intents and purposes of pardon: and a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will prevail as well as the greatest, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as well as the perfect. So <hi>Guilielmus de Rubeo</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains this Doctrine.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>He that confesses his sins, grieving but a little, obtains remission of his sins by the Sacrament of Penance ministred to him by the Priest absolving him.</hi> So that although God working Contrition in a penitent, hath not done his work for him without the Priests abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in desire at least; yet if the Priest do his part, he hath done the work for the penitent, though God had not wrought that excellent grace of Contrition in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</p>
                  <p>But for the Contrition it self; it is a good word, but

                  <p>Now let this be added to the former, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel is this, That if a man live a wicked life for Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score or Fourscore years together, yet if in the Article of his death, sooner than which, God hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to repent, he be a little sorrowfull for his sins, then resolving for the present, that he will do so no more; and though this sorrow hath in it no love of God, but onely a fear of Hell, and a hope that God will pardon him; this, if the Priest absolves him, does instantly pass him into a state of salvation. The Priest with two fingers and a thumb can do his work for him; onely he must be greatly dispos'd and prepar'd to receive it: Greatly, we say, according to the sense of the Roman Church; for he must be attrite, or it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he were contrite; one act of grief, a little one, and that not for one sin more than another, and this at the end of a long wicked life, at the time of our death, will make all sure.</p>
                  <p>Upon these terms, it is a wonder that all wicked men in the world are not Papists; where they may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35126:51"/>
live so merrily, and dye so securely, and are out of all danger, unless peradventure they dye very sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which because so very few do, the venture is esteem'd nothing, and it is a thousand to one on the sinners side.</p>

For Confession: It is true, to them who are not us'd to it, as it is at the first time, and for that once it is as troublesome as for a bashfull man to speak Orations in Publick: But where it is so perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and universal, and done by Companies and crouds, at a solemn, set time, and when it may be done to any one besides the Parish-Priest, to a Frier that begs, or to a Monk in his Dorter, done in the ear, it may be, to a Person that hath done worse, and therefore hath no awe upon me, but what his Order imprints, and his vitiousness takes off; when we see Women and Boys, Princes and Prelates do the same every day: And as often times they are never the better, so they are not at all asham'd; but men look upon it as a certain cure, like pulling off a mans cloathes to go and wash in a river, and make it by use and habit, by confidence and custom, to be no certain pain, and the women blush or smile,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35126:51"/>
weep or are unmov'd, as it happens, under their vail, and the men under the boldness of their Sex: When we see that men and women confess to day, and sin to morrow, and are not affrighted from their sin the more for it; because they know the worst of it, and have felt it often, and believe to be eas'd by it, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that a little reason, and a little of observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will suffice to conclude, that this practice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession hath in it no affrightment, not so much as the horror of the sin it self hath to the Conscience, For they who commit sins confidently, will with less regret (it may be) confess it in this manner, where it is the fashion for every one to do it. And when all the World observes, how loosely the Italians, Spaniards and French do live in their Carnivals, giving to themselves all liberty and licence to do the vilest things at that time, not only because they are for a while to take their leave of them, but because they are (as they suppose) to be so soon eas'd of their crimes by Confession, and the circular and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing hand of the Priest; they will have no reason to admire the severity of Confession, which as it was most certainly intended as a deletory of sin, and might do its first intention, if it were equally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd; so now certainly it gives confidence to many men to sin, and to most men to neglect the greater and more effective parts of essential repentance.</p>
                  <p>We shall not need to observe, how Confession is made a Minister of State, a Picklock of Secrets, a Spy upon Families, a Searcher of Inclinations, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying to Temptations, for this is wholly by the fault of the men, and not of the Doctrine; but even the Doctrine it self, as it is handled in the Church of

                  <p>In the Church <hi>of Sancta Maria de Popolo</hi> there are for every day in the year, two thousand and eight hundred years of pardon, besides fourteen thousand and fourteen Carentanes; which in one year amount to more than a Million; all which are confirm'd by Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> the First, <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX.

in the year seven thousand years and seven thousand Carentanes of pardon, and a pardon of a third part of all our sins besides; and the price of all this, is but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before an altar in that Church. At the Sepulchre of Christ in <hi>Venice</hi> there is hung up a prayer of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> with an Indulgence of fourscore and two thousand years granted by <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII.

                        </gap>.</hi> The English of that we easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; but the meaning of it we do not, because they will not own that these Indulgences do profit any one whose guilt is not taken away by the Sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But this is not the onely snare in which they have inextricably intangled themselves; but be it as they please for this, whatever it was, it was since en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. to all that shall wear S. <hi>Francis</hi> Chord. The saying a few <hi>Pater nosters</hi> and <hi>Ave's</hi> before a priviledged altar can in innumerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces procure vast portions of this Treasure; and to deliver a soul out of Purgatory, whom they list, is promised to many upon easie terms, even to the saying of their Beads over with an appendant Medal of the Popes Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction. Every Priest at his third or fourth Masse is as sure (as may be) to deliver the souls of his parents; and a thousand more such stories as these are to be seen every where and every day.</p>
                  <p>Once for all: There was a Book printed at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Francis Reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35126:54"/>
of the most blessed Virgin Mary according to the use of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in which for the saying three short prayers written in <hi>Rome</hi> in a place called, <hi>The Chappel of the Holy Cross of seven Romans,</hi> are promised fourscore and ten thousand years of pardon of deadly sin. Now the meaning of these things is very plain. By these devices they serve themselves, and they do not serve God. They serve themselves by this Doctrine:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tolet. instr. sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> For they teach that what penance is ordinarily imposed, does not take away all the punishment that is due; for they do not impose what was antiently enjoyn'd by the penitential Canons, but some little thing instead of it: and it may be, that what was anciently enjoyn'd by the penitential Canons, is not so much as God will exact, (for they suppose that he will forgive nothing but the guilt and the eternity; but he will exact all that can be demanded on this side hell, even to the last farthing he must be paid some way or other, even when the guilt is taken away, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent any falling that way, they have given indulgences enough to take off what was due by the Old Canons, and what may be due by the severity of God; and if these fail, they may have recourse to the Priests, and they by their Masses can make supply: so that their Disciples are well, and the want of ancient Discipline shall do them no hurt.</p>
                  <p>But then how little they serve Gods end by treating the sinner so gently, will be very evident. For by this means they have found out a way, that though, it may be, God will be more severe than the old penitential Canons, and although these Canons were much more severe than men are now willing to suffer, yet neither for the one or the other shall they need to be troubled: they have found out an easier way to go to heaven than
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35126:54"/>
so. An indulgence will be no great charge, but that will take off all the supernumerary penances which ought to have been imposed by the ancient Discipline of the Church, and may be requir'd by God. A little alms to a Priest, a small oblation to a Church, a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the image or reliques of a Saint, wearing Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Chord, saying over the beads with an hallowed appendant, entering into a Fraternity, praying at a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged altar, leaving a legacy for a soul Mass, visiting a priviledged Caemetery, and twenty other devices will secure the sinner from suffering punishment here or hereafter, more then his friendly Priest is pleased gently to impose.</p>
                  <p>To them that ask, what should any one need to get so many hundred thousand years of pardon, as are ready to be had upon very easie terms? They answer as before; that whereas it may be for perjury the antient Canons enjoyned penance all their life <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Concil. Tribur. c.</hi> 54. <hi>Burchard. lib.</hi> 19.</note>; that will be supposed to be twenty or forty years, or suppose an hundred: if the man have been perjur'd a thousand times, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery so often,<note place="margin">

Now it is true, that Purgatory (at least as is believ'd) cannot last a hundred thousand years: but yet God may by the acerbity of the flames in twenty years, equal the Canonical penances of twenty thousand years: to prevent which, these indulgences of so many
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35126:55"/>
thousand years are devised. A wise and thrifty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, sure and well contriv'd, and rightly applotted according to every mans need, and according as they suspect his bill shall amount to.</p>
                  <p>This strange invention, as strange as it is, will be own'd,<note place="margin">

                     </note> for this is the account of it which we find in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine:</hi> and although <hi>Gerson</hi> and <hi>Dominicus à Soto</hi> are asham'd of these prodigious indulgences, and suppose that the Popes Quaestuaries onely did procure them, yet it must not be so disown'd; truth is truth, and it is notoriously so; and therefore a reason must be found out for it, and this is it which we have accounted. But the use we make of it is this. That since they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that when sinnes are pardoned so easily, yet the punishment remains so very great, and that so much must be suffered here or in Purgatory; it is strange that they should not onely in effect pretend to shew more mercy than God does, or the primitive Church did; but that they should directly lay aside the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Discipline, and while they declaim against their adversaries for saying they are not necessary, yet at the same time they should devise tricks to take them quite away, so that neither penances shall much smart here, nor Purgatory (which is a device to make men to be <hi>Mulata's,</hi> as the Spaniard calls, half Christians, a device to make a man go to heaven and to hell too) shall not torment them hereafter. However it be, yet things are so ordered, that the noise of penances need not trouble the greatest criminal, unless he be so unfortunate as to live in no countrey and near no Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Priest, or Friend, or Money, or notice of any thing that is so loudly talk'd of in Christendom. <hi>If he be,</hi> he hath no help but one; he must live a holy and a severe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35126:55"/>
life, which is the onely great calamity which they are commanded to suffer in the Church of <hi>England: but if he be not</hi>; the case is plain, he may by these doctrines take his ease.</p>

                  <p>WE doubt not but they who understand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sequele of these things, will not wonder that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should have a numerous company of Proselytes, made up of such as the beginnings of <hi>Davids</hi> Army were. But that we may undeceive them also, for to their souls we intend charity and relief by this address; we have thought fit to add one conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration more; and that is, that it is not fit that they should trust to this, or any thing of this; not onely because there is no foundation of truth in these new devices, but because even the Roman Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they are pinch'd with an objection, let their hold go, and to escape, do in remarkable measures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their own new building.</p>
                  <p>The case is this. To them who say, that if there were truth in these pretensions, then all these, and the many millions of indulgences more, and the many other wayes of releasing souls out of Purgatory, the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Masses said every day, the power of the Keys so largely imployed, would in a short time have emptied Purgatory of all her sad inhabitants, or it may be, very few would go thither, and they that unfortunately do, cannot stay long; and consequently, besides that this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35126:56"/>
great softness and easiness of procedure would give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to the greatest sinners, and the hopes of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory would destroy the fears of Hell, and the certainty of doing well enough in an imperfect life, would make men carelesse of the more excellent: besides these things, there will need no continuation of pensions to pray for persons dead many years ago: To them, I say who talk to them at this rate; they have enough to answer.</p>
                  <p>Deceive not your selves, there are more things to be reckon'd for than so. For when you have deserved great punishments for great sins, and the guilt is taken off by absolution, and (you suppose) the punishment by indulgences or the satisfaction of others; it may be so, and it may be not so.</p>
                  <p>For 1. It is according as your Indulgence is. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it for fourty years, or it may be a hundred, or a thousand (and that is a great matter;) yet peradventure according to the old penitential rate you have deserved the penance of fourty thousand years; or at least you may have done so; by the more severe account of God. If the penance of fourty years be taken off by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, it does as much of the work as was promised or intended; but you can feel little ease, if still there remains due the penance of threescore thousand years. No man can tell the difference when what remains shall be so great as to surmount all the evils of this life; and the abatement may be accounted by pen and ink, but will signifie little in the perception; it is like the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Devil out of a miserable Demoniack, when there still remains fifty more as bad as he that went away; the man will hardly find how much he is advanced in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:35126:56"/>But 2. You have with much labour, and some charge, purchased to your self so many <hi>Quadragenes</hi> or Lents of pardon; that is, you have bought off the penances of so many times forty dayes. It is well; but were you well advised, it may be your <hi>Quadragenes</hi> are not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi>; that is, are not a quitting the severest penances of fasting so long in bread and water; for there is great difference in the manner of keeping a penitential Lent, and it may be you have purchased but some lighter thing; and then if your demerit arise to so many <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes,</hi> and you purchased but mere <hi>Quadragenes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a minute and table of particulars, you may stay long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Purgatory than you expected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But therefore your best way is to get a <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi>; and that may be had on reasonable terms; but take heed you do not think your self secure; For a <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi> does not do all that, it may be, you require: for there is an Indulgence more full, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most full, and it is not agreed upon among the Doctors, whether a <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi> is to be extended beyond the taking off those penances which were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyn'd by the confessor, or how far they go further.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. But further yet; all Indulgencies are granted upon some inducement, and are not <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> or acts of mere grace without cause; and if the cause be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, they are invalid; and whether the cause be sufficient will be very hard to judge. And if there be for the Indulgence, yet if there be not a reasonable cause for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35126:57"/>
the quantity of the indulgence, you cannot tell how much you get: and the Preachers of indulgences ought not to declare how valid they are assertive, that is, by any confidence, but <hi>opinative,</hi> or <hi>recitative,</hi> they can onely tell what is said, or what is their own opinion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When this difficulty is passed over, yet it may be the person is not capable of them; for if he be not in the state of grace, all is nothing: and if he be, yet if he does not perform the condition of the Indulgence actually, his mere endeavour or good desire is nothing. And when the conditions are actually done, it must be enquired whether in the time of doing them you were in charity; whether you be so at least in the last day of finishing them; it is good to be certain in this, least all evaporate and come to nothing: But yet suppose this too, though the work you are to do as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the indulgence, be done so well that you lose not all the indulgence, yet for every degree of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that work, you will lose apart of the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and then it will be hard to tell whether you get half so much as you propounded to your self. But here Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> troubles the whole affair again:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. Concil. Trident. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 20. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. edit.</hi>
                     </note> for if the indulgence be onely given according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the work done, then that will avail of it self without any grant from the Church; and then it is hugely questionable whether the Popes authority be of any use in this whole matter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But there is yet a greater heap of dangers and uncertainties; for you must be sure of the Authority of him that gives the Indulgence, and in this there are many doubtful questions; but when they are over, yet it is worth inquiry (for some Doctors are fearful in this point) Whether the intromission of Venial sinnes,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35126:57"/>
without which no man lives, does hinder the fruit of the Indulgence, for if it does, all the cost is lost.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When an Indulgence is given, put case, to abide forty dayes on certain conditions; whether these forty dayes are to be taken <hi>collectively</hi> or <hi>distributively</hi>; for, because it is confessed, that the matter of Indulgences is <hi>res odibilis,</hi> a hateful and an odious matter,<note place="margin">

                     </note> it is not to be understood in the sense of favour, but of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est severity, and therefore it is good to know before hand what to trust to, to enquire how the Bull is pen'd, and what sense of Law every word does bear; for it may be any good mans case: If an Indulgence be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a place for so many dayes in <hi>every year,</hi> it were fit you enquire for how many years that will last; for some Doctors say, That if a definite number of years be not set down, it is intended to last but twenty years. And therefore it is good to be wise early.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But it is yet of greater consideration: If you take out a Bull of Indulgence, relating to the Article of Death, in case you recover that sickness in which you thought you should use it, you must consider, whether you must not take out a new one for the next fit of sickness; or will the first, which stood for nothing, keep cold, and without any sensible error serve when you shall indeed dye?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. You must also inquire and be rightly informed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Indulgence granted upon a certain Festival will be valid, if the day be chang'd (as they were all at once, by the Gregorian Calendar) or if you go into another Countrey, where the Feast is not kept the same day, as it happens in moveable Feasts, and on S. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomews</hi> day, and some others.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. When your Lawyers have told you their opinion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35126:58"/>
of all these questions, and given it under their hand, it will concern you to inquire yet further, whether a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Pope have not, or cannot revoke an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted by his Predecessor; for this is often done in matters of favour and priviledges; and the German Princes complained sadly of it;<note place="margin">

                  <p n="11">11. It is worth inquiry, Whether in the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee, all other Indulgences be suspended; for though some think they are not, yet <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Emanuel S à</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they are; and if they chance to say true (for no man knowes whether they do or no) you may be at a loss that way.

                  <p n="12">12. Your Indulgences will be of no avail to you in reserved cases, which are very many. A great many more very fine scruples might be mov'd, and are so; and therefore when you have gotten all the security you can by these, you are not safe at all. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be sure still to get Masses to be said.</p>
                  <p>So that now the great Objection is answered; you need not fear that saying Masses will ever be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, by the multitude of Indulgences: The Priest must still be imployed and entertain'd <hi>in subsidium,</hi> since there are so many ways of making the Indulgence good for nothing: And as for the fear of emptying Purgatory by the free and liberal use of the Keyes, it is very needless; because the Pope cannot evacuate <note n="*" place="margin">

And therefore we cannot but commend the prudence of Cardinal <hi>Albernotius,</hi> who by his last will took order for fifty thousand Masses to be said for his soul; for he was a wise man, and lov'd to make all as sure as he could.</p>

But how easie were it for you now to conclude, that all this is but a meer cozenage, an art to get money? but that's but the least of the evil, it is a certain way to deceive souls. For since there are so many thousands that trust to these things, and yet in the confession of your own Writers, there are so many fallibilities in the whole, and in every part, why will you suffer your selves so weakly and vainly to be cozen'd out of your souls, with promises that signifie nothing, and words without vertue, and treasures that make no man rich, and indulgences that give confidence to sin, but no ease to the pains which follow?</p>

                  <p>We desire that it be considered, how dangerously good life is undermined, by the Propositions colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally taught by their great Doctors, in this matter of Indulgences; besides the main and direct danger and deception.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Venial sins preceding or following the work enjoyn'd for getting Indulgences, hinder not their fruit: But if they intervene in the time of doing them, then they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

                     <hi>He that will obtain indulgence for another, if he does perform the work enjoyn'd, though himself be in deadly sin, yet for the other he prevails:</hi> as if a man could do more for another than he can do for himself; or as if God would regard the prayers of a vile and a wicked person when he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for another, and at the same time, if he prays for himself, his prayer is an abomination. God first is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for our selves, and when we are more excellent persons, admits us to intercede, and we shall prevail for others; but that a wicked person who is under actual guilt, and oblig'd himself to suffer all punishment, can ease and take off the punishment due to others by any external good work done <hi>ungraciously,</hi> is a piece of new Divinity without colour of reason or religion. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this are something less scandalous; and affirm that though it be not necessary that when the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is granted the man should be in the state of grace, yet it is necessary that at some time or other he should be; at any time (it seems) it will serve. For thus they turn Divinity and the care of souls into Mathematicks and Clockwork, and dispute minutes and periods with God, and are careful to tell their people how much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they may take, and how far they may venture, least they should lose any thing of their sins pleasure, which they can possibly enjoy, and yet have hopes of being sav'd at last.</p>

Now since it is sufficiently known, that in all or most of the Indulgences, a clause is sure to be included, that something be offered to the Church, to the Altar, to a Religious House, &amp;c. the consequent of this will be soon seen, that Indulgences are made for the rich, and the Treasures of the Church are to be dispensed to them that have Treasures of their own, for <hi>habenti dabitur.</hi> But then, God help the poor; for them Purgatory is prepar'd, and they must burn: For the Rich it is pretended, but the smell of fire will not pass upon them.</p>
                  <p>From these premises we suppose it but too evident, that the Roman Doctors prevaricate in the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Repentance, which indeed in Christ Jesus is the whole Oeconomy of Justification and Salvation; it is the hopes and staff of all the world, the remedy of all evils past, present, and to come. And if our physick be poyson'd, if our staff be broken, if our hopes make us asham'd, how shall we appear before Christ at his coming?

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Contrition</hi> is sufficient if it be but one little act, and that in the very Article of death; and before that time it is not necessary by the Law of God, nay, it is indeed sufficient; but it is also insufficient, for without confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in act or desire it suffices not. And though it be thus insufficiently sufficient, yet it is not necessary: For
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35126:60"/>
attrition is also sufficient, if a Priest can be had, and then any little grief proceeding out of the fear of Hell will do it, if the Priest do but absolve.</p>

For as for those that come after, they are excus'd, if they be produc'd by a strong habit; and the greater the habit, the less is the sin: But then as the repentance need not for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be hasty and presently; so because it is onely to be of single acts, the repentance it self need not be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, but it may be done in an instant; whereas to mortifie a habit of sinne (which is the true and proper repentance (there is requir'd a longer time, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure in the methods of a holy life. By this, and such like Propositions, and careless Sentences, they have brought it to that pass, that they reckon a single act of Contrition, at any time to be sufficient to take away the wickedness of a long life. Now that this is the avowed Doctrine of the Roman Guides of Souls,<note place="margin">

consequents of it, even the unnecessariness of present repentance, or before the danger of death; of which we have already given accounts. But the reason why we remark it here, is that which we now mentioned, because that by the Doctrine of vitious habits, having in them no malignity or sin but what is in the single prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding acts, there is an excuse made for millions of sins: For if by an evil habit the sinner is not made worse, and more hated by God, and his sinful acts made not onely more, but more criminal; it will follow, that the sins are very much lessened: For they being not so voluntary in their exercise and distinct emanation, are not in present so malicious; and therefore he that hath gotten a habit of drunkenness or swearing, sins less in every act of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness or prophane oath, than he that acts them seldom; because by his habit he is more inclin'd, and his sins are almost natural, and less consider'd, less chosen, and not disputed against; but pass by inadvertency, and an untroubled consent, easily and promptly, and almost naturally from that principle: So that by this means, and in such cases when things are come to this pass, they have gotten an imperfect Warrant to sin a great deal, and a great while, without any new great inconvenience: Which evil state of things ought to be infinitely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Christians that would be saved, by all means; and therefore all such Teachers, and all such Doctrines, are carefully to be declin'd, who give so much easiness, not only to the remedies, but to the sins themselves. But of this, we hope it may be sufficient to have given this short warning.</item>
                        <item>3. The distinction of Mortal and Venial sins, as it is taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a great cause of wickedness, and careless conversation. For although
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35126:63"/>
we do with all the ancient Doctors admit of the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins Mortal and Venial; yet we also teach, That in their own nature, and in the rigor of the Divine Justice, every sin is damnable, and deserves Gods anger, and that in the unregenerate they are so accounted, and that in hell the damned suffer for small and great in a common mass of torment; yet by the Divine mercy and compassion, the smaller sins which come by surprize, or by invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or inadvertency, or unavoidable infirmity, shall not be imputed to those who love God, and delight not in the smallest sin, but use caution and prayers, watchfulness and remedies against them. But if any man delights in small sins, and heaps them into numbers, and by deliberation or licentiousness they grow numerous, or are in any sense chosen or taken in by contempt of the Divine Law, they do put us from the favour of God, and will pass into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere accounts. And though sins are greater or less by comparison to each other, yet the smallest is a burthen too great for us, without the allowances of the Divine mercy.</item>

Many other desperate words are spoken by the Roman Doctors in this Question, which we love not to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, because the main thing is acknowledged by them all.</p>
                  <p>But now we appeal to the reason and Consciences of all men, Whether this Doctrine of sins Venial in their own nature, be not greatly destructive to a holy life? When it is plain, that they give rest to mens Consciences for one whole kinde of sins; for such, which because they occur every day, in a very short time (if they be not interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the grace of Repentance) will swell to a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heap. But concerning these we are bidden to be quiet; for we are told, that all the heaps of these in the world cannot put us out of Gods favour. Adde to this, that it being in thousands of cases, impossible to tell which are, and which are not Venial in their own nature, and in their appendant circumstances, either the people are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen'd by this Doctrine into an useless confidence; and for all this talking in their Schools, they must nevertheless do to Venial sins as they do to Mortal, that is, mortifie them, fight against them, repent speedily of them, and keep them from running into mischief; and then all their kinde Doctrines in this Article, signifie no comfort or ease but all danger and difficulty, and useless dispute 3 or else, if really they mean, that this easiness of opinion be made use of, then the danger is imminent, and carelesness is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd, and licentiousness in all little things is easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd; and mens souls are daylie lessen'd without repair, and kept from growing towards Christian perfection, and from <hi>destroying the whole body of sin</hi>; and in short, <hi>despising little things, they perish by little and little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine also is worse yet in the handling. For it hath infinite influence to the disparagement of holy life, not onely by the uncertain, but as it must frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35126:64"/>
by the false determination of innumerable cases of Conscience. For it is a great matter both in the doing and the thing done, both in the caution and the repentance, whether such an action be a venial or a mortal sin. If it chance to be mortal, and pour Confessor says it is venial, your soul is betrayed. And it is but a chance what they say in most cases; for they call what they please venial; and they have no certain rule to answer by; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears too sadly in their innumerable differences which is amongst all their Casuists, in saying what is, and what is not mortal; and of this there needs no greater proof than the reading the little Summaries made by their most leading guides of Consciences, <hi>Navar, Cajetane, Tolet, Emanuel Sà,</hi> and others; where one sayes such a thing is mortal, and two say it is venial.</p>
                  <p>And lest any man should say or think, this is no great matter, we desire that it be considered, that in venial sins there may be very much fantastick pleasure, and they that retain them do believe so; for they suppose the pleasure is great enough to outweigh the intolerable pains of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and that it is more eligible to be in Hell a while, than to cross their appetites in such small things.

                     </note> The opinion of any one grave Doctor is sufficient to make a matter proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nay, the example and practise of good men, that is, men who are so reputed; if they have done it, you may do so too, and be safe. This is the great Rule of their Cases of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>And now we ought not to be press'd with any ones saying, that such an opinion is but the private opinion of one or more of their Doctors. For although in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith this be not sufficient, to impute a Doctrine to a whole Church, which is but the private opinion of one or more; yet because we are now speaking of the infinite danger of souls in that communion, and the horrid Propositions by which their Disciples are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, to the disparagement of good life, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to alledge the publick and allowed sayings of their Doctors; because these sayings are their Rule of living: and because the particular Rules of Conscience, use
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35126:65"/>
not to be Decreed in Councils, we must derive them from the places where they grow, and where they are to be found.</p>
                  <p>But besides, you will say, That this is but the private opinion of some Doctors; and what then? Therefore it is not to be called the Doctrine of the Roman Church. True, we do not say, <hi>It is an Article of their Faith,</hi> but, <hi>a rule of manners</hi>: This is not indeed in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Decree; but we say, that although it be not, yet neither is the contrary. And if it be but a private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet, is it safe to follow it, or is it not safe? For that's the question, and therein is the danger. If it be safe, then this is their Rule, <hi>A private opinion of any one grave Doctor, may be safely followed in the questions of Vertue and Vice.</hi> But if it be not safe to follow it, and that this does not make an opinion probable, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise safe; Who sayes so? Does the Church? No; Does Dr. <hi>Cajus,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Sempronius</hi> say so? Yes: But these are not safe to follow; for they are but private Doctors: Or if it be safe to follow them, though they be no more, and the opinion no more but probable, then I may take the other side, and choose which I will, and do what I list in most cases, and yet be safe by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roman Casuists; which is the great line, and general measure of most mens lives; and that is it which we complain of. And we have reason; for they suffer their Casuists to determine all cases, severely and gently, strictly and loosly; that so they may entertain all spirits, and please all dispositions, and govern them by their own inclinations, and as they list to be governed; by what may please them, not by that which profits them; that none may go away scandaliz'd or griev'd from their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential chairs.</p>

By the Doctrine of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility here is his Warranty. And though the Church do not declare that Doctrine; that is, the Church doth not make it certain in Speculation, yet it may be safely done in practise: Here is enough to give peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to him that does it. Nay, if the contrary be more safe, yet if the other be but probable by reason or Authority, you may do the less safe, and refuse what is more.

                  <p>These opinions are indeed very strange to us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but no strangers in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and because they are taught by great Doctors, by Popes themselves, by Cardinals, and the Canon Law respectively, do at least become very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and therefore they may be believ'd and practis'd without danger; according to the Doctrine of <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And thus the most desperate things that ever were said by any, though before the declaration of the Church they cannot become Articles of Faith, yet besides that they are Doctrines publickly allowed, they can also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rules of practise, and securities to the conscience of their Disciples.</p>
                  <p>To this we may adde, that which is usual in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>praxis Ecclesiae</hi>; the practise of the Church. Thus if an Indulgence be granted upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to visit such an Altar in a distant Church; the Nuns that are shut up, and Prisoners that cannot go abroad, if they address themselves to an Altar of their own with that intention, they shall obtain the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:35126:68"/>
The practise of the Church in this case, gives first a probability in Speculation, and then a certainty in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. This instance, though it be of no concern, yet we use it as a particular, to shew the principle upon which they go. But it is practicable in many things of greatest danger and concern. If the question be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull to worship the Image of the Cross, or of Christ with Divine Worship? first, there is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> for it, and <hi>Vasquez,</hi> and many others; therefore it is probable, and therefore is safe in practise; <hi>&amp; sic est Ecclesiae praxis,</hi> the Church also practises so;<note place="margin">3. <hi>Part. qu.</hi> 25. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>Vide etiam Pontif. cap. de benedictione no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae crucis, fol.</hi> 163.</note> as appears in their own Offices, and S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> makes this use of it. <hi>Illi exhibemus cultum Latriae in quo ponimus spem salutis: sed in cruce Christi ponimus spem salutis.

Ergo Crux Christi est adoranda adoratione La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae.</hi> We give Divine Worship (says he) to that in which we put our hopes of salvation; but in the Cross we put our hopes of salvation; for so the Church sings (it is the practise of the Church) <hi>Hail, O Cross, our onely hope in this time of suffering; encrease righteousness to the godly, and give pardon to the guilty</hi>; therefore the Cross of Christ is to be ador'd with Divine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>By this Principle you may embrace any opinion of their Doctors safely, especially if the practise of the Church do intervene, and you need not trouble your self with any further inquiry: And if an evil custom get amongst men, that very custom shall legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the action, if any of their grave Doctors allow it, or good men use it; and Christ is not your Rule, but the examples of them that live with you, or are in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35126:68"/>
your eye and observation, that's your rule. We hope we shall not need to say any more in this affair: The pointing out this rock may be warning enough to them that would not suffer shipwrack, to decline the danger that looks so formidably.</p>

                  <p>AS these evil Doctrines have general influence into evil life; so there are some others, which if they be pursued to their proper and natural issues; that is, if. they believ'd and practis'd, are enemies to the particular and specifick parts of Piety and Religion. Thus the very prayers of the Faithful are, or may be spoil'd by Doctrines publickly allowed, and prevailing in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</p>
                  <p>For 1. They teach, <hi>That prayers themselves</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>or by the natural work it self, do prevail: For it is not essential to prayer for a man to think particularly of what he sayes; it is not necessary to think of the things sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the words:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

But this is indeed their publick Doctrine: For prayers in the mouth of the man that says them, <hi>are like the words of a Charmer, they prevail even when they are not understood,</hi> sayes <hi>Salmeron:</hi> or as <hi>Antoninus, They are like a precious stone,</hi>

But</hi> 2. <hi>There is an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is by understanding the sense; and that is not necessary: For if it were, very extremely few would do their duty, when so very few do at all understand what they say.</hi> 3. <hi>There is an attention relating to the end of prayer, that is, that he that prays, considers that he is present before God, and speaks to him; and this indeed is very profitable, but it is not necessary:</hi> No, not <hi>so much.</hi> So that by this Doctrine no attention is necessary, but to attend that the words be all said, and said right. But even this <hi>attention is not necessary, that it should be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but it suffices to be virtual, that is, that he who says his office, intends to do so, and do not change his minde, although he does not attend: And he who does not change his minde, that is, unless observing himself not to attend, he still turn his minde to other things, he attends</hi>; meaning, he attends sufficiently, and as much as is necessary; though indeed speaking naturally and truly, he does not attend. If any man in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> had published such Doctrine as this, he should quickly and deservedly have felt the severity of the Ecclesiastical Rod. But in <hi>Rome</hi> it goes for good Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now although upon this account, <hi>Devotion</hi> is (it may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35126:69"/>

                  <p>Well! But after all this, if Devotion be necessary or not, if it be present or not, if the minde wander, or wander not, if you minde what you pray, or minde it not, there is an easie cure for all this: for Pope <hi>Leo</hi> granted remission of all negligences in their saying their offices and prayers to them, who after they have done, shall say this prayer, [<hi>To the Holy and Vndivided Trinity; To the Humanity of our Lord Iesus Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; To the fruitfulness of the most Blessed, and most Glorius Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and to the Vniversity of all Saints, be Eternal praise, honour, vertue and glory, from every Creature; and to us remission of sins for ever and ever. Amen. Blessed are the Bowels of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>which bore the Son of the Eternal God; and blessed are the Paps which suckled Christ our Lord:</hi> Pater noster. Ave Maria.] This prayer, to this purpose, is set down by <hi>Navar,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Tolet.</hi>

                  <p>This is the sum of the Doctrine, concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of saying the Divine offices in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which greater care is taken to obey the Precept of the Church, than the Commandments of God: [<hi>For
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35126:70"/>
the Precept of hearing Mass is not, to intend the words, but to be present at the Sacrifice, though the words be not so much as heard, and they that think the contrary, think so without any probable reason,</hi>] saith <hi>Tolet.</hi>

                        <hi>Ibid. n</hi> 6.</note> It seems there was not so much as the Authority of one grave Doctor to the contrary; for if there had, the contrary opinion might have been probable; but all agree upon this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, all that are considerable.</p>
                  <p>So that between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the difference in this Article is plainly this, They pray with their lips, we with the heart; we pray with the understanding, they with the voice; <hi>we pray, and they say prayers.</hi> We suppose that we do not please God, if our hearts be absent; they say, it is enough if their bodies be present at their greatest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of prayer, though they hear nothing that is spoken, and understand as little. And which of these be the better way of serving God, may soon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, if we remember the complaint which God made of the Jews, <hi>This people draweth near me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me:</hi> But we know, that we are commanded to <hi>ask in faith,</hi> which is seated in the understanding, and requires the concurrence of the will, and holy desires; which cannot be at all, but in the same degree in which we have a knowledge of what we ask. <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man prevails:</hi> But what our prayers want of this, they must needs want of blessing and prosperity. And if we lose the benefit of our prayers, we lose that great instrumentality by which Christians are receptive of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and strengthned in faith, and confirm'd in hope, and increase in charity, and are protected by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are comforted in their sorrows, and derive
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35126:70"/>
help from God: <hi>Ye ask, and have not, because ye ask amiss</hi>; that is S. <hi>Iames</hi> his rule. They that pray not as they ought, shall never obtain what they fain would.</p>
                  <p>Hither is to be reduc'd, their fond manner of prayer, consisting in vain repetitions of Names, and little forms of words. The Psalter of our Lady, is an hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and at the end of every tenth, they drop in the Lords Prayer, and this with the Creed at the end of the fifty, makes a perfect Rosary. This indeed is the main entertainment of the peoples Devotion; for which cause <hi>Mantuan</hi> call'd their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

A Religion that numbers their murmurs by berries fil'd upon a string: This makes up so great a part of their Religion, that it may well be taken for one half of its definition. But because so few do understand what they say, but all repeat, and stick to their numbers, it is evident they think to be heard for that. For that or nothing; for besides that, they neither <hi>do</hi> nor <hi>understand</hi>: And all that we shall now say to it is, That our Blessed Saviour reprov'd this way of Devotion, in the Practise and Doctrines of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Very like to which is that which they call the <hi>Psalter of Iesus</hi>; in which are fifteen short Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as [<hi>Have mercy on me * Strengthen me, * Help me, * Comfort me, &amp;c.</hi>] and with every one of these, the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is to be said thirty times, that is in all, four hundred and fifty times.

It were strange if nothing but intercession by these Saints were

intended, that they cannot as well pray for other things as these; or that they have no Commission to ask of these any thing else, or not so confidently; and that if they do ask, that S. <hi>Otiliae</hi> shall not as much prevail to help a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as a Cataract; or that if S. <hi>Sebastian</hi> be called upon to pray for the help of a poor female sinner, who by sad diseases payes the price of her lust, he must go to S. <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris</hi> in behalf of his Client.</p>
                  <p>But if any of the Roman Doctors say, that they are not tyed to defend the Superstitions of the Vulgar, or the abused: They say true, they are not indeed; but rather to reprove them, as we do, and to declare against them; and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> very goodly forbids all Superstitions in this Article; but yet tells us not what are Superstitions, and what not; and still the world goes on in the practise of the same intolerable follies; and every Nation hath a particular Guardian-Saint, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City, every Family, and almost every House, and every Devouter person almost chuses his own Patron-Saint, whose Altars they more devoutly frequent, whose Image they more religiously worship, to whose Reliques they more readily go in Pilgrimage, to whose honour they say more <hi>Pater-nosters,</hi> whose Festival they more solemnly observe; spoiling their prayers, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences in unknown persons, living in an unknown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and diminishing that affiance in God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, by importune and frequent addresses to them that cannot help.</p>

                     </note> or the worst forms; for such as these are very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as is to be seen in their Breviaries, Missals, Hours of our Lady, Rosary of our Lady, the Letany of our Lady, called <hi>Litania Mariae,</hi> the <hi>Speculum Rosariorum,</hi> the Hymns of Saints, Portuises and Manuals. These on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the instances, which amongst many others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently occurr. Two things onely we shall add, instead of many more that might be represented.</p>
                  <p>The first is, That in a Hymn which they (from what reason or Etymology we know not, neither are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) call a <hi>Sequence,</hi> the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> did
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35126:75"/>
invocate the B. Virgin in the same manner as Councils did use to invocate the Holy Ghost; They call her the <hi>Mother Grace, the remedy to the miserable, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of mercy, and the light of the Church</hi>; attributes proper to God and incommunicable; <hi>they sing her praises, and pray to her for graces, they sing to her with the heart, they call themselves her sons, they declare her to be their health and comfort in all doubts, and call on her for light from Heaven and trust in her for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Heresies, and the repression of Schisms, and for the lasting Confederations of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other thing we tell of, is, That there is a Psalter of our Lady, of great and ancient account in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; it hath been several times printed, at <hi>Venice,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Leipsich</hi>; and the title is, [The Psalter of the Blessed Virgin, compil'd by the Seraphical Doctor S. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alba,</hi> and Presbyter Cardinal of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] But of the Book it self, the account is soon made; for it is nothing but the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> an hundred and fifty in number are set down; alter'd indeed, to make as much of it as could be sense so reduc'd: In which the name of <hi>Lord</hi> is left out, and that of <hi>Lady</hi> put in; so that whatever <hi>David</hi> said of God and Christ, the same prayers, and the same praises they say of the B. Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and whether all that can be said without intolerable blasphemy, we suppose needs not much disputation.</p>
                  <p>The same things, but in a less proportion and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, they say to other Saints.</p>

                  <p>Their manner and form is this,</p>
                  <p>First, They are to try the Devil by Holy Water, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, Sulphur, Rue, which from thence, as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, came to be called <hi>Herb of Grace,</hi> and especially S. <hi>Iohns</hi> wort, which therefore they call <hi>Devils flight</hi>;<note place="margin">

                     </note> and this was well tried of old against an Empuse that met <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> at Mount <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus,</hi> against whom he rail'd and exhorted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to do so.</p>
                  <p>Next to this, the Exorcist may ask the Devil some
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35126:78"/>
questions? What is his name? How many of them there are? For what cause, and at what time he entred? and, for his own learning, by what persons he can be cast out? and by what Saint adjur'd who are his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enemies in Heaven? and who in Hell? by what words he can be most afflicted? (for the Devils are such fools that they cannot keep their own counsel, nor choose but tell, and when they do they alwaies tell true:) He may also ask him, by what Covenant, or what Charm he came there, and by what he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased? Then he may call <hi>Lucifer</hi> to help him, and to torment that Spirit (for so <hi>they cast out Devils, by Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the Prince of the Devils</hi>;) and certainly <hi>Lucifer</hi> dares not but obey him. Next to this, the Exorcist is cuningly to get out of the Devil, the confession of some Article of Faith, for the edefication of the standers by (whom he may by this means convince of the truth of Transubstantiation, the reality of purgatory, or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Indulgences) and command him to knock his head three times against the ground, in adoration of the Holy Trinity. But let him take heed what Reliques he apply to the Devil; for if the Reliques by counterfeit, the Devil will be to hard for him. However, let the Exorcising Priest be sure to bless his pottage, his meat, his ointment, his herbs; and then also he may use some Schedules, or little rolls of paper, containing in them holy words; but he must be sure to be exercis'd and skilful in all things that belong to the conjuring of the Deuil: These are the preparatory documents, which when he hath observ'd, then let him fall to his prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now for the prayers, they also are publickly describ'd in their Offices before cited; and are as followeth,</p>

                     <hi>The Priest ties his stole about the neck of the possessed with three knots, and says, O ye abominable Rebels against God, I conjure you Spirits, and adjure you, I call, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain I call out, I contend and contest, where ever you are in this Man, by the Father, Son and Holy Ghost [then he makes three †] by the most powerful name of God, Hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he makes two and thirty crosses more, and calls over one and thirty names of God in false Hebrew, and base Greek, and some Latine, signifying the same names; and the two and thirtieth is by the sign of the Cross, praying God to deliver them from their enemies. Then follow more prayers, and more adjurations, and more conjurations for they are greatly different you must know) and aspersions of holy water, and shewings of the Cross, and signings with it. Then they adjure the Devil (in case the names of God will not do it) by S.</hi> Mary, <hi>and S.</hi> Anne, <hi>by S.</hi> Michael, <hi>and S.</hi> Gabriel, <hi>by</hi> Raphael, <hi>and all Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, by the Partriachs, and by the Prophets, and by his own infirmity, by the Apostles, and by the Martyrs</hi>; [and then after all this, if the Devil will not come out, he must tarry there still, till the next Exorcism; in which] <hi>The Exorcist must rail at the Devil, and say over again the names of God, and then ask him questions, and read over the sequences of the Gospels; and after that tell him, that he hath power over him, for he can transubstantiate bread into Christs body; and then conjure him again, and call him damn'd Devil, unclean Spirit, and as bad as he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35126:79"/>
can call him; and so pray to God to cast him out of the mans mouth and nose, lips and teeth, jaws and cheeks, eyes and forehead, eye-brows, and eye-lids, his feet, and his members, his marrow, and his bones, and must reckon every part of his body</hi> [to which purpose, we suppose it would be well if the Exorcist were well skill'd in <hi>Laurentius,</hi> or <hi>Bautunus</hi> his Anatomy.] <hi>And if he will not go out yet, there is no help but he must choose, till the third Exorcism: in which, besides many prayers and conjurations in other words to the same purpose, the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cist must speak louder</hi> [especially if it be a deaf Devil, for then indeed it is the more necessary] <hi>and tell the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil his own, and threaten him terribly, and conjure him again, and say over him about some twenty or thirty names or titles of Christ, and forbid the Devil to go any whither, but to the center of the world, and must damn him eternally to the Sulphurous flames of Hell, and to be tormented worse then</hi> Lucifer <hi>himself, for his daring to resist so many great Names; and if he will not now obey, let him take fire and brimstone, and make a fume, whether the possessed will or no, untill the Devil tells you all his minde in what you ask him</hi>: [the liver of <hi>Tobias</hi> his fish were a rare thing here, but that's not to be had for love or money:] <hi>And after this he conjures him again by some of the names of God, and by the Merits, and all the good things which can be spoken or thought of the Most Blessed Virgin, and by all her names and titles, which he must reckon, one and forty in number, together with her Epithets, making so many Crosses, and by these he must cast him headlong into Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Devil be stubborn (for some of them are very disobedient) there is a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth Exorcism, <hi>and then he conjures the earth, the water,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35126:80"/>
and the fire to make them of his party, and commands them not to harbour such villainous Spirits, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Hell to hear him, and obey his word, and conjures at the Spirits in Hell to take that Spirit to themselves</hi> (for it may be they will understand their duty better than that stubborn Devil, that is broke loose from thence.) But if this chance to fail, there is yet left a remedy that will do it. <hi>He must make the picture of the Devil, and write his name over the head of it and conjure the fire to burn it most horribly and hastily</hi>; [and if the picture be upon wood or paper, it is ten to one that may be done.] After all this stir, <hi>Sprinkle more holy water, and take</hi> Sulphur, Galbanum, Assa foetida, Aristolochia, Rue, S. Johns wort; <hi>all which being distinctly blessed, the Exorcist must hold the Devils picture over the fire, and adjure the Devil to hear him; and then he must not spare him, but tell him all his faults, and give him all his names, and</hi> Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <hi>him, and curse not onely him, but</hi> Lucifer <hi>too, and</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>and</hi> Satan, <hi>and</hi> Astaroth, <hi>and</hi> Behemot, <hi>and</hi> Beherit, <hi>and all together</hi>; [for indeed there is not one good natur'd Devil amongst them all;] <hi>and then pray once more, and so throw the Devils picture into the fire, &amp; then insult in a long form of crowing over him, which is there set down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now after all, if he will not go out, there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Exorcism for him with new Ceremonies. <hi>He must shew him the consecrated Host in the pixe, pointing at it with his finger, and then conjure him again, and rail at him once more; to which purpose, there is a very fine form taken out of</hi> Prierius, <hi>and set down in the</hi> Flagellum Daemonum; <hi>and then let the Exorcist pronounce sentence against the Devil, and give him his oath, and then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to go out of the several parts of his body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35126:80"/>
taking care that at no hand he remain in the upper parts</hi>; and then is the Devils Qu. to come out, if he have a minde to it (for that must be always suppos'd) and then follows the thanksgivings.</p>
                  <p>This is the manner of their devotion, describ'd for the use of their Exorcists; in which is such a heap of folly, madness, superstition, blasphemy, and ridiculous guises and playings with the Devil, that if any man amongst us should use such things, he would be in danger of being tried at the next Assizes for a Witch or a Conjurer; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, certain it is, what ever the Devil looses by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to obey the Exorcist, he gains more by this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debauchery of Christianity. There needs no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, the impiety is visible and tangible; and it is sufficient to have told the story.</p>
                  <p>Onely this we say, as to the thing it self.</p>
                  <p>The casting out of Devils is a miraculous power, and given at first for the confirmation of Christian Faith, as the gifts of Tongues and Healing were, and therefore we have reason to believe, that because it is not an ordinary power, the ordinary Exorcisms cast out no more Devils, than Extreme Unction cures sicknesses.

                  <p>But yet from what principle it comes, that they have made <hi>Exorcists</hi> an Ecclesiastical Order, with special words and instruments of collation; and that the words of Ordination giving them power onely over possessed Christians, Catechumens or Baptized, should by them be extended and exercis'd upon all Infants, as if they were all possessed by the Devil; and not onely so, but to bewitched Cattel; to Mice and Locusts, to Milk and Lettice, to Houses and Tempests; as if their Charms were <hi>Prophilactick,</hi> as well as <hi>Therapeutick</hi>; and could keep, as well as drive the Devil out, and prevent storms like the old <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>TO put our trust and confidence in God onely, and to use Ministeries of his own appointment and sanctification, is so essential a duty owing by us to God, that whoever trusts in any thing but God, is a breaker of the first commandement; and he that invents instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal supports of his own head, and puts a subordinate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial confidence in them, usurps the rights of God, and does not pursue the interests of true Religion, whose very essence and formality is to glorify God in all his attributes and to do good to man, and to advance the honour and Kingdome of Christ.

                  <p>Neither can this be eluded by saying, that though the same Worship be given to the Image of Christ, as to Christ himself, yet it is not done in the same way; for it is <hi>terminatively</hi> to Christ or God, but <hi>relatively</hi> to the Image, that is, to the Image for God's or Christ's sake. For this is that we complain of, that they give the same worship to an image, which is due to God; for what cause soever it be done, it matters not, save onely that the excuse makes it in some sense, the worse for the Apology. For to do a thing which God hath forbidden, and to say it is done for God's sake, is to say, that for his sake we displease him; for his sake we give that to a Creature, which is God's own propriety. But besides this, we affirm, and it is of it self evident, that whoever, Christian or Heathen, worships the image
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35126:83"/>
of any thing, cannot possibly worship that image <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively,</hi> for the very being of an image is <hi>relative</hi>; and therefore if the man understands but common sense, he must suppose and intend that worship to be relative, and a Heathen could not worship an image with any other worship; and the second Commandment, forbidding to worship the <hi>likeness of any thing in Heaven and earth,</hi> does onely forbid that thing which is in Heaven to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by an image, that is, it forbids onely a relative worship: For it is a contradiction to say, this is the image of God, and yet this is God; and therefore it must be also a contradiction, to worship an image with Divine worship <hi>terminatively,</hi> for then it must be that the image of a thing, is that thing whose image it is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Doctors teach the same thing which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in the Heathens.</p>
                  <p>But they go yet a little further: <hi>The Image of the Cross</hi> they worship with Divine honour; and therefore although this Divine worship is but relative, yet conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the <hi>Cross it self</hi> is worshipped <hi>terminatively</hi> by Divine adoration. For the Image of the Cross hath it relatively, and for the Crosses sake, therefore the Cross it self is the proper and full object of the Divine adoration. Now that they do and teach this, we charge upon them by undeniable Records: For in the very Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical published by the Authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. these words are found, <hi>The Legats Cross must be on the right hand, because</hi> Latria, <hi>or Divine honour is due to it.</hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35126:83"/>
Trinity, and of Christ, and of the Cross, are to be adored with the worship of</hi> Latria; that is, Divine. Now if the Image of the Cross be the intermedial, then the Cross it self, whose Image that is, must be the last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Divine worship; and if this be not Idolatry, it can never be told, what is the notion of the Word. But this passes also into other real effects: And well may the Cross it self be worshipped by Divine worship, when the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross; for so she does, says <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and makes one the argument of the other, and proves that the Church places her hopes of salvation on the Cross, that is, on the instrument of Christs Passion, by a hymn which she uses in her Offices; but this thing we have remark'd above, upon another occasion. Now although things are brought to a very ill state, when Christians are so probably and apparently charg'd with Idolatry, and that the excuses are too fine to be understood by them that need them; yet no excuse can acquit these things, when the most that is, or can be said is this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that which is Gods due, is given to a Creature, yet it is given with some difference of intention, and Metaphysical abstraction and separation; especially, since, if there can be Idolatry in the worshipping of an Image, it is certain, that a relative Divine worship is this Idolatry; for no mau that worships an Image (in that consideration or formality) can make the Image the last object: Either therefore the Heathens were not Idolaters, in the worshipping of an Image, or else these m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:35126:84"/>The same also is the case in their worshipping the consecrated Bread and Wine: Of which how far they will be excused before God by their ignorant preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and suppositions, we know not; but they hope to save themselves harmless by saying, that they believe the Bread to be their Saviour, and that if they did not believe so, they would not do so. We believe that they say true; but we are afraid that this will no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, then it will excuse those who worship the Sun and Moon, and the Queen of Heaven, whom they would not worship, if they did not believe to have Divinity in them: And it may be observed, That they are very fond of that persuasion, by which they are led into this worship. The error might be some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, if it were probable, or if there were much tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it: But when they choose this persuasion, and have nothing for it but a tropical expression of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which rather than not believe in the natural, useless, and impossible sense, they will defie all their own reason, and four of the five operations of their soul, Seeing, Smelling, Tasting and Feeling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the plain Doctrine of the Ancient Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can consent to believe this error, that Bread is changed into God, and the Priest can make his Maker: We have too much cause to fear, that the error is too gross to admit an excuse; and it is hard to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it invincible and involuntary, because it is so hard, and so untempting, and so unnatural to admit the error. We do desire that God may finde an excuse for it, and that they would not. But this we are most sure of, that they might, if they pleas'd, finde many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, or rather just causes for not giving Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Consecrated Elements; because there are

                  <p>AND now we shall plainly represent to our charges, how this whole matter stands. The case is this, The Religion of a Christian consists in Faith and Hope, Repentance and Charity, Divine Worship and Celebration of the Sacraments, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in keeping the Commandments of God. Now in all these, both in Doctrines and practices, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does dangerously erre, and teaches men so to do:</p>
                  <p>They do injury to Faith, by creating new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and enjoyning them as of necessity to salvation. * They spoil their hope, by placing it upon Creatures, and devices of their own. * They greatly sin against Charity, by damning all that are not of their opinion, in things false or uncertain, right or wrong. * They break in pieces the salutary Doctrine of Repentance, making it to be consistent with a wicked life, and little or no amendment. * They Worship they know not what, and pray to them that hear them not, and trust on that which helps them not. * And as for the Commandments, they leave one of them out of their Catechisms and Manuals, and while they contend earnestly against some Opponents for the possibility of keeping them all, they do not insist upon the necessity of keeping any in the course of their lives, till the danger or article of their death. * And concerning the Sacraments, they have egregiously prevaricated in two points. For not to mention their reckoning of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35126:85"/>
seven Sacraments, which we only reckon to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, and un-Scholastical Errour; they take the one half of the Principal away from the Laity; and they institute little Sacraments of their own, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Rites, and annex Spiritual Graces to them, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they please themselves, of their own heads, without a Divine Warrant or Institution: and, * At last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade their people to that which can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, at least, from Material Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>If these things can consist with the duty of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not only to eat what they worship, but to adore those things with Divine Worship, which are not God: To reconcile a wicked life with certain hopes and expectations of Heaven at last, and to place these hopes upon other things than God, and to damn all the world that are not Christians at this rate, then we have lost the true measures of Christianity; and the Doctrine and Discipline of Christ is not a Natural and Rational Religion; not a Religion that makes men holy, but a Confederacy under the conduct of a Sect, and it must rest in Forms and Ceremonies, and Devices of Mans Invention. And although we do not doubt, but that the goodness of God does so prevail over all the follies and malice of mankind, that there are in the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion many very good Christians; yet they are not such as they are Papists, but by some thing that is higher, and before that, something that is of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract and more sublime consideration. And though the good people amongst them are what they are by the grace and goodness of God, yet by all or any of these Opinions they are not so: But the very best suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diminution and allay by these things, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are wholly subverted and destroyed.</p>

But if the matter be great, yet to prevent a great trouble to your self, you may conceal a truth, by saying that which is false; according to the general Doctrine of the late Casuists.

to a Spouse to break his or her Vow and Promise; and to Children to disobey their Parents, and perhaps to break their Mothers heart, or to undo a Family. No words can bind your Faith, because you can be dispenc'd with; and if you swear you will not procure a Dispensation, you can as well be dispenc'd with for that Perjury as the other; and you cannot be tied so fast, but the Pope can unloose you.

                  <p>THe last thing we shall remark for the instruction and caution of our charges, is not the least. The Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are great Enemies to the dignity and security, to the powers and lives of Princes: And this we shall briefly prove, by setting down the Doctrines themselves, and their consequent Practises.</p>
                  <p>And here we observe, that not onely the whole Order of Jesuites is a great Enemy to Monarchy, by subjecting the Dignity of Princes to the Pope, by making the Pope the Supreme Monarch of Christians; but they also teach, that it is a Catholick Doctrine, the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Pope hath a Supreme Power of disposing the Temporal things of all Christians,<note place="margin">

But because this Book was order'd to be purg'd (<hi>una litura potest</hi>) we shall not insist upon it; but there is as bad which was never censur'd. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes, that the Ecclesiastical Republick can command and compel the Temporal,<note place="margin">

And what then? The execution belongs to others.</hi>] This is the way of the Popes, <hi>thus wisely</hi> and <hi>moderately</hi> to break Kings in pieces.</p>
                  <p>We delight not to aggravate evill things. We therefore forbear to set down those horrid things spoken by <hi>Sà, Mariana, Santarel, Carolus Scribanius,</hi> and some others.<note place="margin">

And if it be objected, That we are commanded <hi>to obey Kings, not to speak evill of them, not to curse them, no, not in our heart</hi>; there is a way found out to answer these little things. For though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle commands, that we should be subject to higher Powers, and obey Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: It is true, you must, and so you may well enough for all this; for the Pope can make that he who is a King, shall be no King, and then you are dis-oblig'd:<note place="margin">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35126:93"/>
kill the Prince; yet if the Pope commands you, it is no sin. <hi>For if the Pope should err by commanding sin, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vertues, yet the Church were bound to believe, that the vices were good, and the vertues evil, unless She would</hi> sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Her Conscience:<note place="margin">

                  <p>But they add more particulars of the same bran. <hi>The Sons of an Heretical Father are made</hi> sui juris, <hi>that is, free from their Fathers power: A Catholick Wife is not tyed to pay her duty to an Heretical Husband; and the Servants are not bound to do service to such Masters</hi>: These are the Doctrines of their great <hi>Azorius</hi>; and as for Kings, he affirms, they may be Depos'd for Heresie: But all this is only in the case of Heretical Princes. But what for others?</p>
                  <p>Even the Roman Catholick Princes are not free from this danger. All the World knows what the Pope did to King <hi>Chilperick</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> He Depos'd him, and put <hi>Pipin</hi> in his place; and did what he could to have put <hi>Albert</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Throne of <hi>Philip,</hi> sir-named the <hi>Fair.</hi> They were the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> who arm'd the Son against the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the Son fought against him, took him Prisoner, shav'd him, and thrust him into a Monastery, where he dyed with grief and hunger.

                     </note> and <hi>Eudaemon Iohannes</hi> sayes, That without question it is a Heresie in the judgement of all Catholicks. Now in such things which are not in their Creeds, and publick Confessions, from whence should we know the Doctrines of their Church, but from their chiefest and most leading Doctors; who, it is certain, would fain have all the World believe it to be the Doctrine of their Church? And therefore as it is certain, that any Roman Catholick may with allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be of this opinion; so he will be esteemed the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more zealous Catholick if he be; and if it were not for fear of Princes, who will not lose their Crowns for their foolish Doctrines, there is no peradventure but it would be declared to be <hi>defide,</hi> a matter of faith, as divers of them of late do not stick to say. And of this the Pope gives but too much evidence, since he will not take away the scandal, which is so greatly given to all Christian Kings and Republicks, by a publick and a just condemnation of it. Nay, it is worse than thus; for <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> upon the <hi>XI</hi> of <hi>September, A. D.</hi> 1589. in an Oration in a Conclave of Cardinals, did solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend the Monk that kill'd <hi>Henry</hi> the III. of <hi>France.</hi> The Oration was printed at <hi>Paris</hi> by them that had rebell'd against that Prince, and avouched for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick by <hi>Bouncher, Decreil,</hi> and <hi>Ancelein</hi>: And though some would fain have it thought to be none of his; yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dares not deny it,<note place="margin">

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:35126:95"/>Now concerning this Article, it will not be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to declare the Sentence of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> because it is notorious to all the World; and is expresly oppos'd against this Roman Doctrine, by Laws, Articles, Confessions, Homilies, the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, the Book of <hi>Christian Institution,</hi> and the many excellent Writings of King <hi>Iames</hi> of Blessed Memory, of our Bishops and other Learned Persons against <hi>Bellarmine, Parsons, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon Iohannes, Creswel,</hi> and others: And nothing is more notorious, than that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is most dutiful, most zealous for the right of Kings; and within these four and twenty years, She hath had many Martyrs, and very, very many Confessors in this Cause.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does recriminate in this point, and charges some <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> with Doctrines which indeed they borrowed from <hi>Rome,</hi> using their Arguments, making use of their Expressions, and pursuing their Principles. But with them in this Article we have nothing to do, but to reprove the Men, and condemn their Doctrine, as we have done all along, by private Writings, and publick Instruments.</p>
                  <p>We conclude these our Reproofs with an Exhoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our respective Charges, to all that desire to be sav'd <hi>in the day of the Lord Iesus</hi>; that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from these horrid Doctrines, which in their birth are new, in their growth are scandalous, in their proper consequents are infinitely dangerous to their Souls, and <hi>hunt for their precious life</hi>: But therefore it is highly fit, that they also should perceive their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35126:96"/>
own advantages, and give God praise, that they are immur'd from such infinite dangers, by the Holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Holy Faith taught and commanded in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; in which <hi>the Word of God</hi> is set before them as <hi>a Lanthorn to their feet, and a Light unto their eyes</hi>; and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are fully admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred according to Christs Institution; and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is preach'd according to the measures of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> is propounded according to the Rule of the Apostles, and the measures of the Churches Apostolical; and <hi>Obedience to Kings</hi> is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sacredly urg'd; and <hi>the Authority and Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> is preserv'd, against the Usurpation of the Pope, and the Invasion of Schismaticks and <hi>Aerians</hi> new and old; and <hi>Truth and Faith to all men</hi> is kept and preach'd to be necessary and inviolable; and <hi>the Commandements</hi> are expounded with just severity, and without scruples; and <hi>Holiness of Life</hi> is urg'd upon all men, as indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly necessary to Salvation, and therefore without any allowances, tricks, and little artifices of escaping from it by easie and imperfect Doctrines; and every thing is practis'd which is useful to the saving of our Souls; and <hi>Christs Merits and Satisfaction</hi> are intirely relyed upon for the pardon of our sins; and <hi>the necessity of Good Works</hi> is universally taught; and <hi>our Prayers</hi> are holy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, edifying, and understood; they are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measures of the Word of God, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Saints. In this Church <hi>the Children are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> carefully, and rightly <hi>Baptiz'd</hi>; and the Baptiz'd, in their due time are <hi>Confirm'd</hi>; and the Confirm'd are <hi>Communicated</hi>; and Penitents are <hi>Absolv'd</hi>; and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents punished and discouraged</hi>; and Holy <hi>Marriage</hi> in

all men is preferr'd before unclean Concubinate in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and <hi>Nothing is wanting</hi> that God and his Christ hath made necessary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Behold we set before you Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing, Safety and Danger.
