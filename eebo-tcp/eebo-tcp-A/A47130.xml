            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THere are a few things of which I thought fit to give thee notice in relation to the following Treatiſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> If thou happen to find ſome few things in it aſſerted, (which touch not any of the great Doctrins of the Chriſtian Faith) that do not ſeem well to conſiſt with ſome paſſages in ſome of my former Books, I deſire thee to reckon them among the things ſince Retracted by me, in my late Book of Explications and Retractations, Printed in the Year 1697. which I have done with a ſincere Conſcience, God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been graciouſly pleaſed, of late times, further to enlighten me, I know not one thing here delivered in this Treatiſe, that may ſeem to have any inconſiſtency with any of my former Books, but is contained within thoſe Retractations, as to Matter
<pb facs="tcp:48738:3"/>
and Subſtance. As to the Doctrin of the holy Trinity, namely, the Oneneſs of the Eſſence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and their true diſtinction, by their Relative Attributes, I thank God, I have always had the ſound Faith thereof, wherein I have fully agreed with all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians, in oppoſition to either Arianum, or Sabellianiſm, or any other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Opinion; but I acknowledge my weakneſs in being too ſcrupulous to own the manner of expreſſing that diſtinction, by calling them three Perſons, as other ſound Chriſtians, upon good ground, have called them; the which ſcruple, upon good conſideration and adviſement, I have now laid aſide, and have found freedom to uſe thoſe terms, with all other Orthodox Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, for reaſons ſufficient (as I judge) I have given on that Head in my following Treatiſe; but this doth not argue in me any change of my Faith, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as my former Books ſufficiently teſtifie, I had the ſame Faith formerly as touching that great and glorious Myſtery, that I now have. And providing that any do own the truth of the Myſtery, though they ſcruple to uſe the terms of <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> I agree with many other charitable Chriſtians,
<pb facs="tcp:48738:3"/>
not to impoſe thoſe terms upon them, or to charge them with <hi>Hereſie,</hi> ſimply for their ſcrupling the terms; though a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſingular ſcrupuloſity, without any juſt ground, is no wiſe commendable in any, but ſuch who ſeek to cloak their groſs Error by only pretending a ſcrupuloſity to uſe the terms, as the Arguments that ſtand on Record in Print to this day, never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by them, evidently prove, (who have argued not only againſt the Names or Terms <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> but againſt their being Three, and againſt any diſtinction betwixt them, other than Nominal, or in Manifeſtations and Operations in time) are no wiſe excuſable, until they retract their former Error: For thus they have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd, as it ſtands in ſome of their Printed Books, <hi>Either they are three nothings, or three ſomethings; if three ſomethings, they are three Gods.</hi> And why ſhould they ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the word <hi>Perſons,</hi> more than the word <hi>Trinity;</hi> ſince after great Cavillation againſt <hi>Trinity,</hi> as well as <hi>Perſons,</hi> for their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſs Scripture Words, ſome of chief Note among them have ſaid in Print, they own the <hi>Scripture Trinity;</hi> and ſurely they were never deſired to own any other, nor blamed for not owning any other. It is
<pb facs="tcp:48738:4"/>
moſt certain that all the other parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin are built on this great <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are one God, having one Eſſence, and yet truly diſtinct in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Attributes and Properties; and to deny their true diſtinction, is fully as great an Error, as to deny the Oneneſs of their <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Godhead;</hi> nor can the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith be ever truly taught, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, without that Doctrin; therefore it was that Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to Baptiſe all, who ſhould become his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; which to be ſure they would not do, before they did in ſome meaſure inſtruct them in the knowledge of this great Myſtery. From which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Doctrin it ſelf is a main Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental of the Chriſtian Religion, the denyal of which is a plain overthrowing of the Chriſtian Faith, as is likewiſe the denyal of the Twofold Nature of Chriſt, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood, by a perſonal Union conſtituting one Chriſt, (which I have always ſincerely believed, whereof my former Books are a ſufficient witneſs;) without thoſe Doctrins, it is impoſſible that the way and manner
<pb facs="tcp:48738:4"/>
of Mans Redemption by Chriſt, and how he is given and ſent of the Father unto us, and how by and through him, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receive remiſſion of Sin, and the holy Spirit, with his ſaving Gifts and Graces, both from the Father and the Son, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be truly underſtood; and the denyal of thoſe Doctrins directly tend to eſtabliſh <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and ſubvert totally the Chriſtian Religion. Another thing I deſire the Reader to notice, That whereas I have not ſo particularly and fully treated of the Moral Part of Chriſtianity, as of the other Part, reſpecting matters of Faith, I requeſt the Reader not to conſtrue, that he had any occaſion thereby to judge of me, that I laid not as great weight upon the neceſſary practice of the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Part (in the careful obſervation of all God's Commands) as upon the neceſſary Faith and Knowledge of the other in order to our attaining Eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for, indeed, I hold them both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to that end. All true Chriſtian Morality is built on the true Chriſtian Faith, and draweth its greateſt motives and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to virtuous Living from thence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as great a diſtinction is made betwixt the <hi>Chriſtians Virtues,</hi> and theſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:48738:5"/>
               <hi>Heathen Virtues,</hi> as betwixt Silver and Iron, or Gold and Braſs. The great reaſon therefore of my not treating, <hi>at preſent,</hi> ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and fully on the Moral Part is, becauſe the neceſſity of the Moral Part is generally owned and acknowledged, among all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians, of the ſeveral Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Communions in Chriſtendom, (as alſo in great meaſure many among ſober Heathens, though they have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe great and noble Motives and Obligations to practiſe the Moral Part that all true Chriſtians have.) And becauſe I know there are many who want more to be well taught and helped in the Doctrinal Part of the Chriſtian Faith than in the Moral Part, therefore, with reſpect to theſe, I have chiefly undertaken this Work, that what Morality is found among them, who are ſhort in the true Knowledge and Faith of Chriſtian Doctrin, may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the true pitch of true Chriſtian Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by their receiving the ſound Chriſtian Faith, as God ſhall be pleaſed to work it in them by his holy Spirit, in the uſe of outward means and helps afforded and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them. The which my ſincere
<pb facs="tcp:48738:5"/>
Chriſtian Labour, in this undertaking, for their good, and the good of any others, to whom it may be of ſervice, I commit and recommend to Almighty God (with my ſincere Prayers and Wiſhes) that he may pleaſe to bleſs it with ſucceſs, <hi>To their ſpiritual profit and advantage,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are they not alſo the Word of God, and are not the Doctrines delivered to us in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way of Life and Salvation, frequently called the Word in Scripture? <hi>John</hi> 17. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> It is any Lye, or Falſhood, as ſome have argued, to call the Scriptures, which are many Words, the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, as it is no lye to call many Letters the Letter, but is an ordinary manner of Speech, both in Scripture and other Books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But ſeeing Chriſt is called the Word, and the Word is ſaid to be God, is it not abſurd to call the Scriptures, or the Doctrin contained in them, the Word? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 27, 7, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, no more than it is abſurd to call the Sun, Light, becauſe God is called Light in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for many words have diverſe Significations in Scripture, as not only the word <hi>Light,</hi> but <hi>Spirit, Life, Fleſh, Milk, Wine, Oyl, Bread, Wae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> have diverſe Significations in Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then may <hi>the word</hi> be diſtinguiſhed?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Into the <hi>eſſential word,</hi> mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. And the <hi>declarative word,</hi> that may alſo be called the <hi>doctrinal word,</hi> and that again may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the <hi>word,</hi> that is, either <hi>Vocal,</hi> (i. e. uttered by the Mouth or Voice) or <hi>Written.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe as the Word or Speech of a Man makes known his Mind and Will to the Hearers, and is the Interpreter of his Mind; ſo Chriſt the Eſſential and Eternal Word, makes known the Mind and Will of God to Angels and Men, and is the Interpreter of his Mind, and Counſel unto

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he hath begot the Son from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting before all Ages and Times, and before all Creatures, but he himſelf is begot of none, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 2.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he was begot of the Father alone, from all Eternity, or before all Ages and Times, and Creatures; and therefore he is called his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, and the word that was in the beginning with God, and that word was and is God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 14. <hi>John</hi> 17. 5. <hi>John</hi> 8. 42.</p>

                  <hi>Q</hi> Doth the Scripture call them three Perſons?</p>

Acts and Properties are attributed to them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in Scripture, the Father is brought in, ſaying, <hi>Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Pſal. 2. 7. Here is I denoting the firſt Perſon, who is the Father, and <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> denoting the ſecond Perſon, who is the Son. Again, <hi>the Lord ſaid unto my Lord ſit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110. 1. Here is I the firſt Perſon, who is the Father, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Son, who is the ſecond Perſon. Again the Father is ſaid in Scripture to know the Son, and the Son is ſaid to know the Father; and the Father is ſaid to love the Son, and the Son is ſaid to love the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>John</hi> 3. 35. <hi>John</hi> 14. 31. Now to know and love are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Acts and Properties, and can belong to none but diſtinct Perſons; alſo the Father is ſaid to give the Son, and to ſend the Son, and the Son is ſaid to be given and ſent of the Father, or to proceed or come from the Father; and the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to hear and to ſpeak, and is ſent both by the Father and the Son, and the Spirit is ſaid to ſearch all things, even the deep things of God, all which are Perſonal Acts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and plainly denote three Perſons, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three Perſons, but three diſtinct and ſeparate Men, why are not the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, (if they be three Perſons) three Gods?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are three ſeparate Perſons, having three diſtinct ſeparate Beings and Eſſences, and are in three diſtinct ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48738:11"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three and one, from the compounded Latin word, <hi>tri unit as,</hi> ſignifying God to be one in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and yet to be three, not in Eſſence, but in their Perſonal and Relative Attributes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there then any juſt occaſion of Offence to ſay, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is the Holy Trinity?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whence then hath come ſo great Offence, in ſome to find fault with thoſe ſound words, as Trinity, and three Perſons?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It hath partly come (in ſome) from their not underſtanding the true ſignification of the words, and it hath partly (in others) come from too great a ſcrupuloſity, becauſe they are not expreſs Scripture words, whereas thoſe very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Perſons uſe many other words, in giving
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48738:12"/>
the account of their Faith and Principles, that are not expreſs Scripture words; and in others it hath come from a prejudice againſt the true Doctrine and Faith of the Myſtery it ſelf, not only denying the three Perſons, but denying any diſtinction betwixt them, other than three Names, or three Manifeſtations, and Operations in time; and laſtly, in ſome it hath come from a Spirit of contradiction, affecting ſingularity, and to ſeem wiſer than others, whereof many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can be given in other Caſes; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly their finding fault with the word Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Humane Nature of Chriſt, which of late theſe very Perſons have owned, ſo that it may be expected, that as they are become ſo tame and conformable to own the word, Humanity, and Humane Nature of Chriſt, formerly blamed by them, they may alſo as freely uſe the words three Perſons, or Trinity of Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Can the Holy Scriptures give to Men any ſaving Knowledge of God, without his Divine Illumination, and inward Teaching and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Spirit in their hearts?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Life of his Manhood, that he laid down, when he dyed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why was it neceſſary that He ſhould dye for us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe Death was the Puniſhment that was due to us for our Sins, as it is written, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye;</hi> and Chriſt becoming Surety for us, by his Death, he redeems and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whereas the Scripture ſaith, Chriſt has redeemed us by his Blood, and hath Bought us with His Precious Blood, as of a Lamb without ſpot, hath purchaſed us with his Blood, and that we are juſtified, cleanſed, and ſanctified by His Blood; what Blood is meant there, and in other ſuch places of Scripture, that mention remiſſion of Sins by His Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The real Blood of his Body, that was ſhed on the Tree of the Croſs, when his Hands, and his Feet were nailed to the Croſs, and his

Side pierced, ſo that Water and Blood came out of his Side <hi>John</hi> 19. 34</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was His Blood the only Sacrifice and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for our Sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was but a part of the Sacrifice and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, for he gave his Fleſh, as well as his Blood, for the Life of the World; and his Soul was made an Offering for Sin. And, indeed, the Sufferings of his Soul were the greateſt Sufferings. <hi>My Soul</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful unto death,</hi> Matth. 28. 36.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſignifies the Word Atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Reconciling, Uniting, and making One, by a firm and cloſe Union; as when the Boards or Pieces of a Veſſel are united 'by Glew or Pitch, that the Veſſel Lake not, from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Kopher,</hi> that ſignifieth Pitch; alſo Ranſom, Redemption, Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If his Blood was but a part, why is our Redemption, remiſſion of our Sins, Juſtification and Sanctification, ſo much attributed to his Blood?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By an ordinary Figure, or manner of Speech, when a part is put for the whole; and as the Blood of the Beaſt is called [in Scripture] the Life of the Beaſt, ſo the Blood of the Man Chriſt, was his Life, to wit, the Life of his Manhood, which he gave a Ranſom for our Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not therefore a great Error in them, who ſay, the Blood whereby we are Redeemed,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48738:21"/>
Cleanſed, Juſtified, is the Life, which is the Light in every Man?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is the Life, which is the Light, even in the Saints, that Blood of ſprinkling, whereby they are Redeemed, Cleanſed, Juſtified?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, For any inward Gift or Grace of Light and Life in the Saints, is but the Effect or Fruit, purchaſed and procured by the Blood of Chriſt, as the Cauſe; but the Cauſe and the Effect ſhould not be confounded, but diſtinctly conſidered; although by the Figure of <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> ſometimes the Name of the Cauſe is given to the Effect, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 21.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How did Chriſt Redeem, Reconcile, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and Sanctifie Men by his Death, and ſhedding of his Blood for them on the Tree of the Croſs? Are Men ſimply, by what he then did and ſuffered for them, Reconciled, Juſtified and Sanctified, before true Faith, Repentance, and Converſion is wrought in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Men are not either Reconciled, Juſtified, or Sanctified, until true Faith, Repentance, and Converſion is wrought in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31. But Chriſt, by the merit of his Death, and ſhedding of his Blood, and by all that he did and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us without us, procured and purchaſed for us, Redemption, Remiſſion, Juſtification, and the inward Grace of Sanctification; yea, Faith and Repentance, together with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Holy Spirit, and the ſpiritual

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the chief thing that is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His moſt perfect, and moſt holy Obedience, and Reſignation unto the Will of his Father; for becauſe he thus humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, therefore God hath highly exalted him to be a Prince and a Saviour, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What made his Obedience of ſo great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and worth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe he offered himſelf through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and that he was both God and Man, his Godhead gave that great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, worth, and value to his obedience: That as the diſobedience of one Man (to wit <hi>Adam)</hi> brought ſin and guilt upon all, ſo the obedience of one Man (to wit Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam)</hi> ſhould make ſatisfaction to God, for the Sins of all; and as the Judgment, was by one to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ſo the free gift is of many Offences unto Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 16. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did not God forgive Men's Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, ſeeing Men can and do oft forgive a debt of mony, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the leaſt ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The caſe is not alike betwixt the debt of mony and the debt of Mens Sins; a Man may forgive a debt of mony, without requiring any ſatisfaction, but the Sin of Murder, no Man can forgive it, without a ſatisfaction of life for life,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48738:22"/>
and God hath expreſly required it by his Law, which may help us to underſtand how the Juſtice and juſt Law of God required a ſatisfaction; and if Chriſt would make that ſatisfaction for us, he was to give his life for us, the juſt ſuffering for the unjuſt, that he might bring us unto God, God having laid on him the Iniquities of us all, who did bear our Sins on the Tree of the Croſs, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed, that being dead unto Sin, we might live unto Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. By which ſatisfaction that Chriſt hath made to God for our Sins, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the juſtice of God is demonſtrated, but his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Purity; for thereby he is made known to be a God, that ſo loveth Righteouſneſs, and hateth Iniquity, that the very Holineſs and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Nature, as well as the Righteouſneſs of his Law required that ſatisfaction to be made, that the Sins of Men might be pardoned, and God and Men might be reconciled, and thus both the Holineſs of God's Nature is demonſtrated, and the due Honour of his holy Law is preſerved, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not Chriſt his making ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for our Sins, hinder the free forgiveneſs of our ſins? How can a debt be fully paid, and yet freely forgiven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The forgiveneſs of our Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. is ſtill a moſt free forgiveneſs to us, becauſe God freely gave us his dear Son Chriſt Jeſus (out of his abundant love) to make that ſatisfaction for us, and alſo that the Juſtice of God accepted that ſatisfaction from Chriſt, which in ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice might have been required of us. Thus the

wonderful Harmony of God's mercy and juſtice, and alſo of his wiſdom and power is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the way of Mens Redemption, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did not Chriſt alſo give himſelf for our Redemption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth it hinder God's free forgiveneſs, that he forgiveth none their Sins, without Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Converſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, which may help us to underſtand, that as Repentance and Faith on our part doth not hinder the forgiveneſs of God to be free to us, and of his rich free Grace, ſo nor doth the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to God's juſtice, on Chriſt's part hinder the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if Chriſt hath ſuffered Death, being the Puniſhment of our Sin, why ſhould men dye? ſhould the ſame debt and payment be exacted both from us and our ſurety?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By Chriſt's dying for us, the Death of the Body ceaſeth to be a puniſhment (ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) though it is a conſequence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin ſtill remaining unto the Faithful; the ſting of Death (which is Sin) being removed, Death is changed from being a Puniſhment to the Faithful, to be a bleſſed and ſanctified means to put an end to the Sorrows, Tentations, and Evils of this mortal life, and to be unto them a paſſage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into eternal life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. 56.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Under whom did Chriſt ſuffer Death?</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why under him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the Jews at that time had their power taken away by the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo that they ſaid to <hi>Pilate</hi> it was not lawful for them to put any Man to death, <hi>John</hi> 18. 31.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was there not a great hand of Providence in this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, It having been foretold, by ſome of the Prophets that the manner of Chriſt's Death, ſhould be by Crucifying and Hanging on a Tree; therefore that manner of death was called (in the Old Teſtament) accurſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie before-hand, that Chriſt ſhould become a Curſe for us, and dye for us, the accurſed death of the Croſs; and alſo it was foretold by <hi>David</hi> in the ſecond Pſalm, that both Jews and Gentiles ſhould gather together and take counſel againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed.</p>

                  <hi>A. David</hi> Prophecied, that his Hands and Feet ſhould be pierced, which was accordingly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and was only uſed, in that manner of death; and <hi>Moſes</hi> lifting up the Brazen Serpent on the Pole, or Tree, was a Figure of Chriſt his being

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe of the Weakneſs and Groſſneſs of our Fleſh, and of our fleſhly Sight, which can ſcarce ſee the Body of the Air, that we breath in, nor behold the brightneſs of the Sun; but when our Bodies ſhall be changed, and made Spiritual at the Reſurrection, we ſhall ſee the glorious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and alſo the glorious Body of Chriſt, and the glorified Bodies of all the Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there alſo a real place, called Hell, into which the Wicked both Soul and Body ſhall be caſt at the Day of Judgment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, which is that called <hi>Tophet,</hi> Iſaiah 30. 33. Which hath been ordained of old, he hath made it deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſignifieth <hi>Tophet,</hi> and why is it ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Tophet</hi> ſignifieth the beating of a Drum, and was the place where the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> burned their Children, and Sacrificed them alive to their Idol <hi>Molech,</hi> where they uſed to beat
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48738:30"/>
Drums, to hinder them from hearing the pitiful Cry of their Children; therefore by a Metaphor, Hell is called <hi>Tophet,</hi> and by the like Metaphor, Hell is called by Chriſt in the N. Teſtament, <hi>Gehenna,</hi> i. e. the Land or Field of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> where all the Filth of the City of <hi>Jerúſalem</hi> was caſt into, that piece of Ground having formerly belonged to a Man called <hi>Hinnon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why hath God ſo ordered it, that as the place of Reward to the Saints, and of Puniſhment to the Wicked, ſhould not be ſeen by us in this Life, nor apprehended by any of our outward Senſes; ſo that none ſhould come from the Dead, to tell us of theſe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That thereby we might have the greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the Exerciſe of our Faith, which is the Evidence of things not ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. We have not only <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets Teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future Rewards and Puniſhments, but the Teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf, who roſe from the Dead, and hath given us in the Records of the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full and ſufficient Ground of Faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe things, to which the Spirit of Truth doth bear an inward Witneſs, and who will not believe on ſuch great Evidences, nor would they believe, if any ſhould riſe from the Dead to tell them, <hi>Luke</hi> 16 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is Chriſt the Object of our Faith, for Remiſſion of Sin and Juſtification; is it as his Blood is ſhed, in us, and as he offers up himſelf a Sacrifice in us (as ſome ſay) to appeaſe the Wrath of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, for all ſuch Notion of Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> blood being ſhed in us, and his offering up himſelf in us
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48738:30"/>
a Sacrifice for Sin, to appeaſe the Wrath of God, is falſe, and contrary to Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Is then Jeſus Chriſt conſidered as he died for us without us, and roſe again, and as he was the Sacrifice for our Sins by his Death, and Blood that was outwardly ſhed, the Object of our Faith, for Remiſſion of Sins and Juſtification?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Heb</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 41.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Which are the ſeveral Parts of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, Such as reſpect Angels, both good and bad, and the whole Creation. Secondly, Such as reſpect the World, or that part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that do not belong to his Church. Thirdly, Such as belong to his Church.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Hath he alſo a Power and Government over the evil Angels, and all evil and unclean Spirits, and the Devil the Prince of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, as plainly appeared, by the Power and Authority he uſed to caſt forth the unclean Spirits out of the Bodies of many that were Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, as is evident from his own words, that all Power in Heaven and Earth was his, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 26, 27. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 27, 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By reſtraining and limiting their Power, over-ruling their evil Deſigns and Actions, and cauſing them to turn to his Glory, and the Glory of his Father, and to the good of his choſen; and laſtly, by Judging and Puniſhing them at the laſt day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth Chriſt perform his Kingly Office over the World, or that part of Mankind, that do not belong to his Church, and neither are, nor ſhall become Members of it, but remain Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent to the laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By giving them a righteous Law, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in their Conſciences for the Tranſgreſſion of which, they are liable to his Judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What places of Scripture prove, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or that part of Mankind, which have not the outward written Law, nor Goſpel, have a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48738:31"/>
righteous Law placed by God and Chriſt in their Hearts and Conſciences, according to which, they are liable to be Judged?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are many, ſuch as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 10. <hi>Job</hi> 28. 28. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 5, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is that Law in Men's Conſciences, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally any other than the meer Reaſon of Man, commonly called human Reaſon, and the Uſe or Improvement of it by its meer natural Actings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, for it is really Divine, being given them of God to Rule and Govern all the natural Faculties of Man's Soul; even his Reaſon it ſelf, which is out Corrupted, and dictateth falſe and corrupt things to Man in his corrupt State; but this Law of Righteouſneſs, writ by God's Finger in his Heart, neither is, nor can be Corrupted; it is a Light given to enlighten his Reaſon, and as a Lamp to him in his night State, or as the Light of the Moon and Stars in the night Seaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 13, 12. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If any Men ſhould be found, who have O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed this Law, or Light in their Conſciences, univerſally, ſhould they be ſaved, not having Faith in Chriſt Crucified?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, it is an improper and unfit Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe, never any have univerſally Obeyed it in all Points; for according to the Scriptures Teſtimony, all have ſinned, and fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, and the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin; for he who Tranſgreſſeth in one Point, is guilty of the whole Law, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Law ſaith, (whether outwardly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly written) it ſaith to them that are under
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48738:32"/>
it, <hi>that every mouth may be ſtopp'd, and the whole world become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 9. 10. 19. 23. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. Secondly, upon that ſuppoſition, Men could not be ſaved with Eternal Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by their beſt works and moſt perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to any Law or Light in them, becauſe Eternal Life is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and not the wages of Mens obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nay, not of the Saints (in a ſtrict ſenſe) for (as ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the promiſe (to wit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Salvation) by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that the doers of the Law are juſtified, and that ſome of the Gentiles, who had not the outward Law, were doers of the Law, or did by Nature the things contained in the Law, and that their thoughts accuſed, or excuſed one another? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. 14. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Though they did ſome things contained in the Law, yet they did not all things, but failed in divers reſpects, (as oft even the Faithful do) and that their, thoughts excuſed them at ſome times, as well as at other times accuſed them, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, they did nor perfectly fulfil the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were excuſed, it was but in part, and in compariſon of greater Sinners, as Chriſt ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon, Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> that ſhould riſe up in judgment againſt the Jews; yea, excuſing in the largeſt ſenſe is far ſhort of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God, which none but Believers in Chriſt Jeſus have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then are <hi>Peter</hi>'s words to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that God is no reſpecter of Perſons? <hi>But</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48738:32"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is a twofold acceptance, the one of a Servant, the other of a Son: <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſhold being pious Gentiles, who did fear God and work Righteouſneſs, were accepted in that State as Servants, but this was ſhort of the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and acceptance of Sons, and of being in a State of Salvation, which none have, but through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; and that <hi>Cornelius,</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> Preached Chriſt to him, (as he dyed and roſe again) was not in the State of Salvation, with reſpect to Eternal Life, is evident from the Angels words to him, how that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould Preach words to him, whereby he and all his Houſe ſhould be ſaved. Moreover that through faith in Chriſt, as he dyed and roſe again <hi>Peter</hi> Preached remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and not through his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in reſpect of what he did formerly, is clear from <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. To him (ſaid <hi>Peter)</hi> gave all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth it from hence follow, that all the Heathens, however ſo virtuous, and all others of Mankind, who have not had Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel outwardly Preached to them, and have not outwardly heard it, are periſhed, and ſhall be damned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, it no wiſe followeth, for tho' Gods ordinary way of Salvation is by the outward means of the <hi>Word</hi> outwardly preached or read; yet this hinders not, but that others may be, and ſhall be ſaved, who have not outwardly heard,

God working by his Spirit, when, where, and how he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not this therefore lay a foundation of a judgment of Charity, for ſuch upright and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentiles as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was, before, <hi>Peter</hi> Preached Chriſt to him, of whom we read in the New Teſtament, and as <hi>Abimelech</hi> was, of whom, and of his uprightneſs we read in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. 6. who have not had the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and other outward means of Salvation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded unto them, that Chriſtendom hath, that they are not without a poſſibility of Salvation, (though not on the account of their Works) through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, ſeeing God who is Light (and in a true ſenſe may be ſaid to be the Light in them, as being the Author and Fountain of all true Light, or illumination, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or ſpecial) is abundantly ſufficient to give them what degree of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, either implicit or explicit, for Eternal Salvation, he thinks needful to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But it is one thing, what God can do, or is ſufficient and able to do, and another what he doth, or is pleaſed to do.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, There is an excellent Order, of ſome things to go before, and other things to follow; ſome of which go before, and others follow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order of Nature, and others in order of time, as plowing and ſowing the Ground goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Harveſt and Reaping; yet neither the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſowing are the moving cauſe to move God, to give the Fruit and Increaſe.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth this appear from Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By many plain teſtimonies of Scripture, as firſt, concerning the neceſſity of Converſion and Faith, in order both to forgiveneſs of Sin, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Salvation. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given him by Chriſt unto both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them, which are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and Rom. 10. 6. <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, ſay not in thy heart,</hi> &amp;c, v. 7. <hi>but what ſaith it, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith, which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved; for, with the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. In that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

golden Chain, containing ſeveral Links that follow one after another: There is <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination</hi> going before <hi>Calling,</hi> and <hi>Calling</hi> before <hi>Juſtifying,</hi> and <hi>Juſtifying</hi> before <hi>Glorifying.</hi> The <hi>Calling</hi> (that is, not an outward <hi>Calling</hi> only, but chiefly an inward <hi>Calling,</hi> and inward Work of God's Holy Spirit enlightning the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and moving the Heart and Will to anſwer the <hi>Call)</hi> is not the proper Cauſe of either <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> or <hi>Glorification,</hi> but a neceſſary ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of it in order of Nature, as the holding out of the Hand is antecedent in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to receive a free gift from him who free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives; for Faith has no cauſality, in order to receive forgiveneſs of Sin, and Juſtification, more than the Hand has to receive a rich and free Gift, which Faith is alſo the free Gift of God. Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. Said <hi>Peter</hi> in his Preacing to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Friends, <hi>To him,</hi> (viz. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,)</hi> even him whom they Slew, and Hanged on a Tree, <hi>gave all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Secondly, As to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, its being neceſſary in order to forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blotting out of Sins, <hi>Peter</hi>'s words are plain, Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> &amp;c. And Acts 5. 30, 31. <hi>The God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgivneſs of ſins.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. Chriſt, after his Reſurrection, taught the Diſciples the true Method and Order of Preaching, <hi>That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48738:37"/>
                  <hi>and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name,</hi> among all Nations, beginning at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> Thus we ſee how though Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins are joyned together in thoſe places, yet in order, <hi>Repentance</hi> is put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But is not Repentance a proper effect of remiſſion of Sin, as the Soul has a lively ſenſe of it wrought by the Spirit of God in the Soul, as it was ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> ſhe loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her, who was a deep and great Penitent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As ſome degree of Repentance is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to forgiveneſs, not as its Cauſe, ſo there are other degrees of it that are conſequents thereof, and may be called the effects of it.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHat uſe hath that inward Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or Illumination in all Men, given them by Chriſt, if no Man can be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Saved by it, without Faith in Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is of great uſe, as it is a preparatory Miniſtration of the Spirit, in a lower degree and kind of Operation, for convincing of Sin, and giving the knowledge of Sin, and working in the Soul a ſenſe of God's Wrath and Judgment for Sin, that is of that ſervice to Men; as when Men are Condemned to dye for their Crimes, and afterwards hear of the King's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and free Pardon, their former Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes the Pardon the more precious and acceptable to them. That was it that <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 9. that was glorious in its Seaſon, that is, antecedent and preparatory to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtification that followeth, and is much more glorious: For as God led <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old by <hi>Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48738:39"/>
Viſion of Peace; and where the Temple was built, without the noiſe of a Hammer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 7. So God now leads his <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the inward Miniſtration of the Law, to the inward Miniſtration of the Goſpel and New Covenant of Grace, of Life and Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What other uſe hath it, eſpecially to the Faithful, who are come under the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So far as the dictates and teaching, Light and Knowledge of it extends, it ſerves for a Rule of Life (together with the Scriptures) in things of moral Honeſty, Juſtice, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for if our <hi>Reaſon</hi> as Men be ſtill of great uſe to us, in things of Reaſon, certainly that Law or Light in us, and in all Men, that is greater and more excellent, than <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> is of great uſe and ſervice to the moſt Faithful. And Obedience to it, as a Rule of moral Life, is ſo neceſſary, that no Man can be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſincere Obedience to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But doth not the more ſpecial Light and Illumination of Faith, given to the Faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Covenant, make the other void and uſeleſs, and as it were extinguiſh it, as the Light of the Day ſeems to extinguiſh the Light of the Night?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay: For as Chriſt ſaid he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil them; ſo he is not come, either Outwardly, or Inwardly to deſtroy either our Reaſon, as Men, or any former Light or Illumination, that he had given; nor doth the Light of the Day extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Light of the Night, ſtrictly ſpeaking,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48738:40"/>
though it may ſeem ſo to do, but doth rather ſtrengthen it, and better it. And why ſhould the more excellent <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> extinguiſh this other <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Moral Juſtice,</hi> more than it doth extinguiſh our Reaſon as Men, which by experience is not ſo found, but the contrary, that the more we are enlightned by, or with, the Light of Faith, our Reaſon is the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, pure, and clear, ſtrong and vigorous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ground of Scripture is there for <hi>Two Lights,</hi> or more than one? Is there not rather one only Light, which is God, and the Word Chriſt, which is one with him, that inwardly ſhineth in the hearts of all Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> originally is but one, and that is <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all <hi>Light, Wiſdom, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> yet this one Fountain ſendeth forth its various Streams according to his good Pleaſure; and though there is but one God, yet there is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Operations, and but one Chriſt, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Miniſtrations, and but one Spirit, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Gifts, as the Scripture plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth; hence we find in Scripture, that God is called the <hi>Father of Lights, and the God of all Grace;</hi> alſo we read both of the <hi>manifold Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God, and his <hi>manifold Grace;</hi> and of <hi>the ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> anſwering to the ſeven Lamps, or Lights in the Sanctuary, which <hi>Solomon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Wiſdom given him of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of unto Ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But can God, or Chriſt, as he is the Word, be ſaid to be a <hi>Light in Men,</hi> either univerſally in all Men, or ſpecially in faithful Men?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, both univerſally in all Men, and more ſpecially in the Faithful, it being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg'd, not only by Chriſtians, but by Heathen Poets, Orators, and Philoſophers, that God, and his Word and Spirit, is in all the Creatures; and as it is ſaid in the Book called <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Gods incorruptible Spirit is in all things, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 12. 1 So that there is no Goodneſs, or Virtue, or Excellency, that is in either Stone, Metal, Vegetable or Animal, but God is the Author and firſt Cauſe of it; and that, not as at a diſtance, or without things only, but as near, yea, ſo near, that, as God is in all things, ſo all things are in him; and in him we live, and move, and have our Being; and therefore, as God is <hi>Light</hi> eſſentially in, and to himſelf, ſo by an eaſie <hi>Metonymie,</hi> God and Chriſt may be ſaid to be a Light to, and in all Men, as the Cauſe and Author of <hi>all the Light</hi> that Men have uni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſally; and more eſpecially he is in, and to the Faithful their <hi>Light,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 27. 1.) enlightning them with greater and more high and noble Illuminations and Lights, than he doth other Men, and ſo is a true Cauſe of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as their Light in them, but not the only Cauſe, as within them, but alſo as in Chriſt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without them, and together with him, their great High Prieſt, Mediator, Advocate, Head of divine Influence and ſpiritual Nouriſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Preſence and In-being of one Cauſe takes not away the Influence, Virtue, and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of another Cauſe; as it were a falſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ſay, God is in a Field of Earth, as the great Cauſe of its fruitfulneſs, and therefore that Field will produce Corn, without Seed, and without Dew and Rain from Heaven, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Influence of the Sun, all which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſecond Cauſes; even as falſe it is to argue, God and Chriſt conſidered as the Word, is in every Man, and in the Saints, and Operates in them; therefore they need not Chriſt conſidered as God-man, the Word made Fleſh, their <hi>High Prieſt, Mediator, Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Propitiation</hi> in Heaven without them, or any influence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Dow, Rain, or Warmth from him, that Sun of Righteouſneſs, in whom the Fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily, who is full of Grace and Truth; and of whoſe Fulneſs (as ſaid <hi>John)</hi> we all receive, and Grace for Grace.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> As to the eſſential Preſence of God, and the eſſential Word and Spirit, that is the ſame every where, and in all things, but in reſpect of Manifeſtations and Operations, the difference is great; for the Faithful have peculiar and ſpecial Manifeſtations and Operations of God and Chriſt in them, which none others have. Again, God and Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, are in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by Union and Communion, and Inhabitation, or In-dwelling by Faith and Love, but not ſo in unbelievers and unſanctified Perſons. Hence it is that unbelievers are ſaid to be without God and Chriſt in the World, without Hope, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

And ſurely that was more, or ſomething elſe, than what they enjoyed of Chriſt within them, unleſs Men will ſay (as ſome have ſaid) that there is no Heaven at all without Men, but only within them, nor any Hell but within them, which is abominable Ranteriſm; but we cannot have the ſaving knowledge of him, nor that ſweet and comfortable experience and enjoyment of him, and of his Love and Life and ſpiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48738:45"/>
but as the Myſtery of him is inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in us, and his Love and Life inwardly felt by us; for as Chriſt within the Saints, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, is but one Chriſt, ſo it is but one great Myſtery, which yet may be diſtinguiſhed into two parts, the greater part being God manifeſt in the Fleſh (to wit, in the Fleſh of Chriſt, as he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſuffered) juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, Preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, was without Controverſie, the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, and without all doubt is the greater part of the Myſtery; for the beſt of the Saints have not the Fulneſs in them, it is only the glorified Man Chriſt Jeſus, without them, who has that Fulneſs; but every one of the Saints have a meaſure of the Gift of Grace out of that Fulneſs, as the Water in the Ciſtern is but a ſinall part of that which is in the River; and though there be ever ſo much good Water in the River without me, yet if I drink not of it, and have not ſome of it within me, I cannot be refreſhed, nor ſatisfied, nor can I live by all the Water that is in the River or Fountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, unleſs I receive of it within me to refreſh me: But if there were no Water in the River without me, I could have none to drink and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within me, but behoved to periſh for thirſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe we need to be but once Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or born again, whereof Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a Sign, but being once Regenerated, we need to be frequently nouriſhed, of which the Supper is a Sign that frequently ought to be uſed, as appears both by the Command of Chriſt <hi>(As often as ye eat,</hi> &amp;c. and the example of the Faithful, in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what is the need or uſe of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seal of the New Teſtament or Covenant, ſeeing the Faithful have the inward Seal of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The inward doth no more take away the uſe and benefit of the outward to the Faithful now, than the inward Seal of the Spirit to Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did take away the uſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seal of Circumciſion from him, which was given him of God to be a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by Chriſt's New Teſtament? and whether it is one and the ſame with the New Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the ſame for Matter and Subſtance, but that it further denotes Chriſt's Legacy, left us in his Will and Teſtament, and confirmed by thoſe outward Seals, appointed by himſelf, that being the Nature of all Wills and Teſtaments, to be in force by the Death of the Teſtator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How doth it appear, that theſe outward things, as Water in Baptiſm, and the Bread and Wine in the Supper, are Seals of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the nature and manner of all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants require ſome external Signs or Seals for their ſtronger confirmation; and as it is the uſual manner of Nations, to confirm their Covenants by or with outward Signs or Seals, ſo it hath been always God's way, in all his Covenanting with Men, or with any People, to confirm it by ſome outward Signs or Seals, as the Sacrifices before the Law, and Circumciſion, and the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, and the Sacrifices under the Law, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Is it not therefore a great Sin, and highly provoking to God Almighty, and doing contempt to our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, not only to reject the Seals of his Covenant and Teſtament from practiſing them, ſo that they can be duly had, but to deny and vilifie them,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48738:56"/>
with the reproachful Names of beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and worldly Rudiments? yea, if God be not very merciful to them, to provoke him, to deprive them of the ſpiritual Bleſſings of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for their ſo great contempt, through their great Ignorance, (God grant that it may not be wilful in ſome.) And do they not act as fooliſhly in the Caſe, as if one that had a rich Legacy left him by the Will of his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould in his folly tear away the Seal of it, which in Law renders it null and void?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How do the faithful the eat the Fleſh and drink the Blood of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not by the bodily Mouth, but by a true Faith, and ſincere and ſervent Love and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Nay, according to Chriſt's plain and expreſs words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53. Unleſs ye eat my Fleſh and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you; the Fleſh and Blood of the Son of Man, together with the Fat and Marrow of the inward Life and Spirit of Chriſt, even whole Chriſt God man is the Food of the Faithful; by him, if an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not this hold forth the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, as he was outwardly crucified,

as for remiſſion of Sin, and Juſtification, ſo for Regeneration and the new Birth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, which ſufficiently ſheweth the great ignorance of ſome, that teach, how <hi>Paul</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more to bring People to know, or have Chriſt formed in them, than to bring them to have a Belief in Chriſt without them, as he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For there is no other way to have Chriſt formed in us, but by having a ſaving Faith in Chriſt crucified without us, wrought in us by the Spirit of God; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> called Chriſt crucified, the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. 24</p>

But the Argument is built on a falſe ſuppoſition and perverſion of our Saviour's words, which was an anſwer to the carnal Jews, their objecting, How can this Man give us his Fleſh to Eat? which they meant of bodily Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the bodily Mouth; but Chriſt meant it of a ſpiritual Eating, by the ſpiritual Mouth of he Soul, to wit, by Faith, which the Spirit giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and their carnal underſtanding was that Fleſh which did not profit, as neither would (on ſuppoſition) their eating of his Fleſh with their bodily Mouths, if they could have done it.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Another Objection is oft made by ſome, againſt the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Fleſh, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, He knew Chriſt no more after the Fleſh; how is this Objection to be anſwered? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The words <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> do not refer to Chriſt's Fleſh; as if <hi>Paul</hi> had renounced and quite buried in oblivion, all Knowledge, Faith, and Remembrance of Chriſt's Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Fleſh, and Reſurrection, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which is evident from many places through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Epiſtles, and particularly from his words a little before in that ſame Chapter; <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. but his carnal knowledge of Chriſt, ſuch as he had when a Phariſee, which was but a knowledge of Chriſt after the Fleſh, he did juſtly reject.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48738:59"/>
of it, who are ſo far from having had Faith in Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered Death in the Fleſh, that they are prejudiced againſt it, and have openly, before many Witneſſes, oppoſed it, as unneceſſary and unprofitable; yea, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as drawing from the Gift of God within?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, <hi>John</hi> 6. 47. 58. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. 5. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is that Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Faithful eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood, that they may have Eternal Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not only the aſſent of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of Chriſt, as he came in the Fleſh, and gave his Body of Fleſh to be broken, and his Blood to be ſued for us, but is a moſt chearful, ready, and free conſent of the Heart and Will, whereby every true Believer, with great deſire, receiveth, accepteth, and relyeth upon Chriſt; truſteth and conſideth in him (and in God the Father through him) for remiſſion of Sin, Juſtification, and Eternal Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the Spiritual bleſſings promiſed in the Goſpel; and by which free act of the Will, the Faithful chuſe God to be their God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Chriſt to be their Redeemer and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Head and Husband, King and Lord, as well as Prieſt and Propitiation for Sin. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever having thus acted Faith on him, is as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhed, comforted, ſtrengthened, fed and ſatisfied with him, as a hungry Man is with Meat; therefore, by a Metaphor, believing in Chriſt is called an eating of him; both which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Underſtanding, and conſent and choice of the Heart and Will, is wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of Chriſt, by means of the Word and Doctrin delivered in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and, by the like Metaphor, it is called,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48738:60"/>
a looking to him, a coming to him, a reſting and abiding in him, a being joyned to him, as the Members are joyned to the Head, a being grafted in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4. and built upon him, as on a ſure Foundation; alſo a being married to him, by which Faith, as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and dwell in him, ſo he abideth and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21. 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>John</hi> 15. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. 3. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. Yea, not only his Spirit and Life dwelleth in them, but he himſelf, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who dyed and roſe again, by Faith dwelleth in them, not by his bodily Preſence, but by their having him in their conſtant thoughts and remembrance, and in their love and affections, as the loving Wife hath her loving Husband in her thoughts and affections, when he is bodily abſent; and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 3. <hi>You are in our hearts to dye and to live with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But it is objected by ſome, that they find a difficulty, if not an impoſſibility in it, to believe in the Man Chriſt without them, whom they have never, at any time, heard or ſeen; they cannot frame a conception of him in the mind, as the Wife can of the Husband, whom ſhe hath both heard and ſeen, and immediately converſed with?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The account that the holy Scriptures give us of him, and of his moſt holy Life, and Virtues, and wonderful Excellencies, doth better help us to frame a Conception of him in our minds, as the holy Spirit that we receive from him, gives life to that Conception by his powerful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, than if we had only ſeen him and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48738:61"/>
heard him outwardly; as the true and accurate deſcription of a Man's Life and Virtues gives us a better account of him, than the bodily ſight and hearing of him; therefore it was that our Lord ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed,</hi> Joh. 20. 29. There is no Man who hath receiv'd ſome extraordinary favour from a Perſon that he hath not ſeen, but by the favour which he hath receiv'd from him, he will be helped to frame a very lovely Conception of him in his Heart and Soul. And the faithful who had not ſeen Chriſt with their bodily Eyes more than we, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> writ unto, did both believe in Chriſt, and love him whom they had not ſeen, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in him with great joy, even joy unſpeakable and full of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. With what dearneſs of love and affection do we love the Saints, whoſe holy Lives and Virtues are ſo lively ſet forth to us in the Scriptures, and the holy Martyrs in Church Hiſtory, though we believe not in them: But we could not love them, unleſs we had ſome true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Idea of them; for love doth as much require a lively Conception of the Object beloved, as Faith requireth a lively Conception of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject believed. Therefore, if the Man Chriſt can be loved, without having outwardly ſeen him or heard him; by the ſame reaſon, he can be believed, and truſted in, without the outward ſight and hearing of him.</p>

            <head>POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe I know there are many who will not allow, that there is any <hi>Light</hi> generally in Men, but that of meer Humane Reaſon; and eſteem any who think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be Fanatick and Enthuſiaſtical, I ſhall here inſert ſome words out of a Printed Sermon of <hi>D. South,</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 35. vol. 3. which I judge worthy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, well agreeing with what I have delivered in my fore-going Catechiſm on that Subject, Pag. 47. 63. 64. 65. Other Proteſtant Authors I could cite, aſſerting the ſame.</p>
            <p>Pag. 68. Vol. 3. Some of the ableſt of the Peripatetick School (not without countenance from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, in the <hi>5th</hi> Chapter of his <hi>3d</hi> Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) hold, That beſides the <hi>Native Inherent Light</hi> of the Intellect (which is eſſential to it, as it is a Faculty made to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and take in its Object after a ſpiritual way) there is alſo <hi>another Light</hi> in the Nature of a <hi>Medium,</hi> bearning in upon it by a continual efflux and emanation from the <hi>Great Fountain of Light,</hi> and irradiating this intellectual Faculty, together with Species and Repreſentations of things imprinted thereupon. According to which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, it ſeems, with great reaſon, to follow; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever interpoſes between the Mind, and thoſe irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from God (as all Sin more or leſs certainly does) muſt needs hinder the entrance and admiſſion of them into the Mind, and then darkneſs muſt by neceſſary conſequence enſue, as being nothing elſe but the abſence or privation of Light.</p>
            <p>For the further illuſtration of which Notion, we may obſerve, that the Underſtanding, the Mind, or Conſcience of Man (which we ſhall here take for the ſame thing) ſeem to bear much the ſame reſpect to God, which Glaſs or Chriſtial does to the Light or Sun, which appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the Eye, a bright and ſhining thing; nevertheleſs this ſhining is not ſo much from any eſſential Light or Brightneſs exiſting in the Glaſs it ſelf (ſuppoſing that that there be any ſuch in it) as it is from the <hi>Porouſneſs</hi> of its Body, rendring it <hi>Diaphanous,</hi> and thereby fit to receive and tranſmit thoſe Rayes of Light, which falling upon it, and paſſing through it, repreſent it to common view, as a <hi>Luminous</hi> Body. But now, let any thing of dirt or
<pb facs="tcp:48738:64"/>
foulneſs fully this Glaſs, and ſo much of the <hi>Shine</hi> of <hi>Brightneſs</hi> of it is preſently gone, becauſe ſo much of the Light is thereby hindred from entering into it, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its way through it. In like manner, every act of Sin, every degree of Guilt, does in its proportion caſt a kind of ſoil and foulneſs upon the intellectual part of the Soul, and thereby intercepts thoſe bleſſed irradiations, which the Divine Nature is continually darting in upon it—a little after.—I will not affirm this to be a perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of the Caſe before us, but I am ſure it is a lively illuſtration of it, and may be of no ſmall uſe to ſuch as ſhall throughly conſider it.</p>
            <p>And concerning the donation of a certain determinate number of Perſons made to Chriſt, to be his People, by an Eternal Compact or Tranſaction between the Father and the Son; by virtue of which Agreement or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, he was in the Fulneſs of Time to ſuffer for them, and to accompliſh the whole Work of their Redemption, from firſt to laſt. See pag. 415. of his Sermon on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 8. [where he hath theſe following words, greatly worthy of notice.] <q>For to affirm that Chriſt dyed only to veriſie a Propoſition [That whoſoever Believed ſhould be Saved] but in the mean time to leave the whole iſſue of things, in reference to Perſons, ſo looſe and undetermined, That it was a queſtion whether ever any ſhould actually Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and very poſſible that none ever might, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that after Chriſt had ſuffered, had been ſtriken; and dyed for Tranſgreſſion, yet for any thing he had done, in all this he might never have had a People; this certainly is a ſtrange and new Goſpel, and ſuch as the Doctrine of our Church ſeems utterly unacquainted with.</q>
