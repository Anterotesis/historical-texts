            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BRIEF
DIRECTIONS
Shewing how a fit and perfect MODEL
OF
Popular Government
may be made, found, or
understood.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more apparent, than that this Nation
is greatly disquieted and perplexed through a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of two Causes: The one, that the present
state thereof is not capable of any other Form, than
that onely of a Popular Government; The other, that
they are too few who understand what is the Form or Model
naturally necessary unto a Popular Government, or what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in that Form or Prudence, for the sitting of it unto the
use of this Nation. For these Infirmities, I shall offer some
Remedy by a brief Discourse or Direction, consisting of two Parts.</p>
            <p>The first shewing those Forms or Models of Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or of Common-wealths, which have been hitherto
extant, whether fit or unfit for the present. State of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The second, shewing a Model Form of Popular
Government fitted unto the present state of this Nation. In
the first part I shall propose seven Models roughly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
In the second, one, but more particularly and exactly.</p>

               <head>THE FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>IN every Frame of Government, either the Form must be
fitted unto the Propriety as it standeth, and this onely is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
in this Nation; or the Propriety must be altered and
fitted unto the Frame, which without force hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but very seldom, practicable in any other Nation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
for the better knowledge of the One way, it will be
best to propose in both wayes.</p>

                  <head>THE
FIRST MODEL
OF
POPULAR GOVERNMENT,
PROPOSED.</head>

                  <p>That if the whole People shall so give up their
Lands, they be divided into twelve equal Precincts, called
Tribes.</p>
                  <p>That the man of greatest quality in every Tribe have about
ten thousand pounds a year given unto him and his heirs, with
the hereditary Dignity of Prince of his Tribe.</p>
                  <p>That some ten other men of the next quality under the
Prince in every Tribe, have about two thousand pounds a year
in the same given unto each of them and their heirs, with the

                  <p>That the remaining part of the Lands, except forty eight
Cities and their Suburbs, be distributed unto the whole People
equally by Lots.</p>
                  <p>That it be not lawful for any Prince, Patriarch, or other,
to sell or alienate his Land, or any part thereof, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

return unto the ancient possessors or lawful heirs.</p>

Lands at all, except the forty eight Cities above reserved,

these be setled upon them and their heirs for ever, besides the
annual Tithe of the whole Territory, and a piece of Money
every year upon every Head under the notion of an Offering,
in regard that other Offerings are now unlawful; and
that this Tribe consist of Clergy, having one hereditary
Archbishop, or High-Priest, for the Head and Prince of their
Tribe.</p>

onely; and that the Clergy being best skilled in this Law, be
eligible into all Courts of Justice, all Magistracies and Offices
whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>That the Prince of a Tribe, together with one or more
Courts, consisting of twenty three Judges elected by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that Tribe for life, be the Government of the same.</p>
                  <p>That the People of the twelve local Divisions, take by the
Ballot wise men and understanding among their Tribes, and
of these constitute a <hi>Senate</hi> for the whole Common-wealth,

their own number; and that these Elections amounting in all
unto four and twenty thousand, assemble at the Metropolis or
Capital City, and be the monethly Representative of the
People.</p>

That the Senate be a standing Judicatory of Appeal from

Magistracy or office of a Knight, and of a Burgess, be in  this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

regard only such elections as are National or Domestick, and
not such as are Forein, or contained in the P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

health, and of one third part in a time of sickness, being so
declared by the Senate.</p>
               <p>The use of the Ballot, being as full of prolixity and abstruse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

throughout all elections and results in this Model, and
for the rest referr'd rather unto practice than writing. There re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>main

OR
The use of these
PROPOSITIONS.</head>
            <p>THese propositions are so layd out to debate or examination, that
a man having the mind to weigh discourse upon, or object
against this Model, may do it in the parts with the most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
            <p>Any examination of, or objection against the whole, or any
part in print or in writing, the Author holdeth himself bound to
acknowlege, or answer: But as to meer discourse upon matters of
this compass it is usually narrow: besides that in writing a Man
must put himself upon hetter aym, than he can be obliged to
take in discourse.</p>
            <p>Any one objection lying in writing against any one Order in
this part of the Model, after such manner as to shew that the
part or Order so invaded ought to be expunged, altered, or amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
unless it may be expunged, altered, or amended accordingly,
destroyeth the whole.</p>
            <p>And any one or more objections so lying against any oue or
more of these orders or propositions, that thereby they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged,
altered or amended, must in the whole or in part make a
better Model.</p>
            <p>In this case therefore, or in case no Objection ly, the use of these
propositions will be such, as thereby any Man or any assembly of
men, considering or debating upon them in order, may find or
make a true Model of a well-ordered Common-Wealth.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59396:12"/>
And that an Assembly can never make, or frame a Model of
any Government otherwise than in some such manner, is prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
first by a Demonstration from the effect; and secondly by a
Demonstration from the cause.</p>
            <p>The demonstration from the effect is, that an Assembly no
otherwise frameth a Law, or Order, than by having it first pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by some one man, and then judging upon it, and the Model
of a Common-wealth must consist of many Laws or Orders.</p>
            <p>The demonstration from the cause is, that whereas reason
consisteth of two parts, the one Invention, and the other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a man may be as far beyond any Assembly for Invention,
as any Assembly can be beyond a man for Judgement; or which
is more, that the formation of a Model of Government requireth
a strong faculty of Invention, and that an Assembly is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voyd of all manner of Invention.</p>
