            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some things of weighty concernment Proposed in Meeknes and love by way of Queries to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration of the inhabitants of Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen, which also may be of use to such as are of the same mind with them, elce where in this Nation.</head>
            <head type="sub">Added by way of Appendix to a Book intituled TRUTH CLEARED OF CALUMNIES.</head>
            <p>Question 1.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether it be a thing any wise warrantable <hi>in common equity,</hi> or tru Christianity, for any person, or persons, to take liberty, both in <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and <hi>print,</hi> to speak against a people as dangerous, and <hi>Hereticall,</hi> and yet wholly to debar that people from vindicating themselves, in either of these wayes, so far as they can? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be supposed, that any persons, except they wholly give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Implicitly, to beleive the accusers can make a true <hi>Judgement,</hi> in that case, upon the accused, especially considering that maxime of law. <hi>Quicunque inaudita altera parte, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. Hee that without hearing both parties, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth judgement, though hee decide the right upon the matter, hath not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the part of a just Judge, to which ad the consideration of these passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. Thess: 5.21. Prov: 18.13. Isayah 41:21.</p>
            <p>Qu. 2. Whether then it was not contrary to the laws both divine, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, for the <hi>Priests</hi> in Aberdeen, to importune the <hi>Magistrats</hi> to make search for that Booke lately published in vindication of the people called <hi>Quakers?</hi> Or whether such a practise hath any warrant, except what flowes originally from the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> as being directly contrary to equity, and to the Scriptures above mentioned?</p>
            <p>Qu. 3. Whether also it was not both <hi>Antiscripturall</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> in G. M. to prohibit his hearers from reading of that Booke, by compareing it with <hi>Poyson?</hi> Whether that was not to keep people in darknes, and dependance upon him? or with how little reason could he desire such a thing considering hee asserted it to contain, an ample <hi>Confession,</hi> of all those <hi>Errors</hi> hee had <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them with? And if so, whether it be likely, that it could prove dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:60776:2"/>
the <hi>Errors</hi> being soo gross and monstrous, which by him, and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> are charged upon that people, that their confessing them, would rather scare people, then engage any to like them?</p>
            <p>Qu. 4. And whether H. M. his bidding people abstain from that Book as poison, without tryall of what is in it, be not like unto the <hi>Papists</hi> way, who bid their neighbours abstaine from the <hi>Protestants</hi> books as poison? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may not even poison be tryed (though not by eating it) in a way that is not hazzardous to the tryer, especially seeing that which som may call poison, may be afterward found by sound tryall, to be <hi>good and wholesom food,</hi> yea <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin</hi> te expell such poisonable <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as your <hi>Priests</hi> infuse into people?</p>
            <p>Qu. 5. And seeing G. M. bids his hearers abstain from the <hi>Quakers</hi> words as from poison, doth hee not endanger such to be poisoned, whom hee sends, or allowes to come to our meetings, to hear what is spoke? and what knoweth G. M. but his spyes, may be touched, so that it may be said, as it was then, <hi>is Saul also among the Prophets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. 6. And seeing G. M. counts our words as poison, why doth hee bring them forth so much among his hearers, if hee thinks hee gives strong <hi>Antidots</hi> against them, I have heard some of his own hearers say, that, that which hee calls the poison, wrought more effectually to persuade, even out of his mouth, then all his <hi>Antidots</hi> could doe to diswade?</p>
            <p>Qu. 7. Whether the latter part of that allegance of G. M. (viz. that all they had charged on the <hi>Quakers,</hi> was confessed to, in that book) be not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest untruth, in respect the greatest charges alledged by him, against the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> are therin utterly denyed. As for instance, the matter of <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> in page 25. the matter of <hi>Popery</hi> in page 34. and of <hi>Arminianisme</hi> pag. 65, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Qu. 8. Whether the said G. M. hath not manifested very much deceit, in saying also publikly, that the said book asserts it, not only to be a thing easy, but pleasant for wicked people, to keep holy <hi>the Sabbath day,</hi> and to perform the spirituall duties commanded to be performed theron, unles hee understands them to be, simply the dispensing to hear a man talke an hour or two, and to have all the rest of the day to spend in idlenes, vain communication, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the alehouse, &amp;c. Which are the words mentioned page 72.</p>
            <p>Qu. 9. Whether it be any way unsutable to the <hi>law of charitie,</hi> or to the meek <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to use plain, and downright dealing calling <hi>a Ly a Ly?</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any be to be blamed, for so doeing, considering the practise of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of Christs and of his Apostles, how sharply they dealt with false teachers as may appear by these Scriptures? Isai. 56.11. Lev. 23. to vers. 33. Ezek. 34. Hos. 4. from 6. to 10. ibid. 5.1. Mich. 3; 5. Mat. 3.7. Joh 8.</p>
            <p>Qu. 10. Whether then they be not prejudiced, who accuse the <hi>Quakers</hi> for useing the same terms, seeing they are willing to make the application mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, by comparing the fruits of the present pretended Preachers, with those that wer of old? As for instance, whether it be a breach either of morall civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or Christian meeknes to say <hi>John Menzies</hi> lyed in asserting <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> to have been educated in a <hi>Jesuits</hi> Colledge, seeing it is utterly false?</p>
            <p>Qu. 11. And whether <hi>David Lyall,</hi> may not be judged more guilty of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb facs="tcp:60776:2"/>
rashnes and envy, then any of us of the breach of civilitie to reprove him for it, who that hee might not want something to say, against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> alledged a notorious untruth upon God, in saying, that <hi>the God of Heaven shut the mouths of all the Quakers, that not one word was spoke among them, as their last monthly meeting, the</hi> 3. <hi>of the</hi> 11. <hi>month</hi>; which divers of their own Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, can witnes to be a ly?</p>
            <p>Qu. 12. Whether it be not a far greater breach of <hi>Charity</hi> in the <hi>Priests</hi> of Aberdeen, not only to speake all manner of evill falsly against that people in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> but also ther to stirre up both Magistrats and people to imprison and persecut them? Whether that be not more like the Practice of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> and of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver Smith then the <hi>Ministers of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. 13. Whether <hi>beating, striking, punching, pulling out of hair,</hi> and that openly in the streets, threatning to stone and pistoll their sober <hi>innocent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and boasting that tho they should doe so, they should be under no haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the <hi>law,</hi> be like the fruits of <hi>Christs flocke?</hi> Or whether such practises, and boastings, be not more abusive of, and destructive to Magistracy, then meeting together in <hi>sobrietie,</hi> and <hi>Gods fear,</hi> to wait upon him, and edifie one another, which is expressy commanded, Heb. 10. or if such actings be not liker <hi>John a Leyden,</hi> and the tumults, and cruelties of <hi>Munster,</hi> then any thing that can be proved against the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. 14. Whether <hi>singing, dancing, swearing, asking if the spirit be come, whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>saying</hi> the <hi>spirit's</hi> upon them, in the <hi>Quakers</hi> meeting, be not <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and <hi>Atheisticall</hi> and interruptions far of another nature, then for honest men in seriousnes to stand up in your meeting houses, after your preaching is ended, and preach <hi>Repentance,</hi> seeing these practises above mentioned evidence how much yee stand in need of such an <hi>Advertisment,</hi> and both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> would say, it deserved, more civill and Christian usage, then Imprisonment or a pair of <hi>stocks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. 15. Whether <hi>David Lyall,</hi> his expressions, intimating his fears of the increase of <hi>Preachers,</hi> doth not show him contrarie to the <hi>Spirit of Moses</hi> who wished all the <hi>Lords</hi> people might be <hi>Prophets,</hi> and to the <hi>Apostle Paull</hi> 1. Cor. 14:29. <hi>Yee may all Prophesie one by one,</hi> and to <hi>Luther</hi> and many of the first <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> and <hi>Martirs,</hi> who held preaching to be the commen priviledge af <hi>Christians,</hi> and so many of them being <hi>Tradesmen</hi> did preach, judging it no <hi>inconsistance,</hi> though this generation of loftie <hi>Priests,</hi> (who may well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, in many things to those <hi>idle Shaveli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs,</hi> whom <hi>Luther</hi> reproves) are loath to admitt of any such thing? knowing if it once should be supposed, that <hi>Trad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>smen</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>Ploughmen</hi> should preach, it would also follow that <hi>Preachers</hi> might be Tradesmen, and so win their living with their hands, as did the <hi>Apostle.</hi> 2. Cor. 4:12. ibid. 9:18. Whether if so, it be not probable fewer would be ambitious of that office, then now are, and that there would be no such gapeing for <hi>presentations,</hi> the desireable baites of <hi>Stipends</hi> being removed, and as it would abate the pride and sumptuousnes of the <hi>Priests,</hi> so it would clip shorter the strypt silk petticoats of their wives, and other gawdy apparell of their children?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60776:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Qu. 16. Whether it can then pertinently be objected as a token of pride against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they preach <hi>Repentance</hi> especially against their doeing it without study, or premeditation, as if trusting to the Spirit of God for utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were pride, which is expressly allowed commanded, and practised in the Script. Luc. 21:14, 15. Acts 2:4. 1. Cor. 2:14. and 1. Cor. 14:29. 1. Pet. 4:11?</p>
            <p>Qu. 17. Whether that doth not homologate the <hi>Popish</hi> argument for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy alledging it to be pride for men to addresse themselves in <hi>Prayers</hi> framed <hi>Ex tempore,</hi> seeing there are <hi>Prayers</hi> framed by the <hi>Church,</hi> and by <hi>learned men,</hi> heertofore (as they say) better then privat men can make off hand, containing what ever is applicable to the condition of any Soule? Or whether it may not by the same argument be pressed upon <hi>David Lyall,</hi> as a point of pride, for him, or his Brethren, to use any <hi>Prayer,</hi> except that examplar, left by <hi>Christ,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> seeing they themselves make the extent of it so large, as ther can be no condition of any particular person, which they will not reduce to some of the heads of it, and that enlargements, and <hi>Tautologies</hi> to God, are not only vain, and needles, but also by himselfe prohibited?</p>
            <p>Qu. 18. And whether it savours more of pride, to preach without premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which is but a speaking unto <hi>man,</hi> then to pray without premeditation, which is a speaking unto <hi>God?</hi> And seeing <hi>David Lyall</hi> and his Brethren pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and without premeditation, of any conceived forme of prayer, may it not be laid at his and their door, first to clear themselves of pride, as to this matter, especially when they doe not pretend to pray by the <hi>immediate teaching and leading of the Spirit,</hi> in which the only true <hi>Prayer</hi> is framed, that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God?</p>
            <p>Qu. 19. Whether or no it did not as well expresse a mind filled with <hi>Pride</hi> as containe a manifest impertinency, for the same <hi>David Lyall</hi> to alledge as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Quakers</hi> pride, that a <hi>little black fellow</hi> came into the Church (<hi>such were his expressions</hi>) whether these words I say savour not as little of <hi>Humility,</hi> as the thing it selfe is void of <hi>Reason,</hi> that either <hi>littlnes</hi> of <hi>bodie, blacknes</hi> of <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>meannes</hi> of <hi>outward Extract</hi> (for so I think hee means by fellow) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistant with the <hi>esse,</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Preacher,</hi> which if they had its probable himselfe could hardly have beene admitted to be one?</p>
            <p>Qu. 20. Whether if such words and expressions be the fruits of premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and study, <hi>(which these men cry up so much, and judge so needfull)</hi> it deserves that esteeme they would have put upon it, or upon themselves because therof; especially considering, many more <hi>impertinencies,</hi> and <hi>inconsistencies</hi> used by them, in their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> witnes that one mentioned upon the same occasion, by the aforsaid <hi>D. L.</hi> to witt that its better to be <hi>an humble Devill,</hi> then <hi>a proud Saint</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if used by a <hi>School-boy,</hi> would have deserved hissing, if not whips, as being <hi>Repugnantia in adjecto.</hi>

            <p>Let <hi>David Lyall, George Meldrum, John Menzies, three Preists in Aberdeen, who have lately most appeared in Pulpit against them called Quakers, and among all their fellow-preists are here in mostly concerned, answer these Queries, if they can, without using those shifts and tergiversations, which the Papists used against the Primitive Reformers.</hi>
