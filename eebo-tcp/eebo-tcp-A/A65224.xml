            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>In spite of you, lie lurking in it stil.</l>
            <l>Christs Church is likened by him to a field</l>

            <l>You'l say, by Tares is meant the hypocrite,</l>

            <l>Whereas the wicked is so easily known,</l>
            <l>We may and ought shun his communion.</l>
            <l>Why then did Christ into his fellowship</l>
            <l>Take <hi>Judas,</hi> suffer him to kisse his lip,</l>
            <l>Cal him by'th' name of friend, nay give him leave</l>

            <l>He had conceiv'd, which made him up a divel?</l>
            <l>And so no hypocrite to Christ was he:</l>

            <l>This only so falls out by accident,</l>

            <l>With power, notorious sinners to restraine,</l>

            <l>More traitors then are faithful, twelve to one,</l>
            <l>How can we then make separation?</l>
            <l>For if we wil not partial be, but just,</l>
            <l>Scarce one of twelve into our flock we must</l>
            <l>Receive; and then how many little flocks</l>

            <l>THis day my Lord rose early from the dead,</l>
            <l>Whiles I securely sleep in my soft bed,</l>
            <l>Not dreaming what he did my soule to save</l>
            <l>Which lay long dead, and buried in the grave</l>
            <l>Of sin. Haste then my soule, and take new breath</l>
            <l>From Christ, to raise thee from this spiritual death;</l>
            <l>Up with the break of day, and break thy chains</l>
            <l>Made by thy sins, and wash away thy staines</l>
            <l>In that pure fountain which was opened wide,</l>
            <l>And runs yet fresh out of thy Saviours side.</l>

            <l>Ne're to contract more drosse from earth again,</l>
            <l>Clear and unspotted as the light remain;</l>
            <l>So when that Christ to judg the world shall come,</l>
            <l>Thou shalt not tremble at the day of doom,</l>
            <l>But boldly stand before the judg, and hear</l>
            <l>The final sentence publisht without fear;</l>

            <head>The Accident.</head>
            <l>WAs it by negligence, or accident,</l>
            <l>That in my sicknesse as my servant went</l>
            <l>To warme my bed, some ashes she let fall?</l>
            <l>Neither perhaps, but 'twas prophetical,</l>
            <l>Foretelling that I must to ashes turn,</l>
            <l>And shortly be inclosed in my urne.</l>
            <l>And if that providence hath so decreed,</l>
            <l>Welcome i'th' name of God, let Death succeed</l>
            <l>His elder brother, Sleep, and then give way</l>
            <l>To Life again, such as the saints enjoy.</l>
            <l>Now on my grave I think, and yet not quake,</l>
            <l>Since thence as from my bed I shal awake;</l>
            <l>When I lie down in dust I doe not die,</l>
            <l>But take a nap, and rise t' eternity;</l>
            <l>My soul shall reassume it's dust again,</l>
            <l>And in a blessed union stil remain.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>WHat shal I render unto thee my God?</l>
               <l>Since thou hast with thy rod</l>
               <l>In measure me corrected, to prevent</l>
               <l>A sharper punishment,</l>
               <l>That I may not condemned be at last,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Seven violent fits I had, to shew that I</l>
               <l>Am mortal, and must die:</l>
               <l>But then such was thy wil, I had no more,</l>
               <l>Thou Lord didst me restore</l>
               <l>To health, and having brought me neer the grave,</l>
               <l>Declaredst then thy mighty power to save.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How much thy mercy doth thy justice passe?</l>
               <l>A sinful man I was,</l>
               <l>Seven times a day I have offended thee,</l>
               <l>Yet thou forgavest me;</l>
               <l>Yea though my sins exceed the stars of heaven,</l>

               <l>Justly I cannot count</l>
               <l>Them altogether half a plague, they goe</l>

               <l>That like a Tree on both sides rock't by th' wind,</l>

            <head>The Conclusion. To my dread Soveraigne And deer Master, CHRIST JESUS, King of Kings.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THou King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</l>
               <l>I owe my self and all I have to Thee,</l>
               <l>My Muse no tribute now affords,</l>
               <l>But what first comes from thine own Treasurie,</l>
               <l>A leafe of praise</l>
               <l>Is all that I can raise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet that leafe is taken from</l>
               <l>Thy Tree of grace thou graftedst in my heart,</l>
               <l>Accept it then, since it doth come</l>
               <l>From that stock which to me thou didst impart;</l>
               <l>It is thine own,</l>
               <l>To all the world be't known.</l>

               <l>I do confesse the ground in which</l>
               <l>'Tis set, is poor, and long hath barren been,</l>
               <l>

               <l>When nought but thorns and thistles grew therein?</l>
               <l>O let thy grace</l>
               <l>Above my sins take place,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And in my heart the upper hand</l>
               <l>Let it stil have, a happy victorie,</l>
               <l>That I thy Champion may stand</l>
