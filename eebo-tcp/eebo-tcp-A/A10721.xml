            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST WORTHY, the moſt vertuous and godly Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> by the grace of God, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwell,</hi> Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Realmes of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France and Ireland.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt worthy &amp; moſt renowned Prince, there is nothing more pleaſing to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit endued with knowledge, then <hi>Truth</hi> when ſhe is moſt bare and naked.</p>
            <p>The pure Corall needes no colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and a good cauſe it ſelfe bringeth credit, it needeth not the help of Art.</p>
            <p>The deceitful Phiſitian giueth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Syriopes, to make his poyſon to goe downe the ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſweet ſongs of <hi>Calipſo,</hi> were but ſubtill ſnares to <hi>Vliſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An oylie mouth may haue a gaulding minde, and it ſeemeth vnto me, that theſe profeſſors of Eloquence are to be ſuſpected, and their ſtraining of words and ſentences (as it were to ſet them on the Teynter) doth ſhewethe little plaine dealing that is within them.</p>
            <p>Yet I would not ſeeme to take the Penne out of his hand that doth write of Eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for that were as if a man ſhuld labour to take the lightning from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or to ſeeke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the fire of his heate.</p>
            <p>And Art (I know) is the Pilot in the ſea of wit: Art is the ſword to conquere Ignorance: and Art is the ſole directer when the worlde would erre. But yet to vſe ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eoquence, in a matter of ſufficient excellency, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew of a pregnant wit, then of a perfect wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Now ſithens my abilitie ſerueth to no better purpoſe, then to ſet foorth in this kind of writing thoſe experiments which 40. yeares training in the warres hath taught me, I haue not vndertaken as a ſubtill Logitian, for I neuer lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe places from whence arguments are drawne.</p>
            <p>Thoſe haue need of artificial ſpeeches, who with pleaſing words do go about to couer diſhoneſt deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20487:3"/>
The matters by me handled, I haue ſet downe plainly, I haue neither floriſhed them with Art, nor ſmoothed them with Flattery.</p>
            <p>I haue graſped at abuſe: yet vnder generalities, not aiming at any one particularly, that hath not a guiltie conſcience to accuſe himſelfe, I haue winked at ſomewhat, leaſt I might ſeeme curious, and haue pretermitted neceſſities, in that they require matter paſſing my reach: neither doe I ſeeke heerein the praiſe of mine owne wit, but to declare the loue I beare to my Countrie, and the dutifull zeale I tender, (and withal humblenes I here preſent) to your excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t highnes.</p>
            <p>If my vnlettered diligence be gratiouſly accepted, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare the ſpightfull eye of Enuie, neither yet the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any others in thoſe things, which I haue onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to your gratious vewe.</p>
            <p>I acknowldge mine owne vnworthineſſe, and I confeſſe my little skill and abilitie to performe, but it is a gratious acceptance, that incourageth me, for <hi>I</hi> aſſure my ſelfe, that a magnificent and princely minde cannot want in him that is deſcended from ſo magnificent and princely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: <hi>Alexander</hi> diſdained not to be praiſed by a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſubiect is not altogether vnneceſſarie to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, for it concerneth the affaires of warre, a knowledge behouefull for the greateſt Monarch, when a King is not ſo much renowned for his crowne, as for his courage and ſkill in the knowledge of armes.</p>
            <p>For although all the giftes of Fortune are to be deſpiſed in reſpect of learning, yet in a Prince, there is nothing ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to be called a great Captaine, or a worthy ſouldier.</p>
            <p>Accept them (gratious Prince) as the earneſt penny of a faithfull heart, accept them and protect them from the malitious interpretour, accept them (with all humbleneſſe <hi>I</hi> beſeech it) for his ſake, that with all loue and dutie will daily pray, that as you are knowne to be deſcended from a moſt royall and princely progenie, and to be the vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heire of your worthie fathers Crowne and Scepter, ſo you may growe in renowne &amp; honour equall to your aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, &amp; may ſucceed your royall parents in their vertues.</p>

               <p>Warre is to be vndertaken but to the end to haue peace, and for matters in clayme, in defence of libertie, and ſuch other like, aſwell the lawes of nature as the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doth admit it.</p>
               <p>For theſe diſtinctions I will leaue them to Diuines, but warre is euermore attended on by Sword, Fyre, Famine, and Murther: the ſinnes of the people is it that giueth the firſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum, and vnſheatheth the ſouldiers ſword, and warre hauing once diſplayed his Banner, it is the iuſtice of the cauſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth it eyther to be good or bad.</p>
               <p>But yet the obtaining of a victory is not a ſure confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this right &amp; equity, for when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered together in <hi>Silo,</hi> to puniſh the ſhamefull ſodometry of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> they loſt in two ſeueral battells 40000.

               <p>By warre to ſubdue a forraine foe, the conqueſt is glorious, but in ciuill warre there is nothing more miſerable then vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
               <p>The practiſe and knowledge of Armes, hath euer béene carefully indeuoured in all ages, and in euery well gouerned Common-wealth, when by it Empires haue béene attained, Kingdomes inlarged, the ſtraights of <hi>Pontus</hi> hath béene ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the incloſures of the Alpes broken vp.</p>
               <p>By it Princes are protected, Iuſtice is maintained, good lawes preſerued, and the Common-wealth defended.</p>
               <p>Great is the knowledge of Armes therefore, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceſſary, immediatly after the knowledge of God, then to knowe how to mannage our martiall cauſes, and as in euery action it is odious is erre, ſo in warres it is moſt daungerous of all other, becauſe that one miſtaking is ynough to ouerthrowe a whole Armie, whereon might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the wracke of a Common-wealth, and the loſſe of a Princes Crowne.</p>
               <p>Warre and the Soule communicates in this, that both of them are in their ſimple natures hardly found out, but are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined by their effects.</p>
               <p>Nothing waxeth young in this world but warre, neyther hath arte euer ſought out a ſubiect more ambiguous, for with the Camelion it changeth according to the obiect, and like an impoſſible infinit in nature, carrieth his euents beyond the reache of coniecture.</p>
               <p>In the heauens it worketh harmony, on the earth peace, it is the hand of deſteny to inforce chaunge, the ſcourge of God to puniſh ſinnes, the true adamant that draweth courage vnto it, and a Baſilique to feare that dyes to behold it: It is oyle in the ſtomacke that hath diſgeſted poyſon, as a medecine to a body that is choaked vp with corrupt humours, as a Fyre to the mettall that wants refining, as exerciſe to the body growne purſie with ydleneſſe, it is the Theater wheron Nobilitie was

borne to ſhew himſelfe, a glaſſe wherein policie eſpieth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, the worſt and beſt that euer Fortune could promiſe her fauourites.</p>
               <p>The ſurfits of peace firſt quickened it, and tyrany that gaue it ſucke, periſhed in cheriſhing it.</p>
               <p>It began in heauen, in the rebellion of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> it preſumed vpon <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> betwéene the firſt man, and the Angell, in <hi>Shinare</hi> ambition made <hi>Nymrod</hi> embrace it: Neare <hi>Sodom</hi> affection cauſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to entertaine it: Sithens in the world it hath béene the Key of alterations, the diſpoſer and ſpoyler of Monarchies, the founder of obſcurities, the worker of miracles.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo intire, that it hath not ſeparated, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo diſſolued that it could not reconcile.</p>
               <p>Peace vnto it, is as <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollax</hi> in a ſtorme, a hope of ſafetie, warre vnto peace, as a motion to reſt, the meanes to produce it.</p>
               <p>It fauoureth not the multitude of men, but reſpects the value, and ſuffers valour ſometimes to periſh in the armes of a fearefull multitude: it is the ſcourge of ſecuritie, the plague of timerites, the end of hatreds, and the beginning of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p>It fauoureth iniuſtice, and oppreſſeth innocents, it ſtrikes as God willes, workes as ſinne warpes it: briefly, a miſerable neceſſitie in nature, and a neceſſary corrector of times infirmitie.</p>

               <p>Next, it is as behoouefull for that Prince that will tye his Generall to ſtraight limits, that he doo likewiſe very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly inſtruct and direct him in thoſe ſeruices he hath to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, which is almoſt impoſſible for him to doo: for how ſhould men that are ignorant themſelues in the affaires of warre, preſcribe their Generalls what they ſhould do, or what they ſhould not doo? or how ſhould thoſe that are abſent, giue preſcriptions to him that is and muſt be in preſent view, and not bereaue him of thoſe aduantages that the varietie of times and occaſions may offer?</p>

               <p>The matter is, when they haue plaid the fraitors, and haue ſtood out in open rebellion, and that they haue beene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with great expence of treaſure, and haue béene brought (as it were) to the laſt gaſpe, not longer able to endure, then to take breath, and to ſupply themſelues againe with their further practiſes they pretend humilitie, and they will make choyce of ſome ſpeciall man ſometimes perhaps of ſome great Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of that Realme, or of ſome other great Commaunder of that part of the countrey, where themſelues are abiding: but ſuch a one they will ſtill make choyce on, as they will bée ſure ſhall be well be friended, as well at the Councell Table of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as otherwiſe in the Court of England: To him they will pretend great ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>They will deſire him to be a meane for a pardon, they will make great offers and proteſtations of their future fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they will ſay they will deſerue, and they will put in pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for ſecuritie: perhaps they will giue their Procurador, a ſcore of Beeues, or a brace of faire Horſe.</p>
               <p>This Councellor, or Commaunder, or whoſoeuer looking into his owne lands, &amp; ſeeing them euery day waſted (or at the leaſt in danger to be ſpoiled) by this traitor y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> now eraueth his aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is glad to imbrace his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, together with his ſute,

and howſoeuer he thinketh the Rebell wil holde promiſe with the Prince, he is ſure in the meane time his tenants and himſelfe ſhal be ſpared from ſpoile.</p>
               <p>Héere he calleth to minde againe how acceptable a péece of ſeruice it is accounted to bring in a Traytor, how much it will redounde to his reputation, when it ſhal be reported what a notable rebell hee hath brought in, how highlie it ſhall aduance his credit, and how his friends in the Courte of England ſhall reioyce and glorifie his ſeruice, con men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to the eares of his Soueraigne Prince, whome they haue made beleeue what a ſparing it ſhoulde bee as well of monie as of manie mens liues, that the Traytor ſhoulde thus be receiued to giue the matter the better grace, they wil tell what wonderful ſeruice by his meanes might after bee performed, and how manye ill diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will bee diſmaied and terrifyed vpon his comming in.</p>
               <p>There is no opportunitie left, nor no labour be ſpared till a pardon be purchaſed, which being once attained, the Traitor is brought in, and where in his action of rebellion, he was able to furniſh the field, with foure hundred, ſix hundred, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand traitors, he is not now able to ſerue his Prince with ſix true men: but he ſerueth his purpoſe, and watching his time, goeth out againe, and wil after be thrée times more chargeable then he was before.</p>
               <p>Theſe be no nouelties, nor no rare and dainty matters to be found, when there be an infinit number of preſidents, that might be inferd; how our gratious Quene by this means haue bene abuſed.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would in no wiſe admit that <hi>Diomides</hi> ſhould be accounted either Valiant or wiſe, for that when the Crakes were put to flight, he remained alone, and aduentured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the Force of <hi>Hector,</hi> which he did rather to ſake the vaine praiſe of the people, becauſe he would not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a runne away, then for the true and ſoueraigne good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth the end of vertue.</p>

               <p>Héere is now a matter worthy the noting, that <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> being but a Heathen, would not admitte of this vaine oftentation, and as he had not the true knowledge of God, ſo

               <p>Out of theſe concluſions choſe I a Souldier, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> do their Wiſe men, in that (as they vainly imagine) can no wayes erre.</p>

               <p>But as from the beginning, the hatred and malice of men one towards another hath continually increaſed, ſo with this rage and furie, they haue not failed from time to time, to practiſe new inuentions whereby to kill and murther, and to this purpoſe they haue till deuiſed weapons, euerie one of more aduantage then other.</p>
               <p>At the firſt before weapons were knowne, they avenged themſelues with teeth and naile, after they began to fight with ſtaues and clubbes, then they found out the forging both of weapons and armours, and from age to age, new inuentions of ſwordes, Iauelins, billes, pikes, and other manual weayons were found out and practiſed by ſundrie men at ſeueral times, entertaining ſtil thoſe weapons in vſe, which they ſound to be of greateſt force and moſt aduantage.</p>

               <p>Thoſe formes and proportions that were vſed when they had no other incounters but with manuall and ſhort weapons (and that the hope of victorie conſiſted in the vigor and ſtrength of mens armes, and in his ſkil that could bring moſt handes to fight) would be now to little purpoſe, when the mightieſt troupes and ſquadrons may be ſo diſcomfited with the furie of ſhotte, that they ſhal neuer be able to ſtrike one ſtroke.</p>

               <p>Since life is the race, wherein we ſtriue to obtaine honour, and death is the tearme whereby our honours are crowned, I will ſpeake of life as it ſhould be confirmed to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and of death as the true gate of felicitie.</p>
               <p>Life ſaieth the Philoſopher is but a borrowed dreame of pleaſure, wherein we apprchend all things incertainly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſwiſt and irrecouerable chaunges thereof.</p>
               <p>It is a race wherein the wicked man ſeeketh to ouerthrowe the good, and the good man that ſtandeth on his feete, will not helpe the good man that fieth on the ground.</p>
               <p>It is a viſion of delight that vaniſheth in imagination, a warfare of vncertaintie, and a way to death.</p>
               <p>In life there is no diſtinction either of greatnes or abiectnes, for the begger in life, hath as great intereſt as the King.</p>

               <p>Wretched is that life, which hath but a time to liue, and that in death, a life without the which death had not béene.</p>

               <p>The ſhortneſſe thereof is redeemed by the vſe, for Life well imploied is a preuention of Death.</p>
               <p>As for Death, what is it but a bleſſed neceſſitie to the good man, and a fearefull enemie to the euill?</p>
               <p>There is nothing more certaine to fleſh &amp; blood, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Death, &amp; nothing more fearful to fooles, then to thinke they muſt die, when it is but a paſſage to a better life: And how happy is that death, which leadeth to that life, which is not ſubiect to death?</p>
               <p>It is a ſeperation from an vncertaine to an aſſured eſtate, a retrail wherein Honour liueth, and obſcuritie ſléepeth: A Harbinger, aſſigning reſt without payment, A Gate, to that felicitie the ſoule longeth for.</p>
