         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

without Name of Authour: the

Who not suspecting the said Booke to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties

of some of his Ministers about him, thought it not
fit to publish this his answere in his owne, but in the
name of the foresaid <hi>Matthaeus Tortus.</hi> But when in
the yeare 1609. his Maiesty (hauing now seene these
answers to his booke come forth) resolued to publish
anew his said Apology, with a large Preface or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<hi>To all Christian Princes &amp;c.</hi> he therwithall

they did. And that in English he committed to <hi>M.
Doctor Barlow,</hi> who made Answere therto, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
it the same yeare 1609. but how substantially
he hath performed the same, may perhaps be shortly
examined. The other in latin of the forsaid <hi>Matthaeus

confuted, this present yeare 1610. And for that
the said Fathers Booke is very short, &amp; written in

            <head>THE
CONFVTATION
OF
TORTVRA TORTI:
OR, AGAINST
the King of England his Chaplaine.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV haue written a booke
of late in defence of your
King, against <hi>Matthaeus

Tortus.) You discouer not
your Name, but insinuate
your self to be a Chaplaine,
Alm-nour, or Tormentor. I
(because it is more honorable) wil cal you Chaplaine.
In the said Book you dispute principally of three heads.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23323:5"/>
FIRST, of the Oath of Allegiance, which your King<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Supremacy in Ecclesiasticall (or Spirituall) matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
THIRDLY, of the Popes power. If we consider
your words, yow are neat and elegant inough: if you<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
labour and diligence, I accuse you not of idlenes. But
many other things there are, which I do not so wel<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
approue; especially these. First, that you are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
giuen to reproaching and taunting. Secondly,
that you do euery where insert many falsities and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities.
Thirdly, that you rather ouerthrow, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
your Kings Supremacy, which you would
fortify: which is as foule a fault as may be. Of these
three heades then, will I treat in order.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Of the Chaplaines Reproaches.</item>
               <item>2. Of his Paradoxes.</item>
               <item>3. Of the Kinges Supremacy ouerthrowne by
him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I trust you will pardon me, Syr, if I modestly set
before your eyes these three thinges; as well for your
owne benefit as others. For your owne, that hereby
you may know your selfe, and, if it be possible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hereafter more wise. For others, that they may
learne not so lightly to trust you, who haue so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and so fouly faultred in things of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Heare me then patiently.</p>

               <head>THE
FIRST CHAPTER:</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Chaplaines Reproaches.</head>
               <p>STRAIGHT then in the entrance of your <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
you reprehended <hi>Matthaeus Tortus,</hi> that he is
altogeather full of railings and reproaches. For
thus you writ of him: <hi>Per librum totum ita petulans,
ita immodestè immodestus, ita totus in conuitijs, facilè vt
quiuis, Matthaeum Tortum esse, possit intelligere &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>Throughout all his booke so impudent he is, so imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
immodest, so wholy giuen to reproaches, that
euery man may easily perceaue him to be <hi>Matthew
Tortus</hi> &amp;c.</q> But you, Syr, do farre surpasse <hi>Matthaeus
Tortus</hi> in this kind. You spare no man. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
all with some reproach or other, where the least
occasion is offered. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. you call <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi>
Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine, a Vow-breaker, D. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
the <hi>greatest lyer of all men liuing, Edmund Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
and others who haue suffered martyrdome for the
Catholick fayth, you call <hi>Traytors.</hi> The Iesuites, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of most outragious wickednes,</hi> the Catholicks you
tearme <hi>the race of</hi> Malchus, <hi>who hauing their right
eares cut of, do heare and interpret all with the left.</hi> I
pretermit, what you haue malepertly vttered against
<hi>Matthaeus Tortus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. These and the like reproaches, which are very
familiar with you, as I perceaue, do not beseeme an
honest man; much lesse the Chaplaine or Almenour
of a King: yet perhaps do they not altogeather mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23323:6"/>
a Tormentor. Neyther may you excuse your
selfe by the example of <hi>Matthew Tortus,</hi> as though he
had first prouoked you to these reproaches. First it is
nothing so: and secondly if it had byn so: what? do
you thinke it the part of a Christian man to requite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
with euill? Truely the Apostle taught vs other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
Rom. 12. 17. <hi>Nulli malum pro malo reddentes,</hi>
to wit, that we should not render euill for euill to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man. And lastly, if you would haue done so,
why haue you not spared others? Was not one <hi>Tortus</hi>
inough for you to torture, vnlesse with the like liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you railed vpon others also? Hereafter therfore
abstaine from the like, and giue eare to that of the
Wiseman, Prouerb. 21. 23. <hi>Qui custodit os suum, &amp;
linguam suam, custodit ab angustijs animam suam.</hi> He
that keepeth his mouth and his tongue, doth preserue
his soule from distresse. And againe Matth. 12. 35.
<hi>Ex abundantia cordis os loquitur. Bonus homo, de bono
thesauro profert bona; &amp; malus homo de malo thesauro
profert mala.</hi> Of the aboundance of the hart the

               <p>AFTER your reproaches and railings, follow
your Paradoxes, which are many in your
booke: but especially these.</p>
               <p>1. That the Puritans in England doe sincerely
sweare to the Kings Supremacy.</p>
               <p>2. That the said Supremacy is to be giuen to the
King by all right.</p>
               <p>3. That no man hath yet denyed, but that the
Kings of the old Testament, had Supremacy in the
Church.</p>
               <p>4. That the Kinges of the new Testament are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the flocke of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. That Kinges are often called in the Scripture
<hi>Christes,</hi> or, <hi>the Annoynted of our Lord;</hi> but Priests or
Bishops are neuer so called.</p>
               <p>6. That if the Pope were Head of the Church, besides
Christ; it should be a monstrous, and two-headed
Church.</p>
               <p>7. That if the Pope should haue power to depose
Kinges; Ethnicks (or Infidels) were better in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then Christian Princes.</p>
               <p>8. That if the Pope will haue a Temporall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
it were to be persuaded that he went to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
for it.</p>
               <p>9. That power to excommunicate, was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23323:7"/>
to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but vnto the Church.</p>
               <p>10. That the Prophesy of the Reuelation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is already fulfilled; and therefore is cleere, and
not intricate.</p>
               <p>11. That the Kinges of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Sweueland,</hi> as
also the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> agree with the King of
<hi>England</hi> in matters of faith.</p>
               <p>12. That it is not now free for the King of <hi>England</hi>
to change his owne, or to admit Catholicke Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in his Kingdome, for that he hath sworne twice to
the contrary.</p>
               <p>13. That <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> is a Vow-breaker,
because of a Iesuite he is become a Cardinall.</p>
               <p>14. That Catholicks teach, fidelity not to be kept,
and falshood to be lawfull.</p>
               <p>15. That Catholickes are of the race of <hi>Malchus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they interprete nothing aright, but all sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously.

                  <p>3. But your king himself thinketh far otherwise of
them in his <hi>Premonition</hi> to the Emperour, Kings, and
Princes. For thus he speaketh: <hi>Praeclara sanè laus, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarum
encomium, quo Puritanos ornaui, cùm me plus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,

when I affirme, that I haue found greater hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

differ from your King, your Head, and Ecclesiasticall
Primate. Your King professeth, that he hath found
more fidelity amongst barbarous or cruell theeues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
amongst the Puritans: You on the contrary side af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<hi>that the Puritans, what they do, they do sincerely.</hi>
So as those to you are <hi>sincere</hi> men, that to your King
are worse then <hi>cruell theeues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Againe, saith the King: <hi>Ego à Puritanis, non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùm

chaunt your wonted songe, <hi>That the Puritans, what
they do, they do sincerely?</hi> To wit, forsooth, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete,
<hi>they would sincerely haue extinguished the King

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:23323:8"/>
5. Moreouer the King saith: <hi>Ego in meo ad Filium Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro,
multò acriùs ac vehementiùs in Puritanos, quàm
Pontificios inuectus sum.</hi> 
                     <q>I in my booke to my Sonne,
doe speake ten tymes more bitterly of the Puritans
then of the Papists &amp;c.</q> So as by the Kings owne iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the <hi>Puritans</hi> are worse then the Papists: But you
call Papistes, <hi>Traytors: Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Puritans</hi> are worse
then Traytors. And yet notwithstanding you write,
<hi>that what they do, they do sincerely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Againe the King yet writeth thus: <hi>Mihi praecipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

Anarchiam expugnare.</hi> 
                     <q>I haue laboured nothing so
much, as to depresse the Puritans <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and erect
Bishops againe &amp;c.</q> To wit, the <hi>Puritans</hi> affect an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
(or to be without a King,) they hate a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
or Primacy: Contrariwise the King depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
this Anarchy, and establisheth a Primacy. Now I
demaund, if the <hi>Puritans</hi> detest this Primacy, how do
they then sweare thus <hi>sincerely</hi> thereunto? <hi>Ergo,</hi> eyther
the <hi>Puritans</hi> are no longer <hi>Puritans:</hi> or if they be the
men they were (to wit <hi>Puritans,)</hi> they affect Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,

not <hi>sincerely,</hi> but <hi>fraudulently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. See then, how contrary in all these thinges you
are to the King. Whome he accuseth, you excuse; and
yet from impudency you cannot excuse them. And is
it not a great impudencie, and (if you will) impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie,
that the <hi>Caluinistes</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
who are nothing els but <hi>Puritans,</hi> should dare so often

then to be accompted <hi>worse then theeues,</hi> &amp; that
by the publike testimonie of a King: For as much as

in the Church. For thus you write <hi>pag. 364. In

But I haue found, not one, but many, that dare deny

that dare deny it, <hi>Nicolas Sanders</hi> in his second booke
<hi>Of the visible Monarchy of the Church, and 3. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
in solution of the 5. obiection of Protestants: and
<hi>Thomas Stapleton</hi> in his fifth boke <hi>of Doctrinall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

<hi>Of Councells, and 20. Chapter. Iacobus Gretzerus</hi> in his
second booke <hi>Of Considerations to the Deuines of Venice,
1. 2. &amp; 3. Consider. Adam Tannerus</hi> in his first booke
<hi>Of the Defense of Ecclesiasticall liberty</hi> the 15. <hi>Chapter,</hi>
and others.</p>
                  <p>11. All these sayd Authors in the places here cited,
propose the argument, which you are wont to vse to
proue the Kings Supremacy in Spirituall matters.
And it is this: <hi>Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosias,
and other Kings of the old Testament haue had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Church:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Kings of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
haue it also.</hi> In the solution of which argument,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23323:10"/>
all deny the antecedent. They deny (I say) that the
kings of the old Testament (if precisely we respect
kingly power) had the Supremacy of the Church:
although they graunt, that some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
not by any ordinary Right, as being Kinges, but
for so much, as that they were both Prophets and
Priestes, by an extraordinary concession or graunt.
The wordes of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> are these: <q>
                        <hi>Respondeo primo,
Moysen &amp;c.</hi> I answere first, that <hi>Moyses</hi> was not only
a Prince, but a chiefe Priest also, as is manifest out of
the 98. Psalme, <hi>Moyses &amp; Aaron in sacerdotibus eius.</hi>
Moyses and Aaron were accompted amongst his
Priestes &amp;c. <hi>Iosue, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were not only Kings, but also Prophets, to
whome God committed many things extraordinarily
which otherwise by office and Right belonged to
the Priests. And in this sort King <hi>Salomon</hi> remoued
<hi>Abiathar</hi> from his function of Priesthood, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Sadoc</hi> in his place. And this he did not as
King, but as a Prophet, by diuine inspiration. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
I say (quoth <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> that diuers other
good Kings of the Synagogue, did neuer intermeddle
in the affaires or offices of the Priests: and if at any
time they did, they were sorely punished by God
for it &amp;c.</q> Thus farre <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> The like haue the
rest of the forenamed Authors.</p>
                  <p>12. This notwithstanding, I adde moreouer
(wherein you deceiue, or are deceaued) that some
of the foresaid Authors do not only deny the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but the consequence of the former argument
also: and therfore they admit two solutions. The
first is this: <hi>We deny</hi> (say they) <hi>that the Kings of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23323:10"/>
the old Testament had Supremacy in the Church.</hi> The
later this: <hi>Although we should grant, that Kings of
the old Testament had the Primacy of the Church; yet
would it not follow, by consequence, that the Kings
of the new Testament haue the same also</hi> &amp;c. For which
they assigne diuers reasons. Read what I haue said
in solution of the same argument, in my Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Pastors of the flocke of Christ. And although
those wordes <hi>Pasce oues meas,</hi> (Feede my sheep)

belong to Christian Kings also: And for that there
were no Christian Kings in Christs time, to whome

                     <q>Neither (say you) is that to any
purpose, which you <hi>(to wit Tortus)</hi> adde of Christ,
appointing not a King, but an Apostle the Pastor of
his flocke. Truly, as he appointed no King vnder the
law, for that there was yet no King, but when there
was a King, then the name of Pastor was not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: Euen so vnder the Ghospell when there were
not yet Kings, for that being none, they could not
be Pastors. But when Kings once became Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
then at length were they no lesse Pastors, then
were of old the Kings of Israell. And if presently

whether Christ would haue said vnto him, <hi>Pasce oues

proue you it? Or who did euer affirme it before your

this mistery to the Christian world? If you deny it,
yow do well. But if Christ did not say to any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

                  <p>15. Againe I demaund, what meane these words,
<hi>Pasce oues meas,</hi> feed my flocke? You (in the 52.
<hi>page</hi> of your booke) expound them of the feeding by
<hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Be it so. But you your selfe <hi>(Pag.
380.)</hi> doe confesse, that your King doth not feed
the sheep of Christ by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine: Ergo,</hi> the
King, by your owne graunt, is not the Pastor of
the flocke of Christ. Neyther can those wordes,
<hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> in the sense that Christ spake them,
any way belong vnto the King. Heere you may
not so soone quit your selfe, I wot well. For of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
you must eyther confesse, that these words,
<hi>(Feed my sheep)</hi> are not vnderstood of the feeding
by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> or els that it belongs to the
King to feed by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine:</hi> or verily, that
the King is not the Pastor of Christs flocke. But
all these 3. wayes are against you. You will haue
the wordes of Christ <hi>(feed my sheep)</hi> to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of feeding by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine.</hi> You
will haue your King not to feed the flocke of
Christ by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine:</hi> You will haue your
King to be the Pastor of Christes flocke. What
euasion then can you heere haue?</p>
                  <p>16. Thirdly I demand, why do not other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kinges take vpon them this Pastorall office,
if they be truly Pastors of Christs flocke? They
would doe it (say you) <hi>if eyther they knew their
rights, or that their strength or courage fayled them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23323:12"/>
not.</hi> And what, I pray you, is this, then as much to
say, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is wise, and the rest
are fooles? He hath force and strength, the rest are
weake and impotent? He is couragious, the rest are
fearefull and cowardly. Thus it commeth to passe,
that whilst you flatter your owne King, you become
contumelious against others.</p>

                  <p>19. Behould heere, you haue diuers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in which Priests are called <hi>Annoynted;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Kinges are not alone so called. This yow might
haue learned out of <hi>S. August.</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 26. Psalme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the title therof, where he teacheth, that in the
old Testament, Kinges and Priests were annoynted,
for that both of them did prefigure one Christ (or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23323:13"/>
which was to be both King and Priest. The
wordes of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> are these: <hi>Tunc vngebatur Rex
&amp; Sacerdos. Duae istae illo tempore, vnctae personae. In
duabus personis praefigurabatur futurus vnus Rex &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos,
vtroque munere vnus Christus; &amp; ideo Christus
à Chrismate.</hi> 
                     <q>Then was annoynted both the King &amp;
the Priest. These two persons at that time were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted.
In two persons was prefigured to be both a
King and a Priest, one Christ in both offices: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was Christ so called, of Chrisme, &amp;c.</q> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
vpon the 44. Psalme about those words, <hi>vnxit te
Deus,</hi> God hath annointed thee &amp;c. he writeth thus:
<hi>Vnctum audis: Christum intellige: Etenim Christus à
Chrismate. Hoc nomen quod appellatur Christus, vnctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
est: Nec in aliquo alibi vngebantur Reges &amp; Sacerdotes
nisi in illo regno, vbi Christus prophetabatur &amp; vngeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp; vnde venturum erat Christi nomen. Nusquam est
alibi omnino, in nulla gente, in nullo regno.</hi> Thou hearest
(saith <hi>S. Augustine)</hi> 
                     <q>Annoynted: vnderstand Christ:
For Christ is deriued of Chrisme. This name that is
called <hi>Christ,</hi> is a name of Annointing, or vnction.
Neyther were Kings and Priests annoynted in any
sort any where, then in that Kingdome, where
Christ was prophesied and annoynted, and whence
the name of Christ was to come. In no other place is
it at all, in no other nation, in no other Kingdome
&amp;c.</q> So <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. Therefore by the iudgment both of Scripture
and <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> no lesse Priests then Kinges, are
called <hi>Annointed.</hi> But you will say they are not called
<hi>the Lords Annoynted,</hi> as Kings are. First I answere, that
thats no matter. For we dispute not of wordes, but of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23323:13"/>
the matter signified by words. Moreouer these two
wordes <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Annoynted</hi> do signify one and the
same thinge: and, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> speaketh, <hi>This
Name which is called Christ, is a Name of vnction.</hi> And
secondly I say, you assume falsly. For that Priests are
not called in Scripture <hi>Annoynted</hi> only, but also <hi>Christs.</hi>
And so we read in the second of <hi>Machabees 1. 10. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus
qui est Ierosolymis, &amp; in Iudaea, Senatusque &amp; Iudas
Aristobolo Magistro Ptolomei Regis, qui est de genere

salutem &amp; sanitatem.</hi> 
                     <q>The people of Ierusalem, &amp;
Iudea, the Senate and <hi>Iudas,</hi> do send greeting to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobolus</hi>
Maister to King <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who is of the race
of Christes (or <hi>Annoynted)</hi> Priests, and to the Iewes
that be in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Behould heere, <hi>Aristobolus</hi> is of
the race of Christes Priests, therefore Priests are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Christs,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Annoynted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. But you will yet obiect: All these things are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of Priests of the old Testament: but I would
fayne see a place (say you) where the Priest of the new
Testament (to writ the Pope) is called <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted.</hi>
Marry hearke you: And I in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner would
as fayne see a place where Kinges of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are called by that Name. Is it lawfull (trow
yee) for you to transferre this Name, which was of
old giuen to ancient Kinges and Priests by the holy
Ghost, to the King of <hi>England:</hi> and shall it not be
lawfull for vs likewise by the same right to transferre
it to the Pope? Heere you take vpon you too
much.</p>
                  <p>22. Moreouer I say, that once only this Name of
<hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Annoynted</hi> is to be found in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23323:14"/>
in that sense whereof we now treat, to wit
in the 2. Chapter of <hi>S. Luke vers.</hi> 29. where it is said:
<hi>Responsum acceperat Simeon à Spiritu Sancto, non visu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
se mortem, nisi priùs videret Christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Domini.</hi> 
                     <q>Simeon
had receiud an answere of the Holy Ghost, that he
should nor see death, vnlesse he first saw the Christ
(or <hi>Annoynted)</hi> of our Lord.</q> Here our Sauiour is
called the <hi>Christ of our Lord,</hi> to wit, <hi>Annoynted of
our Lord.</hi> He was annoynted both King and Priest
as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> aboue noted, not with corporall oyle,
as were the Kings and Priests of the old Testament;
but with spirituall oyle, to wit, of the holy Ghost.
For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him rested the spirit of our Lord, the spirit of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
&amp; vnderstanding, the spirit of counsell and fortitude,
the spirit of knowledg and piety,</hi> as it is written in <hi>Isay</hi>
the 11. Chapter vers. 3. And this is that which <hi>Dauid</hi>
foretold Psalme 44. 8. <hi>Vnxit te Deus, Deus tuus, ole<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

laetitiae prae consortibus tuis.</hi> God hath annoynted thee,
yea thy God, with the oyle of gladnes, before all
thy companions: That is to say, God hath annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thee Priest and King in a peculiar manner, before
all other Kings &amp; Priests. For he annoynted thee with
the holy Ghost, and them with corporall oyle only.
Heerehence I gather, that wheras the Kings &amp; Priests
of the old Testament, were therefore annoynted with
corporall oyle, that they might be a Type or figure of
the Messias to come, who was to be annoynted both
King and Priest with spirituall oyle: so much the more
doth this Name <hi>Annoynted,</hi> or, <hi>Christ our Lord,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to Priests, then vnto Kings, by how much Christ
tooke vpon him the office of a Priest in this life, more
then of a King. Or els, if he equally tooke vpon him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23323:14"/>
both offices: then by equall right, Priests as well as
Kings may be called <hi>Annoynted,</hi> or, <hi>Christs of our
Lord</hi> And therfore I see no cause, why yow should
attribute this Name only to Kings, and take it away
from Priests, vnlesse it was, because it pleased your
fancy so to do.</p>

The holy Ghost hath gone before vs in this word, 1.

Amongst the tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> is the tribe of <hi>Leui.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

you said, that only Christ was head of the Church.
And why so? That you might exclude the Pope, whom
you hate. Now you will also haue the King to be head,
and not only head, but the top or crowne of the head
also. Why so? Because yow seeke to please and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the King. And so it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, that you will
easily endure a two-headed Church, if the King may
be one, but in no wise, if the Pope should be any. And
when you haue placed Christ and the King of <hi>England</hi>
as two Heads of this Church, then it seemes to you
a faire and comely Church: but if Christ and the Pope
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23323:15"/>
be placed togeather, then is it deformed &amp; monstrous.
Get you hence with this your Head, wherin the
Church hath one while one head, another while
two. It seemes that, that of <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> 27. 12. may

better in condition then Christian Princes: to witt,
for that these may be deposed by the Pope, the other
may not. For thus you write <hi>pag.</hi> 36. of your booke:
<hi>Hac doctrina semel promulgata, non multa pòst sceptra,

Quis Christianus Rex esse velit?</hi> 
                     <q>This Doctrine <hi>(to wit
of deposing Princes)</hi> being once set abroach, I beleeue
few Scepters will hereafter be subiected to Christ. For
why? An Ethnicke King cannot be deposed by the
Pope, a Christian King may be: therefore it is better
to be a King amongst Ethnickes. Who will not he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward

                  </p>
                  <p>27. You neyther speake warily, nor Christianlike.
Not warily: for first what you haue sayd, may be thus
retorted vpon you. Yf the King of <hi>England</hi> should
haue power to depose Bishops (which you affirme;)
then were the Bishop; in <hi>Spayne, France,</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi>
better in condition then the Bishops of <hi>England:</hi> For
that heere they may be deposed at the Kings pleasure,
and there not. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for as we say that Christian
Princes may be deposed by the Pope, if they offend, &amp;
not Ethnicks: so do you likewise confesse, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes may be excommunicated, and not Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks:
Yet is it not wel inferred of this your Doctrine,
that Ethnickes are better in condition then Christians,
seing that it is a greater euill to be depriued of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
goods of the Church by excommunication; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of a temporall Kingdome by deposition. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can that be much lesse inferred out of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>28. You speake not Christianlike. For it is not a
Christian mans part thus to dispute: The offences of
Kinges are punnished amongst Christians, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Ethnickes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I had rather be an Ethnick
Prince, where I may not be punnished, if I offend,
then a Christian Prince, where I shall be punnished,
if I doe offend. Thus truly you dispute. If (say you)
Christian Kinges, when they deserue it, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and Ethnicks, although they do offend, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deposed; I had rather be an Ethnicke King
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23323:16"/>
then a Christian. And so truly, you playnly shew, that
you more esteeme a temporall Kingdome, which you
would not loose, then a heauenly Kingdome, which
you doe not greatly care for.</p>

to dispose of the Kingdomes of this world. For thus
yow write <hi>pag. 36. Quod si Pontifici animus est ad regna
mundi; est in Euangelio (memini) mentio de quodam,
qui regna mundi penes se esse, eaue disponendi ius habere
se dixit. Eum adeat censeo; cum illo transigat.</hi> 
                     <q>And if
the Pope haue a mynd to a temporall kingdome, there
is mention in the Ghospel (I remember) of a certayne
fellow <hi>(to wit the Diuell)</hi> who sayd, that all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world were in his power, &amp; that he had
right to dispose of them.</q> I thinke it best he go vnto
him, and couenant with him &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>30. Say, my friend, speake you this in iest or in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest?
In whether manner you doe it, you eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
iniurious to your own King, or els contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Pope neyther whereof doth well beseeme
you. The iniury you offer to your King, yow
cannot deny. For durst you (without iniury) haue
answered your king, eyther in iest or earnest, when
as, after the death of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he demaunded
the Crowne of England, with these words: <hi>If you will
raigne in England, go to the Diuell, and couenant with
him, who is the distributer of all Kingdomes?</hi> I thinke
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23323:17"/>
you durst not. For if you had, then farewell Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineship.
Wherfore then dare you be so saucy to
speake thus to the Pope, but for that you list to raile
vpon him?</p>
                  <p>31. But, you will say, the Pope seekes a temporall
Kingdome, which is not due vnto him. Let him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himselfe with a spirituall Kingdome. But what
if in like manner I should say of your King? He seeks
a spirituall Kingdome. Let him content himselfe with
a temporall. Moreouer I adde, that the Pope hath far
more right to temporal Kingdomes, then you King
hath to the Church: which thing I am to declare more
largely in another place.</p>

you adde, that the Church may transferre
this power to whome she please. For thus you write
pag. 14. of your booke. <hi>Potestas haec ibi, cui data?

was it giuen? Not to <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle. And againe:

giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> to vse this censure; so neyther if he had

the same.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>33. Out of this your Doctrine it followeth: first,
that in the time of the Apostles, power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
was immediatly giuen to the Church of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
and from thence transferred to <hi>S. Paul</hi> the
Apostle, that he might exercise and publikely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the same vpon the incestuous person. But
this very point you openly deny in the same place, in
these wordes: <hi>Paulus congregatis Corinthijs, potestatem
censurae denunciandae facit.</hi> 
                     <q>Paul hauing gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> giues power to denounce the

or Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to denounce the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
(vpon the incestuous person) as heere you affirme;
how had he then receaued the selfe same power from
the same Church? Or what necessity was there, I
pray yow, to giue that power to the Church, if the
Church had receaued it before from Christ, by those
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23323:18"/>
words, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church? These things
do not agree togeather.</p>
                  <p>34. Secondly it followeth: that now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in <hi>England</hi> the power to excommunicate is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in the English Church, and not in the Bishops:
and from the Church the same may be transferred to
Bishops. But if it be so, why doth not the Church of
<hi>England</hi> giue this power to the King, her Head, and
Primate? Why doth she rather giue it to the Bishopes,
then to the King; when as the Bishops are subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
vnto the King in spirituall Iurisdiction, as you
will needs haue it? And is it not an absurd thing,
that you <hi>(to wit the Church of England)</hi> should giue
power to the Bishops, to excommunicate, and cast
out of the Church their King, their Head, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
and their Primate, and yet would not giue the
same power to the King to inflict the same Censures
vpon his subiects, to wit the Bishops? Surely, you
are eyther very cruell towardes your King, or els you
do not seriously, and in good earnest giue him the
Supremacy. One of the two must needs follow.
Therfore looke well with what spirit, you wrote these

<hi>Nos Principi Censurae potestatem non facimus:</hi> We do

And this I will shew you particulerly. For first
you say, your King agreeth <hi>(in matters of faith)</hi> with
the Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Suetia.</hi> But how can this
be? They be <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes, and acknowledge
Christes Reall Presence in the Eucharist, which your
King doth vtterly deny. Secondly, you affirme the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23323:20"/>
same of the Princes of Germany, and States of other
Countryes. But these do not agree amongst themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
some being open <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and others <hi>Caluini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</hi>
How then can they, being deuided amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
agree with your King? except your king (as
you insinuate he doth) professe <hi>Caluinian</hi> Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
<hi>Caluinists,</hi> and <hi>Lutheran,</hi> with <hi>Lutherans: Omnibus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia

may gaine all. Thirdly, suppose this were so, though
it be not: and that all Princes and States, as well <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi>
as <hi>Caluinistes</hi> did agree among themselues, and
togeather with your king; how can it be verified, that
they are a part of the Lords flocke? This I vnderstand
not. I vnderstand it not (I say) how they are a part
of the flocke, and not the whole flocke: For eyther
there be yet others, besides those you haue named which
belong to the Lords flocke, or none. If there be others,
why then did you not name them? or who be those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
I suppose, by your owne iudgement, they are
neyther <hi>Papists</hi> nor <hi>Anabaptistes.</hi> For these you reiect.
If there be no others, besids those you haue named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wherefore did you then call them a part, &amp; not
the whole flocke of Christ? I will speake yet more
cleerely. If the kinges of <hi>England, Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and other Princes and States which agree with
them, be but a part of Christs flocke, and not the
whole flocke; then followeth it of necessity, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those, there is another part of Christes flocke
which agreeth not with them: and so Christs flocke

being not lawfull for him now to do. For that therby
he shall not be once, but twice periured, if he heare you
herin. For with what fayth or conscience (if there
be any conscience of fayth twice giuen) can he admit
your cerimonies, or the publike vse therof, who when
he was first Crowned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
did most solemnely sweare to God in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

he shall be accompted periured, if he permit the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Religion in his Kingdome, or forsake his

it lawfull for him to change his Religion, if he haue
sworne he will not do it? So it seemes, belike. But,
how if the Religion be false which he hath sworne to
mantaine? What shall he then do? Shall he persist
rather in his false Religion, then breake his oath?
Take heed what you say. <hi>An oath</hi> (say the Lawiers) <hi>is
no band of iniquity,</hi> and I may adde, <hi>nor of falsity.</hi>
And therfore notwithstanding an oath neuer so often
made, a man may change his Religion if it be false: he
may annull his pact or couenant, if it be vniust. This
is most certaine. What would you do if your King
should say, that the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is false which he now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23323:21"/>
Would you vrge him vpon his oath? That, in

him to forsake his false Religion, &amp; imbrace the true?
I thinke you would. Why do you then dissemble?
Why do you so much vrge the King vpon his oath, as
though vpon no occasion or euent soeuer it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to chang a Religion that is once confirmed by an
oath, although it be impious and false? Go too, gather
your wittes togeather a little better, and then speake.
43. One thing I would yet demaund of you, and
that is this: Your King in his booke of <hi>Premonition,</hi>
doth exhort Catholicke Kings and Princes, that they
should forsake the faith and Religion, which hitherto
they haue professed vnder the Pope, and imbrace the
English Religion which the King professeth. Now,
it is well knowne, that most of these Princes, in their
Coronation do sweare, that they will neuer do it,
to wit, change their Religion. Heere I demaund (I
say) whether your King hath lawfully and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhorted them to do it, or no? If he hath done it
lawfully and prudently, why do you accuse the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes,
who do but the like in a better cause? If he
did it vnlawfully and imprudently; why did you not
admonish him, to surcease from such an, Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
seeing yow are his Chaplaine, and perhaps in

a Vow-breaker, as a periured person. And euen as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before you did pronounce your King to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne,
if he should admit Catholicke Religion in his
Kingdome: So now you pronounce <hi>Cardinall Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
to be a Vow-breaker, because against his will he
admitted the Dignity of a Cardinal. Truly you are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to vpbraid and taunt. And why, I pray you,
doe you not call <hi>Luther,</hi> a Vow-breaker, who of a
Monke became a married man (if he may be called a
married man, and not rather a sacrilegious fornicator
and adulterer?) Why not also a periured person, that
reiecting the ancient faith, which he had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from Christ, the Apostles, and his Ancestours
most holy and learned men, and sealed with an oath,
did imbrace a new Religion, repugnant to Christ and
the truth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:23323:22"/>
46. That you may therefore vnderstand the matter,
heare then what followeth: It is one thing to vow, or
promise to God any thing absolutely and simply; and
another thing to doe it with a certayne limitation. He
that voweth after the first manner, is bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that which he promiseth: he that voweth after
the second ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner may be quit of his band, when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
therof doth suffer the same. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples herof we
haue in the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For the Daughters &amp; Wiues
did vse to vow with this limitation, to wit, if their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds did consent therto. <hi>(Numb. 30.)</hi> The
<hi>Nazaraeans</hi> in like manner vowed with this limitation,
to wit, they bound themselues for a certaine time only,
&amp; not for their whole life. <hi>(Numb. 6.)</hi> So likewise doe
we in our SOCIETY. He that bindeth himself by a
simple vow, is not thought to be otherwise obliged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at the arbitrement of his Superiours: So as if he should
be by them, for a iust cause, dismissed out of the SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY,
the band or obligation ceaseth. But he that
bindeth himselfe by a solemne vow, dependeth on the
arbitrement of the Pope, who may take him from the
SOCIETY, and place him in any other Degree or
Dignity. And what new thing is this now I pray you?
The like is dayly exercised amongst you. You promise
your King Allegiance and Obedience, but with this
double limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. First, as long as you remaine in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Secondly, as long as the King doth not chang his
Religion. For if it be otherwise, you thinke you are
not bound thereunto.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Kinges Supremacy badly defended
by his Chaplaine.</head>
               <p>SEING you haue once determined to flatter
the King, you go about to defend and approue
whatsoeuer you imagine will please him. And
with this mind &amp; desire, you are imboldned to defend
the Primacy of the Church, which he vsurpeth to
himselfe. But truly very vnluckily: For in this kind
you commit a double fault. First because you bring
many Arguments which do ouerthrow the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
which yet you do for lacke of foresight.
SECONDLY because the Argumentes you bring for
proofe of the said Supremacy in the King, are of so
small reckoning or accompt, as they seeme contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23323:24"/>
I will lay them both open before you: and for
that which belongeth to the first head or point, these
Arguments may be deduced out of your owne Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
against the Kings Supremacy.</p>
               <div n="1" type="argument">
                  <head>The first Argument, against the Kings
Supremacy, taken out of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
owne Doctrine.</head>
                  <p>2. THE first Argument I frame thus: He hath
not the Primacy of the Church, who hath no
iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, neither in the interiour
Court, nor exteriour: But the King, out of your
owne Doctrine hath no iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall,
neither in the interiour Court, nor exteriour: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
he hath not the Primacy of the Church. The <hi>maior</hi>
proposition is cleare of it selfe, because by the name of
<hi>Primacy,</hi> we vnderstand nothing els in this place, but
supreme Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall. He then who
hath no iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, neither internall
nor externall, hath not the Primacy of the Church:
But the King, by your doctrine hath none, neither
internall, nor externall.</p>
                  <p>3. Not internall: For that this Iurisdiction consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in the power of the Keyes, or in the power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of forgiuing sinnes in the Court of Conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
which the King hath not, as you confesse pag. 380.
of your booke, in these words: <hi>Rex non assumit ius Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uium.</hi>
The King doth not assume, or take vpon him,
the power of the Keyes. And worthily. For that Christ
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23323:25"/>
spake not to Kings, but to the Apostles, when he said,
<hi>Accipite Spiritum Sanctum &amp;c. Receyue the holy Ghost:
whose sinnes you forgiue, shalbe forgiuen them: and whose
sinnes you retaine, shalbe retained &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Not externall: For this I will euidently euince
out of your owne Principles, which are these three.
The first, that the Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall of the
exteriour Court, is not founded vpon any other place,
then that of <hi>S. Matthew 18. 17. Dic Ecclesiae &amp;c. Tell
the Church: if he will not heare the Church, let him be
vnto thee, as an Ethnicke and Publicane.</hi> Your second
Principle is, that the Iurisdiction which is founded
on that place, is nothing els, then the Right of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring,
or power to excommunicate. Your third is,
that the King hath not the Right of Censuring, or
power to excommunicate. I doubt not, but you will
acknowledg these your three Principles. And the last,
you set downe <hi>pag.</hi> 151. of your booke in these words:
<hi>Nos Principi potestatem Censurae non facimus.</hi> We do not
giue power, or authority to the King to vse Censures.
And againe <hi>pag. 380. Rex non assumit ius Censurae.</hi> The
King doth not take vpon him the Right or power of
vsing Censures. The former two Principles you in like
manner set downe <hi>pag</hi> 41. thus: <hi>Censura duplex est;
Publicani &amp; Ethnici; minor &amp; maior. Minor à Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
excludit modò. De maiore verò, quae arcet Ecclesia ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,
quae perinde reddit, vt Ethnicos, vix quisquam est,
quin fateatur, institutam eam à Christo, Matth. 18.
per verba,</hi> Dic Ecclesiae; si Ecclesiam non audierit, sit
tibi sicut Ethnicus. <hi>De exteriori foro ibi agitur. Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris
fori Iurisdictio, illo, nec alio loco fundata est.</hi> 
                     <q>A Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is two-fold; to witt of the Publican &amp; Ethnick;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23323:25"/>
the lesser and the greater. The lesser doth exclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Sacraments for the present. But as for the greater,
which casteth out of the Church it selfe, and maketh
men like vnto <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> there is scarce any man, but
will confesse, that it was instituted by Christ <hi>Matth.
18.</hi> by these words. <hi>Tell the Church; if he will not heare
the Church, let him be vnto thee as an Ethnicke.</hi> And
in that place is it meant of the exteriour Court: the
iurisdiction of which exteriour Court is grounded on
that, and no other place &amp;c.</q> Marke well what heere
you say. The iurisdiction of the externall Court,
where is it founded in the Ghospell? <hi>In no other place,</hi>
(say you) <hi>then in Matth.</hi> 18. It is wel. I desire no
more.</p>
                  <p>5. Hence then do I thus now conclude: All Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
Ecclesiasticall of the externall Court, is founded
in that only place, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church: But
the King hath not the Iurisdiction that is founded in
that place: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath no iurisdiction founded in
the Ghospell of Christ, but in the braynes of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne.
Consider now well, how you will deale with
your King, who by your own Doctrine is deuested of
all Ecclesiasticall power: and recall those wordes of
yours, that you wrote <hi>pag.</hi> 90. of your Booke, <hi>Primatus
spiritualis debetur Regibus omni iure.</hi> The spirituall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
is due vnto Kinges by all right. No truly, not by
all right: for, as now yow confesse, they haue it not
by right of the Ghospell, or new Testament.</p>

                  <head>The second Argument.</head>
                  <p>6. THE second argument which I produce, no lesse
forcible then the former, is this: He hath not
the Supremacy of the Church, who cannot (by his
power Spirituall) expell out of the Church, any man,
although he be neuer so guilty or faulty: and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
if he be guilty, may be expelled by others: or
(which is the same thing) cannot excommunicate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, and yet may be excommunicated himself by
others. But your King, by your owne Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excommunicate, or cast out of the Church any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and yet himself may be excommunicated, and cast out
by others: <hi>Ergo,</hi> according to your Doctrine, he hath
not the Primacy of the Church.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Maior</hi> is certayne, and is manifest by a like
example. For as he is not accompted a King, who
cannot banish or exile out of his Realme any man,
though neuer so wicked; and yet himselfe notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
may be banished and exiled by others, if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
euen so standeth the matter in this our case. Now
I subsume thus: But the King can excommunicate, or
cast out of the Church no man, because <hi>he hath not the
Right or power to censure,</hi> as your self speaketh: &amp; yet
notwithstanding may he be excommunicated himself,
or driuen out of the Church, as you confesse <hi>pag.</hi> 39.
of your Booke in these words: <hi>Aliudest priuare Regem
bonis Ecclesiae communibus, quod facit sententia, &amp; potest
fortè Pontifex: aliud priuare bono proprio, idest regno suo,
quod non facit sententia, nec potest Pontifex. Priuabit

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23323:26"/>

subditorum, quâ subditi sunt: bonum enim ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
hoc, nec ab Ecclesia &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>It is one thing to depriue a
King of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon <hi>(or spirituall)</hi> goods of the Church
which the sentence <hi>(of Excommunication)</hi> doth, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Pope can: It is another thing to depriue him
of his owne proper good, to wit, his Kingdome,
which the sentence <hi>(of Excommunication)</hi> doth not, nor
the Pope can. The Popes Censure shall depriue, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him from the society of the faithful, in that they
be faithfull: for that is a spirituall good and dependeth
of the Church. But it shall not depriue him of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of his subiects, in that they be his subiects: for this
is a ciuil (or temporal) good, nor doth it depend of the
Church &amp;c.</q> Then I conclude thus: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King by
your owne sentence hath not the Supremacie of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>8. And by this Argument, which is taken out of
your owne Doctrine, I not onlie proue, the King to
haue no Supremacie Ecclesiastical: but also that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
doth thinke far otherwise, in this point, then you
do. For you confesse out of your former wordes, that
the King may be excommunicated by the Pope: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
you must also confesse, that the King in this case is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the Pope. But your King in his Premonition
to all Christian Princes, denieth it in these words: <hi>Na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
neque me Pontifice vlla ex parte inferiorem esse credo, pace
illius dixerim.</hi> For neither do I think my selfe any waie
inferiour to the Pope, by his leaue be it spoken. Yf he
be no waie inferiour vnto him; how can he then be
excommunicated or punished by him? See then by
what meanes you will heere defend your King.</p>

                  <head>The third Argument.</head>
                  <p>9. MY third Argument is drawne from your own
wordes <hi>pag.</hi> 177. of your Booke, which are
these: <hi>Duo haecregna, Reipublicae &amp; Ecclesiae, quamdiu
duo manent, hoc ab illo diuisum, duos habent: postquam
in vnum cealescunt, non vt in ducbus duo, sed vt in vno
vnus Primus est.</hi> 
                     <q>These two Kingdomes, to wit, of
the Common-wealth and the Church, so long as
they remaine two, this deuided from that, they haue
two Heades: but after they become one, not as two
in two, but as one in one, there is but one Chiefe
&amp;c.</q> This you would say: There be two distinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in this world, one of the Ciuil Comon-wealth,
another of the Church of Christ: These Kingdomes
so long as they remaine two, haue two Primates, or
Heades: but when they grow into one, they haue but
one Primate or chiefe Head. I accept that which you
graunt, and do subsume thus: But in the new law,
which Christ instituted, there remayne two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
nor are they become one: Therefore in the
new Law, there must be two distinct Primates, or
Heads, one whereof must rule the Church, the other
the Ciuill Commonwealth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
if he belong to the new Law, doth not rule
both at once.</p>
                  <p>10. What can you heere now deny? Tell me, I pray
you, in Christes time, when the new Law was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
were these two Kingdomes deuided, or were
they one? This later, you neyther can, nor dare affirme.
For if the Church and Common-wealth had byn one
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23323:27"/>
in Christes tyme, then should there haue byn but one
Chiefe or Head of both, according to your owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And therefore eyther Christ should haue byn
Chiefe both of the Church &amp; common wealth, which
you will not graunt; or els he should haue byn Chiefe
or Head of neyther, which is against Scripture. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
then, that in Christs tyme those two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
were distinct &amp; deuided, and had two different
Primates or Heads; to wit Christ, Head of the Church,
and the King or Emperour, Head of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>11. But now if in Christs tyme, there were not one
and the same Chiefe, or Head, both of the Church and
Common-wealth, which you ought to graunt; how
then dare your King, who professeth the Institution
of Christ, vsurpe vnto himselfe both Primacies, to
wit, both of the Church, &amp; commonwealth: vnlesse
you will say, that he followeth herin the custome of
the Iewes, and not of the Christians, &amp; so in this point
is more like a Iew then a Christian. For this you doe
seeme to insinuate, when as <hi>pag.</hi> 363. of your Booke
you say: <q>
                        <hi>A more, institutoue Israelis orditur Apologia
&amp;c.</hi> From the custome and institute of Israel <hi>(to witt
the old Testament)</hi> our Apology or defence beginneth,
and from thence hath all this question her force and
strength <hi>(to wit of the Supremacy.)</hi> For in Israell did
God erect a Kingdome for his people, &amp; in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he founded a Church to his owne liking. From
thence are we to take example: for so much, as in the
new Testament we haue none. For no where haue the
Church and Empire byn ioyned, or vnited togeather
in one &amp;c.</q>

12. Out of this your so cleare and manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
I gather two things. The one is, that your
King of <hi>England</hi> doth vsurpe vnto himselfe the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
both of the Church and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, without
any example therof in the new Testament. The other:
that either your King of <hi>England</hi> must needs be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or els that other Kings and Emperours are in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
For if, as you say, the Church and Empire no
where in the new Testament haue conioyned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one; &amp; that yet now in <hi>England</hi> they are vnited
in one: it followeth necessarily, that hitherto all Kings
and Emperours haue erred in this point, &amp; your King
only is the first that is vvise: or els, truely, (which
is more credible) that other Kings and Princes haue
heerin beene wise, and your King to haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
and missed the marke.</p>
                  <p>13. But I see well, what may be heerto obiected,
and that is this: That the Pope, forsooth, in some part
of <hi>Italy</hi> doth vsurpe also the Primacy both of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvvealth
and Church. I confesse it to be so. But
this conioining (to vvit, of temporall and spirituall
states) hath beene introducted by humane right only:
but you contend that your King hath both Primacies
by diuine right. And this you cannot proue.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Argument.</head>
                  <p>14. THE fourth Argument, is taken out of the
wordes of your Booke, <hi>pag. 35. &amp;</hi> 36. where
you say: <hi>Christus enim, cuius hic vicem obtendis, non
sic praefuit, dum in terris fuit. Regnum quod de mundo
fuit, non habuit. Regni, quod non habuit, vices non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misit.</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:23323:28"/>
                     <q>Christ, vvhose office you pretend, did not so
rule, when he liued vpon earth: he had no Kingdome
which vvas of this world: He gaue not another his
place in a Kingdome, which he had not &amp;c.</q> And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
againe a litle after say you: <hi>Est ille quidem Rex Regum,
sed quâ Regum Rex est, immortalis est; mortalem
nullum Proregem habet. Papa mortalis ipse, non aliter
Christi vicarius, quàm quâ mortalis Christus.</hi> 
                     <q>He truly
<hi>(to wit Christ)</hi> is King of Kings, but in that he is King
of Kings, he is immortall: he hath no mortall Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
(or Vicar.) The pope is mortall; nor he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Vicar of Christ, then in that Christ is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
&amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. In these words you go about to proue, that the
Pope, although he be Christs Vicar; yet hath he no
temporall Kingdome. You suppose Christ to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
two manner of waies. First, as he is immortall,
or according to his Diuinitie: Secondly, as he is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
or according to his humanity. This done, you
argue thus: Christ according to his Diuinity, or, in
that he is immortall, is King of Kings, and hath all
the Kingdomes of this world in his power, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding
hath he no mortall Vicar or Substitute:
But the Pope is mortall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not the Vicar of
Christ, in that Christ is immortall, or God. Againe:
Christ according to his Humanity (say you) or, as he
is mortall, hath no temporall Kingdome: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot haue any Vicar or Substitute in a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Kingdome: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope, although he be his
Vicar, yet is he not so in his temporall Kingdome,
but in his Spirituall.</p>
                  <p>16. This is the force of your Argument. But do
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23323:29"/>
you not see that this may be in like manner retorted
backe vpon your King? Yea by the very same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
your King may be deuested, both of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Kingdome, and his Supremacy in the Church.
Which I proue thus: If your King haue a temporall
Kingdome, he hath it either as the Vicar of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
(which he pretendeth,) or els as the Vicar
of Christ mortall. But neither of these may be said.
Not the first: Because God, as he is immortall, hath
no mortall Vicar, as you freely affirme: But your King,
without all doubt is mortall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not the Vicar
of God immortall. Not the later: Because Christ, as
he is mortall, hath no temporall Kingdome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
no temporall Vicar: <hi>Ergo,</hi> your King is
not the Vicar of Christ, in his temporall Kingdome.
And so, he is either deuested of all temporall domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
or if he haue any, he must needes be some other
bodies Vicar, then Gods immortall, or Christs mortall.
This, I know: you will not graunt, therfore the other
must be graunted.</p>
                  <p>17. Hence do I further conclude: Your King doth
not vsurpe vnto himselfe the Primacy of the Church,
by any other title, then that he is a temporall Prince
and the Vicar of God: But now I haue shewed out of
your owne doctrine that he is not a temporall King,
nor the Vicar of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by the title of a temporall
Prince, he cannot claime the Primacy of the Church.
Heere you had need to succour him, if you can.</p>

                     <q>It is one thing to depriue a

the Pope can. It is another thing to depriue him
of his owne proper good, to wit, his Kingdome, which
the sentence <hi>(of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication)</hi> doth not, nor the Pope
can. The Popes Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure shal depriue or exclude him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the society <hi>(or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion)</hi> of the faithfull, in that they be

te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall) good, nor doth it depend of the Church &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>19. Heere you distinguish two sorts of good things
which belong to the King. Some you call <hi>Spirituall,</hi>
which depend of the Church: others <hi>Ciuill,</hi> which
depend not of the Church. You adde: These (to
wit <hi>Ciuill)</hi> are proper to the King, of which he
cannot, by Censure, be depriued: The other,
are the common goods of the Church, of which he
may be depriued. Now I demaund whether the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Church, which the King vsurpeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe
to the common goods of the Church, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his owne eiuill or temporall goods? One of
these two must you grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if your distinction be good
and sufficient. If this Primacy belong to the common
goods of the Church, it followeth then, that euery
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23323:30"/>
faithfull Christian, that is in the Church, is no lesse
Head of the Church, then your King. For that the
goods, which be common to all Christians being in
the Church, may no lesse be vsurped of one then of
another. But if this Primacy belong to the <hi>Ciuill</hi> goods
of the Church; then it followeth, that the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be depriued of the Primacy of the Church by any
Ecclesiasticall Censure: and therfore after that he is
excommunicated, and cast out of the Church, as an
Ethnicke, vet in him remaineth the Primacy of the
Church: which is most absurd.</p>
                  <p>20. The like Argument is taken out of your words
following, which are these <hi>pag.</hi> 40. of your booke.
<hi>Rex quiuis cùm de Ethnico Christianus fit, non perdit
terrenum ius, sed acquirit ius nouum; put â, in bonis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae

vigore sententiae amittit nouum ius, quod acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sierat
in bonis Ecclesiae spiritualibus; sed retinet tamen
terrenum ius, antiquum ius in temporalibus quod fuerat
illi proprium, priusquam Christianus fieret.</hi> 
                     <q>Euery King
when of an Ethnicke he is made a Christian, doth
not therby loose his temporall right, but getteth a new
right, to wit, in the spirituall goods of the Church.
In like manner, when of a Christian he is made an
Ethnicke <hi>(to wit by Excommunication)</hi> he, by force of
the Censure, leeseth his new right, which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the spirituall goods of the Church: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he keepeth his temporall right, his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
right in temporalities, which was proper vnto
him, before he was a Christian.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Heere also do you distinguish the double right
of a King: the one <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>temporall,</hi> which a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23323:30"/>
King hath before he be a Christian; the other <hi>new</hi> and
<hi>spirituall,</hi> which he getteth, when he is made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
Now in like manner I demaund, whether doth
the Supremacy of the Church which your King vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
belong to that <hi>ancient</hi> &amp; <hi>temporall</hi> right, or rather
to this <hi>new</hi> and <hi>spirituall?</hi> If it belong to the <hi>ancient</hi> and
<hi>temporall</hi> right; it followeth, that Ethnicke Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be made Christians, haue the Supremacy of
the Church, which is absurd. If it belong to the <hi>new</hi>
and <hi>spirituall</hi> right; it followeth, that Kings, when
in baptisme they be made Christians, or members of
the Church, do receaue more in their baptisme then
other men; which in another place of your Booke you
deny. For you contend, <hi>that all men, of what sort
or degree soeuer they be, are equall vnto them, in those
things, which are obteined through baptisme.</hi>

they were subiects: when they are out of the Church,

of the King, in that they are subiects (for if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them, in that they be not subiects, they cannot
be vnder the Iurisdiction of the King:) But the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of a King, in that they be subiects, are not a part

to ouerthrow the Kings Supremacy: Now let vs see,
if your others be as forcible to the contrary, wherwith
you goe about to establish the same Supremacy in the

               <q>The people sometyme sayd vnto <hi>Iosue,</hi> that
they would obay him in all thinges, as they had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Moyses,</hi> but they obeyed <hi>Moyses</hi> in Ecclesiasticall
matters. Nor did the high Priest <hi>Eleazarus</hi> then med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
no not in any thing, but in temporall. But if any
man shal thinke this more to auayle, because <hi>Iosue</hi> was
a true worshipper of God, and least this right should
seeme to haue place in only Orthodoxall, or right-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
Kinges; Behould then the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to an Hereticke, to wit an Idolater, whome
notwithstanding the Prophet not only not dissuaded
the people to obay, but also was Author, that they
submitted their neckes vnder his yoke, &amp; serued him.
The like was done to <hi>Pharao,</hi> without whose leaue,
they (to wit the Iewes) would not mooue a foot out
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they might sacrifice to God. And the

            </p>
            <p>25. The force of your Argument is this, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Orthodoxall Kings in the old Testament, but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23323:32"/>
also &amp; Idolaters had the Primacy of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the same is to be said of Kinges of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
The former part of the antecedent you proue
by the example of <hi>Iosue,</hi> to whome the people of the
Iewes said <hi>(Ios. 1. 17.) As we haue obeyed Moyses in all
thinges, so will we obey you.</hi> But they obeyed <hi>Moyses,</hi>
not only in temporall matters, but also in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> did they so obey <hi>Iosue.</hi> The later you
proue by the example of the three Gentile Kinges, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonosor</hi>
in Babylon, <hi>Pharao</hi> in Egipt, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> in
Chaldaea, to whome the Iewes were subiect, euen
in Ecclesiasticall matters, because without their leaue,
they durst neyther offer Sacrifice, nor build their
Temple.</p>
            <p>26. That you may then see, of what small moment
this your Argument is; I will briefely examine euery
part therof. And first I will speake something of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
secondly of <hi>Iosue,</hi> who succeeded him: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Gentile Kings which you haue cited. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Moyses</hi> then, it is certaine, that he was not
only a Temporall Prince, but an Ecclesiasticall also: or
if we speake all, he susteyned a quadruple person, or
the person of foure men. The first of a Temporall
Prince, the second of a Law-maker, the third
of a high Priest, or Bishop, and the fourth of a Prophet.
And this is testified by <hi>Philo lib. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Moysis, Regis, Legislatoris, Pontificis, Prophetae.</hi> This
is the life and death of <hi>Moyses,</hi> a King, a Law-maker,
a high Priest, and a Prophet. And the same is plainly
euinced out of the Scripture. That he was a temporall
Prince or Iudge, it is manifest by that of <hi>Exodus</hi> 18.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23323:32"/>
13. <hi>Altera die &amp;c. And the next day</hi> Moyses <hi>sate to iudg
the people, who stood by</hi> Moyses <hi>from morning vntill
night:</hi> which thing <hi>S. Augustine</hi> mentioneth in his 68.
<hi>quaest.</hi> vpon <hi>Exodus</hi> thus: <hi>Sedebat</hi> (inquit) <hi>iudiciaria
potestate solus, populo vniuerso stante.</hi> He sate (saith <hi>S.
Augustine)</hi> alone with power to iudge, all the people
standing. That he was a Law-maker, it is manifest, as
well by other places, as that of <hi>S. Iohn 1. 17. Lex
per Moysen data est.</hi> The law was giuen by <hi>Moyses.</hi>
That he was a Bishop or high Priest, is partly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of that of the Psalme 98. 6. <hi>Moyses &amp; Aaron in
Sacerdotibus eius. Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his Priests: and partly also by the Priestly fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that he exercised. For that (as it is written <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.
8.)</hi> he consecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> a Priest, he sanctified the
Tabernacle and the Aultar, he offered Sacrifice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locaustes,
and Incense to our Lord. And this was
not lawfull for any to do, but Priests, according to that
of 2. <hi>Paralip. 26. 18. Non est officij tui, Ozia, vt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas
incensum Domino, sed sacerdotum.</hi> It is not your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>Ozias,</hi> to offer incense to our Lord, but the office
of Priestes. Lastly, that he was a Prophet, is manifest
by that <hi>Num. 12. 6. Si quis fuerit inter vos Propheta
Domini &amp;c. Yf there shalbe among you a Prophet of our
Lord, in vision will I appeare to him, or in sleep will I
speake vnto him. But my seruant Moyses is not such a one,
who in all my house is most faithfull: for mouth to mouth
I speake to him, and openly, and not by riddles and figures
doth he see the Lord &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. Now as for <hi>Iosue,</hi> he succeded not <hi>Moyses</hi> in
all these offices. For he succeded him not in Bishoply
degree, or high Priesthood: Nor yet in law-making.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23323:33"/>
In Prophesy, whether he did or no, I dispute not. But
that he succeeded him in temporall Principality, it is
manifest out of <hi>Num. 27. 18. Dixitue Dominus ad Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
tolle Iosue filium Nun &amp;c. And our Lord said to
Moyses, take Iosue the sonne of Nun &amp;c. And put thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: who shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, &amp; al the
multitude: &amp; thou shalt giue him precepts in the sight of al,
&amp; part of thy glory that all the Synagogue of the Children
of Israell may heare him. For him, if any thing be to be done,
Eleazar the Priest shal consult the Lord. At his word shal he
go out, &amp; shal go in, and al the Children of Israel with him,
and the rest of the multitude &amp;c.</hi> In which words three
things are to be noted which make to our purpose: the
first, that <hi>Iosue,</hi> was designed the successour of <hi>Moyses:</hi>
the second, that <hi>Moyses</hi> gaue him <hi>part of his glory,</hi> that
is to say, he gaue him not all the power he had, aswell
Ecclesiastical, as temporall, but temporall onely: the
third, that he should be subiect to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High
Priest, and do euery thing at this commandement. For
this do those wordes signify, <hi>Pro hoc &amp;c. For him</hi> (to
wit Iosue) <hi>if any thing be to be done, Eleazar the Priest
shall consult the Lord. At his word</hi> (to wit of Eleazar)
<hi>shall Iosue go out, and in &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28. Heere may you playnely see, in how different
a sense you alleaged that place, <hi>Sicut in istis obediuimus
Moysi, ita obediemus &amp; tibi:</hi> As in these thinges we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
<hi>Moyses,</hi> so will we obey you. For you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it thus; as who should say, the people of the

and ciuill, as they had obeyed <hi>Moyses.</hi> But
you are deceyued. First, for that in Ecclesiastical affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
they were to obey <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest. Secondly,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23323:33"/>
because those words <hi>(as we haue obeyed Moyses)</hi> were
not vttered of all the people, but only of the <hi>Rubenites,
Gaddites,</hi> and of halfe the Tribe of <hi>Manasses.</hi> Neyther
did they say, that they would obey <hi>Iosue</hi> in all thinges
<hi>simply,</hi> wherin they had before obeyed <hi>Moyses</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
somtymes they murmured against him, &amp; did
not obay him:) but in those thinges only, which were
appointed them by <hi>Moyses,</hi> to wit, that they should
leaue their wiues, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; cattle in the place where
they then were, and arming themselues, togeather
with the rest of the Tribes, should passe ouer <hi>Iordan,</hi>
and fight against their enemies, vntil they being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
the rest of the Tribes should there make their
quiet possession. And this is euident out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Scripture it selfe <hi>Iosue</hi> 1. 12. in these wordes:
<hi>Rubenitis quoque &amp; Gadditis, &amp; dimidiae tribui Manasse
ait &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>To the Rubenites also and Gaddites, and to
halfe the tribe of <hi>Manasses, Iosue</hi> said: Remember the
word which <hi>Moyses</hi> the seruant of our Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you, saying: Our Lord your God hath giuen you
rest, and all this land, your wiues and children, and
cattle shall tarry in the land, which <hi>Moyses</hi> deliuered
vnto you beyond <hi>Iordan:</hi> but passe you ouer armed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your brethren, all that are strong of hand, &amp; fight
for them, vntill our Lord giue rest to your brethren, as
to you also he hath giuen; and they also possesse the
land, which our Lord your God will giue them, and so
returne into the land of your possession: and you shall
dwell in it, which <hi>Moyses</hi> the seruant of our Lord
gaue you beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> against the rising of the sunne
&amp;c. Thus <hi>Iosue</hi> to the people. So as that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
followeth (to wit, <hi>Omnia quae praecepisti no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23323:34"/>
&amp;c.</hi> All thinges that thou hast commanded vs, we
will do, and whithersoeuer thou shalt send vs, we will
go. And as we obeyed <hi>Moyses</hi> in all things, so will we
obey thee also,) is referred to that which went before.</q>
But there is no mention made of Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but only of taking armes against their enemyes,
who possessed their land.</p>
            <p>29. On this syde then, as you see, your Argument
falleth to the ground, &amp; proceedeth from a false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
On the other side, that which you bring of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and Idolatrous Kinges, I do not see what force it
may haue. For that those three Kinges, which you
mention, were by your owne confession eyther Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
of the Church of God, or they were not. I
hope you will not say that they were, because yow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the contrary more then once in your <hi>Tortura:</hi>
and that worthily: to wit, that they who be out of
the Church of God, cannot be Princes and Rulers in
the same Church. Yf they were not Primates of the
Church, as certes they were not, how then will you
proue by this their example, that the King of <hi>England</hi>
is head or Primate of the Church? This only you may
conclude, that as the Iewes durst not go forth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
to sacrifice to God, without King <hi>Pharao</hi> his
leaue, who had brought them into cruell bondage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his yoke: So in like manner the Catholickes, that
liue in <hi>England,</hi> dare not go out to other Catholicke
Countries, where they may receiue the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
after the Catholick manner, without King <hi>Iames</hi>
his leaue, who will not suffer them so to do, without
his licence, vnder payne of death or imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And
the like may be said of the other two Idolatrous Kings.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23323:34"/>
But what is this to the Primacy of the Church? I
should rather thinke it belonged to tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny or impiety.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion to the Chaplayne.</head>
               <p>30. YOvv haue heere briefly, what I haue
thought concerning your Booke, which
you haue written in defence of your King:
You haue heere (I say) these three pointes: First, that
you haue oftentimes handled the matter not so much
in Argument, as in raylings or exprobrations. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that you haue defyled euery thing with Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
and false opinions. Thirdly, that you haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ouerthrowne then established the Kings Primacy,
which you sought to fortify: and all these things haue
you done through a certayne desire you haue to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the King. Therefore if you shall represse this your
desire, and behould the onely truth of the thing it selfe,
it will be very easy for you to amend your former
faultes, which I altogeather counsell you to doe. And
if you set God before your eyes (who is the first and
principall verity) you will doe it.</p>

            <p>IN your booke you do so compare a King and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
togeather, that you manifestly depresse the
Authority of the one, and extoll the Dignity
(higher then is sitting) of the other. And therefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23323:35"/>
what others haue thought before you concerning this
point, I will briefly lay before your eyes, that you may
choose whether, changing your opinion, you will

in your errour. Thus then haue others thought and
taught before you.</p>
