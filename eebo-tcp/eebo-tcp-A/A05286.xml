            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26635:5"/>Nowe for the tumultes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities that folowed in <hi>Alamania,</hi> not longe after this, I wyll omytte to tell, becauſe they be meatelye well knowen, and ſhoulde be to tediouſe to be told in this preface, only I wil ſaye that they proceded ſo farre, as they raunged from Duchelande to Englande, where was practiſed the lyke mater, but wanted the like effecte, onely by the myghty power of God, who preſerued the royall bloude, from the crueltye of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious deuyce.</p>
            <p>Many opinions enſuynge of this ſect, one was more wycked among vs Chriſtians, then amonge the Mahomites: for wher as they were contente to haue one of the auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent interpretours of the lawe, to be the ſtaye of the ſame, we wuld haue none at all, but that euerye manne ſhulde be a prophet at his pleaſure: by reaſon wherof folowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groſſe errour, that learnynge and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:26635:6"/>
was not alonely not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and expediente, but alſo wycked and vnprofytable. Who ſo euer was reputed learned, he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred lyke a ſerpent. The whiche blaſphemous deuice, made me pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyſe with moſt profounde writers, amonge the whiche, I founde thys Homelye of ſo worthye a doctoure, and trauayled in it, both for latyn and Engliſhe, but neuer went any further, becauſe I truſted ſome other of greater knowledge, wulde haue ſet it forth, with greater auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie. And at that time, it had ben more expedient then nowe, becauſe it is to be hoped, that the chaunge of tyme, haue chaunged many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hartes. But becauſe I ſe ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayndre of that infection ſtyll left in the dominions of this kingdom, I do with no leſſe loue of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye, ſet forth this good leſſon to my countrey men, then <hi>Baſilius</hi> dyd to his kynſemen. For I am of thys
<pb facs="tcp:26635:6"/>
opinion, that the feruent loue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a man heareth earneſtly to hys countreye, is not inferioure to that which a father beareth to his chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as he was carefull that his yonge coſynnes ſhoulde be well inſtructe and furnyſhed with ſuche knowledge, as might brynge them to the hight of holye ſcripture: euen ſo, I as carefully do wyſſhe all my countrey men, as well younge as olde, to enbrace learnynge, to ſtudy for vnderſtandynge of Poetes and Philoſophers, that they may come the more able to go thorough with the aucthores of Scripture. Yf ye bare the ſcience of humanitie, ye bare all in effecte, yea, diuinitie to.</p>
            <p>Trueth it is, that amonge the Turkes is none other learnynge, than is left behynd in theyr <hi>Alcorane</hi> in ſo muche as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that ſometyme were the floryſhyng peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the worlde, be nowe the moſt vyle and baſte, and all becauſe the
<pb facs="tcp:26635:7"/>
practiſe of learnyng is taken from them. Al the auncient Princes and ſtates, founded theim ſelues vpon religion. The Gentyles had theyr religion in oracles and ſacryfyces, whiche they kept ſo ſtraytelye that the people were moore afrayde of God then of the lawe of men. Is it not euidente that the Romaynes would kepe theyr othe whatſoeuer came of it? <hi>Regulus, Scipio, Torquatus,</hi> and many other teſtifye the ſame, whiche in daungerouſe tymes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued theyr countrey; and whan this ſtreyghte obſeruation waxed looſe amonge them, then theyr ſtate fell to ruyne. The Prynces and ſtates of Chryſtendome, that wyll main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them ſelues vncorrupt, muſt ſe religion duelye kepte: yf there be no learnynge, there can be no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yf there be no religion, there muſte nedes be barbarouſnes and confuſion. Therefore as this holye wryter <hi>Baſilius Magnus,</hi> a noble man
<pb facs="tcp:26635:7"/>
borne, wrote this aduertiſement in Greke to his nephewes, and they gladlye dyd accept it, ſo I praye my countrye men as wyllynglye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſame in Engliſh, becauſe they that chiefly be entangled with ſuche errour as I haue tolde, know none other tounge but Englyſhe. And as the gentlemen of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> receyued profyt by thys auctor. ſo may the tranſlation be profytable to all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of this region, the which God graunt.
