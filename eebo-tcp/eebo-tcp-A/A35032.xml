            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One of these Houses is a fair gentile House, wherein there are six lodging Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; each one a convenient Study to it, with a Standish left in them, besides several other lodging Rooms.</p>
            <p>The other House is also a good Countrey House, with several Chambers, and Studies to some of them, all in very good repair: But the Furniture now removed, we cannot yet find whither.</p>
            <p>The remaining Dwellers in the House, who were but Under-Servants, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess: They are apparently Perjured; For they flatly denied, upon Oath, several things, which were made out by others, and then they confessed them.</p>
            <p>There are One and twenty Chimnies in both Houses, and a great many Doors to go in and out at; and likewise many private Passages from one Room to the other.</p>
            <p>These Houses are seated at the bottom of a thick woody and rocky Hill, with several hollow places in the Rocks, wherein Men may conceal themselves; and there is a very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50390:5"/>
private Passage from one of the Houses, into this Wood.</p>
            <p>In one of these Houses there was a Study found, the Door thereof very hardly to be discovered, being placed behind a Bed, and plaistred over like the Wall adjoining, in which was found great store of Divinity Books, and others, in Folio and Quarto, and many other lesser Books, several Horse-loads, (but they are not yet brought to me, it being <hi>Christmas</hi> Holy-days, but they remain in a safe hand) many whereof are written by the principal learned Jesuits.</p>
            <p>And there were found two Paper Books in Folio, in the Front of one written,
<q>
                  <l>Ordinationes variae pro Collegio Sancti Xaverii.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>(Xaverius</hi> was the Co-founder with <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> of the Jesuits Order, and his Picture was there set up.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordinationes,</hi> doth not here signifie <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as we commonly understand it; but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Rules sent from the Generals of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50390:5"/>
Jesuits <hi>Carassa</hi> and <hi>Paulus Oliva,</hi> to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits here inhabiting; as also Instructions from the Provincials of the Jesuits living in <hi>London,</hi> unto those here.</p>
            <p>The other Paper Book contains the great Benefactors, being Queens, Princes, Nobles, and several others of this and divers other Nations, who have contributed towards the Foundation of <hi>Iesuit Colleges,</hi> or the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of them; and likewise the number of Masses appointed to be said for their Souls.</p>
            <p>There was also found a Latin Book in Folio, declaring, <hi>That there is in</hi> London <hi>a College dedicated to</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ignatius, <hi>with Revenues belonging to it, for the Iesuit Novices in the time of Probation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One in</hi> Wales (which I suppose are these two Houses) <hi>dedicated to</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Xaverius.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50390:6"/>
               <hi>A third is</hi> (the Book saith) <hi>in</hi> Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, <hi>or</hi> Lancashire, <hi>dedicated to</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Aloysius, <hi>another prime Iesuit: which Colleges, when</hi> England <hi>shall be reduced to the Obedience of the Pope, shall never be altered,</hi> as this Book directs. This printed Book, and the other two Paper Books in Folio, I have.</p>
            <p>There are about Fifteen or Sixteen seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral printed Books, containing the Decrees of the several Congregations of that Society at <hi>Rome,</hi> that contain onely the Rules of the <hi>Society of Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are several Books lately written and printed against the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and many small Popish Catechisms printed and tyed up in a bundle; and some Welsh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Books lately printed, and some Popish Manuscripts fairly and lately written.</p>
            <p>Likewise there is a Picture of <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> the Founder of the Society, and the most remarkable Actions and pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50390:6"/>
of his Life, not only written in print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books, but in Pictures in several sheets, which Pictures refer to <hi>Ribadeneira</hi>'s Book of <hi>Loiola</hi>'s Life.</p>
            <p>There is a loose Paper dated the First day of <hi>March</hi> 1652. (it seems this was then founded a College) in which directions were given, that an Account of the Revenue and Disbursments should be sent yearly to the College in <hi>Rome:</hi> It is there also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the same year there were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed 34; reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 155 (a great number;) of those that were fallen from the Church and regained 15, and other matters.</p>
            <p>One Letter seems written by the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to them of this House, wherein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is made, <hi>That there was not Care enough taken to send Young Men to</hi> Rome, <hi>to be there bred up in the</hi> English College; <hi>and for which,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Pope was much displeased, and threatned to take away their College there, and fill it up with Scholars of some other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Order.</hi>

This <hi>Pullen</hi> names seven several <hi>Iesuit Priests,</hi> viz. <hi>Prichard, Archer, Harris, Lewis, Price, Humfreys,</hi> and <hi>Draicot,</hi> who were used to resort thither, and say Mass there: but the Altar, with all the Ornaments thereof, was taken down, and conveyed away, only the Altar Stone remaining with five Crosses cut in it one at each corner, and one in the middle.</p>
            <p>Two <hi>Vestments,</hi> with some other small matters, were found in two Boxes hid in the Wood above-specifi'd <hi>(it seems the other things were but newly removed; and they had begun also to remove the Library, for they had carried out and hid in a Pigs-Cot adjoining, about two Horse-loads of Books.)</hi>

            <head>A Relation of the Knavery of Father LEWIS, the pretended Bishop of LANDAFFE.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Amongst other things which fell out in the Examination of the <hi>Jesuits College</hi> at <hi>Come</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> there is fully proved by several Witnesses, this true Story following; which being matter of Fact, cannot be denied.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere is, amongst the Foxes of this Kennel, one <hi>Lewis,</hi> one of the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished number of Jesuits of the College; who is reported to be the Titular Bishop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> and who is now Prisoner in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a poor Woman, to whom this <hi>Lewis</hi> was a Confessor; her Father was a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50390:9"/>
vicious Liver, and dyed about half a year ago</p>
            <p>This poor Woman having been taught the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and being (it seems) of a very tender nature, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the condition of her Father<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Soul, which she apprehended, by their doctrine, was in great torment in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thereupon fell into a great grief and sorrow; and, with tears in her eyes, address'd her self to this Father. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and told him, <hi>She was inform'd, that he could use means to fetch her Fathers Soul immediately out of Purgatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven; and that she would give him all she had in the world to have it done with speed, though she did not leave her self one penny to live on</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, Father <hi>Lewis,</hi> after a long pause, told her, thus: <hi>Daughter, I am glad to see so much grace in you, as to believe the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Purgatory, so firmly as to be so truly sensible of the Torture of your Fathers Soul therein: True it is, I can (with the assistance of our most Holy Father the Pope) bring your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50390:9"/>
Fathers Soul out of Purgatory into Heaven; but it will cost a great deal of money: For I must send over to</hi> Rome, <hi>to have power herein, and several Masses must be celebrated both in</hi> Rome, <hi>and all other Colledges of Iesuits, and other Offices perform'd to do the work; which,</hi> Father <hi>Lewis</hi> said, <hi>would cost a great deal of money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor Woman answer'd, <hi>She did not care what it cost her; so dear, so precious was her Fathers Soul to her, that she would give all she had to have it done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then she ask'd him, <hi>How much it would cost to have it done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who, after a pause, and reckoning upon his fingers-ends, told her, <hi>It would cost One Hundred pound to have it well done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that the Woman cry'd bitterly, and said, <hi>She was not worth half so much money in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50390:10"/>
Then Father <hi>Lewis</hi> told her, <hi>He would do it for Fourscore pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Woman reply'd, <hi>She was not worth half Fourscore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Father <hi>Lewis</hi> ask'd her, <hi>What she was worth in the whole world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which she answer'd very honestly and truly, <hi>That she was worth but Thirty five pound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Father <hi>Lewis</hi> told her, <hi>Because she was poor, that he would take but Thirty pound:</hi> And thereupon they agreed.</p>
            <p>But when Father <hi>Lewis</hi> understood after from the Woman, that she had no ready money, he began to storm, and to be in a great passion; yet at last he was contented to take her own Bond for the Thirty pound: but took the Bond in a Friends name, and caus'd the Woman to give a Warrant to an
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50390:10"/>
Attorney to confess Judgment upon the Bond, which was done accordingly; and the money was to be paid within six Weeks, within which time Father <hi>Lewis</hi> undertook peremptorily to have the Man's Soul out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> into <hi>Heaven,</hi> and so they parted, and the Woman hereby much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, as soon as ever the six Weeks were over, and the money became due, Father <hi>Lewis</hi> sent to the poor Woman, to come to him again, and as soon as ever she came, he produc'd unto her a Book with gilded Leaves, and red Letters; and after he had tumbled the Leaves of the Book backward and forward, he clapt the Book to his car, and then said thus, looking into the Book,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here it is, I am sure now your business is done; this I tell you to your comfort that your Father's Soul is as surely in Heaven at this very time, as I am here in this Chair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50390:11"/>
And then after a little time that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had express'd her joy at these good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Father <hi>Lewis</hi> ask'd her, <hi>Whether she had brought him his money, the Thirty pound she was engaged for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She answer'd, <hi>She had not brought him all, because her money was out in other mens hands, and could not get it in so soon; but she had brought him Ten pound, and humbly intreated him to receive that at present, and he should have the residue as soon as possibly she could get it in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at this Father <hi>Lewis</hi> was startled, that she had not brought the whole Sum, and fell into a violent fury with the poor Woman, reviled her, gave her many harsh and bitter Words, threaten'd the poor Woman to send Bayliffs to take her in Execution upon her Judgment, and cast her Body into Prison; and not only so, but threaten'd to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate her also, for the breach of her faith, in not paying the Thirty pound, according to her Engagement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50390:11"/>
But, upon second thoughts, Father <hi>Lewis</hi> took the Ten pound, and he came to this farther agreement with her, which was, that she should pay Five pound more forthwith, and the other Fifteen pound within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a year after; and if she failed, then to render her Body to Prison, and suffer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
            <p>After this, the poor Woman made hard shift to pay Father <hi>Lewis</hi> the Five pound, but before the other Fifteen was due, a man of the Protestant Religion, sollicited the poor Woman for Marriage. The poor Woman ingenuously and conscientiously confess'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>That she was worth nothing, but was in debt to her Ghostly Father</hi> Lewis <hi>Fifteen pound:</hi> And acquainted him how, and for what she came to be so indebted. This man, notwithstanding, marries her, and afterwards, by degrees, drew her from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and then brought her before a Justice of Peace, to whom she discover'd all this upon Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50390:12"/>
And this Woman knowing where her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confessor <hi>Lewis</hi> us'd to hide himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground, under a clay Floor, cunningly contriv'd in a poor despicable Cottage; and being now exasperated at the <hi>Holy Cheat</hi> and desirous, as is most just, to catch his person, as he would have catched hers; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to have satisfaction from him for the money he (with so much uncharitableness) cheated her of, did conduct a Justice of Peace to the place, where they found and unken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel'd the Fox, and from thence the Justice of Peace sent Father <hi>Lewis</hi> to <hi>Monmouth</hi> Gaol, where he now continues.</p>
