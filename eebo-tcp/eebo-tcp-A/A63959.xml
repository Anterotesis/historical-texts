            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

did any poor Creature come unto God with greater
Confidence in his Mercy, and Assurance of Acceptation
with him, through Jesus Christ, than I do; but it is
through Jesus Christ, for there is no other way of coming
to God but by him, to find acceptance with him; there
is no other Name given under. Heaven whereby we can
be saved, but the Name of Jesus: <hi>Then speaking to
the Officers, he said,</hi> Labour every one of you to be
fit to dye, for I tell you, you are not fit to dye: I was not
fit to dye my self 'till I came in hither; but O blessed be
God, he hath made me fit to dye, and hath made me will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Blessed Jesus, and that not for a day, but for ever:
I am going to the Kingdom of God, to the Kingdom of
God, where I shall enjoy the presence of God the Father,
and of God the Son, and of God the Holy Spirit, and
of all the Holy Angels, I am going to the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the First-born, and of the spirits of just Men
made perfect: O that God should ever do so much for
me! O that God should concern himself so much for
the good of poor Creatures, for their salvation, blessed be
his Name! for this was the design of God from all
Eternity, to give his only Son to dye for poor miserable
sinners. <hi>Then the Officers going to tye his Hands,
he said,</hi> What, must I be tyed then? well, a brown Thred
might have served the turn; you need not tye me at all,

Night than in all the Days and Nights of my whole life; and I
hope the Lord will continue it, that his Name may be glorified
by me the meanest and poorest of all his Servants, but through
Free-grace faithful unto the end: My Soul is ravished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can
hardly write, and my Comforts are more unspeakable than my
Terrors were. I did this Evening see my dearest Brother and
Companion; his Face was to me as that of an Angel, and he
gave me that Comfort, that I cannot but say my Love to him
is beyond what I ever had to my dearest Relations. When God
comes, every thing hath a beauty and lustre upon it; here is an
Answer of Prayers, and such an Answer as Dearest Relations,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93667:5"/>
must engage you all to be constant in performance of that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, though it stand upon the Earth,
yet it reaches up to Heaven: Here's the Love of God made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to a poor Sinner at the last hour; like the Thief upon
the Cross, he that never knew before what the Love of God was
to his Soul, finds it now filled with it, and running over. Now
bless the Lord, O my Soul! yea all that is within me, Bless his
holy Name for this Dispensation: Now light appears out of
darkness in the face of Jesus; now all worldly Joy and Comforts
seem to me (as they are) things not hard to part with; Father,
Mother, Brothers, Sister, Wife, Children, House and Lands are
(as my Dear Saviour saith,) to be parted with for him, or we are
not worthy of him: I Bless his Name, I find no reluctancy to do
it; he hath brought me to his foot-stool, and I can say hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Will of the Lord be done in this Matter. I never before
but saw a beauty in worldly Comforts, but now those seem so
faded by the greater lustre and beauty that I see in God in Christ
Jesus, that I am astonished where I have been wandering all my
dayes, spending my time and my money for that which is not
Bread. O strive to get a taste of this Love of God in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus!
and it will perfectly wean you from this deceitful foolish
World: What is worldly Honour and Riches! O set not your
hearts upon them, but get a Treasure in Heaven, that your hearts
may be there also: O lose no time! for if you ever knew the
sweetness of it, you would never be at rest 'till you found him
whom your Soul loved; it will be more, yea infinitely more than
all worldly Injoyments can afford you, though in their greatest
perfection; it will make your Life sweet, and your Death most
comfortable: It is the Bread which this World knoweth not of,
and therefore maketh little or no enquiry after it. Dearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
whilst you and my other dear Friends are like <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Hur,</hi> holding up the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> I am through Grace get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Victory over the <hi>Amalakites.</hi> I can embrace my dear and
beloved Brother and Companion with more Joy in the field of
Suffering, than ever I could have done, had I met him crowned
with the Laurels of Victory: Oh the Mercy to dye with such a
Friend, and such a valiant Souldier of Jesus, who hath kept his
garments clean. I now begin to pity you that stay behind, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93667:5"/>
have many Temptations to conflict with; for a little, yea a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little time, and my warfare will be accomplished; and if God
continue his Love and Influence upon my Soul, it will be both
short and sweet. I have little of this World about me, I leave
you all the Legacy of what was ever dearest to me, the best of
Wives, and five poor Children, who must pass through an evil
and sinful World; but I have committed them to God, who hath
commanded to cast our Fatherless Children and Widdows upon
him. Dear Parents, Brothers, Sister, all adieu, my time draws
on, my Paper is finished, and your dying Child and Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
you all to him who is alsufficient, to the God of Peace
that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of the sheep, through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant,
who will make you perfect in every good work to do his Will,
working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through
Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THE Providence of God hath so ordered it, that your
poor and ever loving Father is taken from you in such
a manner as may cast both worldly Loss and Reproach
upon you; but I charge you let not this be a Stumbling-block
to you in the way of God, but that you remember your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in the days of your Youth: That you never neglect a day
without reading the Holy Scripture, wherein you'l find your
Duty both to God and Man; there you'l find the way to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life; there you'l find Christ Jesus instructing you, and
dying for you. Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and all other
things will be added to you: After your Duty to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
your dying Father charges and conjures you, as you'l an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it at the great day of Appearance of our dearest Saviour,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93667:6"/>
that you be dutiful and loving to the best of Mothers, as long
as God shall continue that great Mercy to you: Hearken to her
Voyce, and be obedient to the words of her Mouth, for she'll
be faithful to your Souls and Bodies; and remember that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Parents hath the Promise of this Life, as well as of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life. Pay a great Duty and Obedience to your Grandfather
and Grandmother, Unkles and Aunt, who all of them have not
only testified the greatest Love to your dying Father, but from
whom, if you carry your selves as becomes you, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
both the good things of this World, and Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
for what is far beyond all temporal Blessings. Diligence in
your lawful Callings to which God shall in his Providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
you, is both commendable, and a Duty; but let not the
eager pursuit of the things of this World, justle out the Time
allotted for better things: Prayer will bless what you get in
your Imployments, and so at once you obtain Gods Blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
worldly mercies, and find God manifesting himself to you in
his dear Son Christ Jesus, in the Pardon of your sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
worldly things in the Covenant. Your tender years in
which I leave you in this wicked and deceitful world, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you subject to many temptations, but I commit you to the
Father of the Fatherless, who is able to preserve you both in
Soul and Body: your poor Father hath no Legacy to leave you
but the Blessing of the great Jehovah, which he begs for you
upon the bended knees of his Soul. The Lord God bless you
with the Dew of Heaven, and if he sees good, give you <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
Portion, Food and Raiment; and if the Lord bless you with
any temporal Goods, remember they are Talents, employ them
well to the Masters use: No Duty so acceptable to God as
Charity, that's it which our Saviour exalts so far, that he saith,
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom, for I was an
hungry and ye fed me, naked and ye cloathed me, sick and in prison
and ye visited me.</hi> I die and leave you, but if you keep close
to God and his ways, he will never leave you nor forsake
you: The summe of the whole is, <hi>Fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi>
Do that to all others that you would they should
do to you, is the golden Rule of the Gospel, and will be a
great Preservative to you from offending either God or Man.
Eternity calls me away, and I have neither Time nor Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93667:6"/>
to add more: Your Duties may be various in the World,
as Servants, as Masters, as Husbands, as Wives, as Parents:
There is no Condition of life but hath its Comforts and its
Troubles; the Lord fit you for whatsoever Condition he calls
you to, whether Honour or Dishonour, Riches or Poverty:
But remember, whatsoever it be, it is God's Providence orders
and governs the World. Dear <hi>James,</hi> as thou art the eldest,
strive to be the best, and a good Example to the rest, a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and a loving Son: Whatever thou or the rest have lost by
me, God can make up even in this Life. My dear Babes, who
have been all Pledges of my Love, by the best and most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
Wife; I do once more beg it of you, as my last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
that you obey, love and honour her, who hath been the
greatest worldly Blessing to your Father, and will never think
any thing too much to do for you. My dear Children, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
I must now take my leave both of you and all worldly
Comforts: I trust and hope I am going to the Eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,

               <head>Mr. Nelthrope's last Speech.</head>
               <p>THE great and inexpressible trouble and distraction I have
been under since I came into trouble, especially since my
close Confinement in <hi>Newgate,</hi> hath so broken my Reason, that
for many weeks last past, till the day my Sentence was passed,
I have not had any composure of mind, and have been under
the greatest trouble imaginable: Since my dearest Wife hath
had the favour granted her of coming to me, I am at present
under great composedness of mind, through the infinite goodness
of the Lord. As to what I stand Outlawed for, and am now
sentenced to Dye, I can with comfort appeal to the great God,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93667:7"/>
before whose Tribunal I am to appear, that what I did was in the
simplicity of my heart, without seeking any private advantage to
my self, but thinking it my Duty to hazard my Life for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Protestant Religion and English Liberties, which I
thought invaded, and both in great danger of being lost. As to the
design of Assassinating the late King, or his present Majesty, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
was a thing highly against my Judgment, and which I always
detested; and I was never in the least concerned in it, neither in
Purse nor Person, nor never knew of any Arms bought for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
nor did I believe there was any such design, nor ever heard
of any disappointment in such an Affair, or Arms, or Time or
Place, save what after the discovery of the General design, Mr.
<hi>West</hi> spoke of, as to Arms bought by him: And as to my self, I was
in the North when the late King was at <hi>New-market,</hi> and the first
news I had of the Fire, was at <hi>Beverly</hi> in <hi>York-shire.</hi> As to my coming
over with the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> it was in prosecution of the
same ends; but the Lord in his holy and wise Providence hath been
pleased to blast all our undertakings; tho there seemed to be a
very unanimous and zealous spirit in all those that came from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas: And as to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being declared
King, I was wholly passive in it, I never having been present at any
publick Debate of that affair, and should never have advised it, but
complained of it to Coll. <hi>Holms</hi> and Captain <hi>Patchet.</hi> I believe
the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Mr. <hi>F</hi>—the chief Promoters of it. As to the
Temptation of being an Evidence, and bringing either into trouble
or danger any the meanest Person of his Life, upon the Account
for which I suffer, I always abhorred and detested the thoughts
of it, both when in and out of danger, and advised some very
strongly against it; except when under my distractions in Prison,
that amongst other temptations did violently assault me; but
through the goodness of my dearest God and Father, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from it, and indeed was wholly incapable, and could never
receive the least shadow of comfort from it, but thought Death
more eligible, and was some time afore, out of my distracted and
disquieted condition, wholly free from it; thô not without other
Temptations far more Criminal in the sight of men. I bless the
Father of all mercies, and God of all Consolations, that I find a
great Resignedness of my Will to his, finding infinitely more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in Death, than ever I could place in Life, thô in a Condition
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93667:7"/>
that might seem honourable, every hour seeing the Will of God
in ordering this Affair more and more cleared up to me. God
hath given, God hath taken, blessed be his holy Name, that hath
enabled me to be willing to suffer, rather than to put forth my
hand to Iniquity, or to say a Confederacy with those that do so.
I am heartily and sincerely troubled for what hath happened,
many mens Lives being lost, and many poor distressed Families
rained; the Lord pardon what of sin he hath seen in it. He
in his wonderful Providence hath made me and others concerned,
Instruments, not only for what is already fallen out, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
for hastening some other great work he hath to do in these
Kingdoms; whereby he will try and purge his People, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
the Chaff from the Wheat: the Lord keep those that are
his, faithful unto the end.</p>
               <p>I dye-in Charity with all the World, and can readily and
heartily forgive my greatest Enemies, even those that have
been Evidences against me; and I most humbly beg the Pardon
of all I have any wise in the least injured; and in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
most humbly ask Pardon of the Lady <hi>Loyl</hi>'s Family and
Relations, for that my being succoured there one night with
Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> brought that worthy Lady to suffer Death: I was
wholly a Stranger to her Ladyship, and came with Mr. <hi>Hicks;</hi>
neither did she (as I verily believe) know who I was, or
my Name, 'till I was taken: And if any other have come to
any loss or trouble, I humbly beg their Pardon; and were I
in a Condition, I would, as far as I was able, make them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital.
As to my Faith, I neither look nor hope for mercy,
but only in the Free Grace of God, by the Application of the
Blood of Jesus my dearest and only Saviour, to my poor sinful
Soul: my Distresses have been exceeding great as to my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
State, but through the infinite Goodness of God, tho I have
many sins to answer for, yet I hope and trust, as to my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that Christ came for this very end and purpose, to
relieve the Oppressed, and to be a Physitian to the sick. I
come unto thee, O blessed Jesus, refuse me not, but wash me
in thine own Blood, and then present me to thy Father as
righteous! What tho my sins be as Crimson, and of a Scarlet
dye, yet thou canst make them as white as Snow. I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my self but what must utterly ruine and condemn me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93667:8"/>
I cannot answer for one action of my whole Life, but I cast
my self wholly upon thee, who art the Fountain of Mercy, in
whom God is reconciling himself to the World, the greatest
of Sins and Sinners may find an All-sufficiency in thy Blood
to cleanse them from all sin. O dearest Father of Mercy, look
upon me as righteous in and through the imputed righteousness
of thy Son; he hath payed the debt by his own offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for sin, and in that thy Justice is satisfied, and thy Mercy is
magnified. Grant me thy love O dearest Father, assist me and
stand by me in the needful hour of Death, give thy Angels charge
over my poor Soul, that the Evil One may not touch nor hurt
it. Defend me from his power, deliver me from his rage, and
receive me into thine Eternal Kingdom, in and through the alone
Merits of my dearest Redeemer, for whom I praise thee: To
whom with thy self and Holy Spirit be ascribed all Glory, Honour,
Power, Might and Dominion, for ever and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>NOT knowing whether I should be suffer'd or able, because
of weaknesses that are upon me through my hard and close
Imprisonment, to speak at the place of Execution; I writ these
few lines to signifie, That I am well reconciled to the way of
my God towards me, though it be in ways I looked not for,
and by terrible things, yet in righteousness; having given me
Life, he ought to have the disposing of it, when and how he
pleases to call for it; and I desire to offer up my All to him, it
being but my reasonable Service; and also the first Terms that
Jesus Christ offers, that he that will be his Disciple must forsake
all and follow him, and therefore let none think hard or be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
at what hath happened unto me; for he doth nothing
without cause, in all he hath done unto us, he being holy in all
his wayes, and righteous in all his works; and 'tis but my lot
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93667:8"/>
in common with poor desolate <hi>Sion</hi> at this day: Neither do I
find in my heart the least regret for what I have done in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of my Lord and Master Jesus Christ, in succouring and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and of his poor Sufferers, that have shewed favour to his
righteous Cause; which Cause though now it be fallen and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon, as if it had not been annointed, yet it shall revive, and
God will plead it at another rate than ever he hath done yet, and
reckon with all its opposers and malitious haters; and therefore
let all that love and fear him, not omit the least Duty that comes
to hand, or lies before them; knowing that now it hath need
of them, and expects they shall serve him: And I desire to bless
his holy Name, that he hath made me useful in my generation,
to the comfort and relief of many desolate ones, and the blessing
of those that are ready to perish has come upon me, and being
helpt to make the Heart of the Widdow to sing. And I bless
his holy Name, that in all this, together with what I was Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, I can approve my Heart to him, that I have done his
Will, though it does cross Man's Will: and the Scriptures that
satisfie me are <hi>Isa. 16. 4. Hide the Outcasts, bewray not him that
wandereth:</hi> And <hi>Obad. 13, 14. Thou shouldst not have given up those
of his that did escape in the day of his distress:</hi> But Man says, you shall
give them up, or you shall dye for it; now who to Obey, Judge
ye: So that I have cause to rejoyce and be exceeding glad, in
that I suffer for righteousness sake, and that I am accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to suffer for well doing, and that God has accepted any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from me, which has been done in sincerity, though mixed
with manifold infirmities, which he hath been pleased for Christ's
sake to cover and forgive. And now as concerning my Fact, as
it is called, alas it was but a little one, and might well become
a Prince to forgive; but he that shews no Mercy, shall find none:
And I may say of it in the language of <hi>Jonathan, I did but tast a
little honey, and lo I must dye for it;</hi> I did but relieve an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
poor, distressed Family, and so I must dye for it: Well, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in the Lamb-like Gospel spirit, to forgive all that are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to say, Lord lay it not to their Charge; but I fear he will
not: nay, I believe when he comes to make inquisition for Blood,
it will be found at the door of the furious Judge; who because
I could not remember things, through my dauntedness at <hi>Burden</hi>'s
Wife and Daughters vileness, and my ignorance, took advantage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93667:9"/>
thereat, and would not hear me, when I had called to mind that
which I am sure would have invalidated their evidence; though
he granted something of the same kind to another at that
time, yet denyed it unto me. My Blood will also be found at
the door of the unrighteous Jury, who found me guilty upon the
single Oath of an Out-lawed Man; for there was none but his
Oath about the Money, who is no legal Witness, though he be
Pardoned, his Outlawry not being recalled; and also the Law
requires two Witnesses in point of Life: And then about my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him to the place mentioned, 'twas by his own words,
before he was Outlawed, for 'twas two Months after his abscond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and though in a Proclamation, yet not High Treason, as
I have heard; so that I am clearly Murdered by you. And also
bloody Mr. <hi>A.</hi> who has so unsatiably hunted after my Life, and
though it is no Profit to him, through the ill will he bore me,
left no stone unturn'd as I have ground to believe, 'till he brought
it to this; and shewed favour to <hi>Burton,</hi> who ought to have
dyed for his own fault, and not bought his Life with mine; and
Capt. <hi>R.</hi> who is cruel and severe to all under my Circumstances,
and did at that time, without all Mercy or Pity hasten my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and held up my hand, that it might be given; all which,
together with the great One of all, by whose Power all these, and
a multitude more of Cruelties are done, I do heartily and freely
forgive, as against me; but as it it is done in an implacable mind
against the Lord Christ, and his righteous Cause and Followers,
I leave it to him who is the avenger of all such wrongs, who will
tread upon Princes as upon mortar, and be terrible to the Kings
of the Earth: And know this also, that though ye are seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

your Violence, and dealing with a despiteful hand, because of the

the other, I will say, Weep for your own sins, and for the sins of the Nation,
for the highest Rebellions that ever were committed against the great and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God; lament bitterly for those sins that have been the meritorious Cause of
the late terrible Judgment, that which I fear will cause God to break in upon
this Nation with an over-flowing deluge of Judgments, which are far more tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
and dreadful: As for sympathizing with me in drinking this bitter
Cup appointed for me, I return you most humble and hearty thanks, earnestly
desiring God to come unto you, and fill your Souls with all coelestial Comforts
and spiritual Consolations. Something I must say to purge and clear my self
from a false Accusation laid to my Charge; as that I was engaged with Coll.
<hi>Blood</hi> in rescuing Coll. <hi>Mason,</hi> near <hi>Boston,</hi> when he was sent down with a Guard
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93667:10"/>
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> to be Tryed for High Treason; and that I was the Man that
killed the Barber of that City; and that also I was with him when he stole the
Crown: Now as I am a dying Man, and upon the very brink' of a very stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Eternity, (the truth and reality whereof I firmly believe) without any
reservation or the least equivocation, I do declare in the Presence of the all-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, that impartial Judge, before whom in a very little time I must appear,
I never saw nor Conversed with Mr. <hi>Tho. Blood,</hi> from 1656. till after he stole
the Crown, which was in 71, or 72. nor was ever engaged with him in any of
his treasonable Plotts or Practices. 'Tis true, I being involved in great trouble
of another Nature, (of which I have given to the World a Narrative, and which
is notoriously known in the Countrey where I then lived, by some that were
Enemies to me for my Preaching) I was perswaded to apply my self to Mr.
<hi>Blood,</hi> to procure by his Intercession his late majesty's gracious Favour; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he brought me into his Royal Presence; while I was there, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
carried it with great Clemency, without expressing one word of that
which I am now charged with: Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> continued with his Majesty a little
longer than I did; then he told me that he had granted me a Pardon, which
I did thankfully accept of, knowing it would free me from all Penalties and
Troubles that I was obnoxious to, and were occasioned to me by my Non-conformity;
then engaging him to take out my Pardon, he told me that he
got it out with several others that had been engaged with him in several
treasonable Designs and Actions, at which I was troubled, supposing it
might be imputed to me thereby; yet God knows I have often since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
upon it with great regret and dissatisfaction: if Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> did inform
the late King to make himself the more considerable, and to bring as many of his
Party as he could to accept of their Pardons, that he might be rendered utterly
incapable of Plotting any further mischief against his Government, or any
other ways that I was engaged with him in any of his treasonable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts;
I now appeal to God as a dying Man concerning it, that he hath
done me an irreparable wrong. I also in the same manner do declare, that
I was never engaged with any Party in Plotting or Designing, or Contriving
any Treason or Rebellion against the late King; and particularly that I was
altogether unconcerned in, and unacquainted with that for which my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>
and others suffer'd, and as much a Stranger to any against the present King.
And whereas it is reported of me, that at <hi>Taunton</hi> I perswaded the late Duke
of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to assume the Title of King, I do once more solemnly declare,
that I saw not the said Duke, nor had any Converse with him 'till he came
to <hi>Shipton-Mallet,</hi> which was thirteen days after he Landed, and several days
after he had been at <hi>Taunton:</hi> And 'tis as false, that I rid too and fro in the
West to stir up and perswade Men to go into his Army, and rebell against his
present Majesty; for I was in the East Country when the Duke Landed, and
from thence I went directly to him, when he was at <hi>Shipton-Mallet,</hi> not one
Man accompanying me from thence. But hitherto as I lived, so now I dye
owning and professing the true Reformed Christian (commonly called the
<hi>Protestant)</hi> Religion, which is founded on the pure written Word of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and which I acknowledge likewise to be comprehended in the Articles
of the Doctrine of the Church; this Religion I have made a reasonable and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93667:10"/>
free Choice of, and have heartily embraced, not only as it protests against all
Pagan and Mahometan Religion, but against the Corruption of the Christian;
and I humbly and earnestly Pray to God that by his Infinite Wisdom and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power, he will prevent not only the utter extirpation but diminition
thereof, by the heighth and influence of what is contrary thereto; and for
that end the Lord make the Professors of it to live up more to its Principles and
Rules, and bring their Hearts and Conversations more under the Governme<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
and Power of the same. I dye also owning my Ministry, Non-conformity, for
which I have suffer'd so much, and which doth now obstruct the Kings Grace and Mercy to be manifested and extended to me: For as I chose it not constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
so I appeal to God as a dying Man, not moved from sullenness or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or factious temper, or erroneous Principles of Education, or from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Interests, or worldly advantages, but clearly from the Dictates of my
own Conscience, and as I judged it to be the Cause of God, and to have more
of Divine Truth in it than that which is contrary thereto; so now I see no
Cause to repent of it, nor to recede from it; not questioning but God will own
it at the last Judgment-day: If no more had been required after the late King's
Restauration to qualifie Ministers for publick Preaching, than was after the
first Restauration from the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the first, probably I might have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my self therewith, and not scrupled Conformity thereto; but the Terms
and Conditions thereof by a particular Law made in 1662. being not only new,
but so strict and severe that I could never have satisfaction in my own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
after all endeavours used for a Complyance therewith and a Conformity
thereto: to say nothing of the Covenant, which I never took, but the giving my
Assent and Consent, have been too difficult and hard for me to comply with:
And I very well remember that about fourteen years agoe, entring into a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with Mr. <hi>Patrick Heldore</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi>-man, who was Contemporary with me
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> concerning Conformity, which he much endeavour'd to perswade me
to, I urg'd the severity of the forementioned Conditions against it, and after
some Debates and Reasons with him, I told him I did believe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
and designed on purpose to prevent our publick Preaching, and to keep
us out of the Church: to which he ingenuously reply'd, he judged it was so;
For, said he, a Bishop in <hi>Ireland</hi> (whose Name I have forgot) told me the very
same. But though I could not wade through and conquer this Difficulty, yet
I censure not those that did it; and I believe after all the hottest Disputes, and
most vehement Debates, and violent Contests between Conformist and Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,
there are of both Parties will be glorified in Heaven hereafter. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>29th.</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a visible Church is a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is Preached, the
Sacraments of the Lord duly administred, according to Christ's Ordinance, and
all those things that of necessity are requisite and necessary to salvation; so with
such a Church I have held the most intimate Communion, and with such (did
I live) could hold it: I would not therefore be so Incorporated with any Church
as to exclude me from, and render me uncapable of holding Communion with
other Churches; I was never strongly bound up to any form of Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but that under which a pure and undefiled Religion doth flourish,
and that which contains and really practises Holiness, and advances the Kingdom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93667:11"/>
of God in the World, that can I approve of, and submit to, and willingly live
under, were I to live.</p>
               <p>I did approve of the ancient and present form of Civil Government, <hi>English</hi>
Monarchy; I am fully satisfied with, and do also declare, that it is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
for any Subject to take up Arms against, and resist their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
and rightful Princes: And therefore had I not been covinced by several
things that I have read and heard, to believe that the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was
the Legitimate Son of his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the second, I had never gone into his
Army, judging that without this I could not be freed from the guilt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which I always resolved to keep my self clear from: And tho his
Father denyed that he was marryed to his Mother, I thought it might be
answered with this: That Kings and Princes, for State-reasons, often cannot
be fathomed by their Subjects, affirming and denying things which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would not do, and make even their natural Affections to truckle
and stoop thereto. I exhort all, to abhorr all treasonable Plots, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all Rebellion, with the highest Detestation, and to take the plain Text
of sacred Scripture to walk by, in honouring and obeying, and living in
Subjection to rightful Kings, and not readily to Receive, or suddenly to be
Impress'd with evil Reports and Defamations of them, also not Rashly to be
propagators of the same.</p>
               <p>I desire God to forgive all mine Enemies, and to give me an heart to forgive
them, which are many, some mighty, and all most malicious: Particularly <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Lisnel,</hi> who betrayed me, and proved such a Traytor to <hi>James</hi> D. of <hi>M.</hi>
his old and intimate Friend. I am grievously afflicted that I should prove the
occasion of the great sufferings of so many Persons and Families: But this hath
fallen under the Just and wise ordering of Divine Providence, as <hi>Davids</hi> going
to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> when he proved the occasion of the Death of all the Persons, Men,
Women, and Children, in the City: But who shall say unto God, <hi>What dost thou?</hi>
The care of my most dear Wife and a great many Children, I cast upon God,
who I hope will be better than the best of Husbands unto her, and the best of
Fathers unto them: God knows how Just and Legal Right my Wife hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Estate; to him therefore I commit her, to defend her from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and oppression of men; particularly from a most inhumane and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Brother: But no wonder if he will lay violent hands upon his Sisters
Estate, that hath so often laid them on his own Father. I dye a deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
self-judging and self-condemning Sinner, loathing and abhorring my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great Iniquities, and my self for them, earnestly desiring full Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the bonds of Corruption, under which I have groaned so many years,
longing for a most perfect Conformity to the most glorious and holy God, the
only Infinite pure Being; thirsting for a perfect Diffusion of his Grace through
all the Powers and Faculties of my Soul, panting after perfect Spiritual Life
and Liberty, and a Consummate Love to my dearest Jesus, who is an All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Good, and to be satisfied with his Love for ever: A vigorous and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Zeal for the Protestant Religion, with a Belief I had of the <hi>Dukes</hi> Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
hath involved me into this ignominious Death; yet blessed be God, that by
sincere Repentance and true Faith in the Blood of Jesus, there is a passage from it
to a glorious Eternal Life, and from these bitter sorrows to the fulness of sweetest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93667:11"/>
Joyes that are in his Presence, and from these sharp bodily pains to those more
pure Pleasures that are at his Right hand for evermore; and blessed be God, that
such a Death as this cannot prevent and hinder Christ's changing of my vile Body,
and fashioning it like unto his Glorious Body, in the general Resurrection-day. I
am now going into that World, where many dark things shall be made perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifest and clear, and many doubtful things fully Resolved, and a plenary
Satisfaction given concerning them; all Disputes and Mistakes concerning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Rebellion and Schism, shall be at an end and cease for ever: many things that
are Innocent, Lawful and Laudable, which have foul Marks and black Characters
stampt and fixt upon them here, they shal be perfectly purified and fully cleansed from
there; where at one view, more shall be known of them, than by all wrangling
Debates and eager Disputes, or by Reading all Polemick Books concerning them
here. I greatly deplore and bewail the greedy Appetite and insatiable thirst,
that Professing Protestants have after the Blood of their Brethren, and the
high pleasure they take in the Effusion thereof. But what will not Men do,
when they are either Judicially blinded, or their secular worldly Interest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
insinuates and winds it self into their Religion? Is so twisted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with it, that it animates and acts it, is the Life and Soul, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Form and Power, and made wholly subservient thereunto.</p>
               <p>I bless God for all my Sufferings, and particularly for this last, for the benefit
and fruit of it, by Gods sanctifying of them to me, have been great; hereby
I have been effectually convinced of the Vanity of the World, and my own
sinfulness by Nature and practice, and to see that to be sin which I never saw
before; and to be more throughly humbled for what I know to be sin, not
only of Commission, but of Omission also: Hereby I have been brought to a
more thorough, deep inward sence and feeling of the absolute necessity of the
Righteousness of Christ to justifie me, and he hath been made much more dear
and precious to my Soul, than ever he was before. Hereby my Soul hath
been more Refin'd from the Dross of Sensuality, wrought into a more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Frame, raised up to a higher pitch of Spirituality; hereby I am made more
Meek and Humble, and so Judge more charitably of others that differ from
me in Opinion and Judgment: so though by God's most Righteous Judgment
I have been apprehended, and most Justly and deservedly undergo this Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for my Sins, yet I hope they have wrought for me a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and eternal weight of Glory, fitting and preparing me, making me a
better qualified Subject for, and far more meet to be a Partaker of the same.
By the Grace and Strength of God, I will not purchase my Life by the Death
and Blood of my Protestant Brethren, but chuse to dye rather than be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer
of them; the Impetuous and violent assault of this, I dreaded more
than Death it self. Blessed be God I was not exposed unto it, and conquered
by it, as some have been: having such full bodily vigour and strength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such perfect Health, notwithstanding my Age, predominating in me, it
hath made it more difficult to dye, than if I had been Clogged and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with Infirmities, made to bow and stoop under them by prevailing Diseases
and Distempers, gradually worn out therewith, which many times makes Men
weary of Life, and to desire to dye; and this in Conjunction with many things,
(which I forbear to mention) highly gratifying and pleasing to sense, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93667:12"/>
I must leave for ever, strengthens and heightens the Difficulty, and begets a
greater Regret and Reluctancy in my Will, to have the Earthly Tabernacle of my
Body dissolved, and my Soul to dislodge and quit the same. But now when the
black and gloomy Shades of Death do overspread me, I can say to the
Glory of God's most Free and Powerful Grace, True Faith in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
hath changed the difficulty into a Facility and easiness of Dying: It
hath very much subdued the Reluctancy of my Will against it; for it makes
Future things present, and Invisible things visible, and doth Realize and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate
the same to me; and as by it I penetrate and pierce into Eternity,
and behold Invisible and Immortal things, so hereby, blessed be God, I have
obtained a greater Victory over Sense: The World is crucified to me, and
I to the World, and all the most pleasant delightful Objects therein, all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
fading Creatures, Comforts and Injoyments, are become minute and small,
Despicable and Contemptible to me, in comparison thereof, being infinitely
Contained and Comprehended therein: Shall my Soul clasp and cling about
these Mortal and Perishing things? Shall it cleave and be glued to them? Shall
it be confin'd and captivated into what is kept in the narrow bounds of Time,
and in this lower World? Shall it earnestly desire and thirst for muddy Streams,
yea Rivers of Flesh-pleasing Good; when by an Eye of Faith I can look into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient,
Inexhaustible purest Fountain; the Immense, Imensurate Ocean of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Good; hoping to Drink thereof, to Swim and Bathe my Soul therein for ever
and ever? And when I consider how long my Ears have been bound up, and tyed
to their innumerable and horrid Oaths, and Cursed Blasphemies, and my Eyes
to see the prophanation of the day of God; and when I behold such an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Flood of most prodigious Impiety, such an Inundation of most monstrous
Iniquity, and so much Hell upon Earth, and that there is so much decay of holy
Zeal, and true Piety, and Christian Religion among the Professors of it, such
seeming incurable Breaches and Divisions, such expiring Love and Charity and
partings among them; it hath powerful influence on my Soul to reconcile it
more to Death, and makes it electively, and from choice to leave this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, and to take up my abode in that which is Unseen and Future,
were there shall be nothing but perfect Love and Holiness; a sinless state,
and serving God with all unweariedness, and perfection, with the highest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and delight that immortal Souls can be capable of: there is perfect
Peace and Concord, the innumerable company of Angels, and the Spirits of
Just men made perfect, all fastned together with indissolvable and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Chains of most pure Love, and all continually wrapt up in, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with the highest Admiration of Gods Love, his infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
excellencies and perfections, singing Hallelujahs to him without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and triumphing in his praise for ever and ever. The Consideration also,
that I know so little of these sublime profound and divine misteries; of the
most glorious mystery of Salvation by Jesus Christ; that I am so uncapable
to fathom the depth of the Providences of God, whose ways are in the Sea,
and whose paths are in the deep waters, and whose footsteps are not known,
and particularly in the late stupendious and amazing one; and that I am so
ignorant of the Nature of Angels and Spirits, with their Offices and Operations,
and of their high and glorious excellencies; and that I am so little acquainted with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93667:12"/>
the Nature of my own Soul, as at present dwelling in, and united to my Body,
and as disunited and separated from it; how without corporeal Organs, it shall
most vivaciously, and vigorously perform all its proper Functions and Offices, and
more than ever strongly and indefatigably serve the Lord Jesus, most fervently
and abundantly love him, and delight in him, every way much more obtain the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and highest end of its Creation and being; and this makes me much more
willing to dye, that I may have the knowledg hereof, with innumerable other
things, that I am now either ignorant of, or do but imperfectly know, and so be
made happy by a plenitude of fulness of enjoying intellectual Pleasures, which are
of all other most suitable, sweet and satisfactory to immortal Souls: And also I see
that he that departs from Iniquity makes himself a prey, and so many plunging
themselves into the ways of Iniquity, lest they should accounted odious and vile,
which makes them so much degenerate not only from Christianity, but from
Humanity it self, as if they were scarce the excrement of either; contemning even
that most Noble, Generous Heroick Spirit that dwelt in many Heathens, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it most honourable and glorious to contend for their Rights and Liberties,
yea to suffer Death and the worst of Deaths in Defence of the same; and judge
them accursed and most execrable in the World that do so; and not only so, but
for their own profit and advantage have many of them inslaved their posterity
by it, and are most industrious and laborious, most fierce and furious to destroy
them, whereby they are become as unnatural as Children that seek the ruine
of their Parents that begot them and brought them forth, or them that lay violent
hands upon themselves, dashing out their own Brains, cutting their own Throats,
hanging and drawing themselves, ripping up their own Bellies, tearing out their
own Bowels, they being in diffirent sences Children and Members of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
politick they design and attempt the Destruction of; and when I know not
how long the Duration and Continuance of these things shall be, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
or End by God shall be put thereto, who by Divine and Unerring
Wisdom governs the World; why shall my Soul be unwilling to take it's
flight into the unseen and eternal World? where no sullied, sordid or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing, most incongruous and unbecoming Nature, shall be seen and found,
and where I shall behold no narrow conclusive contracted Soul there, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
preferring their private before a publick good, but all most unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
and equally center in one common universal good; and where the
sighs, and groans and cryes of the afflicted and persecuted, shall be heard no
more for ever.</p>
               <p>I earnestly exhort all, most highly to prize and value Time, and diligently
improve it for Eternity; to be wise, seriously and seasonably to consider of
their latter End; for by the Irrepealable and Irreversable Law of Heaven we
must all dye, yet we know not <hi>how, where</hi> or <hi>when:</hi> live with your Souls
full of solicitude and care, with a most deep concernedness, and most diligent
Industriousness, whilst you have time, and opportunity, and the means of
Grace, Health and Strength, make sure of these two great things, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. What Merits for you a Right and Title to Eternal Life and Glory, and
the future unchangeable Blessedness, as the Redeemers most precious Blood
and Righteousness; that thereby a real Application and Imputation may be
unto you by sincere believing. (2.) That that which makes you qualified
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93667:13"/>
Subjects for it, is the great work of Regeneration, wrought in your Souls,
being renewed in the Spirit of your Minds, the Divine Nature being imprest
upon them, repairing of the depraved Image of God in you; that being
transformed into his own likeness, thereby in the World you may mind and
savour more the things of the Spirit than the things of the Flesh, Celestial
and Heavenly more than Terrestial and Earthly, Superiour more than Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
things: And therewith have a Holy Life and Conversation conjoyned, that
results and springs from the same as Fruit from the Root, and Acts from the
Habits. Let all in order thereto, seriously consider these few Texts of sacred
Scripture, let them predominantly possess you, let them be deeply and Indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Transcribed upon your Souls, let them be assimulated thereunto, and
made the written Epistles, the lively Pictures thereof. <hi>Mat. 5. 8, 20. Blessed
be the pure in Heart, for they shall see God.</hi> v. 20. <hi>For I say unto you, except your
Righoeousness exceed the Righteousness of Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> John 3. 3. <hi>Jesus answered and said unto him,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 5. 19, 20, <hi>to</hi> 23. <hi>Now the works of the Flesh
are manifest, which are these, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. Jam. 1. 18. <hi>Of his own Will hegat he
us with the Word of Truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope by the
Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> Vers. 13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your Minds,</hi>
&amp;c. Colos. 3. 1, 2. <hi>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things that are above,
set your affections on things above, not,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 5. 24. <hi>And they that are Christs
have Crucified the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 2. 1. <hi>And you hath
he quickned, who were dead in trespasses and sins.</hi> Rev. 20. 6. <hi>Blessed and Holy
is he that hath part in the first Resurrection, on such the second Death hath no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>But as
he that hath called you is holy, so be ye,</hi> &amp;c. V. 23. <hi>Being born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Seed,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 4. 3. <hi>But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is
Godly for himself,</hi> &amp;c. I shall mention now no more, the whole Bible abounds
with these Texts, with what a Renovation, and change of our carnal and
corrupt Hearts and Natures, there must be, with Holiness of Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
before we can be capable of a future and blessed Immortality,
and of inheriting the Kingdom of God for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>I</hi> Am come to pay a Debt to Nature; 'tis a Debt that all must
Pay, though some after one manner, and some after another:
The way that I pay it, may be thought by some few Ignominious,
but not so by me; having long since, as a True <hi>Englishman,</hi>
thought it my Duty to venture my Life in Defence of the <hi>Protestant
Religion</hi> against Popery and Arbitrary Power: For this same
Purpose, I came from my House to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth's</hi> Army:
At first I was a Lieutenant, and then a Captain; and I was in
all the Action the Foot was Engaged in, which I do not Repent:
For had I a Thousand Lives, they should all have been Engaged in
the same Cause, although it has pleased the Wise God (for Reasons
best known to himself) to blast our Designs; but he will deliver his
People by ways we know nor think not of: I might have saved my Life,
if I would have done as some Narrow-Soul'd Persons have done, by
Impeaching others; but I abhor such ways of Deliverance, choosing
rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy Life
with Sin. As to my Religion, I own the Way and Practice of the
<hi>Independent Church,</hi> and in that Faith I die, Depending on the
Merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ, for my Eternal Salvation:

               <p>THE News which came in my Brothers Letter, of the <hi>22d.</hi>
instant, to Mr. <hi>Duewy,</hi> did not at all surprize me, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I expected no other; and seeing all hopes of saving my
Life are blasted, I thought my self bound to write a Line or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93667:14"/>
two to so near a Relation as your self, wherein I may take
my Leave of you: I bid you farewel till we shall meet again in
Glory, and never be separated more. As for my own part,
though such a sort of Death as I am like to suffer, be that which
I always dreaded at a Distance, when I have sometimes thought
on it; yet I thank my God, now it draws very near, even but
a few hours off, I find my self supported under the thoughts
of it, and I hope by his Strength who will never forsake his
own, I shall be enabled to undergo it with Glory to his Name,
and my Comfort, and to my own and other Souls good, that
are more nearly concerned for me: And as I have made it my
own endeavour to submit to the Will of God, in this sad Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
without murmuring and repining. I hope you have been
sensible of your Duty in the same Respects, which is patiently
to submit to his Will, and eye his Hand in this severe Stroke.
Though God hath been pleased to deny success to your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for the saving of my Life, yet I am satisfied nothing
hath been wanting on your parts; and for all the Trouble you
have been at on my Account, though I do not live to shew my
Gratitude, yet I render you my dying Thanks, and beg your
Prayers for my support in the last moment of my Life, if
you receive this before my Death, the certainty of which I
have not yet notice of. Remember my Love to my Brother, and
Thanks for all kindnesses. And as for my young Relations, my
Prayer for them shall be, <hi>That they may see more happy Days
than I have done, and Die more peaceably;</hi> I cannot say, <hi>A more
happy Death:</hi> And now my Dear Sister, I take my leave of
you, and I commit you to the Protection of that God, who
hath made every thing Beautiful in its time, and will shew you
the meaning of this sad Providence, which now we do not
understand, to whom I trust I am now going, and in the
Enjoyment of whose Presence, I doubt not but e'er long, you
will meet your Affectionate Brother,</p>

               <p>I Have ev'n now received News of my Execution to morrow,
which though I have such short Notice of, yet I am prepared
for it, and by Gods strength enabling of me, I shall be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
carried through it. The Kindness you have been pleased
to shew in your great Concern for me, since I have been under
this trouble, as well as the Duty I owe to so near a Relation
as your self, ingages me to acquaint you with my present
Condition, for your Satisfaction; which truly is such, as I must
beg you to accept this present Letter as my last farewell; and
though the sad Providence cannot but be grievous to so near and
Affectionate a Relation, yet I hope it already hath, and still doth
yield the peaceable Fruits of Righteousness to your self and me,
who had been severely exercised with it: As for my own part,
I hope I can truly say, that God by his Providence hath wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to be dissolved, that I might be with Christ, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

nothing to do but to die; I having <hi>fought a good Fight, and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Course,</hi> I am now in expectation of that <hi>Crown of Reward</hi>
which God, the Righteous Judge of the whole Earth, hath
promised to all those that love his appearance: And as it is
my great Work to be now every moment fitting my self for
my great and last Change, so it is the Duty that belongs to you,
and the rest of my Dear Relations, to resign me up into the
Hands of that God, whose I am, and to whom I am going:
and not to repine at his Righteous Will, which we ought quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to submit unto. But now being at last leaving the World,
Dear and Honoured Mother, I take my leave of you also, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Thanks for all the Trouble and Care you have been at for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my Life, which God hath not thought fit to make success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;

               <p>THough you be at a great Distance from me, yet you are
very near my Heart, so that to leave the World, before
I have writ a Line or two to you, to bid you farewel, and to
comfort you under this sad Providence, would be uncomfortable
to me: I hope you have by this time learned, how to welcome
Evil as well as good Tydings, and submit to the wise Disposer
of all things, who knows what's best for us, better than we do
our selves; though I question not, but the News of my Death,
especially in such a violent manner, as within a few hours I am
to suffer, will be afflictive to you; yet I would beg of you to
consider the Happiness I am going to, and that I am but a few
Years sooner taken out of a troublesome wicked World, unto
the Quire of Triumphant Martyrs in Glory; which place of
Happiness, though I have not deserved by any Merit of my own,
yet for the Merits of my Mediator and Redeemer, who hath
purchased more for me, than can enter into my Heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

               <head>An Account of the Behaviour of Mr. William and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
Hewling, before and at their Execution; with
several Letters to divers of their Relations.</head>
               <p>THe Gracious Dealings of God manifested to some in their
dying hours, have been of great Use to those living that
heard the same, giving them occasion thereby to reflect on their
own Estate, and to look for the things of their Peace before they
are hid from their Eyes: As also a great encouragement to
strengthen the Faith of those that have experienced the Grace of
God to them at the End; it's thought necessary by Parents, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to preserve to their Children what remains of those Blessed
Experiences that such have had, that God hath taken to himself;
you have here a true Account presented of the Admirable Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of God towards two young Men, Mr. <hi>Benjamin Hewling,</hi>
who dyed when he was about 22 years of Age: And of Mr. <hi>William
Hewling,</hi> who dyed before he Arrived to 20 years, which for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
best known to themselves, engaged with the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi>
for which Mr. <hi>William Hewling</hi> was Executed at <hi>Lyme,
September 12;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Benjamin Hewling</hi> at <hi>Taunton, September</hi>
30. 1685.</p>
               <p>However severe Men were to them, yet the Blessed Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God towards them was such, as hath made good his Word,
<hi>That out of the Mouth of Babes, he hath ordained strength, that he
may still the Enemy and Avenger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Dispersing of the Duke's Army, they fled and got off
to Sea, but were driven back again, and with the hazard of their
lives, got on Shore over dangerous Rocks, where they saw the
Country fill'd with Soldiers; and they being unwilling to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the Rabble, and no way of defence or escape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
with them, they surrendered themselves Prisoners to a
Gentleman, whose House was near the place they Landed at; and
were from thence sent to <hi>Exeter</hi> Goal, <hi>July</hi> the 21; where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
some time; their behaviour was such, that being Visited
by many, caused great Respect towards them, even of those who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93667:16"/>
were Enemies to the Cause they engaged in: And being on
the 15th of <hi>July</hi> put on Board the <hi>Swan</hi> Frigot, in order to their
being brought up to <hi>London,</hi> their Carriage was such as caused
the Commander and the rest of the Officers in the Ship to shew
great kindness to them; and being brought into the River, Captain
<hi>R.</hi> by Order, came down to take them into his Custody, and
carried them to <hi>Newgate,</hi> putting great Irons upon them, and
put them into rooms apart, without giving Liberty for any near
Relation to see them, though in the presence of a Keeper, which
did greatly increase the Grief and Sorrow of their Relations. But
although men were cruel and severe to them, God, who wisely
orders all things for good to all those whom he intends Grace and
Mercy upon, made this very Restraint and hard Usage, a Blessed
Advantage to their Souls, as appears by their own Words; when
after great Importunity and Charge, some of their near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had an opportunity to speak a few words to them before the
Keeper; to which they replyed, <hi>That they were content with the
Will of God whatsoever it should be.</hi> Having been in <hi>Newgate</hi> three
Weeks, there was orders given to carry them down into the
<hi>West</hi> in order to their Tryals; which being told them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
answered they were glad of it; and the morning they went out
of <hi>Newgate,</hi> several that beheld them so Chearful, said, <hi>Surely
those Yonng Men have their Pardons in their Pockets, or else they
could never carry it with that Chearfulness as they do.</hi> This must
be observed, that from first to last, whatever hopes they received
from their friends of their Pardon, they still thought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
never being much affected with the hopes of it, nor cast
down at the worst that might attend them in their Journey to
<hi>Dorcester.</hi> The Keepers that went with them, have given this
Account of them, <hi>That their Carriage was so Grave and Serious,
that made them admire to see and hear what they did from such young
men.</hi> The first opportunity their Sister had to speak with them,
was at <hi>Salisbury, August</hi> the 30th, who gives the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them:</p>
               <p>I found them in an excellent Composure of Mind, declaring
their Experience of the Grace and Kindness of God to them in all
their Sufferings, in supporting, strengthning, and providing for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93667:16"/>
them; turning the Hearts of all them whose Hands they had
been in, both at <hi>Exon,</hi> and on Ship-board, to shew pity and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to them, although since they came to <hi>Newgate</hi> they were
hardly used; and how in their Journey loaden with heavy Irons,
and more Inhumanely dealt with; they with great Chearfulness
profest they were better, yea, and in a more happy Condition
then ever in their lives, from the sence they had of the Pardoning
Love of God in Jesus Christ to their Souls, with only referring
themselves to the Wise and Gracious God, to chose for them
Life or Death; expressing themselves thus, <hi>Any thing what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
God, what He sees best, so be it, we know He is able to deliver;
if not, Blessed be His Name, Death is not terrible, but desirable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> in particularly added, <hi>As for the World,
there's nothing in it to make it worth while to live, except we may be
Serviceable to God therein;</hi> And after said, <hi>GOD is a strong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
I have found him so indeed.</hi> The next opportunity was at
<hi>Dorcester,</hi> where they were both carried and put in Prison, and
by reason of their strait Confinement, our Converse was much
interrupted; but this I found from them, that they had still the
same presence and support from God as formerly, no ways being
discouraged at the near approach of their Tryal, nor of the issue
of it, though it might appear to Flesh and Blood to be terrible.
The 6th of <hi>September</hi> my Brother <hi>Benjamin</hi> was ordered at <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
to be Tryed; then taking my leave of him, he chearfully
said, <hi>Blessed be God, for Afflictions I have found such happy Effects
of them, that I would not have been without them for all this World:</hi>
I remaining still at <hi>Dorcester,</hi> to see the issue of my Brother <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;</hi>
to whom, after he was Tryed, before his Sentence, I had
free Liberty to go to; whose Mouth was filled with Admiration
of the Grace of God in Christ Jesus, that had been manifested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, in calling him out of his natural Estate, suddenly seizing
on his Heart when he thought not of it; in his Abode in <hi>Holland,</hi>
finding secret Whisperings in his Heart to seek the Face of God
who enabled him to answer his Gracious Call, and to reflect upon
his own Soul; whereby he came to see the Evil of Sin, and his
need of Christ; from that time carrying him on to a sensible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to Christ, for Pardon and Peace of Soul; where he said,
<hi>He found a Spring of Joy and Sweetness, beyond all the Comfort of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93667:17"/>
whole Earth.</hi> He further said, <hi>He could not but admire the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
goodness of God, in preparing him for what he was bringing him
unto, which then he thought not of, giving hope of Eternal Life before
he call'd him to look Death in the Face;</hi> So that he did Chearfully
resign his Life to God, before he came, having sought his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in it; and that the Cause did appear to him both then and
now very Glorious; notwithstanding all that which he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
in it, or further might, although God had with-held those
good things from us. As to himself, he said, <hi>God had carried on
his Work in his Soul, in and by all sufferings; and whatever the will
of God were, Life or Death, he knew it would be best for him.</hi> After
he had received his Sentence, when he return'd to Prison, he said,
<hi>Methinks I find my Comfort in God increase since my Sentence:</hi> there
is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, it is God
that Justifieth, who shall condemn? When I came to him the
next morning, when he had received News of the time of his
Execution, and in order to it, was to be carried to <hi>Lyme;</hi> that day
I found him in a most excellent Spiritual Frame, more then ever
before he was in; he said, <hi>He was satisfied God had done best for
him, he knew what the Temptation of Life might be; I might have
lived and forgotten God, but now I am going where I shall Sin no more;
O it it is a Blessed thing to be free from Sin, and to be with Christ!
O how great were the Sufferings of Christ for us, beyond all that I can
undergo! How great is that Glory to which I am going! It will now
swallow up Sorrow here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he was at Dinner, just before his going from <hi>Dorcester</hi> to
<hi>Lyme,</hi> he dropt many Expressions of his inward Joy, such as
these, <hi>O the Grace of God, the Love of Christ! O the Blessed Supper
of the Lamb, to be for ever with the Lord!</hi> He further said, <hi>When he
went to</hi> Holland, <hi>You knew not what Snares, Sins, and Miscarriages
I might have fallen into, or whether we might ever meet again:</hi> Now
you know whether I am going, and that we shall certainly have a
most joyful meeting, and never part more for ever: He said, <hi>Pray
give my Recommendations to all Relations, with Acknowledgments for
all their Kindness; I advise them all to make sure of an Interest in
Christ, for he is the only Comfort when we come to dye.</hi> One of the
Prisoners seemed to be troubled at the manner of Death they
were to dye; to whom he replyed, <hi>I bless God, I am Reconciled
unto it all.</hi> Just at his going, he writ these few Lines to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being hardly suffered to stay so long.

of People beheld them with great Lamentation and bitter
Cryes, admiring at his Carriage and Behaviour at his parting
with his Sister. As they passed along the Road betwixt <hi>Lyme</hi> and
<hi>Dorcester,</hi> his Discourse was exceeding Heavenly and Spiritual, as
those present have since declared, taking occasion from every

the Country as they passed along, he said, <hi>This is a Glorious Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
but what then is the Paradice of God, to which we are going?</hi>
When he was come to <hi>Lyme,</hi> one reading the 14. of <hi>John</hi> and the
18 <hi>Verse. I will not leave you Comfortless, I will come to you:</hi>
said <hi>Christ will come unto us, he will be with us to the very last:</hi> At
<hi>Lyme,</hi> that morning he was Executed, one taking Leave of him,
he said, <hi>Fare-well till we meet in Heaven; presently I shall be with
Christ; I would not change Conditions with any; I would not stay
behind for Ten Thousand Worlds.</hi> To another that ask'd him how
he did, he said, <hi>Very well, I Bless God;</hi> and farther ask'd him if
he could look Death in the Face with Comfort, now it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so near; He answered, <hi>I can, I bless God, with Comfort; God
hath made this a good Night to me, my Comforts are much increased
since I left</hi> Dorcester. Then taking leave of him, said, <hi>Farewell,
I shall see you no more:</hi> To which he repiyed, <hi>How, see me no more?
Yes, I hope to meet you in Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To another which was by him to the last, he said, <hi>Pray Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
my Love to my Dear Brother and Sister, and tell them I
would desire them to Comfort themselves, that I am gone to Christ, and
we shall quickly meet in the Glorious Mount</hi> Zion <hi>above.</hi> Afterwards
he Prayed for about three quarters of an hour with the greatest
Fervency, exceedingly blessing God for Christ Jesus, Adoring the
Riches of his Grace, in all the Glorious Fruits of it towards him;
Praying for the Peace of the Church of God, and for this Nation
in particular, with such Eminent Assistance of the Spirit of God,
that it Astonished, Convinct, and Melted the most Malitious
Adversaries, forcing Tears and Expressions of Sorrow from them;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93667:18"/>
some saying, <hi>They knew not what would become of them after Death;</hi>
but it was evident he was going to great Happiness: When he
was just going out of the World, with a Joyful Countenance he
said, <hi>O now my Joy and Comfort is, I have a Christ to go to; and so
sweetly Resigned his Spirit to Christ,</hi> September the 12th. 1685.</p>
               <p>An Officer who had shewed so Malicious a Spirit, as to call the
Prisoners Devils, when he was Guarding them down, was now so
concerned, that he after told a Person of Quality, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Affected, as by his Chearful Carriage and Fervent Prayer,
such as he believed never was heard, especially from one so young;
and said he believed that had the Lord Chief Justice been there to

               <p>The Sheriff having given his Body to be Buried, although it
was brought from the place of Execution without the knowledge
of his Friends, yet very many of the Town came to his Funeral,

die with so much Comfort and Joy, and afterwards of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the goodness of God, in increasing unto the end; He
Exprest himself to this effect,</hi> We have no cause to fear Death, if
the Presence of God be with us; there is no Evil in it, the sting of
it is taken away; it is nothing but our Ignorance of the Glory that the
Saints pass into by Death, which makes it appear Dark to our selves
or Relations; if belonging to Christ, what is this World, that we should
desire any Abode in it? It is all Vanity and Vnsatisfying, full of Sin
and Misery. <hi>Intimating also his own Cheerful expectation now
to follow, discovering then, and all along, great seriousness and
sense of Spiritual things; complaining of nothing in his present
Circumstances, but the want of a place of Retirement, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
more Uninterruptedly with God and his own Soul; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
That his little time in Newgate, was the sweetest in his whole
Life: <hi>He said,</hi> God having before struck his Heart, when he thought
of the hazard of his Life, and the great Consequence of Death and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
shewing that they were the only happy Persons that had secur'd
their Eternal Estate; and the folly and madness of the ways of Sin,
and his own Thraldome therein, with his utter Inability to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
also the necessity of Christ to Salvation: <hi>He said,</hi> It was not
without sorrow and amazement; for some time the thoughts of Vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
Sin, with Eternity before him was a great surprize; but God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
open'd to him the Riches of his free Grace in Christ Jesus, for poor
Sinners to fly unto, enabling him alone to look unto a Crucified Christ for
Salvation. <hi>He said,</hi> That this Blessed Work was in some measure carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on upon his Soul under his business and hurry in the Army, but never
sprung forth so fully and sweetly, till his close Confinement in <hi>Newgate;</hi>
then he saw an All-spiritual Object more clearly, and imbraced it
more strongly; there he experienced the Blessedness of a Reconciled
Estate, the Excellency of the ways of Holiness, of Communion with
God, which remained very deep and apparent impressions on his Soul;
which he frequently exprest with Admiration of the Grace of God to
him: <hi>He said,</hi> Perhaps my Friends may think this some of the sadest
time of my Life, but I bless God it hath been the sweetest and most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of all; nay, there is nothing else worth the name of happiness: I
have formerly, but in vain, sought happiness in the things of this World,
but I never found it; but now I have found Rest for my Soul in God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93667:19"/>
alone: O how great is our blindness by nature, that we can't see an
Excellency in spiritual things; we spend our pretious time in pursuing
of shadows, and are deaf to the Invitations of Grace, and the Glorious
Offers of Christ in the Gospel? How just is God in depriving us of
that we have so much slighted and abused? O his infinite Patience and
Goodness, that after all, he should yet take any method to bring a
poor Sinner to himself! O Electing Love! Distinguishing Grace!
What cause have I to Admire and Adore it? <hi>He said,</hi> What an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Consideration is the Sufferings of Christ for Sin, to bring us to
God? His sufferings were exceeding great; but alas, what was that
to the dolours of his Soul under the infinite VVrath of God? The great
mystery of Grace and Love is enough to swallow up our thoughts to
Eternity. <hi>As to his own Death, he would often say,</hi> He saw no
reason to expect any other; I know God is infinitely able to deliver,
and I am sure will do it, if it be for his Glory and my Good; for which
I bless God I am fully satisfied; it is all my desire he would choose for
me; that I am sure will be best whatever it be, for truly; except God
hath some work for me to do in this World, for his Service and Glory,
I see nothing else to make Life desirable in this present state of things;
there is nothing to cast our Eye upon, but Sin, Sorrow and Misery;
and truly were things never so much according to our desire, it is but
the World still, which will never be a Resting-place; Heaven is the
only state of Rest and Happiness, where we shall be perfectly free from
Sin and Temptation, and enjoy God without Interruption, for ever.
<hi>Speaking of the disappointment of their Expectation of the work
they had undertaken, he said, with Reference to the Glory of
God, and Prosperity of the Gospel, and Deliverance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> We have great reason to lament; but for the outward
Prosperity, that would accompany it, it is but of small moment in it
self; as it would never satisfie, so neither could it be abiding, for at
longest, Death would put an end to it. <hi>Also adding; Nay perhaps
we might have been so foolish as to have been taken with that
part, in the neglect our Eternal Concerns, then I am sure our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Circumstances are incomparably better for us. He frequently
Exprest grrat concern for the Glory of God, and affection to his
People; saving,</hi> If my Death may be for the Glory of God, and
hasten the D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liverance of his People, it will be enough; and that it
was great Comfort to him to think of so great a Priviledge, as to have
an Interest in all their Prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93667:19"/>
In his particular Converse, he greatly delighted in, and valued those Persons
where he saw most shining Holiness; he also shewed great pity to the Souls
of others, saying, <hi>That the Remembrance of our Vanity may well cause Compassion
to others in that Estate; and in his Conversation, promoting others to a Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
telling them that Death and Eternity are such weighty concerns, that
they deserved the greatest intentions of our Mind; for the way to receive
Death Cheerfully, is to prepare for it seriously; and if God should please to save
our Lives, we have the same reason to be serious, and to spend our remaining
days in his Fear and Service.</hi> He also took great care that the Worship of
God, which they were in capacity of performing, as Reading Prayer, and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Psalms, might be duly performed; in which he took great delight for those
three or four days before his Death. When there was a general Report no
more should dye, he said, <hi>I do not know what God hath done beyond our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if he do prolong my Life, it is all his own; and by his Grace I will
wholly devote it to him:</hi> But the 29th of <hi>September,</hi> about Ten or Eleven at
Night, we found the deceitfulness of that Report; for they were then told,
they must dye the next Morning; which though unexpected, as to the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness
of it, yet he often therein Bless<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d God for his Power, Grace and Faith,
in giving suitable support by his Blessed Presence, which appeared in him upon
my coming to him; at that time finding him greatly composed he said, <hi>Though
Man hath a design to surprize, yet God doth and will fulfill his Word to be a
present help in time of trouble:</hi> Next Morning when I saw him again, his
Cheerfulness and Comfort was much increased, waiting for the Sheriff with the
greatest sweetness and serenity of mind, saying, <hi>Now the wil of God is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
to whom we have referred it; and he hath most certainly chosen that
which is Best.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards with a smiling Countenance, Discoursing of the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
there in the 3. 4, 5. Verse of the 22 of the</hi> Revelations. And there shall be
no more Curse; but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his
Servants shall serve him. And they shall see his Face; and his Name shall be in
their Forehead. And there shall be no Night there, they need no Candle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Light of the Sun; for the Lord God giveth them Light, and they still
Raign for ever and ever. <hi>Then he said,</hi> What a happy state is this, shall we
be loth to enjoy this? <hi>Then he desired the Second Book of the</hi> Corinthians,
5 <hi>Chapter and 1 Verse to be read to him,</hi> For we know, that if our Earthly
House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God; an House
not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens. <hi>All along his Comforts still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
expressing his hope and full assurance in this Glorious Inheritance; and
being now going to the Possession of it: Seeing the happiness of this Blessed
Change, he said,</hi> Death is more desirable then Life; and as to the manner of
this Death, when I have considered others under these Circumstances, I ha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
thought it very dreadful; but now God hath call'd me to it, I have quite other
Apprehensions of it: I can now chearfully Embrace it as an easie Passage into
Glory; and though <hi>Death</hi> separates us from enjoying each other; it will be but
for a short time, and then we shall meet in such Enjoyment as now we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and for ever rejoyce in that Happiness: O! How great a thing is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93667:20"/>
                  <hi>Redemption from Wrath to come, to an Eternity of Happiness!</hi> Then Reading
of the Scriptures and musing with himself, he imitated the great Comfort that
God c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nveighed to his Soul in it; saying, <hi>What an invalidate Treasure is this
Blessed Word of God in all Conditions? Here is store of strong Consolation.</hi> One
desiring his Bible, he said, <hi>Nay, This shall be my Companion to the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Praying, Reading, and Conversing together, waiting for the Sheriffs
coming, who when he came, void of all Pity or Civility, hurried them away,
scarce suffering them to take leave of their Friends; but notwithstanding this
and the doleful Mourning of those about them, the Joyfulness of his Countenance
was increas'd, that as he left the Prison, thus he appeared in the Sledge, when
they sat about half an Hour before the Officers could force the Horses to draw, at
which they were greatly Enraged, there being no visible Obstruction from Weight
or Way, but at last they Haled them forward; the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Sheriff Balaam</hi>-like,
driving the Horses, when they came to the Place of Execution, was surrounded
with Spectators: Many that waited their coming with great Sorrow, said, <hi>That
when they saw him and them come with such Chearfulness, Joy, and Evidence
of the presence of God with them, it made Death appear with another Aspect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They first Embraced each other with great Affection, then two of the Eldest
Persons Prayed Audibly, they joyning with great Seriousness: Then he desired
leave of the <hi>Sheriff</hi> to Pray particularly, but he would not grant it; but only
asked him, <hi>If he would Pray for the King;</hi> To which he Answered, <hi>I Pray for
all Men:</hi> He then Requested they might sing a Psalm, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> told them,
<hi>It must be with Ropes about them,</hi> which they chearfully accepted, and
sung with such heavenly Joy &amp; Sweetness, that many present said, <hi>it broke and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Hearts:</hi> Thus in Expressing the Delightfulness of Praising God on Earth, he
w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llingly closed his Eyes on a vain World, and past to the Eternal Employment, <hi>Sept.</hi>
the <hi>30th</hi> 1685.</p>
               <p>All present of all sorts, were exceedingly affected and amazed: Some Officers
that had before insultingly said, <hi>Sure these Persons have no thoughts of Death,
but will find themselves surprized by it;</hi> after said, <hi>That they now saw, that he
and they had something extraordinary within, that carried them through with
such Joy.</hi> Others of them said, <hi>They were so convinced of their Happiness,
that they would be glad to change Conditions with them.</hi> All the Soldiers in
general, and all others wept and lamented about them, and for him in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
saying, <hi>It was so sad a thing to see such excellent Persons so cut off, they
scarce knew how to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear it.</hi> Some of the most malicious in the place, from
whom nothing but Railing was expected, said, (as they were carried to their
Graves in <hi>Taunton-Church,</hi> Voluntarily accompanied by most of the Town,)
<hi>That these Persons had given sufficient Evidence, that they were Glorified Saints
in Heaven.</hi> A great Officer in the Kings Army hath been heard to say, <hi>If you
will learn to Die, go to the Young Men in</hi> Taunton. Much more was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, shewing the Blessed and Gracious frame of his Soul; but this is
what occurs to Memory. About two Hours before his Death he Wrote this
following Letter, which shewed the great Composure of his Mind.</p>

down for my Execution, and within these few hours I expect it
to be performed. Blessed be Almighty God, that gives Comfort
and Support in such a day; how ought we to Magnifie his Holy
Name for all his Mercies, that when we were running on in a
course of Sin, he should stop us in our full Career; and shew us
that Christ whom we had pierced; and out of his free Grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
us to look upon him with an Eye of Faith; believing him
able to save to the uttermost, all that come to him.</p>
               <p>O Admirable long Suffering and Patience of God! That when
we were a dishonouring his Name, he did not take that time to
Glorifie himself by our Destruction; <hi>for he delights not in the
Death of a Sinner, but had rather he should turn to him and Live.</hi>
And he hath many ways of bringing his own to himself; Blessed
be his holy Name, that through Affliction he hath taught my
Heart to be in some measure conformable to his Will; which
worketh Patience, Patience Experience, Experience Hope,
which maketh not ashamed.</p>
               <p>I Bless God I am not ashamed for the Cause for which I lay
down my Life; and as I have Ingaged in it, and Fought for it,
so I am now going to Seal it with my Blood.</p>
               <p>The Lord carry on the same Cause that hath been so long on
foot; and though I die in it, and for it, <hi>I question not but in his
own good time, he will raise up other Instruments more worthy to carry
it on for the Glory of his Name, and the Advancement of his Church
and People.</hi> I know there hath been nothing left undone by you
or the rest of my Friends, for the saving of my Life, for the
which I return my hearty acknowledgments to your self and them
all; and it is my dying request to you and them, to pardon all
Undutifulness in every Relation; pray give my Duty to every
Relation; and to every Friend a particular Recommendation;
pray tell them all how pretious an Interest in Christ is when we
come to die, and advise them never to rest in a Christless state;

for if we are his, it is no matter what the World does with us,
they can but kill the Body; and Blessed be God, the Soul is out
of their reach; for I question not but their Malice wishes the
Damnation of the Soul, as well as the Destruction of the Body;
which hath evidently appeared by their deceitful flattering Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
I commit you all to the Care and Protection of God,
