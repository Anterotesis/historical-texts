            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have here, Composed a little <hi>Treatise</hi> which Consisteth chiefly of a <hi>Cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> who have been ingaged in the same <hi>case,</hi> for which you now suffer <hi>spoyling of your goods,</hi> the <hi>external Ruin</hi> of some of your <hi>families &amp; Estates, the deprivation of your liberties, and</hi> what not? And now through perusing of the same you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>(as in a glass)</hi> what the <hi>Antient</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have suffered; first by the <hi>Jews,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> or heathen and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by false Christians; yet I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the notion of these things to some will be but as the shell to the kernel, or as the <hi>chaff to the wheat</hi> in comparison of that <hi>Internal,</hi> sweet joy, comfort, and living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment which (I do not doubt, but that) many of you plentiously injoy, yea even in the heat of these troublesome and <hi>Perilous times.</hi>

This same <hi>Abridgment</hi> of Remarkable things which I have found upon Record, I have thought good to <hi>Dedicate</hi> unto you, in as much as you above many in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are aquainted with the <hi>Christian suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering state</hi> and condition, who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been <hi>men of sorrows and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief,</hi> as by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will more palpably and evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Let not the Innocent and simple be offended at it, because it is extracted out of some <hi>Ecclesiastical Histories;</hi> For this I say, that many <hi>Frivolous Histories</hi> which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are perused by such as are <hi>Prone</hi> and inclining to that wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is from below, are not to be compared to this; for they being oft-times Stuffed with forged fables, and lying tales, they stir up the vain, light, frothy minds in people: but the perusing of this which I have here Collected, will <hi>rather</hi> stir up zeal, love and tenderness to the truth, and such as now suffer for it, as the <hi>Antient</hi> Christians heretofore have done.</p>
                  <p>Moreover through the viewing over of this, a litteral knowledge may in part be obtained, of the <hi>Fruits, Doctrines, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>

                     <hi>and Practises,</hi> of the <hi>Apostatized Christians,</hi> after their degeneration, of their <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Counsels,</hi> and what they Decreed; of the temptations, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which they had (who retained their integrity) both from the Heathen and from the false Christians, and how sad and lamentable their conditions were that did not continue faithful: which may serve for examples, to such among you <hi>(belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)</hi> as are <hi>inconstant</hi> and of a <hi>doubtful mind,</hi> let them look upon <hi>Origen</hi> and hear what he saith in his lamentation after his fall: and let them consider the Faith and patience of such as chuseth rather to die than they would <hi>swear,</hi> or sacrifice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the faith, or deny their Lord and Master, and therefore were some <hi>torn in pieces of wild beasts, some Crucified, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, some stoned to death, some stifled, some fryed or Rosted, some burned to ashes, some hanged, some brained, some had their eyes pulled out, and the empty place seared with a hot Iron, some were drowned in the Sea, some fettered and famished to death, in noysome Prisons and dungeons:</hi> Oh the torments that they endured are hard to be

uttered, and that about the exercise of their Conscience and the worship of their God.</p>
                  <p>And truly I must tell you (O beloved) that I was constrained to lay those things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that if peradventure they might in any wise tend to the Confirming and strengthening of the faith of some, to the forewarning of others of shrinking in the time of tryal, and to the strengthening of the hands of the weak and feeble against their <hi>Persecutors;</hi> who also hereby may see what judgment and misery came upon sundry of their <hi>Persecuting fore-fathers:</hi> so that in my judgment it may be of use not only to you who are persecuted, but also to your oppressors and persecutors; who now persist in their wickedness and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as if they <hi>should never come to judgment for the same:</hi> well my dearly beloved, be not you discomforted and cast down in your spirits, because <hi>the wicked is set up, and the ungodly prospers in his ways, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity they are counted happy yet it was not thus in the beginning,</hi> neither shall it allways so continue; for the Lord our God in his due time, will <hi>strik the hook into the jaw of the Leviathan,</hi> so that he shall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41717:6"/>
and the pure and upright in heart shall be delivered out of his paw, and snare, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God: wherefore let none be afraid who are called to follow the lamb in this <hi>Notable day,</hi> for I am perswaded, that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, nor Persecution, Exilment nor Banishment, Fire nor Sword, things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent nor things to come <hi>(though all these do come)</hi> shall not be able to seperate us from that love which we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom I bid you farewel; my dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>

                     <hi>When I was</hi> A School boy, <hi>I was for many years as much inclined to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and play, as my</hi> Fellows, <hi>though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time I was enticed and drawn by them into things which I knew then certainly, to be evil, and contrary to the tender principle of God in my</hi> Conscience, <hi>yet rather than I would be behind them in their wonton childish follies, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have come to have been jeered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided by them) I chused rather at that time to run with them to the same excess of vanity, though I knew for certain I ought not to have done it, and when for the same I came to be corrected by my Tutor, and judged of the Lord, I was made to confess,</hi> that it was just, and that I had justly deserved the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Afterwards through the mercy and goodness of the Lord I came to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Illuminated <hi>or enlightned before I left the</hi> School; <hi>And come to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sense of true judgment being set up</hi>

                     <hi>in my heart, And then I came to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Sorrow and Heaviness, for the loss of my</hi> mispent pretious time, <hi>and the Sins of my Youth,</hi> (even while I was yet a youth) <hi>were brought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fresh into my remembrance, and became in those daies my great burthen, and withal in those daies my</hi> study and learning <hi>became also burthensome, and not these alone, but especially the wantonness and rudness, folly and naughtiness of my</hi> School fellows, <hi>that also became grievous unto me at times, and a dread and fear was upon me,</hi> (when I minded the Lord) <hi>that I durst not run with them to folly and wantonness as I had done before; So that when they have gone to play, I have retired my self into some private place</hi> to ponder upon the things <hi>which the Lord put into my heart. And when with a</hi> retired mind and upright heart, <hi>I came in sincerity to wait upon the Lord, then came my</hi> Soul <hi>to feel some secret Communion with him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some</hi> Crummes <hi>of living Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him; and then was I joyful in him at</hi> night, <hi>whereas formerly I had</hi>

These things I rehearse unto you whereby you may understand how the Lord</hi> dealt <hi>with me, and how it was with me, while I was yet a</hi> Scholar; <hi>to the end that you may somewhat the better know how to</hi> behave <hi>your selves</hi> (I mean you that are tender, among them that are wild and rude) in Schools <hi>where you are Appointed to learn and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</hi>

In the mean while (necessity so constraining) the Bishop sent for <hi>Iohn;</hi> he, when he had ended and finished the cause of his coming; Go to (saith he) O Bishop restore unto us thy charge which I and Christ have committed unto thy Custody, the Church whereof thou art head bearing witness. The Bishop at the first was Amazed, supposing some deceit to be wrought touching money, which he had not received, yet was he not able to Answer them for that he had it not; But when <hi>Iohn</hi> had said, I require

the young man and the Soul of our Brother; then the Elder looking down with a heavy Countenance sobbing and sighing said: <hi>he is dead.</hi> To whom <hi>Iohn</hi> said; How? and by what kind of death? he Answered he is dead to God, for he is become wicked, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to be short a Thief for he keepeth this mountain together with his Associates; the Apostle then rending his Garment, and beating his head with sorrow, said, I have left a wise keeper of our Brothers Soul; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me a horse and let me have a guide. He hastened and rode in post, being come unto the place appointed he is straight wayes taken of the thievish watch, he neither fled nor resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but exclaimed: for this purpose came I hither, (said he) bring me unto your Captain; who in the mean time as he was Armed beheld him coming, but as soon as he saw his face and knew it was <hi>Iohn,</hi> he was stricken with shame, and fled away: The old man with might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him, and cryed, my Son why flyest thou from thy Father Unarmed and Old? O Son tender my cause, be not afraid, as yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth hope of Salvation: I will undertake for thee with Christ, I will die for thee, if need be, as Christ did for us, I will hazard my Soul for thine; trust to me, Christ sent me. But he hearing this, first stood still casting his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Ground, next shook of his Armour, anon trembled for fear, and wept bitterly. He embraced the old man, and coming unto him, answered as well as he could for weeping: So afterwards the Apostle brought him unto the Church again.</p>

It is written of <hi>Montanus,</hi> that he was puffed up with an immoderate Desire of Primacy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chief Authority, opened a Gap for the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to enter into him; and being mad and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged suddenly, and bereft of his Wits, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed furious, and published strange Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Tradition and ancient Custom of ancient Succession, now received, under the Name of Prophecy; they which then were <hi>Auditors</hi> of this unlawful Preaching, some cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised and checked him for a Lunatick <hi>(i. e. one possed with Lunacy, who at certain times of the Moon is distracted in his Wits)</hi> and one that was possessed with the Spirit of Errours, and forbad him to Preach, being mindful of the Forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Threatnings of our Saviour tending to this end, that we should take diligent heed of False Prophets. Others waxed insolent <hi>(i. e. proud)</hi> and boasted and bragged of him not a little, as if he had been endued with the Holy Ghost and Gift of Prophecy; so that through disobedient Persons, he came to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured than his Merit did require: And two Women being possessed of a foul Spirit, spoke fond, foolish, and fantastical things, even as he had before, and they gloried and rejoiced in that Spirit which pronounced them happy, and puffed them up with infinite fair Promises; yet <note place="margin">A deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit.</note> sometimes by Signs and Tokens he rebuked them to their faces, so that he seemed a chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Spirit.

they neither did Homage <hi>(i. e. a servile Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of some Tenants, which by Duty they owe to their</hi>

Those things he wrote in his first Book; and in his second Book he writeth thus of their Ends:</hi> These, say they, are the Prophets which the Lord promised to send his People. Let them answer me: <hi>I charge them in the Name of the Living God, O ye Good People, Is there any of the Sect of</hi> Montanus, <hi>and these Women which have been persecuted by the Jews,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to death.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, when the Bishops went about to rebuke the Spirit which spoke in <hi>Maximilla,</hi> they were hindred by others that wrought by the same Spirit, saying, Let not the Spirit of <hi>Maximilla</hi> say, <hi>I am chased as a Wolf from the Sheep: I am no Wolf, I am the Word, the Spirit and Power; but let him manifestly express the power by the Spirit, and prevail.</hi>

                     <p>Again, <hi>speaking of one of their</hi> highly esteemed Martyrs, <hi>he writes in this sort:</hi> And that we trouble not our selves with many, let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetess tell us touching <hi>Alexander,</hi> who called himself a Martyr, with whom she hath banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whom also many do adore, <hi>i. e.</hi> worship,

whose Thefts and other heinous Crimes, which he suffered for, I will not presently rehearse, for they are publickly known and registred, Whose Sins hath he pardoned?

                     <p>For as when Christ commanded, <hi>You shall not possess Gold, neither Silver, neither two Goats;</hi> these, on the contrary, seek after the Possession of unlawful Substance; for they whom they <note place="margin">False pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous.</note> call Prophets and Martyrs, have extorted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>i. e. wrested it from people per force,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Rich, but of the Poor, the Fatherless and Widows.

                        <p>This Persecution was not begun by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Edict <hi>(i. e.</hi> Proclamation or Decree) but one whole year before: For there came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this City a certain Southsayer, and Inventer of Mischief, who moved and stirred up the whole Multitude of the Heathen against us, and excited <hi>(i. e.</hi> stirred up) them to defend the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of their Native Soil: By whom they being thus provoked, and having won to their side such as were of Power and Authority, to perpetrate <hi>(i. e.</hi> to commit any unlawful thing) all impious Acts, they perswaded themselves, that the only Worship of Devils and our Slaughter was Piety <hi>(i. e.</hi> Godliness) it self. First then, they apprehended a certain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and commanded him to utter Blaspemy; who for disobedience therein, was beaten with Clubs, his Face and Eyes they pricked with <note place="margin">A Martyr stoned.</note> sharp Quills; afterwards they led him forth, and stoned him to death.</p>
                        <p>Again, they brought into the Temple of <hi>Idols,</hi> a Faithful Woman named <hi>Quinta,</hi> and constrained her to Worship; who contrarying and abhorrying their Idols, had her Feet bound <note place="margin">Heathen Cruelty.</note> together, and by them trailed and lugged all along the Streets. which were paved with sharp
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41717:48"/>
Stones; and withal being beaten against Mill-stones, and sore scourged, she was brought forth to the place and executed. Which being done, they all almost with one accord violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rushed into the Houses of the Religious, and and the wicked led the heady multitude unto their Neighbours Houses, whom they knew to be godly and well-disposed, and they destroyed, spoiled, stole, and bore away the precious Jewels; but the vile, the base, and the woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den stuff they threw out into the Street, and burned it to ashes; shewing forth thereby a Resemblance, or Spectacle of a City taken and ransacked by the Enemy. But the Brethren took it in good Part, and very cheerfully suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they the Loss of their Goods; much like unto them of whom <hi>Paul</hi> hath testified, so great was the Rage of the Heathen, that there was no way left for us to pass, no not the common High-way, nor any By passages either by day or night; they cried out all, and exclaimed every where; there was no other choice, but either to utter Blasphemy, or to be drawn and burnt at a Stake. But in the end, this Sedition and Civil War overtook the seditious Persons themselves, and turned upon them the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Cruely, which they before had practised upon us; so that for a little Season we refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our selves, their Fury wherewith they raged against us being somewhat abated. But a while after, the alteration of the Imperial Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was made known unto us, which before-time had been very favourable unto us, but now threatned great Mischief to ensue, And the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41717:49"/>
Emperours Edict or Proclamation was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and that most dreadful Saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note place="margin">Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against Christians</note> prognosticated <hi>(i. e. foretold)</hi> long before, then took place, That if it had been possible, the very Elect themselves should have been offended..</p>
                        <p>Then did all tremble and <hi>Quake</hi> for fear; some forthwith of the mightier sort fled away, doubting what would befall them; some of their own accord were carried away with their worldly Affairs, some were perswaded by their Neighbours, and being called by their Names, were present at their profane and impious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: Some waxed pale and trembled, not as though they would Sacrifice, but like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sacrifices and Oblations <hi>(i. e.</hi> Offerings) to the Idols, so that the whole Multitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided them; for they seemed manifestly to be timerous both to die, and also to Sacrifice; some went stoutly to their Altars, and affirmed bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they never were Christians; some other there were that held with both sides; some fled, and some were taken, whereof divers endured Fetters and Imprisonments: Othersome after long imprisonment, before they came unto the Tribunal <hi>(i. e.</hi> Judgment) Seat, renounced <hi>(i. e.</hi> forsook or denied) their Faith; yea, some denied Christ, after they had endured Torments. But <hi>Iulianus</hi> and <hi>Cronion</hi> (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and acknowledged the Lord with a sound Faith) were burned to ashes in the presence of the People, which compassed them round about.</p>

                           <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> a young Man of fifteen years old (with others) were committed: First of all the Judge took the young Man in hand with <note place="margin">A young Sufferer.</note> fair Speeches, as though he were easie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; afterwards with Torments, as though he were soon terrified; but he for all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, would neither bow at his Flatteries, or break at his Threats. The rest, after they had endured cruel rending and dis-jointing of their bodily Members, he commanded to be burned with fire: But <hi>Dioscorus</hi> he set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wondring at his gracious Countenance (which gave a glittering shine) and the wise Answers which proceeded out of his mouth, saying he would grant him longer space to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and remember himself, for his tender years sake. Moreover, <hi>Nemesion</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> was accused of Theft, whereof, after he had openly purged and cleared himself before the <hi>Centursion (i. e. Captain of</hi> 100 <hi>men)</hi> again he was accused of <hi>Christianity,</hi> wherefore he was <hi>bound</hi> and brought before the President <hi>(i. e.</hi> a Ruler or Judge.) But the most cruel and unjust Judge delivered him among the Thieves, to be twice more grievously tormented and vexed.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41717:50"/>
with their Countenance, and beckned with their Hands, exhorting them to Constancy, with many signs and gestures of the Body; the which when the Multitude in compass had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, before that any laid hands on them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their doings, they stept forth before the Bar, and proclaimed themselves to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; so that the President and his Assistants were amazed, and the Christians upon whom the Sentence had past, were thereby embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to suffer, and the Judges marvellously afraid. These therefore departed from the Tribunal <hi>(i. e.</hi> Judgment) seat cheerfully, and rejoyced in the testimony of their Faith, God gloriously trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in them.</p>

                     <p>Alas, what have I felt, and how am I fallen? Alas, how am I thus come to naught?

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41717:54"/>
Furtherer of Iniquity: When that I set my self against the Assemblies of the wicked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Doings, there found I shame and the most pestilent Wound of the Devil: When that I was ignorant and unskilful in the divers slights of strivers which commonly entrap men; I allured and exhorted them to the knowledge of the Son of God; wherefore after much sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they promised me, unhappy man, crafty Conveyances to avoid the Subtilty of Satan. But after that I departed from them, the Devil in the same night transformed himself into an Angel of Light, and reasoned with me, saying, When thou art up in the morning, go on, and perswade them, and bring them to God; if they demand ought of thee, if in case they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend and hearken unto thee, do It, and cease not, staggering nothing at the matter, to the <note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> end many may be saved.</p>
                     <p>And again, the Devil going before to prepare the way, whetted their Wits to devise mischief against me silly Wretch, and sowed in their Minds Hypocrisie, Dissimulation, and Deceit. But I, O unhappy Creature, skipping out of my Bed at the dawning of the day, could not finish my wonted Devotion, neither accomplish my usual Prayer, but wishing that all men might be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the Truth, folded and wrapped my self in the snares of the Devil. I got me unto the wicked; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them to perform the Covenant made the night before.</p>
                     <p>O blinded Heart, how didst thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? O foolish Mind, how didst thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think

thy self? O witless Brain, how didst thou not understand? O thou Sense of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, where didst thou sleep? But it was the Devil which provoked thee to slumber and sleep, and in the end slew thy unhappy and wretched Soul. He bound my Power and Might, and spoiled me of my Knowledge; he bound my Power and Might, and wounded me. I answered but in word, and became reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defamed: I spake without malice, yet felt a spight. The Devil raised an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly about me, and pronounced against me that unjust Sentence: <hi>ORIGEN hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</hi> O thou Devil, what hast thou done unto me? How hast thou wounded me? I bewailed sometime the Fall of <hi>Sampson,</hi> but now have I felt a far worse my self; I bewailed heretofore the Fall of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet now am <hi>I</hi> fallen far worse my self; I have bewailed heretofore the State of all Sinners, yet now have I plunged in them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sampson</hi> had the Hair of his Head clipped and cropped off, but the Crown of Glory is fallen off from my Head: <hi>Samson</hi> lost the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eyes of his Body, but my spiritual Eyes are digged out. It was the Wiliness of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that brought him to his Confession, but it was my own Tongue that brought me to this sinful Fall: And even as he wanted after that the loss of his earthly Possession; so my Tongue having bolted out this wicked Saying, deprived me of the spiritual Gifts, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have flowed with Heavenly Riches. And even as he being severed from the <hi>Israelites,</hi>

and cleaving unto Foreigners, endured these things; so I going about to save notorious Sinners, brought my self Captive unto Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the Bond-slave of Sin. Alas, my Church liveth, yet am I a Widdower; alas, my Sons be alive, yet am I barren: Alas, every Creature rejoiceth, and I alone am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken and sorrowful: Alas, O Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was gladsome: Alas, O Seat, wherein I sate full merry: Alas, O Spirit, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore camest down upon me, why hast thou forsaken me?

have mercy upon me, whether he will pity my Fall, whether he will tender my Person, whether he will be moved with my Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether he will have respect unto my Humility, and encline his tender Compassion towards me, who have no taste nor relish of him, but am as the unsavoury Salt.</p>
                     <p>Now let the Elders mourn, for that the Staff whereto they leaned is broken: Now let the Young Men mourn, for that their School-Master is fallen: Now let the Virgins mourn, <note place="margin">It is sasd <hi>Origen</hi> gelded himself.</note> for that the Advancer thereof is defiled: Now let the Priests mourn, for that their Patron <hi>(i. e.</hi> a great Friend) and Defender is shamefully fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: Now let all the Clergy <hi>(i. e.</hi> Bishop, Priests, Deacons, &amp;c.) mourn, for that their Priest is fallen from the Faith: Wo is me that I sell so lewdly; who is me that I fell most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously, and cannot rise again.</p>

Let the Angels lament over me, because of this my dangerous Fall: Let the Garlands and Crowns of the Saints la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over me, for that I am severed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their blessed Assemblies: Let the Holy-Church

I was constrained of the Holy Bishops to break out into some Words of Exhortation, and taking the Book of Psalms in my hand, I prayed and opened; and I lighted upon that Sentence, the which I am ashamed to repeat, yet compelled to pronounce, <hi>Unto the ungodly said God, Why dost thou preach my Laws, and takest my Covenant in thy Mouth?</hi> But bewail me, and lament this my bitter Sorrow; bewail me who am in like case with the reprobate Jews <hi>(i. e.</hi> Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways) for that which was said unto them by the Prophet, now soundeth alike in my Ears; What shall I do that am thus beset with many Mischief.</p>
                     <p>Alas, O Death, why dost thou linger, to wit, that thou mayst spite and bear me malice? O Satan, what mischief hast thou wrought unto me? How hast thou pierced my Breast with thy poisonous Dart!

                     <p>Alas, O the Bosom of the Father which I am deprived of! Alas, that I became Partaker with the rich Man of his Condemnation in the

                     <p>They have granted you Pardon, so that you turn unto that which Nature it self doth bind you unto, so that you Adore, i. e. <hi>Worship</hi> the Gods which guard the Empire, and forget the things which Repugn, i. e. <hi>Resist</hi> Nature: What answer make you unto these?

insomuch as therefore God had brought us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, after that the Ministry was there <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> compleat, he, to wit, <hi>Aemilianus</hi> removed us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another place, which was thought to be more rough: I hearing we must depart from thence, and knowing not the place whither we were commanded to go, neither remembred I that ever afore I heard it named, for all that, took my Journey willingly and cheerfully. Yet here I will accuse my self; for at the first I fretted and took it very grievously. If Places better known and more frequented, had fallen unto our Lot, it should never have grieved me; but that Place whither I should repair, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be destitute of all Brotherly and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Consolation, subject to the troublesome Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of Travellers, and violent Invasion <hi>(i. e.</hi> assault) of Thieves.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, he relates how <hi>Germanus</hi> perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture gloried of many Confessions, and could tell a long Tale of the Afflictions which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: But what can be repeated on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half?

That their right Eyes should be sticked upon the point of a Bodkin, and all to be digged out, and searched to the inner Veins with a hot scalding Iron, and that the left Leg should be Sawn alunder in the Knee-Sinews:</hi> But with these hainous and horrible Treacheries practised against the Noble and Renowned Martyrs of Christ, the great heat of Persecution was asswaged, and the Flame thereof (as it seem'd unto us) by reason of their Blood was quenched, and now Pardon and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was granted unto the <hi>Confessors,</hi> for so the Christians (it seems) were then called of <hi>Thebias,</hi> who were then oppressed with druge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the digging of Metais, growing in that Region: And we poor silly <hi>Christians,</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to recreate our selves in this calm season of quiet peace: but he in whose hand it lay to persecute us, I wot not how, neither by what motion, was again throughly and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully incensed, i. e. <hi>stirred up to Anger</hi> against the <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, upon a suddain the Letters of <hi>Maximinus</hi> were sent to raise <hi>Persecution</hi> against <note place="margin">A new Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> us in every Province, whereupon the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and the grand Captain of the Emperors

                     <head>The Edicts of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinnius,</hi> touching Christian Religion, and the Liberty thereof.</head>
                     <p>Weighing with our selves, said they, that of old the Liberty of Religion was not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and every one had licence after his Mind and Will; We have presently commanded, that every one shall handle the holy Affairs at his pleasure, and that the Christians shall retain their Faith of their former Opinion and wonted Service. Whenas with prosperous Success we came to <hi>Milan,</hi> and enquired of the things which made for the Commodity and Profit of the Commonwealth, these amongst many other things seemed expedient, yea, before all other, we purposed to decree; wherein the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Service due to God is comprised <hi>(i. e.</hi> contained) that is to say, by which we might grant unto the Christians altogether Free choice to embrace what Service and Ceremony pleased them best, to the end the Divinity of the Celestial <hi>(i. e.</hi> Heavenly) Affairs now every where received, might in some part be pleasing unto us, and to all our Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Then according unto this our Pleasure, we have decreed, with sound and most right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Liberty of conscience granted.</note> that Licence any Liberty be henceforth denied unto None at all, of chusing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Christian Service or Religion, but that this Liberty be granted unto every one, to addict his Mind unto that Religion which he thinks fit for him, to the end that God may grant unto us his wonted Care and Goodness.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41717:69"/>
And now whosoever freely and firmly is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to retain the Christian Religion, let him do it without all molestation or grievance. And because that we have granted Liberty to use their Observance and Religion, if so please any; <hi>It manifestly availeth for the Tranquillity,</hi> i. e. ease and quietness, <hi>of our Times, that every one have Liberty to chuse and worship what God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him best.</hi> This have we done, lest ought of our Doings seem prejudicial unto any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Religion.</p>
                     <p>And because the said Christians are known not only to have enjoyed the place of their Meetings and Assemblies, but also certain other peculiar <hi>(i. e.</hi> proper) not to every one private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but belonging by right unto their whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; see that thou command all those accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the Decree mentioned before, to be restored unto the Christians.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Emperor summoned a Synod <hi>i. e. a General or Universal Assembly,</hi> of Bishops to meet at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the uniting and reconciling <note place="margin">A Synod called.</note> of the Churches; for it seemed unto him very grievous, that there should be found in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, a multitude of People prone, <hi>i. e.</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto the worse, and disagreeing, <hi>and that among Bishops there should be variance.</hi>

                        <hi>OF a truth, he that is born after the Flesh, persecuteth him that is after the Spirit;</hi> and that irreconcielable <hi>Enmity</hi> which God (after many Transgression) put <hi>betwixt the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent,</hi> hath in all the ages of the World, appeared in Satans Instruments against the Righteous and Harmless People of the Most High, who since the Fall have suffered through many Generations: And it is observed, how that when the Adversary of Mankind had got possession in <hi>Cain (Adam</hi>'s first Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 1, 8.) that then did <hi>Cain</hi> rise up against his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and slew him: And this same Adversary is he, who hath been <hi>a Murtherer and a Lyar from the beginning,</hi> who until this day hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a place in the Hearts of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Posterity; and one remarkable Token whereby he might be known in all Ages hath been <hi>Persecution.</hi> And after he had gotten Dominion in Mans Heart, <hi>the Wickedness of Man became great in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. 12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>the Earth, and the Imaginations and Thoughts of</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:41717:73"/>
                        <hi>his Heart were evil continually;</hi> so that the Earth came to be corrupted, yea to be filled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And then did the Wicked and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly often offer violence unto the Just and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, even as the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> did unto just <hi>Lot,</hi> whose Enmity was not only against him, but also against the <hi>Angels whom he had entertained,</hi> Gen. 19. 5.</p>
                     <p>And likewise this Adversary of God and good Men, had gotten place in the Hearts of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren, who conspired together to slay him; but they not being suffered of the Lord to do <note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> that, <hi>they cast him into a Pit in the Wilderness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, it appears that Satan <hi>(i. e.</hi> an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary or Devil) had a possession in <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and in the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who did much perplex <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 12, 14.</note> and afflict the Righteous in those days; for they were grieved with them, and therefore did they make the Lives of the Righteous bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with hard bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the Enmity of this Adversary was great in many of the Potentates of the Earth, against the People of God in the days of old, as appears in sundry Places of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it may be observed, how that when they that were called the Lords People departed from his Counsel, that then this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary got place in them also; which plainly appeared by their murmuring against the Lord, when they were wroth over his Servants, and cried out, <hi>Stone them with stones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 10.</p>
                     <p>Again, this Adversary of God, and of good People, got possession, yea dominion in the Sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> who beset the House of him that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41717:73"/>
entertained <hi>the way-faring Levite,</hi> and intended to have slain him.</p>
                     <p>Again, we may see how that when <hi>Saul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the <hi>Gounsel of the Lord,</hi> then did the Evil Spirit of this Adversary enter into him; and then commanded he his Footmen to <hi>slay the Lord's Priests;</hi> and although they would not do it, yet <hi>Doeg slew fourscore and five of them upon one day,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>Again, the evil persecuting spirit of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary appeared also in <hi>Jezebel, Ahab</hi>'s Wife, who stirred up the Elders and the Nobles to procure two false Witnesses against <hi>Naboth,</hi> to testifie falsly against him, as if he had <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against God and the King;</hi> and the People of the City being leavened with the aforesaid Spirit, <hi>they carried him out of the City, and stoned him to death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were departed <note place="margin">Ier. 37.</note> from the Lord, then did the Enmity of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of God and all Goodness appear in them, which manifested it self by the wrath and indignation which appeared in them against the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, whom they cast into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and against <hi>Zechariah,</hi> whom they <hi>slew betwixt the Temple and the Altar.</hi> Yea, so mightily did the Enmity of Satan's persecuting Spirit prevail over them, <hi>that in the end they killed and crucified those whom God sent among them, and scourged them in their Synagogues, and persecured them from City to City,</hi> Mat. 23. 24, 25.</p>
                     <p>From these few Examples which I have here alledged, it doth most plainly appear, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, this Adversary of God, of the Creation,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41717:74"/>
and of Mankind, hath of old had a mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against the Righteous, yea before the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> of whom the Prophets that were slain testified; and it is manifest, <hi>that it was his persecuting Power and Spirit which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in</hi> Cain, <hi>in</hi> Joseph's <hi>Brethren, in the</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, <hi>in the Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>in the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>in</hi> Saul, <hi>in</hi> Jezabel, <hi>and in the</hi> Jews: And the same Enmity hath often appeared in the same persecuting Power and Spirit of this old Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary against <hi>the True Christians</hi> since the coming of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> which may more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>WHen the <hi>Jews</hi> had crucified the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> then did they raise a terrible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that under pretence of <hi>Religion;</hi> yet they sought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Blood-thirstiness, through their carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">John 18. 31.</note> on their wicked Design by the <hi>Romish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> for they said expresly, <hi>It was not lawful for them to put any Man to death;</hi> yet in the mean time they could <hi>hale them before their Councils,</hi> where the High-Priest was President, and there did they Judge and Condemn the Christians, as they had done Christ; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they delivered them to the Earthly Powers, to be punished according to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; <note place="margin">Acts 24.</note> calling the Christians the <hi>Sect of the Nazarites;</hi> and said they set the whole World in an uproar, and sought to annihilate <hi>(i. e.</hi> to bring to nothing) the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they presently got the help of the rude Multirude to persecute the Christians, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41717:74"/>
that under Pretence of defending of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Are not the true Christians now called a Fanatick Sect? And are they not accused for making uproars and tumults, when they are as free from such things as the Christians were in the Days of the Apostles; who were not only accused for making Uproars, but also for setting the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> at nought, even as true Christians now are falsly accused for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king void the Scripture, and of setting it as nought; whereupon many now suffer about their Religion (by such as pretend to defend and propagate it) even as the ancient Christians did then under the <hi>Jews,</hi> who resisted the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, and the holy Men that spoke as it gave them utterance; and being filled with an evil Spirit of Malice and Enmity against the Lord and his Truth, they whipped the Apostles, and haled <hi>Stephen</hi> before their Council, and procured false Witnesses against him. And when <hi>Stephen</hi> in his Answer laid open their <note place="margin">Acts 6.</note> Wickedness, they were pricked at the Heart, and gnashed their Teeth at him, and stopped their Ears, and run forceably upon him, and stoned him to death. And after that, a mighty <hi>Persecution of the Christians</hi> arose, insomuch that they came to be scattered throughout the <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> Land of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that the Jews did bring much suffering upon the Christians, against whom their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">Acts 13. 50. Chap. 14. Chap. 17.</note> was great, and especially against <hi>Paul,</hi> whose life they earnestly sought after, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did they <hi>stone him,</hi> and sometime they did
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41717:75"/>
                        <hi>whip him,</hi> and often were they moved with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy against him and the Brethren, and upon a time, took unto them certain lewd Fellows of baser sort, and gathered a company and set all the City upon an uproar, and assaulted the House of <hi>Jason,</hi> and drew him out with others of the Brethren unto the Rulers of the City, crying <hi>They that have turned the World upside down are come hither also, and these all do contrary to the Decrees of</hi> Caesar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> Hath it not been so of late in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that when the true Christians have come to one of their Friends Houses in a City, some evil affected person or other, hath gathered a company of Rude People, and have haled the Innocent out of their Friends Houses, when they have been edifying and building up one another in the most Holy Faith: So that oftentimes the <hi>Anti-christians</hi> have behaved themselves like the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and through their Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Uproaring have they caused the peaceable and harmless to suffer, when they who were Guilty have gone free.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the professing <hi>Jews</hi> manifested their envious Spirit against <hi>Paul,</hi> when they stirred up the People and laid hands upon him, crying out; <hi>Men of</hi> Israel <hi>help: this is the Man that teacheth all Men every where, against the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Law and this place;</hi> And all the City was moved, and all the People ran together, and they took <hi>Paul,</hi> and drew him out of the Temple, and had him before their Council, and accused him to the Governor; but when they could not prevail, neither by Righteousness
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41717:75"/>
nor by Violence, then did a Company of them bind themselves by an Oath, neither to eat nor to drink until they had killed <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus much concerning the Jews.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Since that the Gospel hath been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched again in the Power and Demonstration of the eternal Spirit, some Cities in <hi>England</hi> have been as in Uproars, where the true Christians have so preached the Gospel as before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and at the same time they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for teaching People against the Scripture, and for incensing of them against Magistracy and Ministry, yea against their Laws and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline; and thereby have some Professing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristians, stirred up the rude Rabble shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to intreat the good Christians, who at this day are found in the footsteps of the ancient suffering Christians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But some will say, Who dost thou call the True and Good Christians, whom thou dost at this time parallel with the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? We know not whom thou meanest, nor do we know whom thou callest the Anti-christians; thou mightest do well to inform us a little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I call them the True or Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who walk in the Light of the Lamb, <note place="margin">Who are Christians</note> who follow him through Honour and Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, through evil Report and good Report, who bear his daily Cross without murmuring, who do unto others as they would be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, who renounce the vain Customs of the World, and forsake the frivolous Traditions of Men, tógether with the hidden things of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41717:76"/>
who are truly contented in suffering when they are therein exercised, and that for the exercise of their Conscience in matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto Religion, who for Conscience sake cannot <hi>Swear,</hi> because their Master for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them, nor pay Tithes, because their Lord is come who ends the first Priesthood that took Tithes, and is become their Priest, unto whom <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 16, 17.</note> they could freely give Tithe, Sacrifice, Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But these that be external he wills not, therefore do they freely offer that unto him, which they are sure he will not reject nor despise, to wit, a clean, contrite, and broken Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they who live godlily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprovably, as becometh right Christians, such I do call Good and True Christians. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as I find the People (who in contempt are called QUAKERS oftner than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) in the Light of the Lamb, in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in the Practices in which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Christians were exercised, therefore it is meet that they now should be called <hi>The Good or True Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>Anti-Christians (i. e.</hi> Opposers of, or Adversaries to true Christianity) such I <note place="margin">Who are Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> call so, as are found professing Christianity in words, but deny it in works, as some that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in Words <hi>they knew God, but in Works they denyed him;</hi> so they that profess to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> and live in all manner of Unchastity, they by their Works deny that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in words, and so are not worthy to be called <hi>Christians,</hi> while they are found in that which is against, or contrary to Christianity,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41717:76"/>
in which thousands of persecuting false Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are found; and therefore do I call such <hi>Antichristians.</hi>

                        <p>Again, (said he) The <hi>Christians</hi> were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> (i. e. <hi>an abusing of Sacraments or Holy Misteryes)</hi> for they did not Solemnize with the <hi>Heathen</hi> the days they Feasted on in Honour to the Emperours with all kind of Beastly Ceremonies, Repugnant (i. e. <hi>contrary)</hi> to the Christians Modesty, Chastity, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                        <p>In those days it was a manner among the Christians not to go to any <hi>Comedies or Stage-Plays,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would not go to any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> for they understood, <hi>that if they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Devil and all his Works, with the World, that then they must forsake Comedies and Stage-plays:</hi> Moreover the Christians said, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce (i. e. <hi>resign or refuse)</hi> your <hi>Shews,</hi> as we condemn their divers <hi>Originals</hi> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have, that they are <hi>effects of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note.</hi> Doth it not from hence plainly appear, that the Tokens of <hi>Triumph</hi> which are used by <hi>Anti-Christians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>Heathenish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Traditions,</hi> in which many have been found of late who profess themselves to be Christians: Did not many of our <hi>English</hi> People [who glory so much of Christianity] make <hi>Bone-fires</hi> [so called] set up <hi>May-poles,</hi> and <hi>In,</hi> and <hi>With</hi> such like <hi>Heathenish</hi> Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Heathnish inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Tryumph when the <hi>King</hi> was Proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when he came to <hi>London,</hi> and when he

was <hi>Crowned?</hi> And did not then the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that Feared the Lord, keep themselves <hi>Still</hi> and <hi>Quiet,</hi> like unto the antient Christians? And were not they judged to be Enemies to the <hi>King,</hi> and Despisers of him, because they did not run with the Multitude to the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Vanity: But renounced their <hi>Idolatrous Superstitious Shewes,</hi> which many did not only produce upon the times before mentioned, but which are produced by <hi>Popishly</hi> affected <hi>Anti-christians</hi> upon their <hi>Popish Holy</hi> [but rather Prophane] <hi>Days:</hi> and upon their <hi>Mayor Days,</hi> even like unto the <hi>Heathen,</hi> whose manner was to set forth such vain <hi>Shews</hi> upon the days on which they Feasted, in whose practise the <hi>Anti-Christians</hi> are now found, who also are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the <hi>Heathen</hi> were, when they that fear the Lord do not observe their days and times, which they, or the <hi>Heathen</hi> have appointed to be Solemnized, which sometime they spend in Voluptuousness, Fulness, and Excess, with all kind of Beastly Ceremonies, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well calls them) which are now indeed as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contrary to Christians Modesty, Chastity, and Purity, as the Ceremonies were, which the <hi>Heathen</hi> joyned the Christians to observe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover the true Christians have been the rather supposed to be Evilly affected to the <hi>KING,</hi> and to be despisers of him, because they can no more take the <hi>Oaths of Allegance</hi> (i. e. <hi>Obedience of</hi> a Subject to his Prince) and <hi>Supremay</hi> (i. e. <hi>chief Authority)</hi> then the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heretofore could swear by the Emperours Fortune, for the true Christians now are of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides</hi>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41717:80"/>
mind, who said, It did not become him <note place="margin">Euseb. l. 6. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.</note> to swear, because he was a Christian, neither would it become them now to do that which their Lord and Master hath forbid, who said, Swear not at all.</p>
                        <p>Again, Have not the true Christians been also upbraided with such false Accusations, as if they put out their Candles and did behave themselves uncivilly in the Evening Meetings; but let such as have thus falsly accused them see in whose steps and practise they are found.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it appears, that it was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Heathen to have <hi>Comedies,</hi> or <hi>Stage-Playes,</hi> but the Christians manner then, was not to go to them, and behold it is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now of Antichristians to have <hi>Comedies,</hi> but the manner of the good Christians is not to come at them, except it be to bear a Testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; wherefore may not even little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren judge, that they who have their <hi>Comedies</hi> for their pastime, at set times and appointed places that such are in the nature and practise of the Heathen, who derided the Christians and said; Their pleasures were not the Christians, <note place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were not the Christians</note> and therefore they had Reason to reject the things which pleased them as they said: even as Anti-Christians now reject Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness which pleaseth the true Christians, who have pleasure in the Lord, and not in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, in which the Apostatized Christians now take pleasure, as the Heathen herefore have done.</p>

                        <p>IN the year 253. did the Seventh Persecution arise under the Emperour <hi>Decius,</hi> who with Excessive Cruelty did Persecute the Christians, In this Persecution several of the Bishops were put to death and such as were the chief among the Christians did they torture with many Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Houses of the Christians they Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and that which the <hi>Plunderers</hi> did not esteem that they burned; In this <hi>Persecution</hi> many suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> some being Burned, some Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (Women so well as Men) some being whipt to death, and some Souldiers (for Incouraging these <hi>Martyrs</hi> in their Suffering) were put to death; In this Terrible Persecution several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Faith for fear of the Torments, <note place="margin">How some fell from the Faith, in the time of Tryal.</note> yet afterwards came to be restored again, the Suffering of the Christians was great under this Emperour, but his days were also shortened, for he had not Raigned two years but was caught in a <hi>Whag of Mire,</hi> where he met with a check or Reproof for his cruelty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note.</hi> Thus it appears that the Christians that lived Godly in <hi>Christ-Iesus,</hi> suffered Persecution, according to what the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath said; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 12. And many now that live Godly and Righteously do suffer not only the Imprisonment of their Bodies, but also the Spoyling of their Goods, which have been Spoyled both by <hi>Priests</hi> and People, who have sometime (as it were) Plundred their Houses for their dishonest gain, and they have shewed themselves in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

                        <p>Again, have not some Souldiers been turned out of their places, yea and brought into suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for countenancing and favouring the Sober, Innocent, true Christians, among whom some for fear of Suffering, may in some respect desert the Truth, as some faithless ones among the ancient Christians did; yet we know certainly there are a Remnant that cannot bow their knee to <hi>Baall,</hi> but would chuse rather to die the death which many ancient Christians suffered, then they will forsake the Lords Truth, or Transgress his Righteous Law, by breaking his commands.</p>

                        <p>After that there came another Order that they should cause the chief of of the Church to offer unto Idols, or else they were to be put to death, then did they begin to Rack, Torture, and put to death such as resisted, and some were constrained to offer.</p>
                        <p>This Persecution hegun as a little sparke,

but it spread over the whole Church, and the Persecution was so hot and great that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors themselves were troubled if not wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed; In <hi>Syria</hi> there was so many of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in hold that their <hi>Prisons</hi> were filled with <note place="margin">Prisons fill'd with Christians</note> them, and with joy they went unbound to their death,</p>

                        <p>IN the year 316 did the Eleventh Persecution of the Christians arise, under the Emperour <hi>Licinius;</hi> who formerly had been inclining to the Christians and a favourer of them, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

In this Persecution the Bodies of some were cut in small pieces and thrown into the <hi>Sea,</hi> for to feed the <hi>Fish:</hi> And the flattering Presidents to gratify this <hi>Tyrant</hi> Tormented such as had done no Evil, even as if they had been Murtherers, but when the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> could bear his Wickedness no longer he made War with him and overcame him, then did this Persecution cease, by whose means also the Christians lived in External Peace and <note place="margin">Socra. 1. l. ch. 2.</note> Tranquillity, but after this Peace there ensued Wars and deadly hatred among the Christians themselves.</p>

Prejudice and Evil, surmizing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, how then did they begin to rend and tear one another, and that often about their <note place="margin">How evils crep in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note>

To demonstrate these things at large, would require. a greater Volum then I intend to make at this time, and particularly to prescribe them would ask more time then at present I have to spend about this matter, yet thus much I may avouch or boldly affirm, that in those days many evils crept in among Christians, which unto this day could not be totally excluded root and Branch; And about that very time when the Church was thought to Flourish most of all, did many hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Weeds and degenerat Plants took rooting, which have much more thriven and grown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Anti-Christians, then the Seed of the Kingdom, which Seed hath been so overgrown and overtopt, that, that little which yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of remains, is as hard to be found now in the <note place="margin">Luke 18. 8.</note> Children of Men, as Faith wili be to be found upon the Earth at the coming of the Son of Man.</p>

                        <p>IN the year 362 did the Twelfth Persecution arise under the Emperour <hi>Julianus</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state

                           <hi>(i. e.</hi> one that revolted from true Religion who had been accounted a Christian, but was an Hyprocritical dissembler, and counterfeated a <hi>Monkish</hi> life, who being sent into <hi>France</hi> by the Emperour to make War with the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and obtaining some notable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was afterwards Proclaimed <hi>Emperour</hi> by the Souldiers, and then did he set wide open the <hi>Temples and Idoll groves,</hi> and Sacrificed to Pictures and Intituled himself an <hi>High Priest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then the <hi>Pagans</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> stomaked the Christians, and that the more, because they went about to disclose unto the World the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans Pictures,</hi> to the end their fond <hi>Ceremonies</hi> might be derided of all Men: Whereupon they Boyled within themselves for Anger, and took what first came to their Hands, set upon them; <note place="margin">Socrat. l. 3 c. 2.</note> and Slew of them every kind of way, so that some were run through with <hi>Swords,</hi> some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Brained</hi> with <hi>Clubs,</hi> other some <hi>Stoned</hi> to Death, some <hi>Strangled</hi> with <hi>Haltors</hi> about their Necks; in the end (as commonly it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in such hurly-burlies) they held not their Hands from their dearest Friends (for one Brother sought the other Brothers.

                        <p>Moreover the Emperour <hi>Julianus</hi> gave out a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that such as would not renounce the Christian Faith mould Warfare no longer in the Emperours Palace, likewise that all should prepare themselves to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that no Christian should bear office in the common <note place="margin">thap. 11.</note>

                        <p>Afterwards he devised a certain slight to wring Money from the Christians, for he set a great fine upon the Heads of such as would not <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Tax</hi> was very grievous and duly demanded of the Christians; Then did the Heathen insult over the <hi>Christians,</hi> and the Governours of <hi>Provinces,</hi> suposing now that it was High Tyde for them under colour of the Emperours Religion to make up their Bagges, vexed the <hi>Christians</hi> far sorer then the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <note place="margin">chap. 12</note> Proclamation bore them out, demanded greater <hi>Tax</hi> then they were sessed at, and some time <hi>Tormented</hi> their Bodys.</p>
                        <p>The Emperour understanding of their doings winked at them, and answered the Christians, which complained unto him in this sort, it is <hi>your part when you have injuries offered unto you, to take the same patiently, for so your God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Emperour made a Law that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should not be trained up in prophane Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature <hi>(i. e.</hi> learning, or cunning, <hi>Grammer Writing)</hi> for (saith he) seeing they have the gift of utterance so readily, they shall easely be able to overthrow the quirks of <hi>Logick</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Gentills <hi>(i. e.

professing Christians, exceeded the common sort of Ignorat People in Hypocrisie and Craftiness, in Deceipt and Spiritual Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, so that the Sufferings of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have been very great under such, as they were, under this Emperour <hi>Iulianus,</hi> and as theirs are at this present; whose Sufferings are augmented oftentimes through the Covetousness and Cruelty of Inferiour Magistrates, whose Wickedness now is not only wincked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, but Tollerated and Countenanced by their Superiors: Hath not this been appearent <note place="margin">How the Wickedness of Officers was Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</note> enough at sundry times in <hi>Englland,</hi> where the chief Officers have been privy to the unjust and illegal proceedings of their under Officers, and yet they have passed it by, as if it had not been worthy of Reproof; in the mean time the Innocent, Harmless and true Christians they have suffered the spoyling of their Goods, and that because they would not <hi>Swear,</hi> nor <hi>Pay Tythes</hi> to an Hireling Priest, nor be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>National way of Worship for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake,</hi> no more then the antient Christians could Sacrifice, or Uphold the Worship of the Heathenish Gods, for the refusing of which they suffered as before mentioned, but it was indeed by and under the Heathen, who did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owne nor profess the Doctrine of Christ, like as the antient Christians doe, who in many things are found as much out of it, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were, and so consequently rather in the practise of the Heathen, then in his Doctrine, who said, <hi>Love your Enemies, Bless them that Curse you, do good to them that hate you, and</hi>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:41717:87"/>
                           <hi>Pray for them which Dispitefully use and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you.</hi> Math. 5. 44. But this Doctrine is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more regarded by some Anti-Christians, then by the Heathen themselves, whose manner was to uphold their Doctrine by quirks of Logick, even as the Priests do now, for when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">How the Priests help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Quirks of Logick.</note> uphold their Doctrine, and maintain their Religion by Spiritual Weapons, then will they betake themselves unto their quirks of Logick, and when they are Insufficient for them, then do they ordinarly make their addresses unto them in Authority, for to crave their help and assistance, but this was not the practise of the ancient Christians, neither is it the matter of the true Christians now, but the custom of the Anti-Christians, who are found in the practise of the Heathen.</p>
                        <p>I have read, how that when the <hi>Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> was Sommoned, which consisted of above three hundred Bishops, besides the Priests, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and others which were heard to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, the <hi>Logicians</hi> busied themselves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding against divers others certain pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Disputation, and when divers were there drawn to disptuation, and allured as it were by bait; a <hi>Lay-man</hi> (that is not one of the Clergy, who was of a <hi>simple and sincere mind,</hi> set himself against the Logitians, and told them <note place="margin">Socrat. li. 1. c. 5.</note> thus in plain words, <hi>That neither Christ nor his Apostles had delivered unto us the Art of Logick, neither vain Falacies</hi> (i. e. crafty devises) <hi>but an</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Christ nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles the Author of Logick.</note> 
                           <hi>open and plain mind to be preserved of us with Faith and good Works.</hi> Afterwards the Logitians quieted themselves and held with his Sentence, Logick.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41717:88"/>
                           <hi>Note.</hi> Thus we see that this Art of Logick (in which the Heathens were very expert, and by the quirks of which they upheld their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not approved of by all the ancient Christians, tho is begun to creep in amongst them when they Appostized, but by some it was testified against then, as it is now, by the true Christians, who are in the life and power of Godliness, which was before this Sophiestical and deceitful Art was, by the quirks of which, Persecutors have upheld their Doctrine, and by the quirks of it, Persecutors do uphold their Doctrine; but so did not Christ, nor his Apostles, nor the ancient suffering Christians, neither doth the true Christians now, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Light and Doctrine of their Lord and Master, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, blessed for ever more.</p>
                        <p>The Histories do relate, that in these twelve Persecutions which were against the Christian Church, the Blood of about five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand was shed; and that among all these that Suffered, there was not one that by Weapons revenged himself, but patience was their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and thereby did they conquer the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Emperours: <hi>Relig. Vryh. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Fol.</hi> 198.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note.</hi> Therefore such Christians now as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer patiently for Righteousnes sake, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting or revenging themselves by violence with carnal Weapons, are rather found in the Spirit and Practise of the ancient Christians, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful persecuting men, who are commonly called Christians, yet do not only do wrong to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41717:88"/>
their Brethren and Fellow Creatures, but are also found revenging themselves of the wrong done unto them by others, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostle, and contrary to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the ancient Christians, in which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practise the true Christians are found.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I very briefly run through these twelve remarkable Persecutions which were Sustained by the Antient Christians under the <hi>Heathen.</hi>

                     <p>Again there was a certain man called <hi>Moses,</hi> who led in the desert the <hi>Monastical</hi> (i. e. <hi>Solitry or Comfortless)</hi> trade of life, but for his Zeal, Faith and Godliness, and for the strange Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by him, he was Famous among all men: And a certain Queen called <hi>Mavia,</hi> required of the <hi>Romans</hi> this <hi>Moses</hi> to be her Bishop. <hi>Moses</hi> therefore was taken from the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and sent to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for <hi>Orders,</hi> and when <hi>Moses</hi> was come in the presence of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the Persecuting Bishow before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Socra. lib. 4. ch. 29.</note> he refused to receive <hi>Orders at his hands,</hi> reasoning with him in this sort: <hi>I think my self unworthy of the Priestly Order; yet if it be for the profit of the Common wealth that I be called unto the Function, truly thou</hi> Lucius <hi>shalt never</hi>

                     <p>In the year 1126 did <hi>Peter de Brusius</hi> teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Infants Babtizm, Transubstantiation, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead</hi> and such like things, which he Preached near upon twenty years, and finally because of this Doctrine, was he <hi>Burned:</hi> for <note place="margin">Bar. An. 1116. Num. 6.</note> then was the <hi>Pope</hi> begun to follow the Foot steps of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> in Persecuting men to death for their Religion, though it was not the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Apostles.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1139 did <hi>Arnaldus</hi> teach against <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Infants Babtism, Transubstantiation</hi> and other things, but the <hi>Pope Innocentus</hi> the Second, commanded him to be <hi>Silent,</hi> fearing least he should spread this Doctrine much; There was <note place="margin">Anno. 1148. Num. 11.</note> one <hi>Peter Abailardus</hi> of the same opinion: And to this opinion many of the <hi>Clergy</hi> were brought, insomuch that <hi>three Popes</hi> had enough to do, one after another, to reduce them to their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition:</hi> Afterwards this <hi>Abailardus</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and <hi>Burned</hi> to ashes in Rome.</p>
                     <p>Moreover there arose some who suffered themselves to be called <hi>Apostolical,</hi> because they said they walked in the footsteps of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: <hi>They rejected Infants Babtism, the Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, praying for the dead, and calling upon the Saines with other of the Romish Ceremonies, they also rejected the priests that led a Sinful Life;</hi> These were called <hi>Unlearned Blockish Clowns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1176, There was a People rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up in the province of <hi>Albi</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whose
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41717:91"/>
opinion was (as <hi>Baronius</hi> writes) <hi>That Infants Babtism was not necessary to Salvation; That an unworthy Sinful Priest, could not administer the Sacrament, that none should be Bishops except they were unreprovable, that men should build no Churches to the Honour of God, nor to the Honour of the Saints, and that it was unlawful to Swear, neither would they receive the Doctors Interprita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> These people (saith <hi>Baron)</hi> were taken into the protection of some <hi>Princes and Rulers,</hi> against whom the <hi>Pope</hi> made War because they <note place="margin">The Popes Cruelty.</note> would not Persecute them, and expel them out of their Country.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1178. The <hi>King of France</hi> and the <hi>King of England,</hi> observing how these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did daily increase; They concluded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther per <hi>force of Arms</hi> to expel them out of their <hi>Coasts;</hi> But changing their mind, they first la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to convert them by the <hi>Clergy:</hi> And to that end was there many <hi>Bishops</hi> and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men sent to convert these (whom they juged to be <hi>Heriticks)</hi> by their <hi>Sermons:</hi> but withal they sent several men with their <hi>Clergy:</hi> that in case they with their <hi>Sermons, reasons and Arguments could not overcome them,</hi> that then the other should fall upon them and drive them out. And when the Bishops with their <hi>Traine</hi> were come to the City <hi>Toulous,</hi> where the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid People were; They ingaged the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens by an <hi>Oath</hi> to discover them they knew to be of this People. And among the rest there was one <hi>Peter Moranus</hi> discovered, and being examined he made a confession of his Faith freely, and therefore was he presently condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41717:92"/>
for a <hi>Heritick,</hi> and all his goods were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiseated,</hi> with his sumpteous House in which he had holden <hi>Meetings,</hi> and part of it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished: But this Faithless <hi>Peter</hi> when he saw this <hi>Storm,</hi> begun to fear and begun to be sorrowful seemingly, and begged forgiveness; And it was granted him with this condition, that one <hi>Bishop</hi> with another man should whip him, he going naked and barefoot towards the Church, and that three <hi>years</hi> long he must go <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (which then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fashion among the Apostazed Christians) <note place="margin">

                     <p>Now others of the aforesaid people observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, begun somewhat to fear, and some seemed to <hi>recant,</hi> but when there was an <hi>Oath</hi> required of them, <hi>they refused to take it,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were rejected as <hi>Heriticks</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were Banished: And it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all the <hi>Catholicks</hi> should shun them; and that all <hi>Princes</hi> should expel them out of their <hi>Countrys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1199 the the aforesaid people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be dispersed in many Citys and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, and their Doctrine begun to spread ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly yea through the most part of <hi>Europe</hi> That the <hi>Popes with the assistance of the Princes and secular powers, had enough to do to root out the same,</hi> First they endeavoured by <hi>disputing</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Banishment,</hi> and lastly <hi>by all manner of Torturing, Burning Hanging and cruell Bloodsheding, so that the whole World seemed to be as in an uproar: And this was all about Religion.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I might here add, very much concerning the terrible and redious <hi>Persecution in Iermany,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Countrys,</hi> which begun in the year 1524. And continued untill the year 1641. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of which, the <hi>Emperour</hi> put forth a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> wherein it was contained, That all such as were found stained or polluted <note place="margin">A cruel Preelama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Emperours</hi>
                        </note> with the cursed Sect of Anabaptism (for so he called it) of what state or condition soever they were, their adhaerents and compliences, were to forfeit both their Lives and Estates, and were to be brought to the utmost punishment without any delay, especially those that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued constant, and that had Baptized any, likewise they that had the name of Prophets, Apostles, or Bishops, they were to be Burned: And all other sorts of people that were baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or had entertained any of the aforesaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, though they renounced that oppinion and were truly sorry for what they had done, yet were they to be drowned: And for the better manifesting of the <hi>Wederdoopers</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour expressly commanded all his Subjects, that they manifested the same to the Officer, of the place where they lived, or where they were found: And if any knew of them, and did not manifest the same to the Officer, or Officers of the place, such were to be punished, as Favourers <hi>of,</hi> complyers, <hi>with,</hi> and adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>to</hi> the aforesaid <hi>Sect:</hi> And such as did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41717:93"/>
the same, were to have the third part of the partys confiscated goods.</p>
                     <p>Moreover he forbad all his Subjects, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require or further any mercy, favour or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givness, for the aforesaid <hi>Wederdoopers,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists,</hi> or to occasion request, or shew any petition on their behalf in pain of being arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily punished; Forasmuch as he would not allow that any of the aforesaid people (because of their Wicked oppinion as he called it) should be received into mercy or favour, but they should be severly punished, to be made examples to the rest, without any dissimulation, favour or delay. This was given out at <hi>Brussel</hi> and Printed the 10 day of <hi>Iuly</hi> (so called) <hi>Anno</hi> 1535.</p>

                     <p>As for the <hi>Arminians,</hi> they were accused for bringing in Atheism, (i. e. <hi>the damnable Opinion of the Atheists)</hi> for being Hereticks; yea, more hurtful and more dangerous than the <hi>Arrians, Macedonians,</hi> and other Sects, and it was said of them, that they Damned themselves before God; with all that heard them.</p>
                     <p>And upon a certain time, when the Priests were met together at <hi>Harlem,</hi> they desired (for the Defence of their <hi>Religion,</hi> that the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> against the <hi>Arminians</hi> might be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, published, and put in execution. Thus the Priests manifested the same evil Spirit of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to be in their Hearts, which was in the Papists, whom they pretended to renounce in Words, yet they retained their envious Spirit, which could bear others no more that differed from them, than the <hi>Papists</hi> could bear them.</p>
                     <p>The Histories do shew how that after the <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> had been about ten Years, <note place="margin">Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> then did they put forth a <hi>Proclamation</hi> against the <hi>Wederdoopers,</hi> (i. e. <hi>such as were Baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or</hi> Anabaptists <hi>as they are commonly called in</hi> England) wherein they commanded all the Inhabitants of the Land, to discover unto their Officers the <hi>Wederdoopers,</hi> to prevent their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying, (it is said) they were determined to put them to Death, with their adhaerents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Laws, <hi>&amp;c, Merck-teyck, pag.</hi> 154.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears from what I have here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instanced, that the Protestants so well as the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41717:97"/>
Papists, have been out of the right way, and that they have run in the way of the persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iews,</hi> persecuting <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and persecuting <hi>Arrians,</hi> who are said to be the first that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted under the Name of <hi>Christians;</hi> but since many <hi>Sects</hi> have followed their pernicious ways, rather than the practise of the ancient Christians, who stretch'd not forth a Hand in their own Defence (as it is said) when they were persecuted, but both <hi>Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> (otherwise <hi>Presbyterians) Arminians, Independants,</hi> and many of the <hi>Wederdoopers</hi> have shewed themselves to be of another Spirit since they degenerated from that Glory and Power; Love and Life, Meekness and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, Patience and Purity, which abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the ancient Christians in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, unto which the Eternal God hath again restored a Remnant, who at this time suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as the manner of their Fellow Citizens hath been who are gone before. And such as are now found in the Life and Power of the Truth, they are at this Day judged by <hi>Papists,</hi> by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> by <hi>Arminians,</hi> by <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants</hi> and <hi>Paptists,</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and others were, when they renounced <hi>Popery:</hi> And the Sects now, that are among the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> are as apt to hate and cast out their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from among them, when they come to walk in a more excellent way than the rest of their Sect, as the <hi>Papists</hi> were, to persecute them that renounced Popery; therefore are the <hi>Protestants</hi> so well degenerated as the <hi>Papists;</hi> witness their daily Practises.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>The <hi>Meletians</hi> assembled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they laid down the Macedonians opinion of the Son of God, jump between the <hi>Arians</hi> and the true Christians, where they proved themselves Neuters <hi>i. e. an indiferent party, not on the one side, nor the other.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 368.

                  </p>
                  <p>A Counsel was called at <hi>Illytini</hi> where the truth in the Blessed <hi>Trinity (i. e. three joyned in one)</hi> was confessed.</p>
                  <p>A Counsel held at <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>France</hi> decreed <hi>Priests</hi> should not marry.</p>
                  <p>The first Counsel held at <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> decreed that <hi>Priests</hi> should marry.</p>

                     <hi>Therefore one of those Counsels have erred, though the Papists say they could not erre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a Councel held at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where <hi>Chrysotom</hi> was condemned: of spite, and for no other crime.</p>
                  <p>A Counsel was called at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where through the spite of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Origen</hi> were condemned.</p>

The third Counsel held at <hi>Carthage</hi> decreed; that the Cletgy in their yeirs of discretion should either marry or vow chastity; and that the chief Bishop should not be called <hi>Prince</hi> of the priests or highest prles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  <p>
                     <q>If the Counsel erred not in decreeing this decree, the Popes have erred since, who have been called the Prince of all the world, and hath been said to have the place of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting King upon earth, unto whom all power in Heaven and earth was given, and whom all nations should serve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore may the Pope through arrogancy err, so well as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which have erred; so that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that both Popes and Counsels (which are erred from the spirit) are fallible and have erred, as doth and may more fully appear.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 417. A Counsel held at <hi>Hippo</hi> decreed that Bishops and priests should look well to their Children, that the Head Bishop of the Head <hi>See</hi> should not be called the chief priest, and that no Scripture should be read in the Church but Canonical <hi>(i. e. approved by exact Rule.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Counsel held at <hi>Taurinum</hi> was held for the reformation of the Clergy, which then was corrupted; <hi>but since much more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Counsel of <hi>Matta</hi> condemned the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> and concluded that Infants were to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>The Counsel of <hi>Agatha</hi> decreed that none should be made priest before he was 30 years old; And that the Clergy should wear such
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41717:100"/>
attire as became their profession, with many other Constitutions.</p>
                  <p>The first and second Counsel held at <hi>Vasio</hi> decreed that in such Churches, where Preachers were not, Deacons should read Homelies <hi>(i. e. Sermons or Speeches.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Counsel held at <hi>Carpentoracte</hi> decreed, that the Bishops should not poul the Parishes <hi>(that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <q>It would be good that every Bishop now in being, observed well this decree, and kept clear of pouling their parishioners by extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deceit, which many of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been guilty of, and it is expected now by many, that they who have of late been installed will in this particular follow their example, rather then the Apostles, who covered no man's Bishoprick, nor Benefice, no man's Tithe nor Augmentations, no man's Gold, Silver nor Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And hear we may justly reflect upon the wise and admirable method of divine providence, which in planting and propagating the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in the world, made choice of such mean and unlikely instruments, that he should hid these things from the wise and prudent, and reveal them unto Babes; Men that had not been Educated at the <hi>Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the Schools of Learning, but brought up to a Trade to catch Fish, and mend Nets; most of the Apostles being taken from the meanest Trades, and all of them <hi>(Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) unfurnished of all Arts of Learning, and the advantage of liberal and ingenious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and yet these were the Men that were design'd to rund down the world, and to overturn the Learning of the Prudent; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had humane wisdom been to manage the business, it would have taken quit other Measures, and chosen out the profoundest Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, the accutest Philosophers, the smoothest Oratours, such as would have been most likly, by strength of Reason, and Arts of Rhetorick, to have triumphed over the Minds of Men, to Graple with the stubbornness of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and baffle the the finer Notion and Speculation of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but it being otherways, it is plainly evident, that they taught Christianity by a Divine Power, the sum of the discourse is in the Apostles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. 28. that God chose the foolish things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wise, the weak to confound those that are mighty.</p>

In the Enumeration of the Apostles, all the Evangelist constantly place <hi>Peter</hi> in the front, and <hi>Matthew</hi> expressly tells us, that he was the first, that is, he was the first Called to be an Apostle; his Age also, and the gravity of his person, more particularly qualifying him for a Primar of Order amongst the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:</p>
                     <p>Yea, our Lord chose him, to be his more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Companion, whom he admitted more familiarly than the rest, in all the most secrets, passages, and transactions of his Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> Preached such a Sermon in the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the effect of which was so strange and wonderful, there being that day added to the Church no less then Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souls, a quit and plentiful Harvest; and though the Converting so vast a multitude, might justly Challenge a place amongst the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Miracles; yet the Apostles began now more particulars, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1, to exercise their Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> going up to the Temple, about the hour of prayer, they found a poor impotent Criple, who, though above forty years old, had been lame from his birth, lying at the beautiful Gate of the Temple, and asking an Alms of them, <hi>Peter</hi> carelessly looking on him, told him he had no mony to give him, but that he would give him, that which was much better, restore him to his health, and lifting him up by the hand, commanded him in the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to rise up and walk, the word was no sooner said than the thing was done; while <hi>Peter</hi> was this working

                     <p>Whilest the Apostles were thus Preaching, the Priests and Saduces who hated Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, intimated to the Magistrates the danger thereof, seized on the Apostles, and cast them into Prison, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 1. the next day they were brought before the Jewish Sanhedrims, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by what power and authority they had done this, <hi>Peter</hi> resolutely answered, in the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom they themselves had Crucified, and God had raised from the dead, and made head of the Corner, and that there was no other way to expect Salvation but by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Great was the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Apostles, admired at by the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim it self, especially when this was the very Court, that had so lately Sentenced and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their Master; the Council commanded them to Preach no more in the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> replied, that they could by no means yeild Obedience thereunto, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themselves, whether it was not more fit that they should obey God rather than them, and that they could not but testifie what they had seen and heard: The Church excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly multplied by these means, and that so great a company (most whereof were poor) might be maitained; they generally sold their Estates, and brought their mony to the Apostles to be by them disposed in one common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,

and thence distributed, according to the several exigent of the Church, which gave occasion to the dreadful instance, <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Saphire,</hi> having taken upon them the profession of the Gospel, according to the free and generous Spirit of those times, and had Consecrated and Devoted their Estates, to the honour of God, and the necessity of the Church, and accordingly sold their possessions and turn'd them into mony, but as they were willing to gain the reputation of Charitable Persons, so were they loth wholy to cast themselves upon the Divine Providence, by letting go all at once, and therefore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with-held part of what they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and bringing the rest, laid it all at the Apostles feet, hoping thereby they might a deceived the Apostles, though immediately gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the spirit of God; <hi>Peter</hi> at his first coming in, treated <hi>Ananias,</hi> with these sharp inquiries;</p>
                     <p>Why he should suffer Satan to fill his heart with so big a wickedness, as by keeping back his Estate, to think to dceive the holy Ghost, that before it was sold, it were holy at his one disposing, and after, it was perfectly in his own power, fully to have performed his Vow, so that it was capable of no other interpretation, then that herein he had not only abused and injured Men, but mocked God, and what in him lay, lyed too, and cheated the holy Ghost, who they knew was privy to the most secret thoughts and proposes of his heart: This was no sooner said, but suddenly to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

and cast them into Prison, but God who is never wanting to his one cause, sent that night an Angel, from Heaven to open the Prison doors, commanding them to Repair to the Temple, and exercise their Ministery, which they did early in the morning, and there taught the People, how unsuccessful are the projects of the wisest States-men, when God frowns upon them, how little do any Councils against heaven prosper, in vain is it to shut the doors, where God is resolved to open them, the firmest bars, the strongest chains cannot hold, when once God has designed and decreed our Liberty; the Officer returning the next morning, acquainted the Council, who much wondered at it, sent for them, and asked them how they durst propagate that Doctrine, they had so strictly commanded them not to Preach, <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the rest, told them, that they must in this case obey God rather than Men, so vexed was the the council with his answer, that they began to cosider how to cut them off, but <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a grave and learned Senatour prevented it by commanding the Apostles to withdraw, and then bid the Council take heed what they did, putting them in mind that several <hi>Persi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

None wanted paternal Care, while so many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers studied to do good, and men were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to Give, than others were to Ask, and seemed to be sorrowful if they had not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon which they might exercise a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Charity.</p>
                  <p>There was hardly a Widow among them, that complained of Solitariness, or sought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a second Husband, and second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was counted little better than Adultery. Their Widows were the same, that they were whil'st their Husbands lived; and finding that upon their Husband's death, they were become Sisters of many Brethren, they aimed at no other Contract, but that with Christ, who, if they were found worthy, would, as they thought, marry them at last to the Service of the Church, where they might exercise that Material Care to the Poor and Needy, which formerly they used to express to their own Children. Here you should see none Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,

This present Life was the least thing they minded, while that to come, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed their Thoughts and Considerations. They were so entirely Christians, that in a manner they were nothing else, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for being any thing else, lest if they should be something else, they should be suspected of deviating from their Master's footsteps.</p>
                  <p>Hence it was, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> accused them of Unrighteousness, and Unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as if they were dead Weights in the World, contributing nothing to the welfare and prosperity of Manking, and as if they stood for Cyphers in Humane Societies, though none were more ready to communicate of the Profit of their Labours to others than they, and did therefore on purpose keep close to their Calling and Profession, that they might be able to relieve the Needy. And though they were loath to take upon them the Employment of Magistrates and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, lest the Empero's and God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands should clash, and they lye under a temptation of obeying Man more than God; yet, when-ever they were thought worthy to bear Office in the Church, they readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Charge, that they might be in a

greater capacity to improve the Talents God had given them, to his Glory, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's good, and were pleased with the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Office, that the World might see they had no design of Gain, or Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Administration.</p>
                  <p>They spake little, but their Thoughts were always Great and Heavenly: and as they look'd upon sublunary Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, as too mean for their lofty Minds to rest on, so their care was to keep the Eyes of their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fix'd on that World, which fades not away.</p>
                  <p>Their Communications or Answers in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discouries were Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay. An Oath they shunn'd as much as Perjury, and a Lye among them was more rare, than a Sea-monster is to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a Continent; for they said, that in their Baptism they were signed with the Mark of Truth, and that they could not be Servants of the God of Truth, if they should yield but to the least appearance of Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p>In the Cities and Towns where they lived, none was unknown to the other; for they Pray'd together, heard the Word together, met frequently at Meals together, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually helpful one to the other; In-so-much that where-ever they met, they knew one another; and when they durst not with their Lips, yet with their Eyes and Gestures, they would salute one another, send Kisses of Peace one to another, rejoyce in the common Hope,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41717:127"/>
and if permitted, assist one another in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities. This is one of us, saith such a Saint, for we have seen him in our Oratories, we have Prey'd with him, we have been at the Lord's Table together, we have heard the Scriptures read together, we have kneeled together, we have been instructed together. O happy Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred! which comes by Prayer, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body and Blood of <hi>JESUS!</hi> O Blessed Relations! where Men are not called Brothers of the Sun or of the Stars, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tyrants styled themselves, but Brethren of CHRIST, Children of GOD, and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Heaven!</p>
                  <p>When a Christian, who was a Stranger, came to them, before ever he shew'd his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias. they knew him by his lean Visage, and meager Face, which his frequent Fasting had brought him to, by the Modesty of his Eyes, by the Gravity of his Speech, by his Gate, and Habit, and mortified Behaviour, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Divine did shine through their looks, and one might read the Characters of the Spirit in their Countenance. Nor is it very strange, that a good Man should be known by his Carriage, for to this day, a serious Person, though he says nothing, something in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, and Features, and Postures, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the inward Zeal, and Sincerity of his Soul; and his Deportment will discover, there is something more than ordinary in him, as much as the <hi>Roman Senator</hi> was betray'd by the Perfumes about him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41717:128"/>
Whenever they were thrust: into the Croud of Malefactors, there Fellow-Christians soon gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed who they were; for they hastned with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to their Martyrdom, and without expressing any impatience, or indignation, submitted their Necks to the stroak of the Axe, prepared for them. They used to look frequently up to Heaven, and one might by their smiles see that between God and them there was more than ordinary Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. Sometimes they would provoke the Executioners to begin their Tortures, and be earnest with the Hangman, not to delay their Agonnies. Sometimes they would laugh at the Pain they suffer'd, and in the very jaws of Death betray a taste of Immortality. They looked upon Christianity, as a Religion, that taught them to suffer valiantly; and to them it was no other but a Science, to instruct Men to dispise Riches, Honours, and Torments too, in order to Everlasting Glory.</p>
                  <p>Their Presidents, and Pastors, were known by no other Character, but that of Officious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Charity, nor had their Shepherds any other mark to be distinguish'd by, but their willingness to advance the good of the Sheep, and their readiness unto every good Word and Work. And indeed so were the Christians in general known by their mutual Love, and kind Offices.</p>
                  <p>If any fell sick, the rest did chearfully run to comfort him; and this Employment their Women were chiefly ambitious of, who seldom stirred out of their own Houses, but upon such occasions, and when they resorted to their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41717:128"/>
Oratories. They were seen but rarely in the Streets, except such charitable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments called them forth; for none denied her Neighbour her care, nor could any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rspects discharge them from that Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
                  <p>If any were Rich, or Noble, they were the readier to express their compassion, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the highest Descent were the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to assist the Calamitous in their need; for Religion had mortifi'd in them all Punctilio's of Honour and State, and made them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in Christ they were all equal. She in whose Veins the Noblest Blood did run, would say of her poor distressed Nighbour, she is my Sister, my Fellow-member, one that hath part with me in my Dear Redemer. If she be antient, she is my Mother, said she, if younger, she is my Daughter; nor were these expressions names of course only, but they were written in their hearts, and their Lips spoke what their Minds believed, and these words were at once pronounced, and thought. Hence it was, that the greatest Ladies touch'd their poorer Neighbours Sores, bound up their Wounds, applied Plaisters to them, made their Beds and tended them, as the meanest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Here you might see the industry of one, there the sweetness and patience of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; one would turn the sick Sister, the other help her up, the third dress her, the fourth feed her, and in all this, the sick Creature saw, as it were, the Face of the Lord <hi>JESUS.</hi> She that tended the Sick, look'd upon Christ
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41717:129"/>
in her that was sick, and she that was sick, thought she saw Christ, in the person that tended her. So Divine, so heavenly were their Works of Mercy, that one was to the other in God's stead, and that saying of <hi>Christ, What you haue done unto the least of these my Brethren, you have done it unto me,</hi> did not depart from their Memories. Thus stood the case with the Holy Women then, and this advantage they reapt by their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table care, that when their Husbands died, they were taken as Deaconnesses into the Church, and thus they prepared themselves for Christ, and the Church's Service.</p>
                  <p>If any were imprisoned upon the account of Religion, all that knew them would fly to them. No Keeper so hard-hearted, but they would find out a way to smooth him; no Lock, no Bar so strong, but they would make a shift to break it, either by their Gifts, or their soft Answers, not to make the Jaylers false to their Trusts, but to get an oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to see their Suffering Friends; and when they saw them, one would kiss their Chains, and Fetters, another lay his Lips to their Wounds, a third give their bruised Members and tired Bodies such refreshment as was needful.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41717:129"/>

                  <p>Were any of them sent through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Heathen Governors to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection-house, or forced to labour hard in Caves and Dens, or lamentably scourg'd, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and abused for the name of the Lord <hi>JESUS.</hi> The rest that heard of it, would not complain, nor think their Brethren un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, but rather count themselves so, because they were not counted worthy to suffer for the Name of <hi>JESUS,</hi> and therefore would wish that this might be their Lot and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too.</p>
                  <p>If the fury of Tyrants abated, or remitted at any time, and the imprison'd and afflicted Believers got leave to return home again, some wounded, some bruised, some with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted Bones, some half Burnt, some Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some with one Arm, some with one Eye, some with one Leg only; their Friends would run out to them, and strive, who should first receive them into their Houses. Happy the man that could kifs their Wounds. and refresh them with Necessaries and Conveniences; and the longer any Man could harbour such a

Christian at his House. the happier he thought himself to be. And such Men as had thus suffer'd for Christ, they honour'd for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and esteem'd them equal with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Presidents. Indeed out of these, they chose their Bishops, thinking those fittest to serve at <hi>Christ</hi>'s Altar who had already made themselves a Sacrifice for him. Thus Men purchased the degree of Pastours by their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and their eminent Sanctity, which pressed even through Wounds and Tortures for the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> prepared them for that Function. Men that were strong to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, they justly thought might be fittest to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour in God's Church, and they that had been such Champions for the truth, they looked upon as the properest Instruments to defend it to their death.</p>
                  <p>Nor did their kindness extend only to their Friends, but reacht even to their greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and they that jush before were perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by them, if their Persecutors fell fick, or were afflicted, or the Plague of God came upon them, these injured Christians would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Services, support them, comfort them, admonish them, attend at their Beds side, and Lend them their helping-hand, cherish them, supple their Sores, relieve them, and with a pity great and magnanimous, weep over their calamitious Estate to the amazement of the Pagan World, who were now ready to look upon them as Angels, when but just before they thought them as bad as Devils.</p>

Poverty was the least thing that troubled them; nor did Want sit so heavy on their Souls, as it doth on ours, for they had learned to undervalue Riches; and that which made them slight it, were these two impressions the Apostles Doctrine had made on their Souls</p>
                  <p>This sunk deep into their Hearts, that here we have no Continuing City, but we seek one to come. That all we see here, is but shadow, and imagery, but the substance is not yet Visible; that the fashions of this World will pass away, and the Gaudes and Glories below the Moon afford no real satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This made it ridiculous in their eyes, to snatch at a Butterfly or a Flying Feather; and they rationally believe, that what-ever is subject to time, and change, will certainly make it self Wings, and flee away, and leave the Soul as empty as it found it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Thoughts must be turned another way, even there where constant satisfaction, lasting content, permanent happiness, perfect beauty, and uninterrupted joys are to be found; and indeed, this duly weigh'd, will breed a mighty contempt of Temporal things, and a certain expectation of future Bliss.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the care of their Children fill their Hearts with anexious Thoughts, for they were sensible, that when-ever the Church had notice of their want, they would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be relieved, and looked after; for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fathers and Mothers left their Estates, and what they had to the Church, so the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41717:131"/>
Church imploy'd those Legacies, or Gifts, to support all those that should be necessitous. Besides this, their Pastors both by their Doctrine and Example admonish'd them to be diligent in working with their own hands, that they might get something not only to be beneficial to themselves, but to others too, and indeed they thought they did little or nothing, if of what they got, they did not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eate to those, who were not able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>They had nothing that was superfluous and hence it was, that there was but little striving about what they left. To lay up much Goods for many years, they thought was fitter for Heathens that for Christians; and having seen no such thing in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, they could not tell, how it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his Servants.</p>
                  <p>Love of Mony, and admiration of Riches, and anxious worldly Cares and Desires of Hoarding, were things they had an antipathy against; and though out of that Stock they provided themselves with Necessaries, yet for engrossing any thing to themselves, besides, was a thought as far from their Minds, as the Heaven they longed for was from that Earth, on which they trampled, and looked upon with pity and scorn? for, alas! what greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness could there be in them after Temporal Means, who were already greater than the World could make them, and took delight in nothing, but surveying that Glory, which ere long they should rejoyce, and triumph in?</p>

If any were so Malicious as to traduce their Teachers, and brand them with the guilt of Covetousness, or Slander them, their Pastors used no other Weapon to put by the Sting, but Meekness to the Back-biter, and their own innocence by degrees dashed, and wiped away all aspersions, Hence the Christians gave them their own freely, for they believed they could lose nothing by it, and long experience had so confirm'd that belief, that Envy it self could make no impressions upon them to the contrary; when it was in their hands, they thought it was safer than in their own; and being hereby freed from abundance of Cares, and Incumbrances, they pressed more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the promised Mark.</p>
                  <p>If any Christian kept any land in his hands, his care was so to use his Income, as to give God the First Fruits of it, to bring his Gift to the Church, to lay by somewhat for Alms, to help and assist the Sick, and to relieve the Prisoners and Captives, not only such as were within the verge of the Town he liv'd in, but others also. Thus did those men live under Riches, as under Thorns, and were sensible of nothing so much as this, that great Wealth is but a great temptation to be Vain, and Sensual, which made them use this Self-denial in their Incomes.</p>
                  <p>He that for a kindness, he did to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, expected a Recompence, was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Person greedy of filthy Lucre; and he that could do nothing for his friend, without a Reward, or prospect of some Profit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41717:132"/>
was censured as a Person ignorant of the Fundamental Law of their Religion. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, Interest, and such names, were scarce heard of among them; and Oppression was a thing, which they thought none that named the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> could be guilty of. In a word, they desired nothing so much in this world as to be quickly gone from it, and they thought it the joyfullest news imaginable to understand, that they were to be dissolved, and to go to <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the Temper Nature, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of that Commonwealth. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it look'd mean, and contemptible. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about them was pompous, either in Cloaths, or Dyet, or Habitation, or Houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff. Such among them, as were Noble or Learned, or of a gentile Extract laid aside their Pride, and all their swelling Titles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that they were better Born, or Educated than others, and became like their Brethren. Plaiting and Curling the Hair was a thing that both their Men and Women proscribed from their care, and they thought that labour lost, which was employ'd on such Superfluities. They were jealous of their serious frame of Spirit, and therefore all such Dresses, as might serve to infuse Vanity into their Minds, or damp their Zeal to Religion, they shunn'd, as they did Houses infected with the Plague. They minded no such thing as Modes and Fashion, nor did any new Habit, or Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that came up, entice them to imitation. Decency was their Rule, and Modesty the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41717:132"/>
Standard of their Habit, and Conversation. They wore nothing about them that was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Costly or Curious, and there greatest study and contrivance was, how to advance their Souls, and make them fit for the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Lamb; Laying on either White or Red upon the Face, or disfiguring it with something black, and of Kin to Hell, they knew not what it meant. Their Garments were either Linnen or Woollen, or Furr, or Sheeps-skin, and their Furniture Mean and Homely.</p>
                  <p>Without God, they attempted nothing; and whatever Enterprize it was, they betook themselves to, they sanctified it by Prayer, and Suplication. If they went out either to Sow, or to Plough, or to Reap, or to Build, God's Blessing was first sought, and begg'd, and they never put on their Cloaths, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained themselves all the while with some holy reflections. Theaters and seeing of Plays they hated, as a thing contrary to their Profession; and though the Heathen despised them for it, look'd upon them as unsociable, Men of pitiful Spirits, Strangers to the Art of Conversation, Melancholy Wretches, Brethren of Worms, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Vermin of the Earth; yet they mattered not their Censures, and triumph'd more in a good Conscience, than the other could do in all the Vanities and Glories of this present World. The Worlds Contempt, was their Glory, and they were proud of being Scorn'd and Undervalued by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41717:133"/>
Crowd, that they might with greater ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness long after a better Inheritance. If any wanted business, he would find some; and they that had no need to work for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, work'd for the Poor. Idleness they had an aversion from, as from the root of Evil, and great Men and Women would do something, which the Needy might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for. The greatest Lady would not disdain to Spin, or Sow, or Knit for her distressed Neighbour, and like Bees, they were ever busie, and employed for the common Good.</p>
                  <p>Love of the World was death to them; and they thought it a certain sign, that they had no Portion in <hi>Christ</hi> if they did serve both God and Mammon. To be in the World, and not of the World, was their <hi>Motto;</hi> and to be other Men, than they seemed to be, was the thing they chiefly aimed at. They seemed to be profane, because they would worship no Heathen Gods, but were the devoutest persons in the World to the true God; and they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to be Men, that they might be the better Christians. Not a few left their high Places, and great Dignities to become Christians, and chose to be low, and contemptible in the World, that they might have no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Servants never concern'd themselves to get their Freedom, for their Masters were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and themselves were so; both cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged their Duties one to another, and consequently lived in perfect Peacé, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Many Servants, that might have had their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41717:133"/>
Freedom, would not, because they lived suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently happy under their Believing Masters; and while they saw nothing but Love in their Masters, their very Bondage was perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>If one Wept, his Neighbour did Weep with him; If one Mourned, his Neighbour Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, as if both had committed the same Sin; In a word, they had their Joys and Sorrows common, and they might be said to be all in one, and one in all: In their Meals they were temperate.</p>
                  <p>Their Houses were open to Strangers, as well as to their Friends and Neighbours; and where the Traveller could produce a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that he was a practical Christian, he could not fail of a most hearty Welcome. Hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was their Badge, and he that would not receive a Brother into his House, because Poor, and Ragged, was either forbid the Church, or not suffer'd to come into it.</p>
                  <p>And though they never had studied <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> yet both their Faith and Reason told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In their Lives, Chast and Modest; in their Married estate, Moderate and Holy; and not a Man came near his Wife, after he perceived, or had notice that she was with Child, till she was deliver'd; and even then when they came together, their Thoughts were so innocent, that they proposed no other end but Procreation of Children to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord. In the very Works of their Calling, they would sing of <hi>Christ,</hi> and make Spiritual Objects so familiar to them, that in their very Sleep and Dreams, they rolled in their Imagination; They were always ready for prayer, and holy Ejaculations; and so addicted to the love of Goodness, that they could not endure a vitious Person; and if they met with any such in their Assemblies, did thrust him out of their Communion, and made it Criminal for any Christian either to Eat, or Drink, or Converse, or Talk, or keep Company with him.</p>
                  <p>Of their Teachers they were so observant, that without them they would begin nothing, and go no-where without their Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation. Without their advice, they would not marry, nor do any thing consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their civil affairs without asking their counsel and approbation, for they looked upon them as their Fathers, and as Religion had made them so, so they thought the obligation to consult them upon all occasions was the stronger.</p>

And when they were beaten, would not beat again; when reviled, would not revile again; and when abused, would not abuse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, nay look upon an unjust Calumny as a piece of Martyrdom, and therefore bear it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly.</p>
                  <p>Their meeting or coming together to Pray, they esteem'd a thing so Sacred, that no Frowns, no Thunders, no Threatnings of Tyrants could make them forbear it; andbeing conscious of their innocence, they justly thought, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might bytheir Authority forbid, but could not with any colour of Reason prohibit their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies. This made them flock to their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, though it was death to go; and Parants with their Children would run, though the next news, they were like to hear was <hi>Christianos ad Leones, Throw those Dogs to the Lions.</hi> Though they were thrust into Mines, and Prisons, yet they would find opportunities to Pray.</p>
                  <p>Some travelled into far Countries, Preach'd the Gospel, and when they had laid a good Foundation there, went farther, and spent their Lives in Pains and Labours, and doing good.</p>
                  <p>With this kind of Life, the first Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed the unbelieving World, and their Power and Number quickly grew so formidable, that the Emperours themselves began to be startled at their progress, and therefore employ'd their Might and Greatness to oppose it. To crush their towering Piety, the Heathens shewed them Racks, Flames, Gibbets, Grid-irons, Cauldrons, boyling Oyl, Lions, Bears, Wild Bulls, and set

before them the Worldly Prudence of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, but by the Grace and Assistance of that <hi>IESUS,</hi> who strengthned them, they were more undaunted at their Torments, than their Hangmen, did fight with Lions, and smile, and were more daring than the Flames they suffer'd in, firmer than the Racks, that broke their Bones, and by their practises surmounted all the great Acts that were ever done by Hero's, and the most famous Conquerours. They overcame Death by a desire of Death, and were more willing to die, than their Executioners to suffer them. Their Blood proved the Seed of the Church, and the more they Massacred, the more their numbers grew, till at last the Emperors themselves became Christians, and were forced to yield to the Faith, and Patience of <hi>IESUS,</hi> and the Christians at last gave Law to those, who at first did Stab, and Murder them, and Conquer'd them in the end, who in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Butcher'd them like Dogs, and such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Animals.</p>
