         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. And therefore he cannot transfer his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer to any other.</p>
                     <p>Touching his Duty, it consisteth in these three. <note place="margin">Duety.</note>

                     <p>Whereunto if there were added, in their due places, the residue of the Rules and Grounds which may be collected out of the bookes of the Law concerning the same, and furnishing both these and them with as many Cases as might be applyed thereunto; the same Cases being put at large vnder euery of their Rules, to demonstrate that in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, which the Rule includeth in generall, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise would proue (as I thinke) some shew of a Treatise, concerning this Title.</p>
                     <p>Which being no hard thing to accomplish, thereby would appeare that it were neither vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible neither vnprofitable, nor altogether vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, to reduce euery title of the Law particularly to a Methode; and so consequently, the whole body thereof into a perfect shape, which now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wholly without Conformitie, and altogether dismembred.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore now, as touching the Materiall Cause of Rules and Grounds, thus much said, may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

                     <p>THe diuisions of Grounds of the Law, as touching and concerning the forme, are in sorte to be Considered. 1. First, the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the words and the Matter. 2. Secondly, the manner of the Manifestation thereof.</p>
                     <p>For the Coherence of the Matter and wordes, there are to be regarded these two qualities.</p>

                     <p>Veritie of Propositions or Grounds consisteth of two sorts: For they import either a necessarie or knowne truth which cannot be impugned: Or Contingent Veritie or Probabilitie, which may sometimes notwithstanding their shew of truth, be impeached of falsehood, and so be subiect vnto many exceptions:</p>
                     <p>The former of these are called Primarie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of Reason. And the later Secondarie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

2 Secondary Principles, are certaine Axiomes, Rules, and Grounds of the Law, which are not so well knowne by the light of nature, as by other meanes: and which although they neede no great proofe to be confirmed; because they comprehend great probabilitie; yet many times are they, at the first shew, not yeelded vnto without due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and are peculiarly knowne, for the most part, to such onely as professe the study and speculation of Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Probable they are said to bee, because, although <note place="margin">Probabilia sunt qua probant, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus, aut plurimis aut cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te sapientibus atque ijs vel om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus vel pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis vel ijs quo rum spectata est &amp; perspecta sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia.</note> the manifest truth of them be vnknowne, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they appeare to many, and especially to wise men, to be true.</p>

Entendment of Law, of which sort some are such as doe admit of no proofe to encounter them, and rest vpon Entendment, but yetadmit proofe to the contrary. Or discourse ofreason.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And hereupon the Law presumeth that eucry assertion and allegation proceeding from any person which soundeth to his preiudice and hurt, is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, as that there shall not be suffered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trauers or deniall of the same. Wherefore if in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> brought of twenty acres of land against one, and he, before the Stature of <hi>Coniunction feoffatis,</hi> had pleaded Ioyntenancy with another of deede; or sithence the said Statute, if he had pleaded Ioyntenancy by Fine with another; although the Piea be vtterly false, yet shall not the demaundant haue any answere or trauers thereunto; because that when the demaundant by his Writ hath admitted him Tenant of the whole; and hee saith that hee was Ioyntenant with another; this other, if he bee false, may stop the Tenant by this Record; To say the contrary of his affirmation, and thereby may gaine the Moytie of the land, against him that hath so pleaded. And therefore, for that, that men are not wont to tell vntruths in disaduantage of themselues; and that the saying hereof if it were not true, will greatly be to the preiudice and hurt of him that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it; thereupon the Law presumeth, that it was

true indeed; and will in no wise admit the trauers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same, or giue the demaundant abilitie to impugne it; but hereupon presently, the Writ shall abate, and no maintenance of the Writ for the cause aforesaid, shall be allowed.</p>
                     <p>In like manner also matters of Record the entend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law doth giue an impeachable credit. And hereof also this rule of Law is drawne.</p>

And thereupon a writ iussued to the Sheriffe of that Countie, where the said goods were supposed to be, to seaze the same to the vse of the King, who returned that a Nobleman had seized the same goods; And thereupon issued forth another Writt out of the Exchequour, to cause him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the same goods so seized by him, who vpon the Returne of the second writ, alleadged, that the partie whose goods he had seized, was not vtlawed: And <hi>Greene,</hi> one of the Iustices of the Kings bench came into the Exchequer with the person who was supposed out lawed, and there testified that he was not out-lawed; but shewed, that that which was certified was done altogether by the misprision of the Clerke: Where <hi>Skipwith</hi> returned him this answer. That although all the Iustices would now record the Contrarie, that they could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nor any Credit might be giuen thereunto, whenas there was a Record extant, and not Reuersed testifying the same Out-lawry: yea the Law so mightily vpholdeth the intended Credit of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that it preferreth the same before the oathes of men, sounding to the Contrarie, and in respect thereof, will not permit a verdit to be receiued, which might impeach the same.</p>

The Defendant pleaded in this Action, that Woodchurch was a Hamlet of A. and no Towne of it selfe. Which Plea includeth a Confession of the wast to haue beene done in such manner as was declared. And vpon this plea, the parties were at issue; with the which the Iurie were charged: And further it was giuen them in charge, that if they found that Woodchurch was a Towne of it selfe, and no Hamlet of A: as the Plaintife had supposed, that then they should assigne damages seuerally for euery waste Committed. The Iurie at length found, that Woodchurch was a Hamlet of it selfe, and assessed damages for certaine of the particular wastes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed seuerally, as they ought. And as touching the wast supposed to be done in the said Hall, they said there was no such Messuage. The Iudges reiected their verdit, because it was contrary to that which was implyed by the Plea of the Defendant of Record: and so inforced the Iurie to giue dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages for a wast: which (indeed) was not done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Conscience of the Iuries; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that some of them made protestation, that in so doing they might be periured: Which wholly was done onely to vphold the Credit of the Record; and that the verdit (of Record) might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, to that which was implyed by the Plea of the parties.</p>

                     <p>Many Examples may be further produced to like effect, to proue that diuers Rules there are receiued in the Law which vpon presumption and Common Entendment, to eschew some notable mischiefe or inconuenience, are so holden for Truth, that in no wise they shall be incountred; although indeede, as

                     <p>Of like nature also there are in the Law other <note place="margin">The Second sort of Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie Rules grounded vpon Entendment.</note> kind of Rules or principles; which although, they doe concerne contingent matters; and therefore may sometimes be impeached, and found vntrue; Yet doe they carry a kinde of Credit also vpon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption or Entendment of Law, although not so vehement as the former.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore although the Law doth receiue them <hi>Prima facie,</hi> and at the first shew, as likely, and giueth Credit vnto the Assertion contained in them, Yet Neuerthelesse doth it admit proofe to the Contrarie, and so suffereth such Praesumption or Entendment, which vpholdeth such Rules, to be impeached, and controlled by a Contrarie tryall by pregnant proofe, and so doth permit any Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made against the same.

                     <p>And therefore the Author of the Dialogues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Doctor and Student describeth equity <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 16.</note> according to this the effect thereof here mentioned:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10308:38"/>
which is that it is no other thing, but an exception of the Law of God or of Reason from the generall Rules of the Law of man, when they by reason of their generality, would in any particular case, iudge against the Law of God, or the Law of Reason: The which exception is secretly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in euery generall Rule of euery positiue Law. And a little after, in the same place affirmeth, That equity followeth the Law in all particular cases, where right and iustice requireth, notwithstanding that the generall Rule of the Law bee to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>And the exception so framed vpon any Rule or Ground to the which it is annexed, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the credit of the said Ground; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <note place="margin">L. quaesit F. de sando instructio.</note> therein, as aforesaid, <hi>Format Regulam in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus casibus non exceptis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But lest some men might thinke, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is spoken in the said Dialogues touching equity might be onely vnderstood of that equity which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlargeth or restraineth statute Lawes (and of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Plowden</hi> in his Appendix vnto the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the case of <hi>Eston</hi> and <hi>Studd,</hi> in his second Commentaries so largely out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi> discourseth. There followeth in the same place of the said Dialogues, and in the Chapter next ensuing are proposed two Axiomes, Groundes, or Rules, with their exceptions, there put for example, and which doe tend to the purpose and proofe of that whereof we now speake.</p>
                     <p>And because that those said Rules there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are last of all here for example before proposed,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10308:39"/>
it shall bee requisite first of all to furnish euery of them with examples.</p>
                     <p>But yet for the better vnderstanding of that which is behoofefull to be knowne concerning equitie in Generall, we are to note that euery Rule with his exceptions or (to speake otherwise in words) euery receiued difference in the Law (being indeede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Rule or Ground and his exceptions) doth either flow from equitie, or else result of the combining of two Rules together, as before hath beene declared.</p>
                     <p>The vse therefore of equitie is triple in our Law: <note place="margin">The triple vse of equity in the Lawes.</note> For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Either it keepeth the common Law in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity by meanes here mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Or it expoundeth the Statute Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Or thirdly giueth remedy in the Court of Conscience in cases of extremitie which otherwise by the Lawes are least vnredressed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore as all men endewed with the right vse of reason, and conuersant in the knowledge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law, must of necessity confesse, that euery Law doth stand vpon permanent Rules, as of Iron not to be bent or broken vpon this or that occasion, or to be infringed vpon this or that occurrence (for else there neede no Court of Law, but all should be one with the Court of Conscience, and haue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings framed according to the Arbitrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the Iustice) So likewise neuerthelesse, vpon euery circumstance of time, person, place, and the manner of doing, there falleth out such matter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, that if Law should be pursued according to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10308:39"/>
the setled Rules thereof, <hi>Summum Ius</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) would prooue <hi>Summa iniuria:</hi> wherefore Law without equitie were rigour. And yet againe, of the other side, if all Lawes should change and bee controlled as often in euery case as equitie would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, then should there be (as aforesaid) no Law certaine. And therefore it standeth with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the common Law in some cases, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and follow equitie, as farre forth as the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Law would permit, and for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of one Rule thereof with another: which common Law againe in other cases should refuse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie for the better auoiding of confusion.</p>

                     <p>Lastly in all cases of mischiefe, for redresse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Positiue Law or ordinary Rules of Law are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue; equity extendeth forth her hand in the Court of Conscience to helpe therein the said defect of the Lawes.</p>
                     <p>The second kinde of equity doth againe of the other side restraine the ample or generall rules of the common Lawes by ministring exceptions, in like manner as is before remembred.</p>
                     <p>And in statute Law it doth also limit the ouerlarge letter, drawing it wholly to, and keeping it within the bounds of the intent &amp; meaning of the makers.</p>
                     <p>In the Court of Conscience it giueth likewise comfort, considereth all the circumstances of the fact, and is as it were tempered with the sweetnesse of mercy, and mitigateth the rigour of the common

                     <p>Wherefore if the same equity bee vsed in such cases onely as are of extremity (as indeed it should) it causeth the Chancellour, into whose hand the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging thereof within this Realme is committed to be in high estimation of honour: so that <hi>In eius</hi>

                     <p>And thus much hath beene said touching the first Ground proposed in the said Dialogues of the said Doctor and Student, which hath beene proued in particular with cases, and thereunto haue beene annexed certaine exceptions which haue likewise
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10308:47"/>
beene fortified with <hi>booke cases</hi> and authorities whereby the former assertions haue not onely beene exemplified, but also thereby it doth plainly appeare, That almost euery disposition in the Lawes, <hi>de qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate</hi> or <hi>de iure</hi> is in conference of Maximes, and resteth betweene the Rule and the exception, which is either ministred by reason of equity, or vpon some other Rule or Axiome. So that euery difference shewed betweene cases, is nothing else but the Rule and his exceptions; the effect whereof briefely is set forth by <hi>Morgan,</hi> who saith: That</p>

                     <p>For the better vnderstanding whereof, wee may note that all matters of debate which may be referred to the controuersies or questions <hi>de qualitate</hi> or <hi>de iure,</hi> as hath beene said, haue either commonly a Maxime of the one part, and a Maxime of the other; or severall resons of each part deriued from sundry Maximes; or else that there is a Maxime of the one part, and there is equity and reason which doth minister an exception to that Maxime or generall Rule: So that all disceptation herein is, as hath beene said, in conference or comparing of Maximes and Principles together discoursing, which thing is directly vnder the reason of the said Maxime; and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10308:48"/>
what matter or circumstance may make a difference, and will be by exception exempted ftom the same; as more at large hereafter in the declaration of the vse of these Maximes may be made manifest and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                     <p>Now resteth moreouer to prosecute the second Axiome or Principle proposed in the said Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, namely, that which followeth there in the seauenteenth chapter of his first booke, that is to say:</p>
                     <p>It is not lawfull for any man to enter vpon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent. <note place="margin">The second Ground.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which ground being expounded by <hi>Littleton</hi> in his chapter of discents to extend only to discents of an estate of inheritance and freehold, and not of a reuersion or remainder, all which followeth after in the said chapter, are nothing but cases of exceptions vnto the said grounds, as it is euident vnto euery one that considereth the same, and therefore shall it heere be needlesse long to insist thereupon. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it shall be expedient to shew some exceptions thereunto, especially some certaine, of such of them as being exceptions vnto the said Rule, are againe restrained with other exceptions. Because there is a Rule of Law, that</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laches ou folly ne sera impute a un enfant de luy</hi>

                     <p>Hitherto haue we entertained discourse as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the verity of Axiomes, Rules, and Grounds; which, as hath beene shewed, is either necessary or contingent.</p>
                     <p>Contingent verity was diuided into two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; the one resting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the entendment of Law; the other being deriued from the disposition and nature of humane things, by debate and discourse of reason.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:10308:50"/>
Of the first sort there are two kindes; for some propositions there are, although of themselues but onely probable, yet neuerthelesse are supposed of such certainty, that no averment shall bee receiued to enounter the same. Othersome, although they be by the Law intended true, <hi>Prima facie,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse the same Law alloweth an averment, and admitteth proofe to impeach the same.</p>
                     <p>Those moreouer which rest vpon discourse of reason, are subiect to diuers exceptions, the materiall cause whereof is, the infinite variety of circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that in all humane actions doe happen.</p>
                     <p>The forme and nature of the exception is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and knowne by this effect following; in that it restraineth the ground vnto which it is connexed.</p>
                     <p>The efficient causes are two, <hi>viz.</hi> Equity or some other Ground of the Law importing contrarietie. And the end thereof is conformity and coherency of Law agreeable vnto Iustices whose minister the Law is.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer as occasion hath bin offered in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the causes from whom Exceptions of Rules doe spring, there hath beene shewed the vse of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the common Law, Statute Law, and Chancery, by the two effects thereof, application and restraint; the one enlarging, the other abridging.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore now resteth to speake of the second principall part, concerning the forme of Axiomes, namely, generallity: The consideration whereof, bringeth to memory, that God in his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len worke, of the frame of transitory things, though he hath furnished the world with vnspeakable vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10308:51"/>
thereby making manifest vnto all humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to their great astonishment, his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible wisdom, his omnipotent power, &amp; his vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prouidence, yet, being the God of order, not of confusion, hath admitted no infinitenesse in nature (howsoeuer otherwise it seeme to our weake capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) but hath continued the innumerable variety of particular things vnder certaine specialls; those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialls vnder generalls; and those generalls againe under causes more generall, lincking and conioyning one thing to another, as by a chaine, euen untill we ascend unto himselfe, the first chiefe and principall cause of all good things. And this is that which <hi>Plato</hi> out of <hi>Homer,</hi> was wont to call <hi>Iupiters gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Chaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eye whereby we doe see and viewe, and the in ward hand whereby we doe reach and apprehend these things, is mans vnderstanding, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed about vniuersality as about his proper obiect, by meanes whereof, in all things rationall, being discouered by the vse of reason, mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for the attaining of knowledge proceedeth from the effect to the cause, and againe from the cause to the effect; that is from the particular to the speciall, and from the speciall to the generall; and so to the more generall, euen to a principall and primary position or notion, which needeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe, but is of it selfe knowne and apparant. And so againe from such chiefe and primary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and propositions to more speciall and peculiar Assertions, descending euen to euery particular matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:10308:51"/>
But that, of this which hath beene said, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might be shewed, especially in this matter, which we now haue in hand, namely, concerning the Grounds and Rules of the Law of <hi>England;</hi> let one of the proposed Grounds first before mentioned stand here for an example, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>This principle being a Rule of reason containing great probability, and being of the number of those that before we said to haue beene deriued from the obseruation of the nature of things, which though it be subiect to manifold exceptions, yet neuerthelesse as a generall Rule, the same is verified in many speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Axiomes; and they againe diuersly subdiuided into many more peculiar propositions; as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of these following may make manifest.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10308:52"/>
and therefore may suffice:</p>
                     <p>The vse of this kind of obseruation of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity <note place="margin">The vse of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of their specialls.</note> of Rules and Propositions is manifold.</p>
                     <p>First, things proposed in the generallity are best knowne and most familiar to our conceipt, sith they be the proper obiect of our vnderstanding, as before is declared.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they doe better adhere and sticke in memory, sith Intellectiue memory is (as the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is) imployed about vniuersall and generall things.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, vniuersall Propositions are the precepts of Art, and therefore they are called perpetuall and and eternall: for no Art, Science, Method, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge can or may consist of particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for the orderly proceeding of euery Art, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically handled, is from the due regard had of the generall, to descend vnto the specialls contained vnderneath the same: wherefore it ensueth hereof, that generall Propositions are the most speedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of knowledge: for experience, which wholly is gotten by the obseruation of particular things (being depriued of speculation) is slow, blinde, doubtfull, and deceiueable, and truly called the mistresse offooles.</p>

Why the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> at the first and <note place="margin">Question.</note> from time to time, had not beene published after this Method of generall and speciall Rules with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                     <p>I answere thereunto, that many ancient writers <note place="margin">Answere 1.</note> attempted that kinde of writing, and accomplished the same according to their seuerall and sundry gifts more or lesse perfect each then other: As by the treatises of <hi>Glanvile, Braction, Britton,</hi> and others appeareth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I say that forasmuch as daily new que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions <note place="margin">2</note> came in debate whereof before had beene no resolution, and wherein many times the least variety of circumstances doth alter the Law; therefore our Ancestors thought it more convenient, to be rather gouerned by an vnwritten Law, not left in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monument, then in the minde of man; and thence to be deduced by disceptation &amp; discourse of reason: and that when occasion should bee offered, and not before.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is more conuenient and profitable to <note place="margin">3</note> the state of the common wealth to frame Law vpon deliberation and debate of reason, by men skilfull and learned in that facultie, when present occasion is offered to vse the same, by a case then falling out and requiring Iudiciall determination: for then is it likely, with much more care, industrie and diligence to be looked vnto; and much more time of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there taken for the mature decision thereof, then otherwise upon the establishing of any positiue Law, might be imparted concerning the same.</p>
                     <p>Last of all, sith all good Lawes require perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity <note place="margin">4</note>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:10308:53"/>
and plainesse; and that in generallity, for the most part, lurketh <hi>obscurity;</hi> therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of more force and effect touching the making and framing of a good Law, then the present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered, sith thereby it brought to light, that which otherwise would not asmuch (many times) as be thought vpon, and giueth occasion to dispute that which none would haue thought euer should haue come in question. And therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due consideration among the Romans, <hi>Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones fori,</hi> and with vs <hi>Demurrers</hi> haue euer beene allowed as originalls of Law.</p>
                     <p>As touching the manifestation of Rules, all are affirmatiue or negatiue: wherein though the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue be, for many causes, the more worthy; yet such negation as implyeth affirmation (and therefore called pregnant) is not without some vse in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe and deliuering of exceptions and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rules. And thus much touching the forme of Rules, Grounds, and Axiomes.</p>
                     <p>The efficient cause of Rules, Grounds, and Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes is the light of naturall reason tryed and sifted vpon disputation and argument. And hence is it, that the Law (as hath beene before declared) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reason; not for that euery man can comprehend the same; but it is artificiall reason; the reason of such, as by their wisdome, learning, and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience are skillfull in the affaires of men, and know what is fit and conuenient to be held and obserued for the appeasing of controuersies and debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, still hauing an eye and due regard of iustice, and a consideration of the common wealth

                     <p>This reason hath in the written workes of the Lawes of this Land, either beene plainely published and expressed in the bookes of Law, vpon decepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cases in debate, and left vnto posterity as the Lights, Rules, and Directions, whereby the said cases so called into question, were at the last decided and determined.</p>
                     <p>Or else it is not at all expressely published in words, but left neuerthelesse implyed and inclined in the cases so decided, and therein doth as it were lye hidden; and yet neuerthelesse to be easily, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie

Wherefore sith in the Law (as in other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) all arguments and disputation doe either consist of expresse proofe and allegation of Authoritie (which are called <hi>Inartificiall Arguments)</hi> or else of application and inference; as well the Rules to bee collected vpon Inference and application of other Cases, are to bee regarded and to bee produced, as those which are direct authorities. And forasmuch as in very few cases of doubt newly rising in debate, and called into question and controuersie, expresse proofe and pregnant authoritie can be found; the Lawyer is most beholding to Inference and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where with hee is instructed and taught, that Cases different in circumstance, may be neuerthelesse compared each to other in equalitie of Reason; so that of like Reason, like law might be framed. And by how much Application and inference doth more depend vpon wit and Art, then the producing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Authoritie; by so much the more it excelleth the same, sith the Allegation of expresse Authoritie, resteth wholly vpon Industrie and Memorie in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing and noting that which hee findeth already framed to his hand</p>
                     <p>Expresse Rules, Axiomes, Grounds and Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the former sort are published in the booke of Law, either in the Lattin tongue, as are the former generall Rules first mentioned, and also infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of that kinde; or else in the French; in which tongue the Reports of forepassed Cases are published vnto the vse of posteritie, and wherewith the said bookes of yeares and tearmes (almost in euery case therein found) are fully furnished. So that all, though it shall be need esse to make manifest that by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which of it selfe is euident; yet still to pursue the former Methode and order hitherunto obserued, we shall easily perceiue the same in this short case here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after expressed.</p>

                     <p>So that the Reasons of euery Resolution in any booke Case being reduced into short Sentences, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or Summarie Conclusions are the Grounds Rules, and Principles that we doe meane and speake of in this place.</p>
                     <p>Such Summarie Conclusions, Corolaries, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Grounds, or Propositions therefore as afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared are deliuered in the bookes of Reports in two manners.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes without any note or marke that they are Grounds or Rules, but onely as laid downe and dispersed in the Arguments and Resolutions as short Reasons of the opinion or determination there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed as in the last example appeareth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes with a note or marke that they are Grounds, Rules, and Maximes, and are expresly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested with such names, as in the entrance of this treatise hath appeared. And thus much of the Grounds or Positions expressed in the bookes.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the second sort, which are to be collected, and inferred out of the Cases left reported, wee plainely may perceiue the notable vse of such collection, in reading aduisedly the Commentaries of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Plowden,</hi> or other the best bookes of Reports; or diligently obseruing any notable Argument made at this day in any the Queenes Courts in matter of <hi>Demurrer,</hi> where wee may not thinke that euery case cited or alleadged out of the bookes for proofe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10308:56"/>
of the Controuersie, is therefore alleadged because it hath expresse matter therein published in plaine words, and tending to the resolution of the point in question: but at sometimes, and that most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such proofe is produced vpon inference, and yet neuerthelesse, sufficiently pregnant to approue the matter whereunto it is rightly applyed: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and application proceedeth wholly vpon collected Rules and Axiomes included in the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Cases produced although the same bee not expresly spoken or published therein.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore notwithstanding, the best meanes of the collection of the said Rules depending onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Meditation, and resting wholly vpon the sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wit, industrie, and iudgement of the Student, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euery mans seuerall conceit is in it selfe sundry) may best be referred vnto the Student himselfe: yet neuerthelesse, shall it not bee amisse here to manifest such direction therein as may be obserued with some fruit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, after the Case read, let vs consider with our selues, and meditate in our mindes, to what seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purposes the same case may be applyed, and what matter, or seuerall matters the resolution of the said Case can confirme.

                     <p>Here of hath appeared that although none of these Propositions bee expressed in the resolution of the said Case, in the booke wherein the same is left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; yet neuerthelesse are they necessarily imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the resolution of the said Case, as before hath beene declared.</p>

                     <p>A second meanes, by Inference to collect, such Rules and propositions as are before declared, is by

way of Argument by Syllogisme: For supposing the said Case to be denyed to be Law which wee haue read. Let vs endeauour to draw the immediate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof into a syllogisme for confirmation of the same. So that thereby, forasmuch as all Rules out of the Law are of two sorts, that is, either being the Reasons of the Case, or the Case contracted shortly it selfe, by such manner of Argument, the Maior, and first Proposition of the said syllogisticall Argument, will bee the generall Reason of the said Case: the Minor or second Proposition, will be the particular Reason: and the conclusion will bee the contracted case it selfe: Which also will serue as a secondarie Rule to determine other Cases of equall Reason called into controuersie. For example herein, we will take the opinion of <hi>Hulls</hi> in 9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>a</hi> in the end of a Case there argued, where he holdeth for cleere Law, That</p>

                     <p>THe Reasons and Causes wherefore these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, Rules, and Axioms (as hath beene declared first in manner as aforesaid) are not onely to be considered, obserued and collected, but alway to be had, and carefully to be kept in memorie, And the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> whereto they serue and tend, will manifestly appeare, as well by the Obseruation

of the right vse of them, and the manifold vtilitie and great helpe, which riseth by the daily meditation therein, as likewise by the consideration and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some inconsiderate abuses which haue crept into the daily handling of them, both in iudiciall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad, and in priuate exercises at home.</p>
                     <p>The necessary vse of them therefore consisteth in two parts.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 The other in vse and practise of the Law lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by these Propositions and Rules, reducing them, as occasion serueth to publique and priuate behoofe.</p>
                     <p>The first is Speculatiue.</p>
                     <p>This last Practique.</p>
                     <p>As touching the first, the profit hence springing may soone be seene and discouered, if we call to our memorie, that no manner facultie whatsoeuer to bee learned by the the light of Reason, can consist or be comprehended by the capacitie of mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, except (as before also in part hath appeared) it be furnished with certaine Assertions, Precepts, Rules, and Propositions, and the same adorned with these two qualities, <hi>Vniuersalitie</hi> and <hi>Veritie.</hi> And as none may worthily take vpon him the name of a Diuine, which is ignorant of the Principles of his Science; nor any man may well arrogate the title or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> name of a Philosopher or Physitian, who knoweth not the seuerall Rules, whereupon, as vpon sundry foundations, the said seuerall faculties are built and erected; so none may bee deemed a Lawyer, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or can giue good Aduise therein, which

knoweth not the Precepts whereon his Art depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; or hath not read the determination of former doubts left reported in bookes, being the greatest part of the written Law in his Land; And thence, not collected Conclusions for the decisions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and future controuersies.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer seeing the Law of this Land is wholly Rationall (as hath beene said) wherein, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences, the minde of man holdeth and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the former published proceeding, by apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and discourse, collecting Primarie aud Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conclusions and Grounds, it cannot bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that the obseruation of these Primarie and Secondarie Conclusions, must needs bee the best, most approued, profitable and speedie meane, for the attaining of the right, sound, and infallible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the said Lawes.</p>
                     <p>And if there be any way extant, or to be found by mans wisedome, to purge the English Lawes, from the great Confusions, tedious and superfluous itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the which the Reports are infested; or quit it of these manifold contrarieties, wherewith it is so greatly ouercharged, so that the Coherencie, constancie, and conformitie thereof, is almost vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, and not without some blemish and reproach of our Nation and Common-wealth, in manner cleane abolished; Surely, as to mee seemeth, there is likelihood by that way and meanes to bring the same to passe, or by none. For, by Rules and Exceptions, all Sciences are and haue beene published, put downe and deliuered: out of Rules and Exceptions, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is framed, by which meanes men may view a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10308:61"/>
perfect plot of the coherence of things: Euen as in a large spred tree, from the lowest roote to the highest branche; from the most ample and highest Generall, by many degrees of discent, as in a Petigree or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie, to the lowest speciall and particular; which are combined together as it were in a consanguinitie of bloud and concordancy of nature.</p>
                     <p>And yet therewithall perusing the particular dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and degrees of distinction betweene them, in all the course of humane studies, there is none that doth more commend vnto our cogitations the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull force of mans wisedome, then doth this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which treateth of the Principles, Grounds, Rules, and Originals of Law and Iustice, being the chayne of humane societie, without the which it cannot consist; and which, besides the exceeding pleasure that the consideration thereof breedeth in the well affected minde, is able to bring vs speedily to ripenesse and maturitie in that profession. For, <hi>Principium est dimidium totius,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Short refined reasons of long perplexed Cases, doe, through their soundnesse, satisfie our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, through their breuity and shortnesse, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delight the minde, through their pithinesse, they may be deemed incomparable treasures, yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great shew of wit, and wonderfully sharpening our vnderstanding, of infinite vse, in all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, containing much worth in few words, no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to memorie, but once obtained, are euer retained.</p>
                     <p>Sith all Sciences doe tend to Veritie (as hath beene before often affirmed, which is the obiect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10308:62"/>
part of our minde; And sith Verity and Truth cannot be obtained or found without due knowledge of the causes; <hi>Tunc enim</hi> (as saith the Philosopher) <hi>unum quodque scire arbitramur, cum eius causas &amp; Principia cognoscimus.</hi> And not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly said the Poet,</p>

                     </l>
                     <p>Then must the right and due obseruation of these and such like Principles containing the Causes of things, be a direction to conduct and leade vs to the knowledge of that faculty and science, whereof they are Principles. For from hence all artificiall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are, and haue beene drawne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>To adhere therefore and wholly to respect parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cases, without any observation of the generall Rules and Reasons, and to charge the memory with infinite singularities, is vtterly to confound the same; a labour of vnspeakable toyle, and wherein we shall neuer free vs from confusion; but engender in our selues, that wrong opinion which many haue (amisse) entertained, that there is nothing certaine in our Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if the Law be euery mans inheritance borne vnder the same, as notably (besides our owne Lawes) saith the Prince of Oratours, <hi>Tully: Maior</hi>

                     <p>But by the former of these two specified kindes of Arguments, is meant as manifestly appeareth, the helpe, Grounds, and Maximes doe yeeld in that kinde. For the vnderstanding therefore of the right vse thereof, it behooueth to consider, that the same wholly doth consili in the apt and convenient appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the said Rules, vnto such particular cases daily falling in debate, as may be comprehended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the generallity of the same Rules, and may in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery respect berightly reduced thereunto; so that the Rule might serue as a well-grounded reason of the matter called in question.</p>
                     <p>To this effect the Author of the Dialogues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Doctor and Student, after hee had at large spoken of the credit and supposed certainty of a Principle or Maxime of the Lawes of this Land, addeth further that such Maximes be not onely hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for Law, but also other cases like vnto them, and all things, that necessariy follow vpon the same, are to be reduced to the like Law.</p>
                     <p>A second vse of the obseruation of Principles in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Argumentation may be this.</p>
                     <p>Wee are taught (as saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> and as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hath afore beene remembred, by the election of Principles to abound in matter fit for Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our propositions may be framed as parts of Syllogisme, or as antecedent Propositions of Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memes, by which forme of Arguments, this profit and commodity is reaped, that he which rightly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the same, in proofe or disproofe of any proposed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10308:63"/>
matter shall not need to fall into any unnecessary and extravagant matter, or digresse from the point that hehath in hand. For if the parts of our argument so to be concluded, doe consist of Propositions which are Principles in Law, and be in due and expedient manner framed and combined together, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, which is the point in question, will follow, either necessarily or probably, according to the truth of the said Propositions, for as we haue before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by reducing a case to a Syllogisme, we might finde some of the principall Reasons and Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereupon the verity of the said case, being the conclusion, dependeth; as trying out the cause by the effect: So of the contrary part, to frame the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by the cause; the same Propositions will, as they confirme one case, so likewise establish all other speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cases, which shall happen to concurre in equall and like reason, or be reducible to, or vnder, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity of the said Proposition.</p>
                     <p>And although the Lawyer be not tyed to this short course of Argument current in schooles, yet in whatsoeuer large discourse of Argument, if this forme be respected, though amplified and enlarged with Prosyllogismes, after the manner of Rhetoriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Oratours, it will yeeld the fruit aforce remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.

These three cases greatly doe differ both in the circumstance of matter, &amp; in the immediate reasons, and yet neuerthelesse haue some resemblance, and a kinde of conformitie and likenesse, betweene them each to other.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First they all concerne the King.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Secondly the King in euery of them is restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from that power or benefit that his subiect hath. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In the first, he cannot arrest one as his subiect may.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In the second he shall lose that debt which his subiect, in whose right hee claimeth it, shoud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In the third he shall not be receiued where the subiect might.</p>
                     <p>And lastly in euery of these cases, if the King should bee admitted to doe as a common person might, the subiect in suite with him should sustaine great preiudice. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In the first he should not be permitted to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the iniury done to his person.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 In the third and last haue his Action debated without his default.</p>
                     <p>The likenesse of which cases cannot so well bee conceiued without many words, except wee reduce vnto some generall Axiome the vnity and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of reason found in them. And therefore this Proposition without more might haue sufficed for all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:10308:66"/>
Where the subiect by reason of some Prerogatiue that is in the King, should otherwise be put to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice; there the king shall not be allowed that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which euery of his subiects by law enjoyeth.</p>
                     <p>In which generall Axiome or Rule, a generall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all the said seuerall Cases doth equally concur.</p>
                     <p>By this obseruation wee may reape likewise a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourth commoditie, after this manner. All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports doe consist of particular Cases Euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Case hath his seuerall Circumstance. Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are singular, and hardly retained in memorie. For, true is that sentence, which <hi>Bracton</hi> hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed <note place="margin">Bracton li. 1. cap. 1. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

For, <hi>Memoria Intellectiua est vniuersalium, vt est ipsemet Intellectus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not the Case ruled this way, nor that way but the reason which maketh Law; For, <hi>Non quid sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere</hi>

Although in argument, I confesse not onely the Generall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but likewise the speciall Cases are as proofes produced and alleadged.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, sith the chosen and collected Propositions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and Principles in manner as aforesaid, for our better
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10308:66"/>
vse behooueth to be committed to writing; we may easily without great trouble, by disposing of them orderly, frame a Directory, in manner either of a methodicall Treause, or of an Alphabeticall Table, fit and conuement both for the speedie finding of that wee would seeke, and the ready hauing of that we can wish for, surpassing the benefit of any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement hereto fore extant.</p>
                     <p>And thus much touching the commodities grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the consideration and collection of Principles, Rules, Axiomes, Grounds, and Maximes: and of the scope and end whereunto they tend in managing of our Lawes, as well for the behoofe of the Student, and for the vse of the Practiser. And now remaineth that a few words be said to forewarne both, of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine abuses ordinarily bred herein.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The first Abuse is, that neither the Ground of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times produced doth come neere the Reason of the Case, in question; nor the Cases alleadged to proue and fortifie that Ground, doe directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same. A fault very vsuall in publique exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises; and may be redressed if we doe call to minde that any Case alleadged ought not to be wrested to proue the Rule or Ground alleadged; but the Rule, Ground, or Principle ought to be the very immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or secondarie reason of the Cases whence, it is drawne, and which Cases are brought to confirme the same, in such sort that all the Cases alleadged doe concurre in equalitie of reason, likenesse, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in full proofe of the Principle so produced. And that the Ground or Principle bee a reason of the question in variance, to subuert or confirme the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10308:67"/>
same. Wherein also let this be weighed, that a few Principles cannot sufficiently serue to supplie all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions in that behalfe, but the same must be drawne and deduced of all Causes, Titles, and matters in the Law fit for argument and ves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A second principall ouersight is this. Many to proue their opinion in the controuersie proposed, frame their reason rightly from some notable Ground, and knowne Principle or Rule, which though it bee well applyed, yet not regarding the manifold Exceptions whereunto the same Principle is subiect, they doe set it forth so generall, that it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth their aduersarie some cause of challenge and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thereunto, by obiecting some instance or cases vpon exception of the said Rule: and thereby doth not onely seeme to enfeeble the same, in shewing the fallacies thereof; but sometime in shew, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the whole reason and argument grounded thereupon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third abuse of these Principles or Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is, in the two much frequenting and often needlesse vse of them. For sometimes the obscuritie of the Cause, may require some other manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, drawne from places of inuention, which may content and satisfie the minde of the hearers much better. And sometimes the clearenesse of the matter it selfe, needeth not such preparation of proofe and confirmation of those Principles and Rules. For then is the most and best of them, when that both Propositions and Cases to confirme the same, haue great coherence with the question; when both the circumstance of the Case in question, and the cause
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10308:67"/>
of doubt, doe giue occasion to vse them; so that which thereby is affirmed, may rightly be reducible to the purpose.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Finally, it sometimes falleth out to be a fault ouermuch to abound in well doing. <hi>Omne Nimium vertitur in vitium,</hi> saith the Prouerbe; for sundry times it happeneth, that it is very conuenient and direct to the matter to make argument vpon a well applyed Prnciple, Rule or Ground, which by men of great learning and reading is sometimes so suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently handled, with such abundance and ample fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of notable and direct Cases, that their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour herein deserueth high commendations: yet more conuenient were it, that their paines were lesse. For to what purpose behooueth it, to heape Case vpon Case, as it were one on the necke of another, <hi>Pelion</hi> vpon <hi>Ossa?</hi> Whereas many probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, though confirmed with few good Cases, breede greater contentation to the hearer, by reason of the seuerall proofe made thereby then many Cases.</p>

                     <p>The Iudges when many prisoners are in the Goale doe in the end before they goe, peruse euery one. Those that were indicted by Grand Iury, and found not guiltie by the select Iury, they judge to be quitted, &amp; so deliuer them out of the Goale. Those that are found guilty by both Iuries they Iudge to death and command the Sheriffe to see execution done. To those that refuse tryall by the Countrie, or stand mute vpon the ind ctment, they iudge to be pressed to death, some whose offences are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring vnder twelue pence value, they judge to be whipped. Those that confesse their ind ctments, they iudge to death, whipping or otherwise, as their offence requireth.

of <hi>A.</hi> they cannot haue it, for its not an estate testamentory that should goe to the Executors as goods and Chatrels should, so as in truth, no man can intitle himselfe vnto those Lands; and therefore, the Law preferreth him that first entreth, and he is called <hi>Occupans</hi> and shall hold it during the life of <hi>B.</hi> but must pay the rent, performe the conditions, and doe no wast. And he may by deed assigne it to whom he please in his life time. But if he die, before he assigne it ouer, then it shall goe againe to him whomsoeuer entreth.

This is called discent of Land, and vpon whom the discent is to light, is the question. For which purpose the Law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance preferreth the first Child before all others, and amongst children the male before the female, and amongst males the first borne. If there bee no Children then the Brother, if no Brothers, then sisters, if neyther Brothers nor Sisters, then Vnckles, and for lacke of Vncles, Ants, if none of them, then Couzens in the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest degree of consanguinity, with these
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10308:87"/>
three rules of diuersities. 1. That the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <note place="margin">Of discent 3. rules.</note> male shall safely inherit; but if it come to females, then they being all in an equall degree of neerenes shall inherit altogether <note place="margin">Brother or Sister of the halfe bloud shall not inherit to his Brother or Sister but only as a child to his Parents.</note> and are called Parceners, and all they make but one heire to the Ancestor. 2. That no brother nor sister of the halfe blood shall inherit to his brother or sister, but as a Child to his Parents, as for example. If a man haue two wiues, and by either wife a sonne, the eldest sonne ouerliuing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be preferred to the inheritance of the Father being Fee-simple; But if he entreth and dyeth without a child, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall not be his heire, because he is of the halfe bloud to him, but the Vnckle of the eldest Brother or Sister of the whole bloud, yet if the eldest Brother had dyed in the life of the Father, then the youngest Brother should inherit the Land that the Father had, although it were a child by the second wife, before any daughter by the first. The third rule about discents. That land purchased by the partie himselfe that dyeth, is to be inherited; first, by the heires of the Fathers side, then if he haue none of that part by the heires of the Mothers side. But Land descended to him from his father or mother, are to go to that side only <note place="margin">Discent.</note> from which they came, and not to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side.</p>

                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:10308:88"/>
Those Rules of discent mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to bee vnderstood of Fee simples and not of entailed Lands, and those rules are to bee restrained by some particular customes of some particular places: as namely, the custome of <hi>Kent,</hi> that euery male of equall degree of Childhood, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood or kindred, shall inherit equally, <note place="margin">Customes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains places.</note> as daughters shall being Parceners, and in many Burrough Townes of England, the Custome alloweth the youngest sonne to inherit, and so the youngest Daughter.

                     <p>And there is another note to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Fee-simple inheritance, and that is, that euerie heire hauing Land or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, be it by common Law or by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is chargeable, so farre forth as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thereof extendeth with the binding acts of the Ancestors from whom the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance descendeth; and these acts are colaterall encombrances, and the reason of this charge is, <hi>Qui sentit commodum sentire debet incommodum siue onus.</hi> As for <note place="margin">Euery Heire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing land is bound by the binding Acts of his Aneestors if he be named.</note> example, if a man bind himselfe and his heires in an obligation or doe Couenant by writing for him and his heires, or doe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10308:88"/>
grant an Anuity for him &amp; his heires, which warrantie in all these cases, the Law char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heire after the death of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor with this Obligation; Couenant, Annuitie, Warrantie, Yet with these three Cautions. 1. That the partie must by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall name bind himselfe and his heires, or Couenant, grant, and warrant for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his heires; otherwise, the heire is not to bee touched. Secondly, that some action must be brought against the heire, <note place="margin">Dier. 114.

Thirdly, that no heire is further to bee charged, then the value of the Land descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him, for the same Ancestor that made the instrument of charge, and that Land also not to bee sold outright, but to bee kept in extent and at a yearely value <note place="margin">Dier. 149.

way of confession and set downe the true quantitie of his inheritance descended, and so submit himselfe; therefore, as the Law requireth. Then that heire that otherwise demeaneth himselfe, shal be charged of his <note place="margin">Heire charged for his false plea.</note> his owne other Lands and goods, and of money for this deed of his Ancestor. As for example. If a man bind himselfe and his heires in an obligation, and dyeth leauing but 10. Acres of Land to his heire, if his heire be sued vpon the bond, &amp; commeth in, and denieth that he hath any by discent, and it is found against him by the verdict that he hath 10. Acres, this heire shall bee now charges by his false plea of his owne lands goods and bodie to pay the 100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the 10.

                     <p>Entayles of Lands began by a Statute <note place="margin">☞ By the Stat. of West. 1. made in E. 1. time estates in tayle were so strengthened they were not forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by any attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> made in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. time, by which also they are so much strengthened, as that the Tenant in Tayle cannot put, away the Land from the heire by any Act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance or Attainder, nor Let it, nor incomber it, longer then his owne Life.</p>
                     <p>But the inconueniencie thereof was <note place="margin">☞ The great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued thereof.</note> great, for by that meanes, the Land being so sure tyed vpon the heire as that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not put it from him, it made the Sonne to bee disobedient, negligent, and wastfull; often marrying withoutthe Fathers consent, and to grow insolent in vice; knowing, that there could bee no cheeke of dis-inheriting him. It also made the owners of the Land lesse fearefull to commit Murthers, Felonies, Treasons, and Manslaughters; for that they knew, none of these acts could hurt the Heire of of his inheritance. It hindred men that had intayled Lands, that they could not make the best of their Lands by fine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement, for that none vpon so vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an estate, as for terme of his owne

                     <p>Lastly, those Entailes did defraud the <note place="margin">☞ The prejudice the Crowne received thereby.</note> Crowne, and many Subjects of their Debts; for that the Land was not lyable longer then his owne life-time; which caused, that the King could not safely commit any office of accompt to such, whose Land were entailed, nor other men trust them with loane of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                     <p>These inconveniences, were remedied by Acts of Parliment; as namely, by Acts of Parliament later then the Acts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, <note place="margin">The Stat. 4.

And more then that, where many are owners of inheritance of Land nor Entayled, may during the minoritie of his Eldest sonne appoint the profics, to goe to the aduancement of the younger Sonnes and pay Debts by Entayle and Perpetuities, the owners of these Lands cannot doe it, but they must suffer the whole to discend to his eldest Sonne, and so to come to the Crowne by Wardship all the time of his Infancie.</p>
