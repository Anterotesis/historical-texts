         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EDITOR
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN this Second Volume of the <hi>Diary,</hi>
which is here Presented, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things very Considerable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the several Progresses of a Life
of <hi>Faith,</hi> with various Manuductions to
this Mystick and Supersensual State, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
within the Space but of One Year;
wherein this Author was most plentifully
Visited of God. There are many Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
given concerning the <hi>Paradisiacal,</hi>
the <hi>Angelical,</hi> and the <hi>Divine</hi> Life, in
the Gradual Augmentation and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Seed of Faith within
the Soul: Many things concerning the
<hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> with her Laws of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize;</hi>
which besides an Interiour, do
carry also with them an Exteriour Sense,
<pb facs="tcp:29870:3"/>
that will be made good to her Children:
many things respecting the Establishment
of a Royal Order of the <hi>Melchizedeck
Priesthood</hi> upon the Earth, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of Prophecy and Miracles, in a more
Extraordinary and Fixed Manner than
ever hitherto.</p>
            <p>They are all Great and Momentous
Matters which are here deliver'd, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
both the Church of Christ in
general, and each Member thereof in
particular: neither are they such as are
at a distance, but such as are near at
hand, and at the very Door; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
already to be accomplished in
some Persons in divers Countries, even
almost of all Ranks, Constitutions, and
Manners of Living. Whereof much
could be said. And if they be not only
Great, but also Uncommon and Strange,
though it cannot be expected that they
should easily be Receiv'd; yet it may,
that they should at least be admitted to a
fair Hearing, and candid Examination, as
to the Pretences which are made. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
also the Method of Delivering them
down may be, and how liable soever to the
Exceptions of the Eloquent and the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
this will not be a Prejudicate strong
<pb facs="tcp:29870:3"/>
enough to make the Wise and Prudent in
Heart, throw away a rich Treasure that
may be put into their hands, because of
the many Coverings that may be put
upon it. And if the Matters be of the
greatest Consequence, though they be
couched for the most part under certain
Parables, Similitudes, and Visional Ideas,
it is not at all doubted but that Many will
be found, who may hereby be stirred up
to dive into and comprehend what others
will slight and despise, as seeing nothing
more in it than an Enthusiastick Jargon of
Words. But let the Thoughts of these
be never so mean, it is certain to me, that
<hi>Wisdom will be justified of her children:</hi>
and that her Children are Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Children in the Eyes of the World,
in their own Eyes, and in the Eyes of
God. No wonder then it is that the
World despises them, laughs at their
weakness, and with a sort of Disdain,
pities their Folly. It has been so from the
days of Christ and of his holy Apostles:
and it is no new thing for the <hi>Mystick
Wisdom</hi> of God to be accounted <hi>Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and those that are led by an higher
Spirit than that of this World to be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Mad,</hi> or even possess'd with a <hi>Devil.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:29870:4"/>
But if the World know them not, a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the World doth know them.
Hear then, Oye Little Ones, and rejoice:
Hear also, O ve Despisers, and mourn.
For a <hi>glorious Kingdom,</hi> and a <hi>beautiful
Crown,</hi> even the Crown of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
is now set before you both. Take heed
that ye neglect not so great an Offer, and
deride not those who do Believe, and
consequently Accept it. If so, the Evil
Day of Temptation, that is to try the
whole Earth, will overtake you sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and then will ye be constrain'd to
confess, How are these whom we counted
Mad, numbred among the Children of
God: and how is their Lot fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Redeemed out of the Earth,
who stand upon the Mount of <hi>Sion,</hi> with
Crowns and Palms in their Hands, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Lamb?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ascending Steps</hi> to which Mount
you will find Here so described, as could
be by none but such as have went up by
them; in conformity with that process
of the Regeneration, and the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which hath been expressed by
the <hi>Ascension-Ladder sent down,</hi> that was
in the year 1681. set forth by the Author,
and in the Year 1694. Translated into
<pb facs="tcp:29870:4"/>
               <hi>High Dutch,</hi> and soon after that into
<hi>Low Dutch.</hi> Wherein it is at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
how the Actions and Passages of
our Blessed Lord in the Way to Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
are not only Representative, and
Imputative as to their Meritoriousness,
or Efficacy, but are also Operative of the
same in the Members of his Mystical Body.
Who must also pass through <hi>Death,</hi> and
the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> before they can <hi>Ascend.</hi>
and be <hi>glorified</hi> with him in the Kingdom
of <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> or of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi>
Let us then, as many as Love the Lord
JESUS and his Appearance, behold the
<hi>Cloud now breaking,</hi> wherein he will De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into Us, in like manner as he As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and having carry'd us through
the Cross, will lead us back into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
whence we came out, by restoring
again the bright and pure Image of God,
through his all-virtual Resurrection:
and from thence conduct us still higher
and higher, as we shall be herewith by
him <hi>Adorned,</hi> into those Superiour States
of Glorification, in the Heavens above
<hi>Paradise,</hi> where he sits as at the right
Hand of the Father, in the Fulness of
Majesty and Glory. From whence he
will Personally also descend to Judge the
<pb facs="tcp:29870:5"/>
World according to Righteousness and
Truth [or Equity,] when he shall have
thus prepared a Body of Saints, made
like unto him, in the midst of whom he
may pitch his Glorious Tabernacle. Out
of which his Edicts will be sent, as on
the Wings of the Lightning, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
ends of the Earth, by Flying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
who have liv'd in Bodies of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
but shall have then receiv'd the
Immortal Crown and the Incorruptible
Name. O Blessed, yea, thrice Blessed
are all those, who through that Faith,
which in these Sheets is Discrib'd, are
made partakers of this First Resurrection,
and of the high Immunities and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
of the First-born.</p>
            <p>But who is sufficient for these things?
And it may now again be said: Alas!
<hi>Who hath believed our Report?</hi> We are
accounted as Liars all the day long, for
they sake, O God of Truth. Alas!
who will believe that thou hast remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
thy Promises of Old, which all thy
Holy Prophets have repeated from thy
Mouth: O Lord most Holy, O Lord, most
True? Or that thou hast spoken unto us
out of the Cloudy Pillar, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with us in the Silence of our Hearts?
<pb facs="tcp:29870:5"/>
How hast thou made us to bear thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
O God: and to be in the Eyes
of many, and even of our Brethren, (as
we still esteem them) as the <hi>Dung</hi> of the
Earth, and as the <hi>Offscouring</hi> of all the
present Forms of Religion; because we
have believed they Word, and have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to thy Voice, calling unto us in
the Evening of this Sixth Day? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dealest thou thus with us, O Lord our
God? Surely thou answerest us: <hi>Why are
ye so jealous of mine Honour, as if the
Times were not in mine Hand, and the
Seasons ordained in my Counsel? Arise:
and hold not your Peace, though ye be
but the Offscouring of the Earth, and lie as
among the Pots. Blow ye the Trumpet;
and cease not, till I shall appear. Suffer
me to plead my own Cause, and at my own
time. Remember my Servant</hi> John, <hi>that
I sent to prepare my Way: how he wrought
not any mighty Deed, yet was sound faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in his Ministration, and prevailed
abundantly. Think not that I am slack
in performing my Promises, of destroying
the Adversary, that Man of Sin, by the
Ghostly and Miraculous Powers going out
of my Mouth, as streams of Fire. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

my Promises are at hand to be fulfill'd

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and rejoice
greatly, that ye are counted worthy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
shame for my Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we shall not be Solicitous
what may be Said or Thought of us by
Any. Our Part is Defensive, not Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive:
and so Only but with respect to
the Honour of God, and the Immutable
Truth of his Word. And therefore it
will be incumbent on those who would
oppose us, to shew the Invalidity of that
Charter which we pretend to have
from the Mouth of Christ himself, <hi>Luke</hi>
11. 10, 13. <hi>Matth</hi> 5. 48 (compared
with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 10, 12, 13, 14.
(compared with Chap. 17. 20, 21. and <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 17. 39.) Or to produce but any one
Testimony either out of the Old, or
New Testament, (which they themselves
dare to rely on) for the Final Cessation
of Revelation and Prophecy in the
Church of God, either with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
or shortly after, or even after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Centuries of Years, as the more
Moderate and Learned do Assert. Or
else to shew that what we do profess to
have thus learnt, when rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
is Clearly contrary to what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in the Law, or in the Gospel, or
<pb facs="tcp:29870:6"/>
to some thing deliver'd by the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
or Apostles. Either of which if
these Gentlemen can prove, they will do
much towards the Sapping, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the whole Foundation upon
which we stand. But till this shall be
done, all this other Labour will be but
in vain: and instead of retarding, will
but serve more Vigorously to promote the
Work: that is undertaken and carried on
by some that are of a <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Spirit,
and not to be daunted with big and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Words.</p>
            <p>If there be then any Dissatisfied as to
the Contents of this Volume, or of the
former, or other Writings hitherto
Printed of this Author; let them, if
their Dissatisfaction be out of a Zeal for
God, and the Truth of Religion; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with cool and sedate Thoughts,
whether there be not as good a Ground
in Scripture for the Expectation and
Belief of such a Kingdom of Christ to
come, as is herein expressed, and said
to be revealed by the Powers of the Holy
Ghost; as there is for many of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in Religion which they do receive,
and Articles which they have subscribed
to. Let them consider what is the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb facs="tcp:29870:7"/>
of the Divine Name on Earth,
to be daily Pray'd for, (and therefore
to be believ'd in) what the Coming of
the Kingdom of our God on Earth, and
what the Doing of his Will on Earth, in
like manner to be Pray'd for, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
in, as to the very same degree
that it is in Heaven; that is both with
the same <hi>Oneness</hi> of Spirit, the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Purity,</hi> and the same <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality</hi>
of Extent; with respect first to the
Name of the Father to be sanctified, by
such as shall have receiv'd the Seal of
the Adoption of Children; secondly, to
the Kingdom to be manifested, which
must be in the Power of the Father; and
thirdly, the Will to be performed, which
must be by the Holy Ghost, ministring in
the inward Sanctuary, which he fills.
Let them consider what other Systems do
say as to these matters: and then let them
examin what a System may be drawn
out of this Book, when well digested,
and fully comprehended. After which
let that which is hence drawn, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with those: and both together
be compared with the Sacred Scriptures,
taken in their easie, plain, and natural
Sense, without running to, or depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:29870:7"/>
upon the Glosses, Interpretations, or
Comments of any whatever. Let them
further consider, whether in these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there be the least Footsteps to be
found for such a prevailing Opinion, as
is at this day grown in a manner Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
amongst us, that the Prophetical and
Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
by Christ for the establishment
only and Foundation of his Church, and
not for its Building up, and Perfection
in the Work of the Ministry, till all
should be brought hereby into the Unity
of the Faith, and the Knowledge not
only of the Mysteries of Religion, but a
full conformity to the Stature of Christ,
in the most perfect and stable Model of
it: concerning which much is spoke,
both here, and in <hi>The Message to the
Philadelphian Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be confessed that there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
several things, that will be apt to
shock the Readers at the first view, who
have not had any such Experiences in
themselves: but chiefly through the
Strangeness of this Parabolical and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
way of Writing, which is fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as great a Disreputation in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Refin'd Age, as it was of Esteem in
<pb facs="tcp:29870:8"/>
the first Ages of the Church. But upon
a most nice and accurate Examination
these Stumbling Blocks will either all, or
for the most part, moulder away of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And whereas it is generally Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against every one that steps out of the
Vulgar and Ordinary Road, and speaks
but of any Divine Favours above what
are common, That all proceeds from the
Root of Pride in them, variously trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it self; you may be Here assured,
that there is the most Solid ground Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
by what you shall read in these
so Peculiar Memoirs, for the <hi>Humility</hi>
of the Cross; without making it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with Faith or Hope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or to impede
the Progress of any Generous Design for
the Good of this Nation, of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and of the whole World. And no
where better you may find what a vast
distinction there is of a True and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
from a False and Beggarly Humility.
Another thing that may recommend this,
with the other Treatises of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
is that there will not herein be
found, any vilifying or reproaching the
Sacred Customs among Christians, any
Lessening or Derogating from any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
either of Christ or of his
<pb facs="tcp:29870:8"/>
Apostles, as is usual unto Some: but a just
Deference to the truth of the History as
well as of the Divine Mystery. Here is
nothing against the Ordinances of the
of the Gospel, when us'd in Spirit and
in Truth: nothing against the giving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to whom Honour is due: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against the Unity of the Body of
the Church under Christ the only Supreme
and Universal Bishop, and his Holy Spirit.
For as much as nothing is asserted for the
<hi>setting up of any new Sect, or Church:</hi>
but an Encouragement is only given, for
the Waiting purely in the unity of this
Spirit, with Prayers and Supplications,
that such an <hi>Holy Catholick</hi> Church may
arise upon the Earth; whereof Christ can
say, that <hi>my Dove, my Vndefiled is One,</hi>
and that it is <hi>One Spirit</hi> with himself.
Wherefore also there can be no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
as to any Uncharitableness in this
Author. Who is more blamed for the
Height of Charity, as stretchingit too
far, than for the want of it, or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But that Exact and Beautiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the Design and Import
of our Saviour's Doctrine, which is herein
Deliver'd, will be sufficient probably to
prefer the same to all the Sober Inquirers
<pb facs="tcp:29870:9"/>
after Truth: when they shall have Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
examin'd into it, and compared
it with those Lame and Imperfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of it which are given by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Systems: and will be able to guard
it self (when clearly Apprehended) against
all Attacks, whether on the right hand
or on the left. There are some Antient
Truths conformable to the Gospel and
to the Belief and Practice of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Church, which you may here find
Reviv'd: some not so generally Lost,
Confirm'd. What is said concerning the
Incarnation and Satisfaction of Christ, the
Resurrection of the body, Christian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and the Kingdom of God in the
Restitution of Depraved Nature, is so deep
and so Fundamental; and withal so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
with that high Veneration which
every Christian ought to have for the holy
Scriptures, as may reward the Worthy and
Patient Inquirer: Besides many other
Great and useful Mysteries unfolded, and
Notions neither Wild nor Barbarous
propounded, but worthy of Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by all Christians, and all Men, for the
Humiliation of Man, the Exaltation of
God, and the Promulgation of the Gospel
of his Kingdom: to discover more deeply
<pb facs="tcp:29870:9"/>
our own Weakness and Unworthiness,
and to infuse into us a great Charity for
others, Condescention, and Compassion
towards all that bear the same Image and
Nature with our selves, and towards the
whole Groaning Creation.</p>

Of which it was Foreseen, that they should
have their Acceptation and Improvement
in this Age, and Period, by Many that

who are found walking in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

For this is the Day for Increase and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of the <hi>Sharon</hi> Glory. Who
then would refuse among this Number to

the Godhead doth flow, which will make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Plant to Bud, Flourish, and bring forth
Fruit like unto Apples of Gold, that is,
Solidly and Substantially Good.</p>
            <p>Much of this Kind and Nature you may

by one: who once knew herself to
be as a Wild Olive, cumhering the Ground,
or as a fruitless Shrub bearing only prickly
Thorns. Out of which uneasy State the
Kindness and Love of God did appear to
bring me forth, when I was about the
years of Eighteen; my first Passage being
through most terrible Conflicts: I for
same years walking through the Valley of
<pb facs="tcp:29870:11"/>
               <hi>Achor,</hi> and through the bitter Dale of
<hi>Baca,</hi> till about the Year Sixty,
being Ten years afterward, a <hi>Door of
Hope</hi> was opened, and Floods of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
came into me, with some immediate
Dictates that followed me from the Holy
Vnction, that taught me all things that
were necessary for me. Albeit I did not
hereupon for sake the Outward Ministry: but
I still waited, and sought out such as I
judged to come nearest to the Apolostical
Practice. So keeping on my Course Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
with a watchful waiting Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly,
I must own and confess to the Glory
of the Spirit's peculiar Ministration that
I found such Deeps broken up in the
Center of my own Soul, as open'd that
Divine Wisdom and Vnderstanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Knowledge of <hi>God, Christ,</hi>
and <hi>my self,</hi> as I could not any where
else meet withal. The which still engaged
me as a weaned Child to be, that I might
suck no longer from the Breast of this
Worldly Principle; or draw Water from
any other Fountain, then that which
(through rich Grace) I had already tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of. For this Scripture always much
followed me: <hi>Whom shall he teach Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and make to understand Doctrine;
<pb facs="tcp:29870:12"/>
but the weaned from the Milk, and her
that is drawn from the Breasts?</hi> Which
Observing and Obeying, the Word was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
made good to me. For the
Springs thus opening, did still arise to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Degrees. Though sometimes through
the Multiplicity of Concerns, wherein I
was circumstantiated, they would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coulour'd,
and even mudded. Which
made me seek after great Abstraction, and
Solitariness, that I might attend upon
these springs, to keep them pure and clear.</p>
            <p>So that when God did cast my Lot to
be a Widow, which was in the year 70.
this Change, bringing me first into mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Trials, did drive me into a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Vnion with mine Eternal spiritual
Husband; upon whose Care I wholly cast
my self. And then I resolved to make the
choice of <hi>Anna,</hi> to wait in the Temple of
the Lord day and night; and to be a
<hi>Widow indeed,</hi> after I had been the Wife
of a Pious Husband about five and twenty
years. For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(though offer'd for my temptation) could
move me from it: or withdraw me from

I have till this Day persued, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in: and shall so do, till I shall have
finished my Course, in the hopes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Triumphant Ioy of my
Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus worthy Reader, I have given you
a Brief Narrative of the Beginning and
Progress of my new born Life: which is
elsewhere more enlarged on in a Particular
Treatise. But this may suffice for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
into the following Volume of
my <hi>Journal.</hi> Wherein, as in a Glass,
you may see under what Leadings I have
been, where you may read the express man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and method of the Spirit's Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:
in which, I can soberly avouch
that, I my self was wholly <hi>Passive,</hi> and
the Spirit altogether <hi>Active.</hi> For my
Creaturely Being was so bounded up, as
nothing to know, or contribute hereunto;
all being laid in silence, while God was
to arise, and speak forth himself through
this Earthen and empty Vessel. For the
sake of which let no Contempt or Slight be
poured out: for it is what God in his
<hi>Wisdom</hi> did reserve to bring forth for the
<pb facs="tcp:29870:13"/>
Vse and Service of as many as are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to receive and take hold of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mysteries; for improvement and
growth to all those Degrees of Perfection,
which are herein made mention of. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for this End, <hi>Wisdom's</hi> Book of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
was opened, that by this Divine
Learning her Children might be brought
up, and made meet and ready for their
Bridegroom the <hi>Lamb.</hi> For undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Day hereof draws near: whence
these Writings having been kept in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
these Twenty Years, as taken by
me for Private Memorandums, according
as they were given day by day forth, they
are now by a strange and unexpected
Hand, being a Person of great Piety and
Worth, brought out into the Light.
Whose Fame and Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own shall out-live all
Writings of Time; and who perpetually
shall wear <hi>Love's</hi> Diadem and Crown.</p>
            <p>I have no more now but to beseech and entreat
those to whom these Sacred Truths shall come to be
Perused, that as they would reap Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
herefrom, they might fear and dread to
pass any Iudgment or Censures, in a gain-saying
way to the Spirit, the Opener of them. And let
me humbly give this my Advice, that the Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
and the highly Advanced in all Rational
<pb facs="tcp:29870:13"/>
Learning and Wisdom, and in all great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Acquirements, do become as <hi>Children,</hi>
committing themselves to <hi>Wisdom</hi> their true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they may be broughs up at her Feet.
Which they will find to turn to a thousandfold bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Account, than all that ever they have before
learnt. For I have made it my Observation, that
the Rashness of many Spirits in Condemning what
they are absolute Strangers unto, hath shut the
<hi>Gate of Wisdom</hi> upon them. Therefore this
Caution accept of from your little and low Fellow
Member, O all ye that would be growing Plants
under the Shadow of <hi>Christ</hi> the blessed Vine, that
ye refuse not to seek and draw from the Royal
Grape continually, the Iuice whereof is pure <hi>Spirit,</hi>
to strengthen you with the Balsam of Life. All this
the Child-like Spirit will come to Tast and Know:
and by obeying these Rules and Manuductions,
you will have occasion to adore, bless and magnifie
what of the Spirit of GOD shall hereunto move and
drive you. For the <hi>Commission</hi> is already gone
forth to the Angelical Messenges, that constrained
are to sound the Horn of Salvation, which is filled
with the <hi>Ghostly Oil.</hi> Which will so abundantly
flow, as to heal all the Divisions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
whereby the several Parties do wound each
other. Who would not Ambitious then be, among
these Shepherds to hold out the Love golden Crook,
to fetch in the torn, rent, and scatter'd Sheep,
and Lambs, into Christ their Princely Shepherds
Fold; where they may quietly lie down in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
Pastur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, that do Spring again as fast as
they are fed upon? The Door for Entrance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
<pb facs="tcp:29870:14"/>
stands open, let none shut it upon themselves.
For a thousand times Thousands of Blessings are
pronounc'd upon the Publishers and Promoters of
this Glorious Ministration of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And
a Cry there is now sounding from the Heavens
unto all Preachers and Teachers, of all Ranks
and Degrees, and whatever Titles and Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
they do bear, that in pure Vnity and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
they do together agree, to Declare and Held
forth the Everlasting Testimony of the <hi>Spirit of
Jesus,</hi> from the Springing Vnction, that will be the
Sealing Mark of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Day, that is now
again to be Revived. For which evermore Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>IN and about the middle of the Night,
being called out in Prayer, I did
feel a mighty throng of Invisible
Powers that filled me, so as if I had put
on the Immortal Vehicle, for the Sacred
Trinity to act in, with Love and Joy-Powers,
during sometime upon me with
great ravishing Sweets. In the Morning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29870:17"/>
this Word did me greet, When will you
begin to draw out some part of that
stock, which you have trusted with
him, who is so ready with you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
The great and mighty One
hath charged himself with a Debt unto
you, by all and every act of Faith, which
at any time had purely flown out from
either, joyning hereunto in one Spirit,
as Co-partners in Spiritual things. Then
was it further opened unto me, that we
had been careless, in that we had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in not keeping our Accounts clear,
both in relation to the Lord, and to our
selves. 1. First as to the Talent and Gift
intrusted with us, as a Provision bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon us, from our Father to traffick
withal, during such a time, as might
bring the intended encrease unto effect.
Now the Spirit who keeps the Heavenly
Records, said unto me, Search and see,
and be well advised, what hath been
freely given from your God to you.
For you are Debre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to his Grace for a
new Adoption, who hath again begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you not only to the Hope, but the real
Possession of that which belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Children. Though ye have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
understood the Royalty of your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29870:17"/>
own Beings, nor yet the greatness of
your Strength and Might. For be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
upon this New Creation score, in
which ye now are considered, thereto doth
belong <hi>Sion</hi>'s rich Provision. Now
then it is but meet, as dear and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Children, to keep your Accounts
clear, and to charge your selves with so
much stock of Life and Spirit, as ye
have received. It must be called out for,
and nothing of this Treasury must lie
idle or useless: but all is still expected
upon the encrease, till ye come to be a
numerous Seed. 2. In the Second place,
said the Spirit, Consider and call over
what you have adventured, and returned
back into that great City, wherefrom the
rich Exchange of Spiritual Goods is to be
produced. Know for your great Comfort,
that ye have a faithful &amp; able Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in this high and Heavenly Country,
that you may fully assure your selves of
great gain in Spirituals, according to the
kind, of what the high Region doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
Which is of that unknown and
excellent value, as these Worldly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
will not care for to purchase,
because they have no Judgment of such
invisible mystical Treasury. But to you who
are only for the Heavenly Merchandize,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29870:18"/>
more Bills of Store shall yet be given
forth. Fear not to make fresh char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon that great Trustee, who
commandeth all in Wisdom's vast Bank.
Nothing is more pleasing then to make
out what resteth due unto you, upon
the Spirit's Births Account. Little
have you examined how Matters and
Things of this nature, stand betwixt
God and you: Who thinks it no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
to his Soveraign Greatness,
to be endebted unto such, as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
Lading back again on Faith's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
All which hath been committed
in trust, with this Charge to traffick with
no other; for it would be an Evil to
spend your Corn, Wine, and Oyl, upon
the fine trimmed Harlot; which yet being
so high in Appearance, is more then half
divided in the true Love's Property.
Therefore be wise for your selves, and
scatter not, till ye have reaped and got
your own Crop in. Hearken then, and
observe this weighty Rule, to carry all
this high Spiritual Commerce in the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness
of the Eternal Spirit. There are
but few in this professing Age, that do
understand the rate of that Precious
Stone ye are Adventurers for, with all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29870:18"/>
those other Celestial Ornaments for to
bring in against the Bridal Day; which
will not be solemnized with the Lamb,
till ye have fetched in all your Eternal
Revenue. Therefore be not afraid to
urge, and to account with your God, for
what the Spirit of Faith hath sent out,
for the bringing in that which is of the
greatest weight and consideration that
hath been known, since the World of
Creatures hath been existing.</p>

               <head>Ianuary the 7th. 1676/7.</head>
               <p>THis Night I found the Life-Center
much open, and the Oracle for
to sound clear, and somewhat to talk
with me from the Heavenly Sphear.
The sum of which was to perswade unto
a decease, from all that low activity and
concern about things and matters T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial.
For as I was mourning in the
feeling sence of that dark Stone, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Superiour part down, upon
every slight occasion, ministred from
this Principle; Which I found in my
very tast, to be as brinish Salt Waters,
that fretted, and eat upon that interiour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29870:19"/>
vigorous part of the Spirit, so feebling it
as its force was evidently felt to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
until the <hi>Shiloh</hi>-Spring did open
again. Which washed up the healing
Stone, which put all into place and order,
which by the Corrupter was made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased.
Then this Word spake to me,
Dost thou think to recover Immortality
of Life, with that Inheritour, who doth
belong unto it, while there is a divided
Eye and Ear, which still open are to
see, and hear all those Charming Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities,
which for this Earthly Kingdom
do plead, and do engage you still here
to be Traffickers, from which ye are
prohibited by Mount-<hi>Sion</hi> Laws. Is
not Wisdom's Merchandize more worthy
to be all in your Eye, who will assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find you daily employ, as to work
off your selves, from all those Habits,
and Customs, as have been brought in
Traditionally from the Fall. From
which ye are redeemed, as ye do feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the true Mystical Passover, which will

to that pure thing, which ye do feel stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from the light Region. This hath
gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> sufficiency to clear that evil stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nature, from out of which strange
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29870:19"/>
Essences do so turbulently arise to annoy
and disturb that, which would be free
from all Sins Casualties, reigning in the
Princely Spirit of what will become the
absolute King of Righteousness. Who
hath already set a Foot upon your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Earth, for this very end, that
his Throne and Dominion might be so
fixed, within the circumfering Powers of
your Wills, that so Time may be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, from an entire Act going forth
from this Soveraignty: which in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsical
way will bring all into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that is within. He will first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the Judgment, for cleansing the
floor: make but the inside clean and pure,
then Power will soon be known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
whereby a Body suitable to
such a Spirit, may come to be perfectly
framed. As thus if the Pith of a Tree
be by its Life extensive, it makes the
Bark, through which it riseth fresh,
fruitful, and beautiful; that so you may
easily conclude, that a Life-Sap is vailed
under the Bark, but it is not perceiveable,
till it shoots forth it self, getting
through every branch and twig: even so
it is in you, considered as Trees of a
new Plantation, in whom the Spirit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29870:20"/>
riseth, as an essential Pith of Life, and
distributeth it self through every Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
permitting nothing to mingle with
it, that should abate its vigorous pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
for to assimulate and qualifie the
very outward Bark or Body into a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Appearance and palpable Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
The meaning of the Spirit, as to
fruitfulness, is not only the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Birth-degrees of Regeneration,
and here to stop, as in measures of
Love, Joy, Faith, Hope, Meekness and
Patience, which are the first Fruits of
the Spirit. But hereunto are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Fruits yet more super-eminent, as
the product of these. When so ripened,
as each one their Seed do shed into the
pure Heart, whereinto the Blood of the
New-Testament is poured in. From
hence now it is, saith the living Word,
that a Spiritual Body will be driven
forth, all in the Heavenly Form, acting
forth in another kind of fruitfulness,
then the foregoing. As thus, a Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Creature worketh and produceth acts
answerable to his Animal rational Life,
which may be justifiable before Men: and
nothing beyond his Life-Sphere is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But now from a new-made Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29870:20"/>
that deriveth a Birth so high, as
nothing less then God's own Likeness is
to be evidenced in it; This must needs
work like it self in various Powers, of
another sort of miraculous Fruitfulness,
by which Jesus through this Ghostly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Body is glorified.</p>

               <head>Ianuary the 12th. 1676/7.</head>
               <p>IN the Night there was presented unto
me, two Forms very displeasing to
my Eye, being Cloathed with a Hairy
Goats-Skin, where spots and botches
did appear so unlovely, as I was much
disgusted at the sight of them. But
while I was viewing them, first the one
rent this outward Deformity in twain,
and likewise the other following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the first, did also rend open.
And I beheld two sweet amiable Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
came forth from within this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Figure; but at first sight they
were as Babes still-born. Upon which
I took up one, and it soon revived with
all motions of Life, and answerably the
same vigorous Spirit manifested it self
in the other, so as I saw them able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29870:21"/>
stand upon their Legs, and so the Vision
shut up in the Formality of it, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self in the Spirituality, as I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
waited. After a little season, the
Spirit thus spake within me, What have
you seen in these two strange pieces of
Deformity, but a rough and unclean
Vestment, that is so ignominious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and see your own vile Bodies thus
pourtraied out, while that ye do bear
those uncomly Shapes; which as a Vail,
shall rend away, that so the truly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Ghostly Body may appear.
Who is, as those innocent and all-beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Babes that have been shut up under
a Covert, as in a twofold Body. As
first, that thick and cloudy smothering
Body of Sin. Secondly, the very visible
form of Corporiety, which is but a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
Image, being the product of a
degenerate Spirit. Which with the
other must be put off. For corruptible
Humanity in its fleshly Figure is too mean
for the high Birth degree of the Eternal
Spirit: Though it may be suffered for a
time as a disguised Cloathing, till that
which is born without Sin, be strong
enough to break through the rough
humane, and Animal Beast, that was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29870:21"/>
ever designed for a Sacrifice: That so all
brought in by the Fall, might come to
be anatomized; that in the room thereof
another Body might rise, not only like
what was in <hi>Paradise,</hi> but one Degree
yet higher, according as your Jesus hath
assumed a more transparent Body. As
these things were plainly discoursed of
to my Spirit, an Objection did arise, How
this twofold Body should come to be so
demolished, while we live in this visible
Sphere, as no more to appear in its sinful
Frailty, or Elementary Ponderosity. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not heard or seen any one, that hath
yet so put off the vile Body, though
hereunto incited, and prophesied of, that
such a Change is upon the Inward, and
Outward Man to come, but it hath not yet
happened in this Orb. Nay, our Lord
Jesus himself did not alter his humane
Figure to endure, till he had ascended
out of all mortal sight; and though after his
Crucifixion, he did appear, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at pleasure, yet he always assumed
a <hi>body</hi> like to ours, as bearable to the view
of those whom he delighted to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto, in, and after his Resurrection.
Therefore though he had no Body of Sin
to put off, yet he had a Body of Mortality,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:29870:23"/>
which was not put off to the humane
Eye, till he gave up the Ghost of his
Animal Life upon the Cross. All which
strengthning the Argument, that our
Corporeity hardly in this Region, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
of such a Transformation, as
thereby to pass out by and through a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
airy Body, in and among the high
enthroned Powers and Dignities resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> This Doubt
lay much upon my Spirit, importuning
a clear resolve, that the mind of my God
herein might be expresly revealed,
through an immediate dictate, which
thus far I obtained. Oh Soul, true it
is, no one President there hath been, that
hath so wrought out the very Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of all Impurity, as to assume a Body of
that Celestial Clarity, as therein to walk
up and down among Mortals; yet that
makes not against the possibility hereof,
for there is that to come, that yet never
was in existency. Which still will steal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the World by degrees, as in the
successive Ages, some one miraculous
thing or other will be produced, which
was not before. For this very Unbelief
hath sealed up the mighty Birth-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power, which still cries, How can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29870:23"/>
such Transmutations be, as to come
forth another Spirit, actuating it self in a
suitable Body? Ah what Doubtings, and
Debates have been here about it? So
that Age upon Age hath nothing seen of
the Resurrection-state, because afraid to
destroy the Body of Sin. Which is the
first Alteration, that must be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the outward Body can be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And know this further, whoever
doth attain to the one, hath Power and
All-sufficiency for the other, as they shall
see it expedient, to Metamorphose their
gross Corporeity. And though your
Jesus did not alter his Humane Shape,
into any visible Body of Glory, it was
not through any deficiency, that he
could not do it, but it was his pleasure
that he would not do it. Who knew
his Times and Seasons, when, and for
what Ends such Transfigurations were
needful. He coming into this World
upon Suffering account, that thereby
Concuering he might have all Power,
to convey such a Spirit, as might form to
it self such a proportionable Body, for
all such as do give themselves to be
made like unto him, as he is now in a
glorified state. But your further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29870:24"/>
is, that if possibly you should
attain hereunto, this World would be
no fit Principle, for such transparent
Spirits, and Bodies for to live in? The
Inhabitants here could neither bear your
Transparency, nor you their gross Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity,
attended traditionally with all
Evil of Sin in some more refined, in
others visibly lascivious, running into
all Excess, from which the true Eagle-Body
will mount away. But this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that while ye have a Work and
Service of God to do here in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
you will not want the Fence of
a Spiritual Body, to go in and out, to
meet the Sacred <hi>Trinity</hi> in the serene Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
And as <hi>Moses</hi> did, when he did
talk immediately with God, was then
put into a shining Body, that was not
known or understood, which was laid
aside, as a Garment for that purpose,
that so he might speak with the Most
Holy; but as soon as he did come out
from that Holy Place and Heavenly
Parley, he then put on that Form, in
which he might be known of the lower
Orb. Think it not incredible, that
this, and much more, is again to be
done, as your Jesus did often change his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29870:24"/>
Body; though it was not known to the
vulgar Eye. Doubt not but such wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sufficiency will display it self from
the pure contaction of the Sapphire Body.
Therefore proceed to keep among the
Immaculate and Just Ones, according to
that present transferring Power, which
comply'd withal, will produce a change
internally, till a Body be assumed invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
as shall rend the outward Temple-Vail.
Then the Ark of the Living Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
shall be known, read, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
yet of none but the Disciplehood.
As your Lord did only appear unto his
own in his risen Body; so shall it be when
you so risen are, as to descend from the
Heavenly Sphere.</p>

in that near approach, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Service, in all the Tabernacle-Worship,
wherein we come to bow our
selves before the Most High. Therefore
it was asked me, how I did think it was
possible for to see the glorified Person
of my Jesus, till I had put on the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Robe of a New Body, he being now
ascended into the most Holy: Waiting
there till the whole Priesthood called
and anointed to be of the same Order
with himself, do enter upon the same
terms; having offered up in Sacrifice, the
vile reproachful Body of the Flesh,
through the same Eternal Spirit, by
which your Jesus offered up his Body vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly:
as by a violent Death, so yours
by a voluntary, mystical Transformation,
working invisibly. Then what a most
holy <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>-Spirit will ye pass,
into the Heavenly Place withal, to effect
in the true and eternal Tabernacle: where
the unchangeable Priestood is known in
all the Celestial Orders, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing

of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and to proclaim in mighty

upon you, that their will need no more

the Law of the Spirit-written in the
Heart, as there will be no more a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For by this Fiery Law proceeding, the Law
of Sin within the Members, where ever
stirring, will hereby be consumed. For
it is no more a weak, literal Precept,

Law-giver writes and engraves himself,
as an Endless Power of Life, to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

lay hid, as the Apostle himself had
not fathomed: But it was shewed to me,
that it was of great use to know and

because thereto we had great reference.
For he had not only the denomination
of a Priest to pronounce Blessings, but a
King to whom Tribute was paid, for

had taken, and there Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of <hi>Salem:</hi> thus far the Scriptures

                  <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Second Person,
who had his Existency from all Eternity,
and was in a high Priestly Order from
the time of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and did Officiat
in the Heavenly Sanctuary, and real
Tabernacle in the Heavens. Whereof
<hi>Moses</hi> had a Sight and Pattern given him
to figure out according to the low Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
which the Church in the
Wilderness then stood in. But this great
<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> incarnated himself in Flesh,
that he might visibly make an Offering
thereof, to testifie that an end must be
to that weak, corruptible, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
state, as now henceforth is to be

he had assumed, that so that mean and

               <p>In the forepart of the Night, being
newly fallen asleep, I saw the Heavens as
it were part, and rend, and mighty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
in it. The earthly Inhabitants
in great Trouble, running up and down,
as fearing some unexpected Change was
coming upon them. Which awaked me,
and there was immediately presented unto
my view, as breaking through a bright Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
two glorified Bodies, of a bright
Beryl Colour, in such a wonderful Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture,
as did excel all, I had formerly
of this Nature in Vision seen. Upon
which my Eye kept fixed without any
surprize or fear, and still it was brought
nearer. The one seemed in a Manly
Vissage, and the other as a Woman very
Lovely in her Countenance; then soon
after two or three more broke forth, and
joyned themselves unto them, as in like
glorified Figures. This Sight was so
pleasing, that I could not but Pray, Oh
that we might be added unto them. For
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29870:27"/>
it was said, Behold this is the Lamb and
his Bride, which first I did see. Oh this
great Vision had so mighty an Influence
upon my Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as grievous it was still, for
to be confined in the Corporeal Body,
only hourly waiting for to see its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
But it was said, Abide Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
till your Salvation shall be
fully wrought out, then you shall
swiftly be cloathed with the self same
Body, all Spiritual bright, and airy, as
my Bride, for to unite in one Body with
me. Then I replyed, Ah my Lord,
why must this Translation be so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sought, and still prolonged. It was
again answered, it was so considerable
a Change, as could not be without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through many further Degrees.
For Sin and Mortality would not be so
easily vanquished, while we did abide
in this tempting Region.</p>

               <p>This Morning it was much upon my
Spirit, how to quicken our Progress, so
as to arrive to that Nuptial Conjunction,
which did open unto me in the Heavens.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29870:28"/>
The Spirit sent forth deep and strong
Invocations for the Consummation of
this high Matrimonial Unity, that so
we might together display our Loves and
Joys to each other, in that Spicy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
Bed of the Celestial Orb. Oh
the Eccho's which I did hear in me sound,
the Spirit called to the Bride to descend
down, the Bride called for the Spirit to
ascend. Thus cry upon cry did, as a pure
cloudy Incense, send out, which brought
this Answer down, Oh ye who are in the
betrothed Spirit, why may not the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
hereof, yet a while stay your most
eager and Spiritual Passions of Love, till
such time as your Vessels of Clay be
turned into the fine Ophire Gold, through
the working forth of that Saphire Stone
that is formed in you. Which shall
work through all in its degrees, till it
hath brought you up to that perfect Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as ye may make challenge with holy
Boldness to the Marriage-state, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that pleasant and glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
which you did see in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
Which was shewn to you for this
very end, that so you might see your
own Nuptial Day solemnized. Before
the accomplishing of which, yet great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29870:28"/>
Commotions will be permitted, as you
did see in the Vision. See first, what is
still left alive of your dying part that
will mutiny. For the Sensitive Life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consent that ye should be married
away out of their known Linage and
Country; Therefore they will lie in
wait to entercept all Messages, and Love-Tokens
from your <hi>Immanuel,</hi> to prevent
the success of so great a Wedlock change.
Therefore I the Spirit of your Lord, do
warn you, that you turn away from all
self, and creaturely Parly. The Serpent
also will subtlely back with Arguments
in forms of Flesh, that so ye might grow
cold in your Love, and slack in your
Faith: but spur forward, and faint not,
for the everlasting Gate is set open by
Soveraign Command. The Trumpet doth
daily sound to enter into Love's Holy
Ground, where only the Friends of the
Bridegroom shall attend you, at the
Banquetting Feast of Bread and Wine.
Now away, and draw from all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
things of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and you shall meet
assuredly your <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King, with
a full Cup of Blessing. This receive as a

               <p>About the Morning-break, as I was
contemplating upon the change of the
Body for Translation. A further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
was given with Joy and Peace
unutterable, in hope of this Glory to
be revealed. My Spirit praying, that
we might obtain Grace, for to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of the same Order with our
great <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> This Word immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
sprung, saying, The way and manner
for it, hath been most evidently set forth,
and plainly taught you, as my Spirit
could demonstrate it unto you. You can
find no surer Footing, then first to be
found, in the walk of Death. Trace it
then so throughly, till you can see no
more Earth, yield ye up the utmost ends
without any reserve. For no mingling
state after Death, but all immaculate
the: Feast of Tabernacles to celebrate
within the most Holy Place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fear not to pass through this Valley,
for I the Spirit of Truth will assuredly
finish this Mystery, because you have
applied your Hearts to me, having
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29870:29"/>
sought Death as a Treasury, trying all
ways and means for to expire out. But
as a deadly Enemy, that is loath to be
conquered, it still revives, which makes
you to suspect, that you shall never get
rid of this grand and last Enemy, but it
will still hang a weight disgracing, and
separating from your high Priesthood.
But seeing you have cast your selves
wholly upon me your Comforter, to be
advised in this matter. Now then
know, I will cast you, with the free Act
of your own Wills, into a slumbering
Trance, that so ye shall gradually dye
away, as all sensitive Operations shall
be wonderfully suspended, which must
be done actually through the disposing
and yielding up the Life of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Body. That Life must dye,
because of the habitual course of Sin.
After that way of dying, of which it is
written, I am dead and crucified; yet
I live through that Life, which swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
up Mortality. Even so likewise
the Time shall come, when ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckon
your selves dead, and freed from
the Body of Sin, when you shall lie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and still in the sweet and pleasant
Trance, as fled away from out of this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29870:30"/>
Principle, no more to be known or
seen, but as in the Heavenly Form of a
Powerful Body, to work the mighty
Works of God your Father in. It is
true, what Eye hath yet seen this, the
Ear hath only heard hereof, but who hath
come to believe the possibility of such
a Transformation? Oh but Faith gives a
mighty heave hereunto, now as it hath
been your Cry. Who, and how shall ye
be delivered from the Body of Sin and
Death, and get a thorough Pass from
Death, unto such a fluent Vehicle,
whereby ye may be able to say, neither
Heights nor Depths, Light or Darkness,
neither Earth or Air shall be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
you from the Love, nor yet from
those immediate accesses into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Places, as belonging to that Royal
Priesthood? Truly it is your Father's
pleasure, for to bring you hereunto, not
only in the flight of your Spirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Body adjoyning consonant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
because a naked Spirit cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and effect such Effects and Acts, as
a Body adhearing thereunto. Therefore
see and believe it of necessity, for to be

Glory, and thereof take, and bring

of the Lord, that have united with
one accord: fall on hard and close this
Work. Continually give up your selves,
and lo, I will break for you all the Bands
of Sin and Death, that so the pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which even was at work in you,
may assume its own Body of Spiritual
ability to pass, and enter, where nothing
of Corporeity can be admitted. Your
Priestly portion is for such a time reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
whenas you shall come into the
most holy of all, for then you will have
Boldness to make all your own Demands;</p>

to plead in the shining Face of a

of Glory will very well know you, and

The Situation of the Great King is seen

forward, for this Verily is the Mark I
your Death-conqueror do set before

while ye are ranging and pudling in, I
cannot be so clearly seen, nor afford to
give out those more eminent and choice
things, because you are not yet sapera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the vile Body, that so ye may
be redeemed from all that is of a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Conversation. For indeed I would
wholly appropriate you for my self,
who being in a glorified state, must of
necessity glorifie you, before I can shew my
self in such a familiarity as is so desirable.
For when I was in the World, for the
accomplishing of the State of Humiliation,
then the human Figure was proper, for
to unfold suitably the Mystery of the
Most High, and to relate it as Bearable
in that Age. But now as a Prince and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29870:31"/>
Shepherd of a glorified Fold, I set in
Heavenly Places, to call my own by Name,
to pass away out of their dark Cloudy

away, and fall down as Houses of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as it hath been hitherto universally. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this superiour Change hath not
been believed in, nor the Foundation by
a thorough Death, been understood in
order hereunto, or surely laid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Rising Body that is to swallow
up Mortality, hath not been manifested,
but now observe those Deaths and Life-Rules,
which have been set so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before you, and you may possibly be
changed into such a vigorous Spirit and
Body, as to pass through that Glassy Sea:
which is so brickle, which whoever can
stand upon it, are probationed indeed
to enter into farther Degrees of Glory,
all in Light, the God of Light to see
without any other Medium. Ah Lord,
even so let it be.</p>

               <p>Oh from hence I did see with what
Bodies we must enter withal, into the
Mystery, that is on the other side of the
Glassy Sea, for there the Thrones were
shewed me, that were placed for the
Conquerors. Who could be able to say
with their Jesus, I was dead and slain,
but now Life is rising evermore, then
also will follow the Keys of Death and
Life, to open and shut Heaven and Hell,
as the Hand of the Spirit will. Thus
having great and manifold Discoveries,
of what was to be possessed after Death,
we came easily henceforth, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to all the deep Demensions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
beloning. For the Lord had dealt
with us and carried it much after the
manner as he did with <hi>Moses,</hi> who upon
the Mount of Vision, had shewn unto
us the New Heavens with all their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
and Glories, also with the New
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and King thereof; and
though <hi>Moses</hi> was prohibited entring
into that, which was but a Shadow of
what he really passed into by Death's
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29870:32"/>
Transmutation, yet God did him no
wrong by all that, thereby to translate
him out of the Mortal Principle, into
that of Duration: which he had often
Sights, Gusts, and Tasts of, while he
was in the Corporeal Figure, and he
enjoyed the Image of good things to
come, as he passed through the Worldly
Sanctuary.</p>

will have, will you not desire, and
most freely obey, as my Servant <hi>Moses</hi>
did to go up, and dye on Mount <hi>Nebo.</hi>
That is, take leave of this Earthly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and go apart from all, that
still would invite you to abide with
them. For if you do not withdraw out
of their sight, you will never be able
voluntarily to dye, while they do see
any strength, vigour, or force to be in
your natural Ability, as the beloved
<hi>Moses</hi> had. They will be crying, What
need is there of such a dying, as no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29870:33"/>
more to be seen or known by us, after
the manner of what hath been; so as
without you follow this Example, to
go apart, you will hardly dye away
quietly, but you will be disturbed to
bring your Life back again, so as it will be
a lingring dying Death: therefore well
consider this impeding thing, and that
you might not be alone, in a suffering dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
state, I have provided one, that will be
a dying-Mate with you, to support and
strengthen each other, till a Dissolution
is finished. Then you may totally cast
your selves upon your dying Beds, there
waiting for the Hour of your Change.
The utmost grievousness of it will be,
but as a slumbering Trance, that will
make you forget this Principle, with all
its good or evil Properties, all things
will be alike unto you, because gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto your own People in the Land
of Light, where more transparent things
will take up your Minds, and satisfie
your Sights. There be certain measures
and rules, whereby ye may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no your approaching End be
near.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Consider the Years and Date of
your Age: there is a set and appointed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29870:33"/>
time for Spiritual Death, as well as for
the Natural: The bounds thereof are
determined, though few, or rarely any,
have tasted this Spiritual Death, before
their outward Man hath been broken by
Natural Death. Yet some known, and
some unknown Examples hereof have
been, as <hi>Enoch, Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> with the
Lord of Life, who though he suffered
Death, yet rising in that Body again,
was with it for a certain time conversant
in the Earth, to testifie another Change
was to pass thereupon, or else he never
could have stood upon the Sea of Glass,
without being changed into another Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
meet for Mount <hi>Sion</hi> Light. More
also have found this Translation, though
happily concealed. But it is enough
that you know by what means it may
possibly be reached, through the serious
disposing of your selves unto this dying
state. Making observation by self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
of those Signs and Marks, that
you may certainly conclude, that the time
of your departure is at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Bounds and Time,
without all controversie the Body of Sin
is old enough to dye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is not few, but
many and evil have been its days, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29870:34"/>
have been spent unprofitably; therefore
the Life thereof, is not to be prolonged, but
to seek the cutting of it off, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Member, with all that do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto it. As the vile Body which
through the corrupt Principle entring in,
changed the very Form, into the like
deformed Image, which being brought
back again unto a Nullification, then
the Eternal Life will spring, and set all
in order, as to the very outward Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle
again.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Symptom you are to take
notice of is this, how your Life-Pulse
beats, weak or strong, that is, whether
the Life and Vigour of the Heart be much
deaded and spiritless to all, whatever can
be named, that hath its Root from this
degenerated Principle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Symptom is this, do you
feel your Stomach and Appetite fully
gone, that yon cannot digest any of the
Fruits that is brought forth by the Sweat
of the Brow, and Toil of the Hands, all
which was the product of the Curse.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Symptom is this, nay more,
try your selves, that to all which seems
to carry a more refined excellency in it,
are you able to distinguish it, as garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29870:34"/>
only with somewhat out of <hi>Paradise,</hi>
but mixed with the wild and sowre
Vintage of this World, whether you
do feel real disgusts and loathing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> place, this is another pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Sign, the Life-Breath is much
pent and stopped. The thick Air and
unsavoury Fumes of this worldly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
have near stifled the very Life-Breath;
so as it will be unbearable, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing at all in this whole Universe
pleasant unto you, because of this your
Spiritual Sickness, which presageth
Death to be so near. Can you now but
give a real Proof of such languishing
Symptoms, then may you hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
a glorified Translation is hereby
working out, where nothing more that
is uneasie shall be felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning some means to this perfect
Death, consider these that follow.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> Let your Bridegroom Spirit
you, who are thus truly dying, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
you wisely, to put your visible Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
into order, as only using them, as
for a meer constrained necessity, during
the time of your sick mortal state, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
expecting that their Date is wearing

have no need.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then yet again, take this
Rule from your dear Comforter, who
would have you finish all things, that
may be in order to this accomplishment,
of what may make perfect, and entire,
lacking nothing, that may make comely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Place, There is another
Act as necessary to be performed as this,
in passing away, and making a disposal,
as your last Will, of all that you possess
in, and from the Spirit of this mutable
Region, that doth constitute and give
forth to the fallen Ones, their several
Portions, by and through the visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,
that work uncessantly in
all the Rational and Sensitive Faculties, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29870:35"/>
also from the subtle introducement of
the Prince of Darkness, who thereby
holds the Life captive, that it cannot so
easily come to its total decease. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give up all, as they have proceeded
from the Earthly Rudiments, let them
inherit them as their own again. For
the Spiritual Birth and Body, that is to
take place upon the Remove of this,
hath more high graduated Intellectuals
and Faculties supersensually engraven
upon the Mind, which will always gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Crystal Source of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense

               <p>In the first part of the Night, my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
were wholly intent upon that
Way, Order, and Method, by which a
Decease might be to the Body of Sin.
For the Spirit intimated and declared
plainly, that while it was alive, there
could be made no Claim to Mount <hi>Sion's</hi>
Revenue. For as much as the wise and
holy God, and our Father, had made a
Settlement, according to eternal Counsel
upon the true Birth-Heirs, begotten of
the Virgin-Spirit, who only the Eternal
Goods can inherit. Now then so long as
the false, evil, intruding Birth reigneth
in the Mortal Body, the Heavenly Off-spring
must needs be kept down, and
made to serve in a strange Country. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their first-born Lord, <hi>Esau,</hi> that
is so potent and great in this earthly
Principle, that until such time, as the
<hi>Iacob</hi>'s Birth is grown strong and mighty,
he cannot look the supplanted <hi>Esau</hi> in the
Face. Therefore full armed with God's
Host we must maintain our Battel, and
be in no fear, but the <hi>Edomites</hi> will fall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29870:37"/>
down, when they shall see the Angel of
the Most Holy with his Flaming Sword
passing before us, to make our way into
our own Land, where our Inheritance
doth lie. God saying unto us, Come return
unto your Rock, and there I will hide
you, till the Fury, Wrath and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
shall pass away: and I will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you and Eternal Cleft of Stillness.
Where secured ye shall be, as in Death's
sweet passive Liberty; so as ye shall no
more hear the noise of the pransing War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
who always is annoying, while he
can find you on this side of Death.
Therefore see it of necessity, ye must
from Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> into this Rock ascend;
where buried as out of sight ye shall be:
for your Dying shall only be Hiding, till
such time as the Life, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Deity shall re-enter as a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Breath, all fully to Spirit you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
That so the very Nature and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Rocky precious Stone may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
in you: Then when-ever you will
smite this Rock with the Rod of the
Spirit, it shall gush out Rivers of Living
Waters, to be come in each of you, a
Springing Well. That so you may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the mighty Name of him, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29870:37"/>
hath gotten unto a Life and Victory, by
lying close hid, as in the Heart of this

my Bed, waving Clouds descend
upon me, one after another, as the Night
and the Day, dark Clouds, and Light
swiftly following one after another. At
which I was somewhat amazed, till I
did understand the meaning hereof.
Which was thus manifested, that the
black Clouds were hard pursuing, as the
dark Shadow of Death, that still would
be enterposing with the light Cloud,
which presented the Life, that was to
reign over Death. I saw the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was this Day set before me, a
Crystal Gate, by which Glassy clearness
we might see, and take a measuring view
of that wonderful place: Wherein was
the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi>-Seat, with all her
Temple-Magnificency; which was shewn
to be the high Serene Majesty, who as
circling Bow all of Saphire Stone, did
include such as could pass through chis
Gate. For only those true and Sacred
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29870:38"/>
Worshippers, who with the Lamb had
overcome, could stand within that
Temple, as Kindly Priests of the high
Tabernacle-Order for to be. Then this
Word hereupon followed, What have
you through this Glassy Gate beheld,
but such things as might make you strive
hard, and even force an entrance within
the Glassy Screen. For these Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are given forth from the Celestial
Globe, to set a Work that transforming
Stone, that must all-power fully Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
the gross fleshly Body; that no way
can pass through here, till it is changed
like to that Door, which you did see:
which till then is, as a bright Bar of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
This Privilege only you have,
a Prospect, as <hi>Moses</hi> had, of the Figurative
Land: but hereinto you can by no means
come, till you have endured the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
Fire of the Saphire Stone. Which
will be given for to do the last finishing
part, that so Transubstantiation may be
set afoot. The Worthy will certainly
it see, who are found in the Life of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
resolving to beat down that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
Body, which is all the Alienation
that separates you from your God and
this Holy Place, which within the pure
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29870:39"/>
Gate hath been viewed. These words
lay up, as from the Holy and Just One,
and go forward to this high Procedure.
As not being satisfied with these transient
Discoveries, no further then as Mediums
of Provocation, to call up all your
Powers: and thereby to encourage that
other, who is to be for me a Witness in
Priestly Power, working in his measure
steadily, till the Shadow of Death shall
fully flee away. That so successively each
one may be cloathed substantially with a
Body declaratively, which will be God's
mark to testifie, who are partakers of
the First Resurrection: Therefore set
your Hearts hereunto fully, for your

gave me to see what was in Bondage,
and what was free, that would not now
be any longer in Bondage to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of Sin. Having that Word
brought to me, to search and find out
that Salt Stone, that would make all
perfectly sound and savoury, which the
Corrupter had most subtlely defiled. For
I saw for every Sacrifice to be salted with
this Stone of Fire was absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for in it lay hid all Perfuming Sweets.
Therefore an express Charge came down
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29870:40"/>
to re-assume it to our selves, as the choice
Altar-Stone, where the unknown Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
should be written. Oh then
said the Spirit of Truth, ye cannot ask
any thing fruitlessly, as ye have done:
do but will, and it shall be done. Oh
that the Most High could have such as
were so fixed in Body, Soul and Spirit,
to this all-seasoning Stone of Wisdom,
as to trust them with this Jewel of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
so as to leave all Matters, whether
great or small with them, in whom his
Heart might rest: That all, and every
Circumstance of things might be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for those Ends and Services, which
might agree with the In-written Name, that
as a Fountain of Oyl doth run into those
Vessels, which are seasoned by this
Salt Stone of Fire. For know in Verity,
the most Holy hath no pleasure to see
his own in this World, to live and walk
up and down in so mean a Capacity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
to set a Foot, or Hand, to what
lieth in the Divine Magia Root. Which
you may lawfully stir up, since for you
Christ the Lord hath made the Way, by
ascending on High; for to subdue all
things under him, that so of the same
Power he might subordinately pass away
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29870:40"/>
from himself unto you. Who calleth
you to draw out the Purchase of his
Death, by like dying, and by like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Living, according to the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
quality. Which by stirring up,
may effect thereby great and mighty
things, answerably to the Wisdom and
Soveraignty of Holiness, which all as in
Inclosure doth lie about this holy thing
for you. You little know what a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
is nigh to you: but your Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Will hath yet somewhat that doth
clog its Wheel, which is designed for to
be the running Chariot, whereunto the
Spirit of Infinite Might must joyn.
Now then by all means, seek the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralling
of your Will; for could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
mingle therewithal, but what did
fall from the pure Deity, how would you
find God all-active in and through you?
But herein lieth the great Nicety to keep
the Will-Spirit untouched, that nothing
from the Bryery Root doth twist about
it, if this is kept spotless and free, what
may you not find Power to do with the
Most Holy. Observe and keep this great
Secret, it is from great and high Love,
that I have given an insight to thee, that
so all Offences may be removed, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29870:41"/>
would you should come to Reign over
all of the Earthly. Further of this, I
besought the Lord, might be revealed:
For the great Depravation was in the
matter of the Will; for it was shewn me,
it was unequally yoked, and had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
strange Flesh, from which there must
be a Separation by Death. Had not the
Royal Will yielded to the tempting <hi>Eve,</hi>
but had kept its Priority, how great and
mighty a Lord might Man have been in
and over the whole Creation of God,
having absolute Power in himself. But
hearkening to the Dalilah, that is still
acted by the Serpent-like Spirit to this
day, it becometh successively despoiled of
this Lock of Strength and Power: and
so hereby the Shame of our Nakedness
doth appear, as to what Cloathing we
might have been made known in. Had
not <hi>Adam</hi> thus lost his Dignity, and so
hereby brought forth Fruit unto Death,
running through all his Posterity, in,
and after the Similitude of his Sin. Which
hath brought Impotency, deflowring us
of all that Spiritual Might; of this we
need no other Proof, then what we
do each one carry about with us. But
the great Thing is, Oh thou who art
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29870:41"/>
promised as the mighty Restorer of this
Breach, What must we do? who are so
unavoidably overtaken, with the same
Thral, and come bound with the same
twisting Cords? which hath altogether
weakened the force of our Wills? To
this great Query, as I humbly pursued,
so I had my desire resolved.</p>

               <p>This know, and well consider, that
your Original is from high extracted
Matter, which is so Eternal, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dye: but it stands at the pleasure of
the Will, what way it will drive forth it
self into. For now it is a distinct Essence,
and had it not been corrupted from that

never have fallen into such an dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Power is so withdrawn, as ye have no
defence, nor can make, against those
numerous Circumstances of Evils, that
do conspire, where they may find degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

then yet, for a more clear and perfect

is to be done, that the choice facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Will, may come to regain its

all powerful success as before, it was
enthral'd by the tempting <hi>Eve.</hi> No
other way there is, but for the Will to
be born again, that thereby it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
its Virgins Might and Force, then
every right Essence will move and open
from pure Nature's Center. This Birth
is not according to the Will of Man, but
God. Who out and from an infinite
Pity and Love is come by Water, Blood,
and Spirit to recover and lift up your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasped
Wills, that so they may stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their true native Prerogative, being
also set free from the flattering Dalilah,
which includes the whole variety of all
attractive Delights from this Principle,
that as with Cords hath bound the Will
down. Oh now then, as beloved of
your God, for ever drink in this Word of
Counsel, and herein joyn and work with
the Spirit of your Lord Jesus, who
is come to perswade and allure you, to
fuffer joyfully the breaking up of your
whole Earthly Family. Which only
consisteth of what is indged but lawful
and expedient by the false Seers, who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29870:42"/>
are <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Merchants. But to you, I
have other things revealed, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
you to be at variance with whatever
will not consist with the new-born Will.
Who is to be matched with her,
who is the real Bride and Heir, to whom
a great Retinue doth belong; of which
Family you are to bear the Name
only. Therefore let it not seem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
to rend and divide from what is
of this evil World; for verily hereby as
God is true, ye shall sustain no loss:
For your Superiour Will, will hereby be
so free, chast, pure, and mighty, as by
its Conjunction with its Bride, may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
into a wonderful fruitfulness,
more terrible then whatever hath been

               <p>It was further discoursed to me the
great and mighty Effects, that would
accrue to that Will, which could from its
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29870:43"/>
Original Purity spring, passing as a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Arrow with mighty swiftness, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thereof touching by the way to
spoil its force; and with a fixed Eye,
dertermining to bring about that very
thing, which the Arrow of the Will
is gone into. Which verily will have
the same success that our Lord had, when
he said, I Will such, and such to be made
whole. All those great and marvellous
things, which have been done in the
World, before and since Christ's time
have been by the Act of the Will, as
delivered from the Poysonable Web of
Mortal Self. Oh then how free is it in
it self, to summon in the mighty Force,
which is laid up in God's strong Tower
for the unbyassed Will to draw out, to
act and do upon the Holy Ones account, as
a just Steward entrusted with a power of
so high a Nature, as all Matters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
in the Counsel of a simplified
Will. This was shewed to me, as a
great and wonderful Prerogative, into
which the holy Driver made me search,
and still further to pry into the Mystery
hereof, opening that Scripture to me in
the <hi>Revelations, Whosoever will, let
him come, and take of the Waters of Life
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29870:43"/>
freely.</hi> The force lay all in the Will,
taking and recovering by lawful Violences
the Crown of Immortality and Life, that
hath during the Captivity of the Mind
and Will, been out of reach and sight.
But now our dear <hi>Immanuel</hi> in Spirit is
come to unbind, and set our Wills free,
revealing what the clog and stop here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
hath been, which hath prevented
the going forth of the Will-Spirit in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.
Who this more said, Yet
I will give thee a deeper Sight, that ye
may see what hath lain, as upon the

down the rising Power of the Will,
that it could do no mighty things.</p>

               <p>As I was Considering in my self, to
wing up in the Power of a Free-will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is said, There is a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Day of God's Power: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Enquiry throughout all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of my Mind, how in this matter
it stood with me; I found the Will
deficient, much after the manner
as the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 7th. of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29870:44"/>
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> gives a Character, in which is
presented a divided Will in an uncertain
Motion, which argued great Strife,
Weakness, and Imperfection. Which by
no means was to be found in us staying
here. For said the revealing Unction,
To this end I have manifested unto you,
the adjoyning Power of Supremacy.
Which must be looked after, as the
Bride-Mate of the Will, which addeth
the Dowry of all-sufficiency, in the
Lord's Work and Business, to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
uncontroulably, carried up in the
Chariot of the free willing Spirit, that
trampleth all down before it. Upon this
Word of Counsel, I had a mighty Voice
with it, crying thus in me, with many
Ecchoings following upon it, saying,
You now know the way, why is it that
you still stay with the viler sort: try,
and see every day, what force ye can
raise for your Revenue to that Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
born Family, where is nothing but
Peace and Unity, with Palm Trees of
Victory, and Wells of Salvation, that so
ye may come to tast, that which is so
sweet, while you are yet but in your
way. The smell and sight of <hi>Paradise</hi>
will you first entertain, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29870:44"/>
Death of the mortal Life, and a
while must stay with those lower Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
well viewing that native Place
and Country: for somewhat that was
lost there, shall be upon recovery, as
soon as you there appear. Then the
Tree of Life will invite you to eat of it,
that so Immortality may be regained.
Then your Souls and Spirits are with
Bodies suited for a higher Degree, to
come up among the greater Dignities.
For <hi>Paradise</hi> is as your Bride-Chamber,
where ye must put on again your Virgin
Body.</p>

               <p>After this Call to <hi>Paradise,</hi> the Spirit
presented that Scripture to me, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
28, 29. and opened very powerfully
to me, every Sentence of it, as shewing
we both should sustain no Loss, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
all those Particulars there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
The occasion of our Lord Jesus
giving forth the assurance of a better
exchange, upon the very fore-going, of
what was in present view and possession.
This Query was started, upon the coming
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29870:45"/>
of the Young Man, who had as he
thought, bid fair for the Kingdom of
God, supposing none could go higher,
then to observe and keep all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
but our Lord had a more
searching thing to try him withal,
which he was not aware of, when he
so confidently moved his question. The
Answer to which brought great Anxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that no doubt he repented him, that
he urged such a Discourse, whereby as
in a Glass, he might see the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of inheriting Eternal Goods, till that
he was stripped of all that, whereby he
was inriched from this lower state of
things. Which made our Lord to cry
out of the great Hardship and Difficulty
that would be to quit all to follow him,
to come to be no more of the World,
then he was, but as a Stranger not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any dwelling place, but to pass
through it, as a foreign Country, only bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so long, as to do the Lord's Message,
and perform his Work, which ought to
be our end and design. For the whole
drift of our Jesus, in and by all his Life,
Example and Doctrinal Admonition was
still to wind us off, and ungraft us from,
out of the strange degenerated Vine,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29870:45"/>
from whence we so readily suck that
Life, from which a Death is to come upon.
But to come to what was opened to me,
from <hi>Peter</hi>'s asking Christ so bluntly,
what they should have, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of forsaking of all for him:
Which seemed to be a pretty selfish Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but however our Lord overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that, giving an high encouragement
to whomsoever shall by forsaking of all,
give proof of their Love to him, and
esteem of the Heavenly Treasury above
the Earthly. Now upon the Call and
Cry, which I had follwed me to draw
off, and come away from what would
make a Prey of us. My Heart ecchoed
back again, saying, Ah Lord how is it
possible we should put off all so quickly,
when so deeply engaged, and settled as
House-keepers, amongst the Inhabitants
here below, as not seeing our selves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of passing into another Sphere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do bear gross Bodies. Upon
which the Spirit brought those Words
to me. As first, Whosoever shall forsake
Houses, that Word in Particular, was
thus interpreted. That by Houses, the
Spirit that spake in Jesus, then did aim
at a further thing, then an outward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29870:46"/>
Habitation. Houses for shelter
are harmless and without Offences. But
it is that Earthly House spoken of, which
is the Body of Sin, which harboureth
the whole Tribe and Family, who are
from the fallen Birth. From which evil
Seed a Corrupt Generation hath sprung,
and sheltred themselves therein. There
is Father and Mother, Husband and
Wife, Brethren and Sisters, as the most
Holy Spirit declared, saying, All these
in a compact are, being of one Blood and
Life, strong Animal, and mighty Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
and all these do lawfully plead for
their establishment, as in such who are
refined from the more gross Pollutions,
not considering their own Originality,
that all do proceed from a corrupt Being,
and it is not the suspending their Evil
Properties at sometime, not suffering
them to break forth, washing that over
which beareth the stain of a Leopard
Spot. This is too short, and defective:
for to race the Foundation of the House
and Linage, you are called upon to pull it
down. The Incitement is to that supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Will upon whom all these Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Powers have encroached. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must act a <hi>Sampson</hi> part, resolving
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29870:46"/>
to make a Battery, that so a final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
may appear upon the visible Stage,
resolving to break the Brood, though
you do with them sink down into Death.
Call up your force, the mighty strength
of <hi>Israel</hi> is at hand, yet once more to
avenge you, by not only shaking, but by
removing the Pillars of that House, which
hath been a receptacle of all this Evil
Fraternity, from which to go out, ye are
commanded. Let not your Noble Will
take any notice of their subtle and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Abnegations, or upper Washings,
which cannot change the <hi>Blackamore.</hi>
It will be an <hi>Ishmaelite</hi> at best, though
a faithful <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Son part thereof
may bear, yet because of a divided
Seed, born from the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> nothing
of Wisdom's Inheritance it must ever
share: all of that is reserved for her own
true Heir, who hereupon will rid all of
the <hi>Hagarites</hi> Offspring, not one shall
dwell in <hi>Isaac's</hi> Court. Thus I was
made to understand the scope and drift
of the Spirit, what it was to forsake all,
it is no less then to be dead to all, and
to come so far in this Death, as to strike
at the very moving cause, of what hath
given Life unto these degenerated Plants,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29870:47"/>
at which very Root the Flaming Sword
will pierce, that so the Original Matter
may be throughly consumed. Ah blessed
Lord, such a deep Wound in that hidden
part, whereout all of this strange, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brood begotten was, do thou now
give us from thy great kindness, such a
deadly stroke, that no more of Life may
ever stir from that Center: and give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us a release from that <hi>Ishmaelitish</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to all Eternity, Ah dear Lord Jesus.</p>

promised upon a new Score, of
which <hi>Iob</hi> was a true Similitude, who
lost all in this very same kind, and had
all again restored; as a Figure of this
new replenished state. All the Comfort
that may be expected further from hence,
is Marriage-Union. From whence En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
may come: without this, the other
will not altogether perfect the Joy.
Therefore be assured, that Care is taken
for this also, there is a numerous Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring

out of this Holy Habitation to be
Born. Your Father hath already made
the Match before Hand, before you do
come thither. All things, while you are
in this Principle, are determined upon.
Oh! here you will know the unutterable
Pleasure of a Bridegroom, who will be
so intimately tender over you, that you
shall say, Never was such kind of Love
known, or fathomed; when you shall
know no more any Interposing Lover,
but can appropriate each other in all
Purity: A blessed exchange here will
then be understood. But yet there are
higher Degrees of Joy, when you shall
bring forth, after your own Heavenly
perfect Likeness. The great Blessing that
is promised upon this Conjunction with
the Virgin-Bride is Fruitfulness. Ye shall
also see of the travel of your Spiritual
Bodies, and therewith be satisfied. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as a fruitful Vine, upon the sides
of this Eternal House and Building, will
spread forth her self. Consider that
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> which Prophecy is yet to be
fulfilled, <hi>Isa. 49. 20, 21. In this time the
Children, which thou shalt have after thou
hast lost the other, shall say the Place is
too strait;</hi> meaning this earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29870:51"/>
they cannot thereto be confined:
they may look into it, and pass through
it as Strangers, to shew themselves as
Jesus did after his Resurrection, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Habitation for them is here, v. 22.
<hi>But thou shalt say in thy Heart, who hath
begotten these, seeing I had lost my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and was left alone?</hi> This repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
your dead and deplorable state
once, and the suddain and unexpected
Restoration: In that clause, <hi>Where have
they been?</hi> So that a Nation and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Priests seems to be born in one
Day. This is marvellous indeed, when
ye shall see your Spiritual Offspring, as
Olive-Plants about your Table set.
This must needs heighten your Peace
and Joy in him, who is your Tabernacle
framer, who hath such durable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Comforts provided in this Mountain
of Holiness. Besides, there are also Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

you from one and the same Eternal Spirit,
whose Loves are pure and immutable as
God's Love is; rejoycing, Not envying
at each others Degrees of Glory: No

Harmony. A blessed Family thus
compact! It may well make you groan,
to put off this Earthly House, that so
this Royal Society may be made known
to you. And as ye have been long here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
kept as Exiles, so let this true and
faithful account, which now is given by
that Spirit, who doth bear a true Witness
hereof, provoke you this Translation to
seek, and that withal your Might. For
the Emphasis lieth in that Word of your
Jesus his Promise (if you well observe)
which runs <hi>Now in this Time,</hi> or in this very
time, signifying all Here to be made good.
Which will awaken great Persecutions,
as it is said, strange Uproars within and
without you. Which the Prince of this
World will raise, when he seeth that
any one shall in great earnest resolve, to
put off all that he can challenge right
unto. It is the earthly Sinful Body, that
he disputes for: leave it him; for after
this manner he contended for <hi>Moses</hi>
Body, which God had hid. Be ye hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
Exiles here, but real Inhabitants
with God, your appointed dwelling
Place. Leave this Principle, and all
what is its own: care not, but render up
what you had from it. For when you

have quitted all, doubt not, but the
<hi>hundredfold</hi> will come upon you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as hath been revealed: Be

ye shall be undoubtedly highly blessed.</p>
               <p>The same Day I had this Word spake
in me, thy Soul is among tearing Lyons,
but a <hi>Daniel</hi> guard is about thee. They

               <p>Arguments to plead with the Lord were
given to me this Night. Which I found
was from the Spirit of Prayer, that ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
strongly and potently in me, for
our remove, out of this Tent of vile
Humanity, into what I did in Spirit
see. Upon which I had this Word spoke
to me; Be patient in Hope, stedfast in
Faith, ardent in Love, and ye will
move the Trinity, to send forth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
for your enlargement.</p>
               <p>Then again was given into me an Idea,
as the Dr. and I did mutually joyn in
Prayer, in, and for the same thing, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29870:53"/>
our Condition was like to <hi>Ionah,</hi> swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in the Belly of the Whale,
shut up in the House of Death, enclosed
in the Body of Sin, round which the
Seas and Floods did beat upon, and the
Deeps did roar, and boil as a Pot of
Ointment. All which presented this
World, with the mutinous Spirits, that
are as the restless Waves, that would as
the Belly of Hell devour us, if not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
It was thus shewed to me, that
the true Prophetical <hi>Ionah</hi> was in
us, who was cast into this boisterous
Sea, which would drown the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Life, but that the wise preventing
Love of God hath provided for <hi>Ionah</hi>'s
safety in the very Belly of Death. Out
of this Grave the Lord our God doth
hear our Voice, though the Earth with
her Bars are about us, yet said the Living
Word, out from Corruption your Lives
shall be brought. Thus Death shall not
at all hurt you, let not your Souls faint,
but direct your Prayers to the Holy
Temple; that so through great fervency,
from these nether Depths you may there
into enter, and from Death's Bands ye
shall beloosed. The Body of mortality,
as the Fish, shall vomit you up, when

give forth. These Openings are still

               <p>I saw a Vision thus presented to me;
I did see a green Cloath-Covering, which
was sown over a White Sheet, which
was let down, and I was bid to unrip it,
which after a metaphorical manner was
done, I know not how. And under it
there were Creeping Creatures, that were
of a devouring Quality; then under the
Linnen there appeared a Lamb pure and
white, with sparkling Eyes as Flames of
Fire. Which thing considering, it was
thus opened unto me, This was the Face
of the Covering, that the Word of
Command came forth to have unripped,
and taken off. By which the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ground might be discovered, where
the fatned Beasts did lurk under, who
by the Covering were bounded. But
now the shame of their Nakedness did
appear, so as they crept away, and could
no longer abide, by reason of the Lamb's
sparkling Eye, which caused the Remove
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29870:54"/>
to be made; saying to me, Now give
place, who am come to scatter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all of this evil quality from before
my Face. I can no longer bear this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
upon me, this partition Vail must
be rolled away, even that dark Body
of Sin, which hath been as a weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lamb of God. Whose Eyes do
pierce to find out every thing that hath
made a breach, that so the Heart of
God should not be concealed from you:
into which you could never see so long
as this thick dark Covering remained,
whereby hid hath been the very Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
matter, that hath brought in all the
Woe and Sorrow. For which purpose
by way of this Similitude, you may come
hereby to understand the force of that
great Love, that moveth to lay all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and bare, that so through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
of that light Eye, which did lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Image of that Sin-breeding Beast, that
could multiply into such encrease under
the green Covering. Whose Seat and

that so thou mayst be at rest, from the

Let us in the first place now make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Originality of this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
how he came to have a Being. For
in the beginning of the Paradisical Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all was created by God, comely,
good, and perfect: how came then this
strange Essence to be brought in, to dispoil
and alter the whole Heavenly Course
of things in this Paradisical Creation?
Now know, that before this, there was
a Creation of Angelical Hosts, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
product from the everlasting
Being. Who delighted to generate
Thrones, Mights, and Powers, that so
God through distinct Existencies of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Spirits, of that high Angelical
Order, might come to manifest his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
which before lay void and
hid in an Eternal Stillness. So as here
was the Angelical World in pre-existency
before the Paradisical. The Superiour
Heavens were furn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>shed in the first Place
with Dignities suited for God's own
peculiar Habitation. Of which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
there was a Spirit of high Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that did awaken in some of them,
who were Principalities in this Kingdom,
to exalt themselves equal, or above the
Lord their Maker. For which cause,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:29870:56"/>
being cast out from the most meek and
holy Presence, they consulted how to
spoil and infect, having great Envy
against God's new Creation, and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man in, and after the express
Image of himself. This blew up their
Coals of Jealousie, and fiery Indignation,
which as deadly Arrows were soon sent
forth; namely, so soon as <hi>Adam</hi> came to
have an existency. He must be tried by this
subtle Serpent. And the first onset was,
whether they could by their Magical
Art cast him into a deadly Sleep; that
so thereby his Impotency might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
stupifying his seven high gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Faculties. Who hereby before he
was aware did loose his Virgin genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
strength: and whereas it was said,
That God cast him into that Sleep, the
meaning is, God suffered it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the probation to come upon him,
to see whether he could stand this first
Insinuation, which was by some secret
Poyson, that he had drunk in, from the
fallen Spirits, who had somewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
of their evil Seed cast in. In that
God said, Seeing Man is already fallen
from that primary force and strength,
that he cannot bring forth from that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29870:56"/>
Female property, Now it will not
be good for him to be alone: he shall
have a Companion answerable to his
present state, which is already lower by
many degrees, then when the pure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Breath did enter in. But had
<hi>Adam</hi> with his <hi>Eve</hi> here staid, and had
not been brought in a further Premunire,
Mankind had not seen the Sin fatal Death
of Mortality. But the Serpent seeing
his Invisible Sorcery had taken so good
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffect, he now is more bold to adventure
upon the second Tryal, suiting his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
more subtlely, telling them they
should be as Gods. Which was an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Argument, at which Sugar-Bait
they presently nibled, and did eat of it,
and in that very moment were turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that mortal Beastly shape, the Figure
whereof you do to this Day wear. But
well had it been, if this had been all the
injury; but oh the Serpently Seed was
cast in there, who at once sent in that
Poyson, that hath had its death opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ever since. Thus you see the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality,
from whence ye have derived
your Earthly Life of Mortality, which
is so inherent, that as a boiling Source it
is maintained from this strange intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29870:57"/>
Fire; so as though you are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Labour, to scum off the Filth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet it still renews again. So while the
root of this corrupt Matter remains, your
toil, fear, and care will have no end.
Now what is it think ye, must enter in so
deep, as to suck out the Serpent's deadly
Sting, that hath made all this disorder in
Nature? Many Medicines have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and some have been safe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
of, yet they have not reached
the place of Sin's Conception, to destroy
both the Serpently Seed, with the first
Earthly <hi>Eve,</hi> which is the Mother of all
Living in the Earthly Property. Her
Womb is fruitful, still to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Viperous Thoughts, and evil Earthly
Motion from a flowing Source through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Generations. Now you will say
how and by what means shall this be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died?
You cry the Power is not in us:
how can that come to be nullified, that
is so essentially in us? The Boughs may,
while but tender Boughs, be bent; and
when strong grown, they may be cropt;
but the stock, as a deep grounded Oak,
our Arm is too short to reach: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
move it, the very Earth will rend
and shake, when ever it shall come to be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29870:57"/>
displaced. Hear now and consider ye,
whose lawful Objection is come before
me: it is granted to you, that the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Father through the Mightiness of
the Spirit in the Lamb's Nature, must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
for you the Root of this Oak, that
is so deeply rooted in the Ground of
Nature. But what Tool or Instrument
will he take in his Hand, but the Ax of
your Wills. Then a through stroak will
he strike by the piercing Eye of his Spirit,
who seeth the very depth, from whence
its Essence doth proceed. For without
a discovery made, where the Cause of
this defect is, nothing hereof could be
made, or for you wrought out. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lamb of God is come, the Vail
of Covering to unspread; that so by the
sparkling Fire of his Eye, ye might see
from the Depths beneath the Birth-Source
of Sin, which doth open wide. Also with
the same Eye, ye may behold within the
heights of <hi>Sion,</hi> a flowing Ocean of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Gold: to this for healing do ye fly.
For no other Medicine can heal the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
Sting within you. These are the
Golden Floods, which by the Spirit are
daily poured forth, to drown the first
Birth of <hi>Eve;</hi> that so an end may be of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29870:58"/>
that generating Source, and her Womb
for ever henceforth may come to be
barren in you. To which end, Orders
and Decrees are made in Heavenly
Places, that Virgin-Wisdom shall take
place in her room: and her Seed shall
be destructive to the Serpent's, and to
all his Hierarchy; and you shall see his
Head-Power bruised to purpose, when
all Sin in its Originality shall be blotted
out by the Hand, and working Source of
the Deity. Who will give also to you
the Key and Chain of Power, that so in
the Name and Authority of the Lamb,
ye may take hold on the Dragon, and
bind him, and shut up his flowing Source
of Evil, and with the Seal of the Living
God, to seal him up, that he may find
no way to come out of his own Lake, to
corrupt or deceive you any more. Then
you will begin in all stillness upon the

For in the Singular Number, it will begin

I could restrain the moving, acting Life
of Sin, then I did obtain near access to
the most Holy, during the seasons and
times, when I could reign over all the
Region of Natural Sence. Which the
Interiour Spirit may thus keep upon its
Watch-Tower; so it would then be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a subject meet for the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

self at such a time, when so raised, as
to desert all, that might be called car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
rational; then little enough I seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be, so light and so free, so purely
sprightly, to pass through the Glassy
G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te. But while I am again cast into
the Nature of a gross thick Body, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with Sensibility; then no Ability
there is for me to pass, where I would.
As the Day and Night be thus in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
still of force, to oppose each the
other in the divided Property, till the
everlasting Day of the Spirit shall alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dis-inherit the dark benighted
Sense. Whereof hopes given are by that
Spirit, who thus spake from my Lord
Jesus, putting this Question unto me,
saying, How dost thou think it possible
to know the Majesty, who is encircled in
such excessive Light, whilst thou livest
in so many Degrees below the Seraphick
<hi>sphere?</hi> For great is the remoteness that may
be from hence to them. Who altogether
are confined to a Terrestrial state. For in
that Word is weight, that divided hath
the Spiritual in, and from the Natural. Who
is uncapable to know, discern, or judge
of any matter, but what is his own: that
is, which lieth within the Sphere of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29870:59"/>
understanding, as a rational Man, who
is wise for himself. Which Wisdom
is all to protect and hold up, and save
what is to be cast down, and be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus the Serpently Birth of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
will hold its own, in opposition
to the pure, meek, essential Being and
Birth, which is from the Spirit. Who
is a great Sufferer, while he is so near
adjoyned to the Natural Man, who is a fit
Recptacle, for what this evil Principle can
shake him withal: which the Prince and
great Commander of this World, will
enough of this trash and earthly stuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
load him withal, to give the mind full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
to prevent that which is Sublime
and Celestial. Therefore, in vain the
Scripture hath not said, None can know
the Thoughts of a Man, save the Spirit
that is in him; that is, none can pry or
reach into the subtlety of the deceitful
Heart, that is working and busie, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Plotting, to compass the heighth
of earthly things, to which his Life would
wholly extend: As desiring to know
nothing more, or above, or beyond his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Sphere; being satisfied with the sight
of his Eye, with the hearing of his Ear,
being wholly taken up with what is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29870:60"/>
from this mortal state, which finds
out a daily variety to hold this Life in
Captivity.</p>
               <p>Thus you see the Earthly Man made
out; he is distinct from the Heavenly.
He knows nor perceives nothing of the
Spiritual Man's concerns, but as living
in one and the same Body, hath great
advantage to interfere, and cast in many
times his cloudy Reasonings. This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

For the Dragon must try successively up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

could not be, if he had not recourse to
<hi>Eve</hi>'s depravity, that hath lodged you
in Elementary Bodies, by which the

from whence Hope there is, that
the Stem of the whole and Eternal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being yet left for Attraction, may
assume again its lost Paradisical Body;
through the Gift of the Holy Ghost.
For if ye once come to recover your
inward Spiritual transformed Might,
Power and Purity, the outward, at your
pleasure will be for alteration. For the
way to the Tree of Life will be known by
the Spiritual Man: which being fed upon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
will operate for another manner of
Covert, then a Goat-like Skin, wherein
is your deformity. For the Spiritual
Man born again, will be so wise and
knowing, as it will lose nothing, that
doth belong to it upon Election; though
for a time, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>-like, driven
out from his Paradisical Kingdom hath
been, to feed amongst the wild Beasts;
whose gross Body sucks in answerably
what this low Element can afford him.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29870:61"/>
This is the earthly Mans Portion, till he
be Born again into the Spirit; then he
comes to a clear Understanding and
sound Judgment, and calleth over what
Heavenly Revenue doth belong to him.
Another Heart and Spirit is returned,
which makes him for to see and loath
that former Image, wherein all of the
Earthly was found, conversing daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men in Beastly Shapes. From
which by the mighty Birth of the Spirit
of Jesus, you are returned, to get esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
in your own Kingdom. Who
are true Heirs thereof, through Love's
Adoption; but not being come to the
full Age, are not to have yet the Reins
of Government wholly put into your
Hand: this is reserved for a full grown
Spirit of Wisdom, which will spring in
you by degrees. But this is now doing
for you, saith the deep searching Spirit,
a Catalouge is making out of what
Goods and Spiritual Stuff do belong to
you, that so you may know what ye
have to trust unto, and so set your Heart
thereupon. Your Heavenly Father
would not that you should be kept ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what is your Eternal Dowry;
For the knowledge of this will act you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29870:61"/>
forth answerably, into all Deified great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit, as expecting such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to come, and such a Priesthood of
the highest Order to be given to you. All
which is to make you, for to bethink
your selves, how for to carry it, while in
this World, ye shall be vied withal from
mighty Powers and Principalities, that
Command all Delights and Pleasures,
that the visible Earth affords. But these
must be nothing available with you,
who do proceed from another Line,
therefore do you only mind the things
of the Spirit, none else can know them.
Therefore marvel not, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by all other, these special things
are only registred in the Book of Life
for you. The deep searching Spirit may
look here into, who is privledged to take
out of the Original Copy of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Will, what he hath alotted you
in matters Eternal. Upon this free Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and Conference, which flowed as
Oyl, to make the Lamp of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
for to burn bright, that so
I might be of a quick Sight in Spiritual
Things, yet more deep to see: Who
here could not be at rest, till the Spirit
would give to me a particular of those

rich Immunities and Glories, that so we,
who herein are concerned, might whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Then, said the speaking Word, Lay aside,

in an Embroidered Robe, like a

I congratulated him, hoping hereby he
should come to have more open access,
into the most Heavenly Place. For this
Word was with me for him, which
was spoken to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> the High-Priest:
thus saith the most Holy, if he shall walk

               <p>Somewhat before Break of Day, I did
see two Persons, that were known to me,
in a Boat without Oars, as upon a Sea.
Upon a suddain a great Wave of Water
broke in upon them, whereupon the Boat
began to sink: upon which the one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stripped
himself to swim to save his Life;
and seeing it in absolute Peril leaped out;
upon which the other with her Cloaths
took hold of his Arm; and thereby
plunged him into the Sea; upon which
I cried out, saying, Lord save him. Upon
which he did rise, getting from that
other, who did take hold upon him.
Then a gallant Ship did him meet, where
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29870:63"/>
on a suddain, I found my self in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
great Joy did take in the Person
that swam; but the other could not be

               <p>THis Morning this Word greeted me,
Oh! what of Flesh can live, when
the immense Deep shall be searched out by
the Spirit; therefore consider what it will
be there, to know the things of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently.
The anointing shewed now the
great disproportionableness, betwixt what
was to be known of the things of God,
and that of Man; who, tho' he be degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and hath lost all Propriety in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
yet is born an Heir to Terrestial
things: and hath such a Spirit as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how to contrive, and make out for
himself another Paradise; to which he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29870:63"/>
bends all his force and might, to imitate
what was lost; and doth answerably effect
great things by rational Wisdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
as belonging to this Principle.
So that though he hath lost the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in things Celestial, yet
through Toyl, and Care, Sorrows, and
Fears, he hath recovered temporal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
as his own to live upon, and to take
lawful Pleasure in: Nay, the Natural Man
may go much further than all this; who in
the more sobriety of Morality, from a
Light within, may be convinced of that
Duty, and Necessity, and Fear, that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to that God, in whom all Live, and
have their Being; and therefore may shew
by a kind of upright moral Conversation,
the Law of God written in their Hearts

so that you may take in this higher degree
of things into the knowledge of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Man, as an earthly Man, and yet not
able to receive or comprehend the more
high, wonderful and deep things of God.
It is only possible to that which is the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29870:64"/>

they can never be unfolded. Only the
Spirit, for the use of this new Born Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Spiritual Born Man, doth bring
down a Breviate of those invisible Things
that are in heavenly Places, or rather that
are in God, who is the Original from
whence all glorious things, that are in
Existency, are brought forth: which may
be named as the Back-parts of God, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and stretched forth into a Light Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick

his own Majestick Forms, which no one

But you will say what more of the things
of God are discoverable? when you are
wholly in the Spirit, you need not thus
Quere: but in the mean time there is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which will take it's range for you, to
view the Fathers, Goods, Poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thereunto. To proceed then to
the heights, depths, and bredths, of what
are yours in Reversion, within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> state. Consider then
what of God's is there, they are all yours,
as ye stand engrafted into the Tree of
Life. Now what hath the Spirit found
out in all the heights, above this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sphere? First into Paradise it doth
take its Flight, where all things are in
good Order, and flourishing state, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adam</hi> had lost his Virgin Mate.
Paradise is now stock'd again with such
as have waded through the floating Sea
of Sin and Mortality, in order to the
putting on that image of Purity, where
the least Guile or Fault may not be
found in any there. The Spirit doth see
all in wonderful Harmony, for this Voice
was heard to say from the high and lofty
One, with Men risen from the Dead I will
also dwell, though it be alotted for a time

Mystery; which is, what may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
upon in this very Life time, know
there is a mystical Paradise, as well as a
local, which springs metaphorically, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a pure magical Center; this is a
wonderful state to know and wittness: it
chiefly stands in divine Visions, Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Ideas, Presentations, Manifestations,
in Sounds, Trumpets, Voices, in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in Powers, Raptures, Joys, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible-Feelings:
I say all these Golden
Springs do flow from out of the Bowels
of the new Paradisical Earth. This will
amount to your present Peace and Joy.
Wait I say to feel that. Now that your
Spirits may give a Seal with me, that ye
have received the anointing, and that you
do walk with your Spiritual Man in this
Paradise; where you do often hear the
Eccho of the Bridegroom's Voice, calling
to you still to hast the getting on all that
which will make you look sweet and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,

and the fragrant Sweets that may
you perfume and scent, that so all your

upon which you may stretch your

upon it, shall be in good deed metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized.
Behold to you, this Paradise Gate
doth open stand, and what of the things

Word of caution to you, who resolved
are to tast more deep of these flowing
Sweets, take heed of the Laws of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
which once in particular were given
to you, remind and observe them. For
you must not be in the Quality, halting

times, by a terrestial Voice and

invisible Earth, where none but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

who are my chosen Disciples, I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

in the Crown number Roll. Now one

Priesthood to the Hundred and forty
four thousand. Blessed are they, who are
the first foundation Pillars of this Virgin
Church, upon which, I can allow to be

For the Case is now clean alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

when I broke forth in the fleshly

so long and cloudy a Day of Apostacy.
A sparkling Star shall rise out of that
Orb and Climate, whereof it shall be
said, this is Wisdom's fruitful Day; out
of whose eternal Morning Womb, ye
shall see bright Stars of Glory generated
for a glorious Temple. Who then will
now sound this my Trumpet, and will
call to break away from their iron Yoaks,
to come to be dignified, as hewed Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
for Wisdom's Temple to be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Oh! what saith the Spirit, who
shall I find that can say, accept of me for
holy Use, who without shadow of change,
will no more turn into this World. For
such a Pure and Apostolical Foundation
the Father of Spirits will lay for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Stone, yet in the Earth again. Who
will open in some such first, that in
a seperated Mind and Spirit, do wait
herein as Virgins, not as with a double
Eye, to look forward and backward, up
and then down, no such unsteady Spirit
will ever be taken in: Therefore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Jesus doth give you this seriously to

would that this Prophecy might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled

fledged, did all present themselves to
view. The old one was flown from
them, to bring Provision to them. At
which sight of these young Eagles, we
who walked together consulted, how to
take them, and to bring them away as a
Prize. While thus considering how to
climb the Tree, we were on a suddain
carried level with the Nest, and did not
know how we got so high. But one
Eagle I did see had fluttered out, and
hung by the Twig of a Tree all martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Legs and the Neck all Bloody and
broke. The rest suffered themselves to
be taken, though they were so strong and
fledged, as they might have flown from

us. But that other Person took the
Number of them, which were Six, and
I did receive them into my Apron, and
so as strangely we were let down from
this high Place, as we were drawn up to
it. After this I set the Eagles down, and
they did very tamely eat Bread, which I
did provide for them. I did remember
nothing further hereof.</p>

that living Tree, whereto none can

But how, and after what manner
shall this be, My Spirit was in deep Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
as also when it should appear? Then
it was thus said, Know ye not, that <hi>Eve</hi>
lost her Virgin Eagle Body, and so hath
long been sown into a slumbring Death,
in Folly, Weakness, and Dishonour?
But now the Life-Tree hath so fluently
conveyed it self in this long Vacation,

Wisdom hath made choice of <hi>Eve,</hi> for to
be her Mate (that is the lapsed Soul of
the inward Man,) whose Hand must
help to build this Nest for her. Thus
choice Eagle Spirits, will be raised up,
out of old <hi>Eves</hi> Dust for this use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

see with an Eagle Eye, that thus, and
after this sort, a new Virgin Body must
be raised up by Virgin Wisdom in this
World, for the Spouse, and Church of
Christ, and so for every Member of that
Body; and so consequently for every
lapsed eternal Soul to be cloathed upon
with its new Virgin Body. Oh! who

this Tree of Life is so pure, that

Then your defence will be mighty and
sure, and your Bread and Waters will be

fly far, the Tree of Life so nigh, here
are still fresh Fruits upon the Branches,
from it by no means start aside, but keep
close upon the Nest. You cannot yet be
able to conceive, what here by abiding
close, may be brought forth from this
vertual Eagle Body, to wit, Throne
Eagle Powers, mighty to ascend to the
number seven. But if any shall look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
downward, into this Principle to
descend, before it is fully Feather'd, great
damage and hurt will necessarily accrue,
as in the Similitude I did see. Therefore

that would be of this Number, to

with what aversness you may meet
withal from this lower Orb. Therefore
abide till full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

be able to fly, and mount away, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29870:73"/>
any creeping thing, or hurtful Beast shall

fly to your munition Rock. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted,
for your more constant place of
Dwelling, for to be, which so near bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
is upon the Heavens of Heavens,
where the immense Deity is Resident.
Who may appear, while we keep oft to
his Eagle Off-spring: For when you
come hither to Paradise, there is still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Principle, that must be passed
through, which will be very easy, when
ye shall bear this risen Eagle Body on
you. How suddenly will the ghostly
Dove bring you into the very third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
there to see your Jesus with your
Eagle Eye, as <hi>Iohn</hi> Personally did, when
he upon the Wing of the Spirit was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
high: Possibly somewhat of these
Glories may be seen before ye actually
enter in. For blessed will they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
who are flying Angels, that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what they have heard or seen in
these higher Worlds. These are they
who shall bring down glad Tidings to the

to sound, the Tabernacle of God
will out of the Heavens descend. Oh,
what of Flesh shall live? When the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29870:74"/>
mighty Eagle shall call her own away to
behold, what she doth unfold within the
third Principle. The fight of the Eye,
and the hearing of the Ear in that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sphere, will so fill all with the Melody
and Joy of the holy Ghost, as nothing of
the earthly Sence of things shall, or can
enter into this Eagle Brood. Now hereby
try your selves.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mystery, you must then know, every
one of us have within our selves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eternal Man, and an outward Man.
Now the inward eternal Man hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himself his own eternal <hi>Adam,</hi> and his
own eternal <hi>Eve.</hi> His eternal <hi>Adam,</hi> is
his own eternal Spirit within himself, and
his own eternal <hi>Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> it is his own etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Soul within himself. This eternal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> in themselves are now to be
considered in their fallen and lapsed
State, as both being separated from their
first, true, original Mate, to wit, from
the eternal Virgin Wisdom of God, who
was united to both these in Paradise. For
they both sinned in Paradise, then lost
the Life of the Virgin Wisdom of God,
and their Virgin Purity in Paradise. And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29870:74"/>
therefore their true Mate being lost out
of themselves in Paradise, they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of Paradise. For when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eternal Spirit in Union with the
eternal Soul, both being united to their
true Mate, the Virgin Wisdom of God,
could, and might have brought forth a
holy Generation in their own Image and
Similitude, like unto themselves in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Righteousness, and in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But after that the eternal Spirit
and Soul had sinned in Paradise, that is,
after the eternal <hi>Adam</hi> and the eternal
<hi>Eve,</hi> belonging to the inward eternal
Man, had transgressed in Paradise, and
were ejected out, then they lost their
fructifying Power, and then they could
not bring forth a holy Off-spring. Now
this eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> which is the eternal Soul,
belonging to the inward Man, is called
to return to her Restoration State, and
to return again to her first State in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and to reunite her self again to her
lost Mate, to wit, to the eternal Virgin
Wisdom of God, and then her Womb
should be fruitful again, and she shall
bring forth none but Eagle Birds, none
but a holy Off-spring, to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Church on Earth without Spot or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29870:75"/>
Wrinckle. Here is now a Prophesie, a
Prediction, that now the time is come,
that this eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> which is no other
but the inward eternal Soul in its lapsed
State, whose Womb hath been hitherto
barren and unfruitful; but now the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Virgin Wisdom of God will sow her
Virgin Seed, into her Womb, and she
shall be fruitfull, and shall bear Twins,
and bring forth a perfect Eagle Off-spring,
and they shall make a perfect
Church on Earth. And now the Soul in
her Restoration shall again be fruitful in
Child-bearing, in bringing forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to inherit perfect Justification, and
perfect Sanctification, and Salvation;
but then this <hi>Eve</hi> must continue in Faith
and Charity, and Holiness with Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the Apostle mentioneth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
15. The restored Soul by its Union with
her true Guide and Mate, the Virgin
Wisdom of God, shall bring forth a
Royal Off-spring presented to be the
strong Eagle Brood: and this is the
Work that Wisdom is about to do, to
reunite her self to the eternal Soul,
which is the eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> as her true
Mate and Guide; and to sow her Virgin
Seed into the Womb of <hi>Eve</hi> to break the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29870:75"/>
Head of the Serpent, then <hi>Eve</hi> shall be
no more deceived, but now shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Mother of Celestial and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Children, all her Children shall
possess Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the new <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
State of Glory. This is the eternal
<hi>Eve,</hi> the eternal Soul, which now shall
be the Mother of all Living, that is, all
her Posterity shall now feed upon the
Tree of Life, and thereby become all
eternal, immortal, and incorruptible.
And all this shall be brought about by
Wisdom's Art and Contrivance; to wit,
by reuniting her self to the Soul, and
thereby becoming again the Souls true
Mate and Guide. This is the State of
Restoration, and this is that State, that
Wisdom is bringing forth upon the Earth;
and in this Figure of the Eagle birth,
Wisdom Prophesieth, and Predicteth,
what is near at hand to be fulfilled,
and brought to pass, to egg us forward
in the belief of it, to be done within
our own eternal Man in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
                  <p>But now there is belonging to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man, the mortal Man, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Product of the Fall, a mortal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
and a mortal <hi>Eve.</hi> The mortal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:29870:76"/>
is the mortal Spirit of the outward
Man, and the mortal <hi>Eve</hi> is the mortal
Soul of the mortal Man. She is in her
fallen State, the Mother of all Living;
that is, of all living mortal Spirits, with
mortal Souls, and with mortal Bodies.
Her Womb in this state of Apostacy hath
been very Fruitful. She hath ever since
brought forth in all Ages a mortal Off-spring,
subject to the death of Mortality,
who have only fed upon the Tree of the
knowledge of Good and Evil. She
hath brought forth a fleshly Off-spring in
her likeness and similitude, and hath had
a long Day in the World. Now the
Prophesie and Prediction is not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this mortal <hi>Eve,</hi> belonging to the
outward Man, in relation to her Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but it is to be understood of
the eternal Soul, that eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> that
hath been so long barren in her lapsed
state. But now <hi>Sophia</hi> will once more
espouse her self unto her, and she shall
bring forth a holy Issue, a birth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
eternal Eagles, to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Church on Earth, whereof Christ
will be the Head and King to reign over.
This is only wrought for explanation
sake, that you might not think, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29870:76"/>
That which is written and manifested
from above, in the crystalline Glass of
Divine Wisdom, is mere Confusion.
Therefore you must distinguish between
<hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> between the eternal <hi>Eve,</hi>
and the mortal <hi>Eve,</hi> the one belonging
to the inward eternal Man, the other to
the outward mortal Man; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
is only to be understood of the
eternal Soul, and not of the mortal
Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You must distinguish in the
eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> between her fallen state and
her restored state, for the Prophesie
is not what she is at present, but what she
is to be in her restored state.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> place, You are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the eternal lapsed Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to effect it, but it is the Work of
God's eternal Wisdom, who will freely
espouse her self, to her again, after this
long time of separation and alienation,
and then she shall be the Mother of a
holy Generation. Her Womb shall bring
forth no other Children, but such as shall
make their Nest upon the Tree of Life.
And these things premised, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
the Representation will be easily
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29870:77"/>
understood, by Wisdom's Eagles, and
confirmed sufficiently by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>For you may read that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>
were both created eternal, immortal and
incorruptible Creatures in their Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
state, and they both were created
perfect, without any spot of Sin or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of Weakness, while they stood in
their Paradisical Innocency; and they
were both to have brought forth an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
holy Generation, a perfect Church
on Earth, had they remained in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
But sinning in Paradise, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
lost their Virgin Power, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
their Virgin Birth, and they
could not bring forth a perfect Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
having transgressed and lost their
Virgin Power, through Wisdom's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
and estrainging her self; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were driven out out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
But now being banished from their
Paradisical Power, and having both eaten
of the Tree of Mortality, and having
both of them, both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
cloathed themselves with mortal Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with a mortal Spirit; that is, with
a mortal <hi>Adam,</hi> and with a mortal Soul,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29870:77"/>
that is, with a mortal <hi>Eve,</hi> and with a
mortal Body of Flesh. Now the mortal
<hi>Eve</hi> hath been very Fruitful in the Birth
of her Mortality; but the eternal Soul,
the eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>Eve</hi> typed out in
the state of Paradise, to be the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Mother of a perfect Generation,
to make up a perfect Church on Earth.
The Womb of this eternal <hi>Eve</hi> hath been
barren to this Day, but now Wisdom
Prophesieth and Predicteth, that she will
look upon this eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> this eternal
Mother, and will make her the fruitful
Mother of a joyful Generation, but she
will reject the outward earthly <hi>Eve,</hi> and
will make her Womb to be barren, that
hath exalted her self in the Multitude of
her Children, but they were only to be
the Brats of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But the Children
of the eternal <hi>Eve</hi> shall be the Children
of <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and the Children of the
<hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Vision, and divine Presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for to support those, that wait for
Wisdoms Day to appear in <hi>Eves</hi> Birth,
through the eternal Souls Restoration,
in Union with eternal Wisdom. It is not
only the inward Man, the eternal <hi>Adam,</hi>
that is an eternal Spirit with his Mind,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29870:78"/>
Will, and Senses, that shall now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
but also his eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> this is,
his eternal Soul, withal his Affections,
and Passions, shall be also restored. And
though the holy Scriptures make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
chiefly of the first <hi>Adamical</hi> Man's
Restoration, but yet it also mentioneth
<hi>Eves</hi> Restoration; I say the Womans
Restoration, as well as the Man's. It is
also clear, that the whole inward eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Man shall be Restored, and not only
one part of him, not only the Will-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is but the superiour part of
the inward eternal Man, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the first <hi>Adam</hi> that sinned; but also
his eternal <hi>Eve,</hi> that is the eternal Soul,
the inferiour part of the inward eternal
Man, called the Woman, this shall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
also. So that the whole Man with
his Spirit and Soul, with his <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> shall be Restored; in the Day of his
Restoration, when divine Wisdom shall
espouse, and contract her self to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man. Oh blessed Day! Come,
dear Wisdom, and finish this Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
in the Body, Soul, and Spirit
of the inward eternal Man, who is hid
within the outward.</p>

               <p>This Day we were set upon, by that
strong Warriour, that had assumed a
poor corporeal Shape, to shoot forth his
venemous Arrows in great bitterness for
to disturb us. Which Grievance I did
present in Prayer to my God, that these
raging Spirits might be bounded. My
Spirit crying and bewailing this wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
boyling Cauldron, that the Infernal
dark Powers had kindled the Fire here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that so unsavoury Fumes do Daily, as
Scurn herefrom rise. I besought then the
Lord, that if by any means both she, and
we might be delivered from these Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and serpently Stingings. My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
crying, Oh Lord, what have we done
that this foaming tempestuous Sea must
still roar about our Ears; Is it needful
it should be so? Then reveal thy Mind
herein still further to us. Upon which,
I quietly reposed, committing the whole
of this Concern to that mighty One,
from whom both the Help and Power
must only come, to allay all of this boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
Nature. About break of Day
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29870:79"/>
this Word came to me, saying, Behold
and see, it is but a Worm, that is of no
moment, who thus troubleth you, only
the subtilty of the Serpent hath entred
to work through it; but if you knew
your own Spirit of Might and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

Then again this Word came, saying, To
what end is that Nest prepared upon the
Tree of Life, Is it not that you might
fly away from all these hurtful Beasts?
Why do ye walk upon their Ground, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
your pure &amp; spiritual Minds, while

               <head>March the 11th. 1676.</head>
               <p>In my first Sleep, in the Night time,
many magical Workings and Ideas were
presented to me. As first, a Figure of a
Woman, with a Crown upon her Head,
who seemed to me to be but of a small
Stature, but her Visage was bright as the
Sun, and clear as the Moon, with a
White loose Garment girt about her with
a seeming White Silken Girdle, who
came near to me, saying, Behold and
see, what ye may arrive to be in me?
And so passed away.</p>
               <p>Then after a while, there was a Child
all Lovely and Fair put into my Arms;
it was all naked, of a smooth shining
Skin; I could not see who it was that
disposed it to me, but it was unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
let down into my Arms. I thought
it to be very Weighty, though but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
so passing to go away with it, it
suddainly slipped through my Arms unto
the Ground, at which I gave a great
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:29870:80"/>
Screek, and with great Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
took it up again without much
Damage.</p>

               <head>March the 12th. 1676.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Interpretation of the First Vision.</head>
               <p>Concerning this Vision, the Thoughts
of my Head were, for the space of time,
much troubled, till the revealer of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
did expound to me the meaning
hereof. As to the first, which was the
Woman with the Crown upon her Head.
This was declared to be the Virgin-Bride
of the Lamb, who came to shew her self
made fully Ready, all Bright and Fair,
as the Queen and Princess of Heaven.
Who hath her place at the Right-hand
of the <hi>Immanuel;</hi> for so much as this
Woman is the Glory of the God-Man,
who out of this masculine Nature is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
according to the Figure of the first
Paradisical Man, who brought forth that
<hi>Eve,</hi> that was the Mother of all that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the mixed Property of Good and
Evil. All of which Off-spring the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29870:80"/>
visible World doth consist of, which
to this Day is under the denomination of
the fallen Creation: which hath been
upon Restoring ever since the Relapse,
but not yet Restored. What then has
made it stick so long? Where is that
Woman whose Seed must bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
Head? Is she not yet made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest?
Yes sure, she hath been known as to
the first Figure hereof, to whom it was
said, That this <hi>Eve,</hi> or first Woman should
bring forth her Seed in Sorrow. It hath
been also generally concluded, That out
of this earthly <hi>Eve</hi> that Royal Seed
should come, by which the Serpent in
Nature should be destroyed, which was so
suddainly introduced both into <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve.</hi> True it is that the genaelogy did
so run from them, to the Birth of Christ
after the Flesh, but yet not to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
for <hi>Eves</hi> Seed: though God said
to the Serpent, that he would put Enmity
betwixt his Seed, and the Womans. But
how is that to be understood? Not in
the Line of natural Generation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it said that from such a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who lies under the Curse of Sin
and Sorrow, that this blessed Birth
should spring therefrom. Though in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29870:81"/>
Truth and Substance, a mighty and
wonderful Birth was made manifest,
wherein a deeper Mystery hath been
couched than to past Time, and past
Generations hath been Revealed. But
now the Hand of Love begins to move,
and the Covering is turning away off
from such, who are turned in to know the
Treasures of eternal Wisdom. The Spirit
of Truth is verily at hand to drive and
guide the pure Mind jointly with it self,
into the Ocean-Mystery, which is God
himself in his abstracted Deity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
separated Spirits may very deeply
dive, when they are departed from
their Earthly Senses. This deep thing,
which is upon revealing, I found like a
boiling Pot of Oyntment, so sweetly
flowing into my Intellectual part. Upon
which my Mind as all in a flaming
Light was enlightned to see, what under
the Mantle did lie. Who according to
eternal Counsel, was hereunto fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained,
typically to be brought forth
in the Line of Natural Virginity, even
a Man or Sorrows, and acquainted with
Griefs, and subjected to Sufferings, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and covering by a Terrestial Form,
that sparkling Star of the Deity: Which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29870:81"/>
also would have been obscured, if he
had not again risen from the Dead. Which
gave the Church a mighty Remove in
that day, from shadows, into that which
was more Spiritual and Substantial,
through the giving of the Unction.
Which hath from that Age striven migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
but the Man of sin still hath been
too strong: witness those Complaints,
to the very breaking Hour of Mortality,
in them that are highest in the Birth-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of Jesus, as working through
humane Properties. But then an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
must rise herefrom. If all this
be too short, what more is there yet to
come? Things now have long stood at
a stay, what may we from the mighty
God and everlasting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Father more yet
expect? that so the Temple Body of
Jesus, may not still lie unperfected.
Well, what more forceable can there be?
then Christ in the Flesh, and Christ in the
Spirit? <hi>Ans.</hi> To this there is an Answer,
by the All-searching Spirit prepared,
there is yet a Virgin Woman to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
out from the Heavens, whereof
<hi>Mary</hi> that bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght forth Christ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Flesh, was but a Type. For
it was neither <hi>Eve,</hi> nor she to whom the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29870:82"/>
Promise was made, concerning that Birth,
which should bruise the Serpent's seven
headed Power. There must be another
Genealogy found out, from whence the
Serpent-treader must also come. Look
and see, and you shall find hereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. To which place, I
was by that Holy Ghostly Seer referred,
as to a Foundation for this more Excelling
Ministration. <hi>Iohn</hi> seeing this in Vision
so long since, and nothing hereof yet
produced, let not that seem so marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in your Eyes, for Times decreed are
in the Spirit, as known to God, in what
Age in the World this Blessing will be
most seasonably brought forth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
ye may by Wisdom's Star, that
hath appeared in your Heavens, that
out-thence (if kept pure and clear) this
great Wonder may follow, according as
ye did see in the late Idea. But, ah my
Lord, how is this to be understood? sure
this Woman is not to be manifested in any
one Particular, who is subsisting in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Substance. For she will come all
arrayed in a Body Saphire-like, and not
in the garb of the Mortal Creature, with
the Globe of this World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> under her Feet.
Therefore this Query meets with this,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:29870:82"/>
Who living in this Principle, may expect
such a Ray of Glory for to become a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering?
And this was Answered, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dost thou think, that it was cryed
up for a Wonder, if it was not upon
some extraordinary change, who though
thus transformed into such brightness of
Excellency, yet she is called a Woman:
But the pure Heavenly Glory altogether,
covereth the Creaturely Being. The
sparkling Deity that was hid within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the great and high amazement, a
flaming Garment. This also will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to the right discerning Eye in this
present Sphere, from whence will arise
the admiration? and great questioning
there will be, from whence this Woman
did proceed? If any hereof shall make
a doubt, how it can ever be on Earth?
for Virgin Wisdom to draw over her
Virgin Vail of Purity in some one or
other, so as expresly to Personate her.
Tell them from the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi>
such a spotless Lilly will sprout out of
the Immaculate Body, and shall be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
from the Heavens so fair and lovely,
that she will be elected for the Lamb's
Bride and Mate, who raised is to the
high Eagle state, who may have Power
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29870:83"/>
mount into the Heavenly Place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be sent therefrom, for such purposes
and intents as here are premised. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
big with such a travelling Seed, as
may break the Serpent's Head in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
him, who hath got into the
Heavenly Place. Where now expect, he
will be cast out, as strong travelling Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do take hold upon this Woman.
These Pangs and Sorrows will differ
much, from those that were in <hi>Eve</hi>'s day;
whose Sorrows greatly multiplied hereby,
through a natural, vile, sinful Body: no
hope whereof there is that ever it shall
be destroyed, till this Birth of Births doth
grow to ripeness in any such one. Who
in Wisdom's Virgin likeness shall be bred
up to the Wonder in Heavenly Places,
from whence all Wonders shall go forth.
For who, but this Man-child shall be the
Ruler of Nations in all Soveraignity,
no more under the Power of any <hi>Herod,</hi>
or <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> to be arraigned unto
Death? For he is immediately caught
up unto God and his Throne, and from
thence is to descend again; to bring up
the Remnant of the Virgin-Seed, against
whom the Dragon still makes War. But
to each one, who belongs to this his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:29870:83"/>
of Priests, they shall be mightily
born up upon his strong Eagle-Body, so
as all the Dragon's Floods shall be too
short to reach this high Eagle-Nest, which
is prepared in the Heavenly Place. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Rock of Strength, I, saith the
<hi>Amen,</hi> will build my Virgin Church,
who shall know no more any thing of
the Number of the Beast, but shall be
totally acquitted from Men of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quality. Therefore I give this Word
to you in particular, that ye may know,
there is somewhat of Grace to you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
by this Prophecy, which is upon
renewing. Therefore consider hereof,
and ponder it deeply: for to the pure
chast Virgin Mind, much of this may
happen suddenly. You daily from the
Unction have received much in order
hereunto; which Golden Talent I do
expect should be improved, that so ye
may further be trusted with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Dignities and Powers, tending
to Wisdom's Star sparkling Crown, which
to none is given, till they be quite driven
out of the Worldly Principle. If now
then ye can ascend with all your Might
to this Tree of Life, you may find quick
Removes to him, who is that Ghostly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29870:84"/>
overshadowing Power, who can impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with this last all-saving Birth. O,
saith the Spirit, that hereunto ye could
give your selves without further debate,
to the glorified Person of your Jesus;
that the issue might be, to wit, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Son of Might, brought forth to
all Wonderment.</p>

               <p>Now as concerning the latter Vision,
whereof I gave a Narrative, according
as I had magically seen it. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
whereof was after this manner
given to me, this is the Child that is born
from the Heavenly Virgin Womb, after

Moreover it was said to me, Dost thou

Years since a Son of God with great earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

be a Temple, Priest, and Prophet, if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou mightest be answered. Though
thy Petition was not granted in that way,
as to have a Son by earthly Generation,
but much better it shall be, if thou shalt
see the travel of thy Soul and Spirit in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29870:84"/>
the Birth of a pure <hi>Nazarite,</hi> given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee from the Lord. Which is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
degrees beyond what once thou
were greatly sollicitous after, to wit, a
fleshly Birth. Since which time, much
hath been wrought for thee, Wisdom
hath so highly favoured thee, as to cast
thee into her Virgin Mould, or else no
way capable to embrace such a Man-child,
who shall have Power to do great and
mighty things on the Earth, and to hold
up the four Winds, an <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit, to
shut and open the Heavens. Such a one
God will need upon the Earth to have,
but none could yet arrive to this mighty
high and glorified state, the mortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hitherto so hindred, and the Dragon
hath raised great Seas of partition, and
hath brought down such with his twisting
Tail, as were ascending for Heaven; for
out of Mount <hi>Sion's</hi> Heaven, Wisdom's
deputed Virgin Woman is to descend
with all accomplished Power, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Holiness. Then what manner of
Child, thinkest thou this must be, Who
is begotten by the Eternal Word of
Truth, and is daily to be brought up a

Milk from the Virgin Breast, that so his

strength may hereby daily grow? Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
thou, and blessed wilt be called, if
such a spoiless <hi>Nazarite</hi> Lilly thou shalt
bring out of thy Spiritual Womb. At
which I tell thee, who am the All-Seer,
the Serpent doth heave mightily against
it: there is daily plotting to make hereof
an abortive; nay, when thou hast him
in thy Arms, it may slip away. Which
for Caution was shewn, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
take hereof sure hold, because this
Holy Birth is designed to be in that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to whom the Serpent hath had long
Indignation, but through great heed,
and daily watching and care, he may
keep out from this last prepared hurtful
Snare. Who, then shall indeed bear the
Banner of Victory over all his, and thy
home-bred Enemies. Who if obedient
to his Eternal Virgin-Mother in all things,
which shall proceed from the Law of her
Mouth, may then be the Man of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
indeed. But before-hand, take thou
charge on his behalf, lest he suffer any
<hi>Dalilah,</hi> to come near his Head with a
Rasor, where only his strength doth lie:
if so, all will be undone; as ye did see in
the case of <hi>Sampson.</hi> This holy spiritual
Off-spring must be for the Conversation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:29870:85"/>
of Masculine Virgins, who are of his own

let him abide in that Milk-white Nature

               <p>In this juncture of time, upon these
weighty Prophecies frequently opening
upon me, they indeed took up my whole
Mind in Spiritual Debate for my self,
and that <hi>Nazarite</hi> whom the Prophecy
did still eye, for whom I was made to
be concerned: Because he was to be a joint
Pillar to bear up, and to declare this

and warred against, so soon as it should
be brought to Light. Nay while but u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us revealing, the Serpent doth work,
in many Wiles here against us: of which
still we have Warnings by Vision and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakings.
As after Break of Day, this
by Presentation was shewn to me, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the twink of an Eye, I did espy a
young Dragon out of a Hole of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29870:86"/>
Earth, with Head, Wings and Tail, so
speckled with black Venomous Spots,
as I could not bear to look upon it, and
while I was considering what should be
done to destroy this Venomous Beast;
immediately from on high, a young
sprightly Eagle down did fly upon the
Back hereof, with such undauntedness,
as it had no power to resist the Eagles
arrest. Who did mightily tear with
her Bill the Dragon's back and tail.
What further Victory she had, I did not
see, the Vision hereof shutting up. But this
Word of Comfort was present with me,
saying, See see after this manner ye will
be relieved by your own Eagle-Spirit;
for nothing is like to the courage and
strength of an Eagle. Therefore when
at any time this polluted Beast shall face
to daunt and affright you, gather up
your Eagle-Might, and be revenged in
the first place upon that Tail, wherein
doth lie to you the greatest danger, for
there is both Sting, Venom, and Poyson,
and also subtle attracting Insinuation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

These are very hurtful, because not
discerned; therefore not feared or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted.
As if his Head was set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
against you, then ye could not but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29870:87"/>
see his Mouth standing always wide open,
to swallow up what, and whoever doth
but look within the Circle of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Of which ye have been aware,
and therefore have been kept by virtue
of an unknown Angelical Guard, from
his Mouths foaming Rage. Which this
subtle Serpent knoweth well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath turned his Tail against you
through a young one. Who if possible
might overcome your Virgin Spirits, and
cause you to turn down, and fall in with
the Dragon and Beast again, after all
chast separating <hi>Nazarite</hi> Vows, and
ascending Mights, by which like Eagles,
ye fly to the Munition of Rocks. Who with
his Scorpion Tail will then surely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
you, whose sting and power lieth
there to hurt by Commission from the
King of the Bottomless Pit. Therefore
your onset make, like a right brood
Eagle from your Tree of Life, (your
Eagle-Eye will soon espy all Scorpion
Spirits, with their twisting Tails) and
then rend and tear with the Golden
Bill of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Take present care of the Heavens of your

For an instance hereof, that Scripture

how immediately was he with them, and

against <hi>Eves</hi> Birth, as it hung upon the

the Center of Vision and Revelation.
Whereby heaviness was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spirit, so as I was made to pour
out my Complaint in secret to my Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29870:88"/>
Jesus. Upon which after some Repose
in the Night, there was the similitude of
a Man standing before me, leaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Tree, with a working Tool in his
Hand, as one worn out with Labour,
with a Dew of Sweat upon his Face; he
seemed to be so sick and tired, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
I would bear him a way from that
place; whereupon I took him up, and
carried him upon my Back, but I could
not long bear this ponderous Person, but
must throw him off, else I perceived we
must fall down together. Whereupon it
was said, Carry him back to his own
place, who did come from the Earth,
and thereto he must return, for to spend
out his Life, and dye, that thou thereby
mayst be fully discharged. Which Idea
had a considerable Speaking in it, as it
did plainly allude to the fallen Adamical
state, the meaning of which was clearly
opened by the Spirit, who said, What
hast thou here seen, but that old Life
<hi>Adam,</hi> who was made out of the Dust,
and inferiour part of the Earth, who is
turned out from the Angelical Shape,
where he might have very near address
to God, his Maker. But he did suck in
that, from that wretched Tree, which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29870:89"/>
hath made him so deplorable a Figure,
as thou didst see. So as he is only meet
to spend his days in toil and labour upon
that Ground which is cursed for his sake,
so as nothing it will or can bring forth
without Sweat of the Face. Oh ye,
who are sufficiently sensible of this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
toiling Day; into which all are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
but can bear the Burthen as if it
were indeed a Paradisical Sphere, so
lightly hath the whole Creation yet cared
for its relasped state: How choice and
few are those, that do seek herefrom to
be released, being of that Perswasion,
that the Earthly with the Heavenly must
unseparably grow together as Twins?
Which is not so determined by the great
God and Creator, but he doth still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that through the many depressions
both in Spirit and Body, some one
or other, are this long-run out time,
would be so weary of the Body of toil,
sorrow, and Sin, as to violate, upon the
Love, Pity, and Power of God the Father;
who cannot resist to send forth saving
Succour to ransom such, as still do fill his
Ears with Cries and Groans for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
out of that which is the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Original matter of all and every kind
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29870:89"/>
of thraldom. Hearken now, and hear
the Glad-tydings, which is sent from
your Father to you, who hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of your travelling Sorrows, while
yoked with that Man, upon whom Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is past, that he might live by care
and labour, yet to you I say, he shall
not always, and for ever be your clog.
There is a Birth of Strength upon the
rising, that will easily throw off this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Weight. Yet a little while, and
the Iron-rod shall rule the Man of
Sin, so as to divide him from thee. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways have been tryed to make him
dye, but all have been too short, for he
hath been a Warriour from his Original
Sin-Conception, and will keep the Field
of this out-birth, as he hath done from
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Day. What hopes then say
you? that out of us he shall be thrown
out, for here I did object in Love, Fear,
and Faith, that many worthy Ones had
striven hard to conquer by Death, some
of whom did go very far, but scarce in
any did this Death-Arrow so hit, as to
obliterate Sin altogether in its Root.
Then was it replyed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> It is sufficient, that
one was perfect and just without Sin in a
humane Figure; then was that Scripture
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29870:90"/>
spoken in me, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. As by one
mans disobedience, so by the obedience of
one, many shall be made righteous.</hi> The
Words were thus opened by the Spirit,
who said, God revealed to <hi>Paul</hi> in his
Day, that nothing less was designed, than
a full and clear Acquitment from that
first Man, which did so naturally work
in toyl and labour, bringing only forth
Fruit unto Death. And who but that
Man, called the Branch, shall answer to
that defectiveness, in abolishing the very
Sperm of Sin: that as nothing thereof
could be found in himself, so likewise in
those, who are elected for to be in joynt
Heir-ship in the Kingdom of <hi>Mount Sion</hi>
with him. Whereunto he translates
none, till the old <hi>Adamical</hi> Life is laid
in an everlasting Sleep of Death, no more
to awake for Contempt and Shame. As
often now it doth, which hath stopped
the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> from descending down,
because once hath been perfect &amp; ready to
meet this heavenly City. Therefore saith
the most Holy and True, another manner
of Church must be gathered from among
Men, who out of the Womb of that first
Morning Star, that is now upon break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, a Star-like Off-spring is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:29870:90"/>
that shall go forth with the iron Rod
of Power, and dash in pieces every one
of the Dragons Heads, till this Church
be born upon the Earth. Who all are of
Angelical Natures, till then expect no
Power over the Dragons and Beasts to
reign. To you who Numbred are to
bear the Lambs Trophies, stand to your
Virgin Call; fly not from her innocent
White Colours, whatever shall be here
said against her. If ye shall be the first
born Star, who shall shine upon Wisdoms
Crown; the Loves eternal Testimony
for this end hath opened the clear Body
of the Heavens, that ye might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what may be looked for in this
Age. Therefore do you stand as mighty
and immoveable Pillars for the Lamb and
the Brides Church, and great Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have against those that would it
down decry. Fear not those pushing
Horns, that war here against her, she
will make the glittering Sword of Power
to be your defence against all your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Be not troubled at the fewness of
your Number: for out of one or two
that shall be perfect in their Generation,
a strange Generation may proceed, who
all mighty Warriours shall be for God
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29870:91"/>
and the Lamb, to follow him in tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down all earthly Powers. Keep but
up to your Leaders, and ye need to fear
no ill, for invisible Seraphims shall still
pitch a mighty Pavilion round about
you.</p>

               <head>March the 20th. 1666/7.</head>
               <p>Thus ended this Revelation from the
Vision I had seen: which left a sweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
Sence of Love, Peace, and Joy to
feed upon.</p>
               <p>Another Idea was presented to me
from the History of <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> and <hi>Vashti</hi>
his first espoused Queen. Who by her
act of Disobedience to her Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
was banished his Throne. This
Word with great Power did through me
sound; A Virgin Queen among the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
shall be found, that shall be crown'd
in the room of <hi>Vashti.</hi> Then saw I one
in the similitude of a Woman cloathed
with Scarlet, which was said, This is
one of Wisdom's Houshold, who but
she for the King of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi>
whose Garment is of an unstainable Dye?
From hence the Spirit made use of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29870:91"/>
whole literal Discourse <hi>Ahashuerus, Vashti,</hi>
and <hi>Esther.</hi> The most high Majesty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Figuring out himself, having created
and made for the Excellency and Glory
of his Kingdom, according to the state
of so wise and infinite a Being. That so
he might take Pleasure in all the Glory
and Riches of his Kingdom, or Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being all made perfect and good,
and high Princely Angels and Powers for
Attendance. As also Creating one more
Noble Image as Male and Female, who
was in Election to be advanced to very
high Dignity, no ways inferiour to any
Princely Spirit in the Angelical Figure.
But now the Sovereignty of the most
High resolved to try this his new formed
Creature with a Law of Restriction, as
from the Lord their Maker and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who might well expect a ready
and punctual Obedience. Who <hi>Vashti</hi>
like was disobedient to the great King's
Command, and so thereby was turned
into an earthly <hi>Eve,</hi> and immediately ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out from the high Throne Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
For else it would have been an
ill President, if God should not thus
have done, the heavenly Hierarchy
might have questioned God's immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29870:92"/>
and thereby have taken advantage
to deviate from those known Angelical
Laws, which the great Creatour had to
them perfixed. Thus much was opened
of this Original <hi>Eve,</hi> from whence the
contradicting and slighting <hi>Vashti</hi> Spirit
doth proceed. The true Virgins Life,
which the first formed Man was once
in, is now as to him, and all of his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
carried away as a Captive, and sold
for nought. For this Virgin Nature, was
wholly taken away upon this act of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
Who though thus made to
fly from the earthly Man, yet she is in
safe and sure Custody, to bring her
forth again in the most needful and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
time; which will be, when you
see the Pride, and stately Insolency of
<hi>Vashti</hi>'s Spirit generally grown so high in
the World for contempt, and neglect of
those Superiour and Paradisical Laws,
which by God the Creatour, were upon
all enjoyned. But now being by all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
forfeited, What is decreed hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to be done? Why, <hi>Vashti,</hi> who hath
wrought all this Evil, and doth work still
in every one, must depart from the
Crown Dignity, and no more appear
near the Throne of the Majesty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29870:92"/>
but evermore be counted as dead
to the eternal Royalty. Then heard I this
Voice sound, saying, Come, come, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mate must be found for the King;
search, and see, she must be found among
the Children of the Captivity, one more
excelling for Beauty, Amiableness, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Meekness, Humility, Love,
and Patience, than any other; by which
Endowments, the true Virgin Queen,
that is allotted to be in <hi>Vashti</hi>'s room,
shall be known. For such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one is in the
Eye of the great and mighty <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi>
for to find Favour and Kindness. Then
was it further shewed to me, that
such a one, so excellently qualified in all
perfection of Holiness, is to be admitted
into the Bosom of the most Holy. That
she would have hereby great Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to plead for the Liberty of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Seed. This Wise Virgin I did now see
in a Figure, that she, by Council with
the upright <hi>Mordecai,</hi> did bring to pass
great and mighty Deliverance, according
to the literal similitude. Now then the
true <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Spirit, is that which was
still in Unity with <hi>Esther:</hi> without whom
she would do nothing. Whereby it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be observed, that where two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29870:93"/>
are thus in Harmony, upon a high
and spiritual Account, there is great
Force and Strength united to a blessed
Success: Both ways considered, as each
one, having a <hi>Mordecai</hi> Councelling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
within themselves; or distinct, as in
a Person without, both of which are of
great service in the Work of the Lord.
Some Rules were given to her, who is
to succeed <hi>Vashti,</hi> that so she might gain
Esteem, and Favour with the King. As
first a Child like Innocency, and humble
Simplicity, and staid Sobriety, which
may render her as a blushing Bride of
Virginity, all pure and fair as the Lilly.
Such a one will be most meet to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and personate the eternal Virgin, that
so the Crown of Queen-like Power might
be set on her Head. Then she may have
access upon more equal terms to this
mighty potent King; for herein lieth the
great Priviledge, that upon any straits or
distress as may happen, this worthy
<hi>Esther</hi> knoweth whither to repair, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both the Heart and Ear of that
mighty one, who hath Dominion every
where. She knowing her times, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Cause is Just, for which she
makes her Application. Here also I was
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29870:93"/>
incited from this History, for to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the state of this <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> who
had a Court and Tendance for himself,
and another for his Queen, with her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.
Even so the high and holy
One, hath two most holy Courts, for
Purity, and heavenly State. The one is
the great Pallace <hi>Shusan,</hi> which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> state of Glory; the
other is the Celestial All-springing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
provided for the Virgin Queen,
and her most honourable Women; where
she, that principal One, in whom the
King delighteth, is often sent for to
see, and to be honoured among that
high Assembly. She at no time is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to her Lords Command, but
rejoyceth to be admitted to every spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Feast: and then again by reciprocal
Love invites also her Lord and King to
banquet with her, of such Fruits, as she
well knows will please him; so that
there is no end of Love's Commerce.
This chast and loyal Bride loveth not,
if it might be permitted, to make
one Meal, without her beloved King.
She admitteth none into her secret
Courts, but such grave <hi>Mordecai's,</hi> and
such as are Virgins like unto her self.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29870:94"/>
The <hi>Haman</hi> once or twice intruded with
the King, which doth allude to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
Serpent Seed, of which the wise and
prudent <hi>Esther,</hi> with her <hi>Mordecai</hi> did
foresee the Danger, and the subtle Plot
for eternal Ruine; and therefore wisely
grounded themselves, first in the Love,
Favour, and good Will of their King.
Even so do ye imitate the Examples of
these worthy Ones: observe all things as
in the History, so in the lively track of
the Mystery. Let it be your grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to ingratiate your selves in this your
Captive state, with the mighty Potences in
heavenly Places: Act each one both these
Parts. Oh <hi>Mordecai!</hi> if any thing of
Treachery, or Dishonour thou knowest
against thy Lord the King, be faithful to
bring it before him, that when need is,
it may be remembred; for hereby the
Virgin Seed in time shall rise to promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Oh <hi>Esther!</hi> maintain that Love
and Favour which thou hast obtained,
hold fast what thou hast received of that
Love Pledge, do thou prepare often in
thy Paradisical Mind, what may please
and have influence upon thy mighty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Lord. Be sure to maintain all
intimacies, for verily the Day is not only
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29870:94"/>
comming, but now is, when both <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>
and <hi>Esther</hi> shall have occasion to
set a work, the utmost interest they have
both for themselves, and for a scatter'd
Seed, with the great King; to give seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power for Confirmation and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in a wonderful way: As also
Decrees to reverse and change, what
seems so unalterable in the visible state
of Things among the oppressed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.
Here now somewhat of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
Book is opened, seek the right
Eye Salve, that ye may plainly read
these things, and make high and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Use of them, that <hi>Esthers</hi> good

               <p>In the Night, as I was waiting in my
wonted solemn Retirement, what might
further be administred. I was cast as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a magical Sleep, where I saw my
self carried into a Wilderness; where I
saw only pleasant, pastoral Walks and
Trees, which much suited with my Mind
and Inclination there to walk; where I
found nothing to disturb my superiour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29870:95"/>
Meditations. In which place I promised
my self opportunity, as not willing that
either my Name, or Place should be
known to any, saving One. But while
I was thus pleasured in my reserved state,
I suddainly did see one, that was known
to me, walking very strait and upright,
with a Book reading in his Hand: He
seemed to be as one, that would not
look awry. But it was said presently,
that this Person was a Spy: Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
two more did appear of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Sex, both which did make a kind of
Assault upon me; but one of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
was more fierce, and did give my
outward Skin a prick, as with a sharp
Needle. Upon which I called for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
aid to succour me, or else too
hard they would be. Whereupon I was
parted from them, and saw them in that
place no more: A voice, saying, None
here shall henceforth come, but such as
can agree to walk with thee perfectly.
And so the Vision broke up.</p>

                  <p>Some Days after I did further enquire
into the more full meaning of this Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
why such should so conspire against
my solitary reserved Life: but especially
that one, who was in my Eye of more

my Heart, Their Eyes must for a while
be with-held; they will not you know,

For it was secretly whispered to
my Spirit, that in some there might be a
refined and spiritual Emulation, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
a more Gross and Sensual. Both of
which I had councel, and caution, how
to walk with; so as no occasion, of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

Furnish thy House, and stock it well with
choice Vessels of all kind, that are fit

               <p>THis Word I was reminded of, as a
Prophesie to be fulfilled in this
la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Age of Time: Rejoyce, O ye Souls,
in what I am about to do; which is to
create new Heavens in your old Earth;
to change it into a spiritual Frame and
Model, wherein the holy Ghost, that I
will send down, shall evermore abide
and dwell: Then shall ye bear the Name
of <hi>Immanuel.</hi> Now it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what the reason was why the holy
Ghost could not transform the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
into its first Original Purity; which
was because the new Heavens were not yet
Framed: which do represent a Mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and a Heart purified. For that
Scripture was opened to me, If Christ
be risen in you, than hath Sin no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over you, but its Body sinks and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29870:98"/>
dies away. For till the Body of Sin be
laid, there can be no assuming of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Body, at least for duration. Then
again the great Prince and Shepherd had
another design to gather up holy, choice
Spirits, that had lived in mortal Bodies,
to come up after him, to make up the
<hi>Mount Sion</hi> Church, in the invisible Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Sphere. And those that have
kept fast the Word of Truth in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and have fought the good Fight of
Faith; if that they dye in the Warfare,
they shall loose nothing of what they have
so far wrought; there is a Reservation
and a Place for such, to perfect what is
lacking. For,</p>
               <p>1. Christ himself did not go out of
the Body into the highest mansion of
Glory, but he first entred Paradise: So
likewise those, whom the Father hath
given to him, must whether in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or out of the Body, make their first
remove thither, to be fully made meet,
to be gathered up to the Fountain-head
of all springing Wisdom and Glory. A
known Number here is to make up the
Flock for this upper Fold; whereof are
the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29870:98"/>
who are nominated to be Elders among
that great Assembly; who are moved out
of Paradise to sit in heavenly Places,
with their head Prince and Mediatour.
To which holy Place there are some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfect Spirits in every Age added,
as Saints breaking away from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>This now is a Dispensation of that
Time mentioned, of a gathering in of
heavenly Spirits to Christ, out of the
reformed Paradise. But there is yet a
fuller Time and Dispensation to come,
that shall answer to the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> above,
which is said to come down. Here is a
<hi>Mount Sion</hi> Church to be gathered out
from among all Churches of Men, by
the preparing Ministry of an <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit,
who is to make ready against the Lord's
return from that solemnized Wedding
with the present triumphant Church.
Now what is meant by this <hi>Elias</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
But such a Spirit as hath Power to
transform and translate at pleasure. This
<hi>Elias</hi> is not an abstracted Ghost, but is in
Conjunction with a flaming Body of
Light. This was that, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
eyed much in their Days, and had
the Revelation thereof; but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29870:99"/>
for the latter Ages. This pure
abstracted ghostly Power did come upon
them, and did great things through their
own Bodies, but did not work to the
height of a ghostly Body; for then Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
would have been over Cloathed
with Celestiality: Therefore it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for a future Season. This Apple
is not yet fallen upon any one, but is
growing to the full golden Colour, to
give a full Body and Spirit to them:
For whosoever shall eat of this golden
Apple, shall be transmuted into a Body
as of fine Gold. And so who shall first
partake hereof, the <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit will
soon operate, to translate them from
terrestial Things. Then was this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
with me, But who of all Flesh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now shall this great <hi>Elias</hi> perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Or ever come his Day to see?
Many various Visions, and Prophesies,
and many Persons tending hereunto have
been, both in former and present times.
But oh, dearest Lord! when, and how,
and upon whom shall this be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
seeing all so universally are slow
of Heart to believe? To know posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
I dare not will, lest I should
grieve the holy Spirit, remembring that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29870:99"/>
Rebuke, which Christ gave when his
Disciples asked, Whether he would at
that time restore the Kingdom? Who
did not seem to be pleased, that they
did urge the thing so closely. Which
made me sober upon the like occasion;
though through the Vision and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon it, I had some temptation to
encroach upon that, which is said to
have the Mind of <hi>Iesus:</hi> which had its
Times and Seasons, which waiting upon,
great things might be revealed. And
accordingly this Word, in way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
sprang freely in me; Go your way
in that Measure and Portion of Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and wait as <hi>Elias</hi> under the <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Tree;</hi> which signifies a Paradisical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
from which Tree all sweet
Scents do flow, as the holy Gusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
do blow. Which will send in that
which will give a Rich and Pleasant smell
to your God, in order to somewhat else.
Oh, who but those that are of an <hi>Elias</hi>
Spirit that are weary, and do make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of their mortal Terrestrial state,
and would know a Transmutation, are fit
for this which is here Prophesied of?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:29870:100"/>
Then again this Word was spoken to
me, That the great <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King,
who hath charge over the Houshold of
Faith, doth design before his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Manifestation in the World, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and raise up some, who shall be as
the Seven principal Shepherds: to go
forth in the Power and Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi>
to turn the Heart back again of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
lost Prodigal Children, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their eternal Spirits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to reconcile the two different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
That the <hi>Enochian</hi> state may be
revived for a free walking with God,
by the Light of the one eternal Day, to
pass in and out; not making reflect on upon
this course material Body, being super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
Cloathed upon with that,
which giveth holy Boldness to appear
in that most pure Sphere. Thus the
<hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> Spirit are to arise upon
some, who will mutually together agree
to break through this vile Principle;
though it be with Mountains rending,
and with Rocks breaking, and Earth
quakings. All which make way, for
the dividing from that low terrestial
state to incorporate with the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of God. As to this query, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29870:100"/>
hath only to say further thus; Do not
you put far away this Day through Fear,
and Unbelief, but turn into the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Paradise, and under the <hi>Iuniper</hi>
Tree bemoan your disappeared Virgin
Bodies; which sweet unknown Solitude,
attend for its Restoration. While you
abide here the Angelical Powers shall
minister spiritual Fare to strengthen
you, for what is further to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
by you. If you will hereunto
fixedly wait, then also given may be
the deep magical Book; in which Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
Spirit will make you Skilful in
the circling Planets, appertaining to
that invisible Element, which governeth
all belonging to the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi>
with all its Inhabitants there. Now
then as any shall desire in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s and

this deep Revelation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As I was in my Bed, contemplating
the unknown and invisible Orb of Glory,
longing for a Body, with which I might
have entrance thereinto: While I was
thus deeply mufing, there first appeared
to me a bright Cloud, which gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self into a round Compass; then it
opened into various Colours, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Splendorous with numerous Stars:
which were only discernible, as they
did not so visibly appear, because the
brightness did overcloud them. In the
midst of this, did suddainly break forth
somewhat like the Figure of an Eye,
which did look terrible, piercing through
all, with flaming Streams round it, which
were transcendently glorious. Upon
which I could not stedfastly look, till I
had closed my mortal Eyes: which then
for some space of time, I did behold,
and then it vanished in the twink of an
Eye; then opening to see whether I could
bear the glory of it, it did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
out of sight with this Word, What
Flesh can live in this refining Element?
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29870:101"/>
Then answered my Spirit, True, O Lord:
therefore the destruction of it I would
see, that I may come to live with thee in
these <hi>New Heavens.</hi> Why dearest Lord,
is this Crystalline Orb of Light, let down
only for view? If we may not partake
something of the Nature of it? How is it
that we have been so long lodged out of
the sight of thee in this remote Principle?
if it must still be, how can this vile Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial
state be grateful to Spirits, who
did pre-exist in thee before all Worlds;
coming now to understand what is their
true Eternal Dignity; to live in such lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Bodies, free and unclogged of
Corporeity? After I had thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
our deplorable Condition,
through the sight and sence of what was
in the Idea of my Spirit, I could not but
move this Question to my Sovereign
Creator, <hi>Why such a pure Spirit generated
out of the highest and super excellent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
should unite with such course, mean,
Corporal Forms, acted by a mortal, sensual,
rational Soul, that governed it by the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Region?</hi> To this deep Question, the
Spirit gave this Aaswer readily, That the
Immense Deity did hereby prepare high
and worthy Ends, in sowing pure Spirit
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29870:102"/>
into corruptible Flesh. As first for its
Probation, it cometh into such Bodies
to exercise, and to put forth its Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Might, for Mortifying, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and check all the natural Propensity;
which the mortal Spirit would tempt
that which is Eternal, to joyn with it in.
The which not yielding to, but maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its own Superiority, in curbing and
suppressing all of the earthly part, God
is hereby greatly pleased, and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
Therefore think not much, that
for the present there is such incongruous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
betwixt that which is Intellectual, and
that which is Terrestial. That which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
may command and subdue all what
ever is Temporary. Therefore be not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of your own Spirits Soveraignty,
but call up its true Authority, for the
Spiritualizing of what would be clouded
with Sensuality. For if you yield here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and are overcome, then your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
lies as dead and buried. And what
account can any such give to their Lord,
when he comes, who are thus slothful.
Therefore that Parable (consider of it)
about the Talents improving, had a very
deep meaning: if you should not be
faithful in the first stock of Life and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29870:102"/>
Spirit, you must not expect that more
high and full Trust, and latter Crop,
both Ghostly Spirit &amp; Body Celestial, will
be given. Therefore be patient, hold
out, and do the prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t work of the
day, and know your Reward is not far
from you. Then was the Vision of the
Holy Element to me opened, as thus,
The bright Airy Cloud, which gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it self into a round compass, and
was mixed with flame Colours so subtle
and pure; this was said to be the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all Celestial Bodies: and those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Stars, which were veiled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the bright Cloud, were naked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that did ascend out of Bodies ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial,
into this pure Element, and put
on Figurative Bodies bright and Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
corresponding to the Nature of the
Star-like sparkling Spirits, who did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be fixed in this pure Element.
Then further, as to that Majestical Eye,
which did appear so terribly piercing,
it was shewn me, nay, the Spirit did
plainly in a still Voice eccho in me, that
from this pure Eye all distinct Sparks of
Life did proceed, and did fly into mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bodies, according to the hour of
Life, and did come piercing into the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29870:103"/>
fleshly Womb, there to unite with a
corporeal Spirit, which is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
from <hi>Adam</hi>'s lapsed day.
Then was a Secret whispered into that
Ear, which open stood to hear, what
the Spirit dictated so uear, saying, Hast
thou not read that one Star differeth from
another in Glory, and one Angel is more
mighty and powerful, and greatly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
then others, yet all of and from
that pure Eye extracted. Even so fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learn, and receive this, That in the
productions of Spirits, there is great
difference, some greater, and more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehensive, and intelligent, and
strong to encounter with the averse
matter, to which they are united. For
know, this prerogative of Will, which
with God, the Fountain of all Spirits is
to be left free, is not here to be called
to an account by his Creatures. Who
gives Spirits successively to Bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
for what he hath for them more
eminent and extraordinary work to act
and do, in the lower Region of this
World. Therefore God hath left
himself this Liberty to give to one
five Talents, and to another but two, or
one. But if to that one, any shall be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29870:103"/>
faithful to improve it, while he lives in
this Body, doubt not but it is of very dear
acceptation with their Lord, to enter into
his Joy, though somewhat different accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Spirits degree. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Lot</hi> were both from a pure righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Seed, yet <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spirit of Truth
did much excell. And so ye may recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
innumerable Instances throughout all
Ages, as <hi>Enoch, Moses, Ioshuah, Elias,</hi>
who had answerably great Service to do
for their God, though so unsuitably
matched by Bodies; yet such was the
greatness of their Spirits, as they made
their very terrestial Man to keep pace
with their Spirits. Nay, such is the
power and ability of an Eternal Spirit,
through piercing into its original center,
that it may attract and cloath it self with
the inward Virgin Body; which is the
Matter of that pure Element, which thou
didst see; and so for Times and Seasons,
the gross Nature sublimated and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,
may be as oft of this kind, as
was formerly; according to the might
and potency of the Spirit existing in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
As this was shewn in your Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
both before and after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now what doth this Vision pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29870:104"/>
but the cloathing of some great
Saints with this pure Element. Who do
often withdraw from the Corporeal
Sense. Oh who can tell, What is here
to be enjoyed, but such as do slide away
from this vile earthly Climate? The
Seven-Star Planets will be given into
their Hands, the Influences of which
are all of pure Ghostly Inspiration, to
out-set and overthrow the earthly gross
Element, which so long hath prevented
the Heavenly Community. Now then
dive into your own Celestiality, and see
with what manner of Spirits ye are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued:
for in them the Powers do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
lie for Transformation.</p>
               <p>From the fore-going Revelation, it
was fully cleared unto me, for what cause
pure Spirits, which did proceed from
the holy Being, came to exist in mortal
Vehicles. It was not for any Sin or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
which they acted or did in the
times of their pre-existency in any Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Region, as some do believe, being
bare abstracted Spirits, without any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
Bodies. Only <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>
may be considered as the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and all included in them, as the
representative Heads of all successive Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29870:104"/>
who were mortalized after
their similitude. For which cause, Sin,
and Curse, and Death enter'd, but none
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgressions shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
for shall not the Judge of all
the Earth do and pass righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Shall any suffer for what they
could no way avoid? God forbid, as in
Sin all Men and Women were conceived
and born, so likewise in a Seed of Truth
and Righteousness, which is invisibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
for to destroy and overpower
the Serpently Seed, both growing up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which of them doth obtain the
mastership, doth remain in each ones
Principle. The most wise God having
laid in a sufficiency of Spirit, who in the
days of <hi>Noah,</hi> said, <hi>My Spirit in them
was tired out, striving still with them,</hi> so
God will clear and acquit himself of all,
that of this Nature can be charged upon
him. Then further it was opened unto
me from that Scripture, <hi>That as Sin hath
abounded, Grace shall much more abound.</hi>
This Grace was revealed in the Gift or
Infusion of the Spirit of Christ, as the
promised Seed of restoring Life unto
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> upon their very dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that they might not be as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, in that corporeal Image,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29870:105"/>
which they now were changed into. If
the Eternal Word, which was from the
beginning, had not been their Light and
Life, and so likewise generative to their
future Posterity, they had been in the
same condemnation with the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but the Eternal Word did even
then incarnate himself for their help and
recovery, and to save them from sinking
into that horrible Lake, which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
had prepared for them. Thus did
the Eternal Love immediately move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, to free them out of the
Dragon's Power, whose design was to
make them of their own Hierarchy, in
their Princely power of Darkness, out
from which the Lamb of God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
them. Who from the Foundation
of the World was the Salvation of God,
so still going on to the Ends of the
Earth. But while this new thing sprang
in my understanding, which seemed to
differ from what I had formerly received
as Truth, I besought the Lord my Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
to answer this Objection that was
raised thereupon. That if so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, the Eternal
Word (who is the new Birth-Seed) did
incorporate with <hi>Eve,</hi> whereby power
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:29870:105"/>
and ability were given to bring
forth wholly after the Spirit; how was
it then that she should and did bring
forth after the fleshly Image, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the first Man, which she
brought forth in the wrathful Property
first awakened. In Answer to this, I
found Light at hand to resolve me, As
thus, it did not seem good to the Wise
Creator to obliterate, and so presently to
wipe off the Stain, with which they by
the act of Disobedience had blemished
themselves. Some marks of Displeasure
the most Holy did still include them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as a Terrestial Body, and to bring
forth in Travel and Sorrow, what should
have been by Magical Power, and Joy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Celestial Angelical Forms: but now as the
effects of disregarding the Command of
God, they brought forth a mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
Image, according to their own
Likeness. But then I further queried, but
this Corporeity might have been Sinless, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Original Righteousness was also infused,
by the immortal Spark of Life entring in,
to incorporate with the outward Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Birth. That Spirit which had so pure
an Existency, and was in free Liberty,
should come into a necessitated thraldom
as in <hi>Cain</hi> was manifested. As to this I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:29870:106"/>
also obtained Satisfaction, that <hi>Cain</hi> had
the Eternal Light of Life with him, that
did fore-warn him, and convince him of
the end and danger of Sin, and that he
was under Probation, and that the Serpent
had liberty still to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s fallen into. Who
had an absolute Liberty of Will and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of Power to stand his Ground, as
God said to him by way of Reproof, If
thou dost well, shalt not thou be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but if not Sin lieth at thy own
Door. Which plainly doth declare, that
<hi>Cain</hi> should not have yielded himself Sins
Captive. So that in all Temptations, you
may know whither to fly, even to that
eternal Word within you: who is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Save, who Is and Was from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the First, and the Last, Visible
and Invisible, Deity in Humanity, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
out of Humanity; all making and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fullfilling and Manifestation
of the Mystery which hath been hid in
the Trinity. Which <hi>Arcanum</hi> will be
daily revealing in this latter Age. Then
arose a further Query to be answered, If
Christ as a Seed of Life was infused into
every individual Birth throughout the
Line of Terrestial Propagation, whereby
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29870:106"/>
a Sufficiency was found to bear down and
overcome, what the Serpent had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of this Venome and Sting of Sin
add Death: What further need was there
of Christ to assume a Body and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in the World as a Personal Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
by and through the offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Propitiatory Sacrifice for Sin; If it
could have been expiated by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Internal Light and Life, thus ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
Springing according to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Christ the Light of every one that
cometh into the World? As this is a
weighty and considerable Question, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
it shall be from That, which seeth
into the first Ground, of what cometh to
be manifested in time. Now then for
these Reasons it was expedient for him,
who was nominated the Second Person in
the Trinity to be exhibited in a corporal
Form upon this Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To declare the possibility of
bringing in and acting forth an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteousness in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rail humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which every way was beset and
assaulted with Temptations from all
dark Powers; which from their evil Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did conspire to overturn Truth and
Fidelity in this Immaculate Lamb; for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:29870:107"/>
had the Dragon prevailed upon him here,
Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
should never have been revealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then again for this Cause,
Christ was to be manifested in Flesh in
God-like Power, as very needful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
that great High-Priest, to attone
and make expiation for the Sins and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiveness
under the first Covenant,
which was given in <hi>Paradise;</hi> all since
having sinned after the similitude of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
Transgression. The holy Seed in
them being weak, through the Body
which is included, and falling under the
gross Element: which hath and doth in
some much more then others, choak and
smother the Life, and doth greatly cloud
and darken universally this pure Light
whereby the good part doth rarely get
the Victory in any, till they attain to a
good degree of Illumination and Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
For, this Spring of Light doth get
through but by degrees: for tho in it self
its of great Potency, yet need enough
there is, for Sins committed in the times
of Ignorance and Minority; before the
Spirit comes, to make the Soul under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it self, from whence it is relapsed:
I say, for the Remission of these Sins past
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29870:107"/>
through the forbearance of God, not
less then such a Sacrifice was your
Jesus for you to become.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> Place, Then as Christ ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
all Righteousness in his Humanity,
for an Example to his fellow Breathren,
so they might come to the unity of
the same perfect Life, by the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Spirit, which was in him through
the dying Life. For thereby your Lord
Jesus obtained a super-additional force
and power of Spirit to give, and shed
abroad into you, for the working out
a full Liberty and Salvation. For seeing
his pure Life-Seed was under oppression,
he also came into a Body of Flesh, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and free it from the Bondage of
Sin and Evil, and also the very Mortality
antecedent thereunto; according as it
is written, delivering them, who
through fear of Death, were all their
Life-time subject to bondage: Which no
way could be effected, but by Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Death. First in the humane
Figure of your Lord Jesus, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shewed you the way to do mystically,
that so thereby you might escape the
Second Death, through the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29870:108"/>
which is said to quicken Mortal
Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth</hi> Place, Now then further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s was the very great and
primary end of Christ coming into a Body
of Flesh to transfigure, and to shew the
way of Immortalizing of it, as he did
his own after his Resurrection, when he
ascended into the Kingdom of his Father.
Then this was also noted to me from hence
that had not Christ come down into a
Body, the highest Saint could have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no higher State than Paradice: though
endued with all the internal Excellency
from the Word of Life, as a Seed incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with it. For their highest dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Paradise, beyond which
Region neither Patriarchs nor prophets did
arrive before Christ's appearing in the
World. Therefore you see Christ imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
himself in a Terrestial Form brought
forth many considerable Advantages, if
they may now be considered of by the
wise hearted, so as to wait and expect
the fruits of that additional Spirit, that
is some degrees higher, than any Seraphick
Flame of Light. Believe it, and know it,
that this Breath of Fire breathed and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29870:108"/>
sucked in, will melt away all your gross
Metalline Corporeity.</p>

               <head type="sub">The True Shunamite</head>
               <p>As soon as I awaked in the Morning
this Word spake in me, What is to be
done for thee? Wouldst thou be spoken
for to the King? This Word I ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
often upon, what should be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereof, and for what intent it did so
speak. Which after some days was thus
resolved, that such who signatur'd are
with Spiritual Generosity and Largeness of
Love, answerably to that <hi>Shunamite,</hi> who
was so careful of <hi>Elisha,</hi> as to provide
for his Entertainment; even so grateful
would Christ the true Spirit of Prophecy
be unto them who have such a Proof of
Love and Esteem for him, as to furnish
out a most holy separate Place, for this
Prophet still to turn in into. First then it
was given me herefrom to observe, that
this <hi>Shunamite,</hi> as she did understand
him to be a Man of God, gave him great
Reverence, and would not lodge him in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:29870:109"/>
her own mixed Family; as judging none
there worthy of his Conversation: and
therefore did on purpose build a place of
Apartment for vacancy, that this holy Seer
might have opportunity for enquiry with
the Deity: Therefore she took care he
should not be disturbed. Then further
this Word came unto me, as not only for
Council, but for Information: that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was taken of such a true <hi>Shunamite,</hi>
who was in Council with her Eternal
Mate, that had prepared according to
this similitude, for this Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
a most holy inward place; with a
true Spiritual furnishment, of what was
necessary to tempt this true searching
Seer to take up here his abode. Then
was it shewn me, what I did not know
to be in my self so clearly, thus figured
out dstinctly by way of Allegory. First
a new Edifice on purpose was framed by
the wise Master Builder in us. Then a
Table-Heart, in which the Law of Love
was written. Then a Bed for to give
ease and rest to our Beloved, that he
might not be as a wayfaring Man. Know
this in each of us, so furnished out as his
own home, where we might retire to
him in the Light and Spring of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:29870:109"/>
Which is the Candlestick and
Candle fixed in us before-hand, without
which no comfortable abode for this
Prophet would be in us. Then again,
the Stool signifies a quiet fixation with
us without weariness, a blessed conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
In that there is but one Seat, it
shews that here is an excluding of all
other out of this Place. The <hi>Elisha</hi>
Spirit admitteth none to sit with him in
his Lodging: for this sitting or waiting
posture is proper for the Spiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner,
that night and day may minister
hereupon. Upon this I did receive an
approbation or Sealing Word for good
Hope and rich Consolation to us, who
could witness that large generosity of
Spirit in Love to this Prophet, before
whom we are called to stand. Who did
put indeed and verify this Question a
second time unto me, saying, What shall
be done for you, who have cared all
this Care for me, in giving me a place of
Apartment, where nothing might mingle
with me? Tell me now, what I shall
speak on your behalf, whether to the
King, or Captain of his Host? The King
here represents God the Father, the
Captain your Lord Jesus, the <hi>Elisha</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:29870:110"/>
Spirit, the Holy Ghost. Either of them
both can be heard at all times. Therefore,
see that ye be free in Humility with your
Prophet. Now having such a Grant
made to me, I consulted how to act the
part of a wise <hi>Shunamite;</hi> though I
could, and might take herefrom great
Liberty, yet I am taught to weigh all my
Request, that nothing rash or unadvised
may proceed from me. Oh my Lord
and great Prophet, I cannot compare
with the <hi>Shunamite</hi> in all things, who
said, That she was in her own Land and
People. But we may be said to be on some
account, as exile Captives, while
living in Elementary Bodies, also in a
Land under Babylonish tribute, which is
very grievous to the Supernal part.
Who knows its own true Nativity, as
seeing through the Glass of Eternity, what
we once were in pre-existency. But now
as existing in Forms of Mortality, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, that we need nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the highest degree of this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial
state. Therefore in blushing Fear
and holy Modesty, I did declare the
Sense hereof to my Prophet, If now my
Lord will speak for this unto the great
and mighty King, and Captain of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29870:110"/>
Lord's Host, that we may have release
out of all Babylonish thrall, and be
brought back again, to our own People,
to dwell in the Heavenly City. What
greater express of kindness can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
for us by the Prophet? But the
Spirit of <hi>Elisha</hi> replyed to me, There is
yet a greater thing then this, of which
thou hast made no mention, that must go
before it. Which is the one pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Birth; for that which is born
from beneath of fleshly Corporeity, can
never be gathered among those Celestial
Denisons, till immortaliz'd with pure and
Aethereal Bodies. Ah my Lord, if so,
what hopes can there he for us, who are
so united unto this out-Birth. Then said
the Prophet, Be quiet and still, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while this pure Birth, that is all of
Spirit, may freely Spring, in which you
will pass, where you so much long, and
desire for to dwell. But then this was
further revealed, that many would be
the cross workings of this Worldly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
therefore very wary we must be
to avoid all Minglings with it. For we
stood here upon a very nice point, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
know, and be only conversant with
this God-Man, from whom is diffused,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29870:111"/>
that which is of pure Birth Impregnancy,
that will excell in Perfection all of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Births. Yet said the Prophet, consider
further this, If you do attain to this Birth,
know while ye are in this Principle, it
is not out of all danger. Hazards do
attend it, as in the case of the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi>
while but in the Childish state.
The Four Elements may specially be in
strife against the Life hereof, when the
<hi>Elisha</hi>-Power may be with-drawn away.
Therefore keep up all Love, and sweet
Correspondency with this Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that ye may a Refuge have, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may happen for present or future
time, or may fall out upon you; making use
of this his great Friendship at all times,
when need doth require: who hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Breath for Life still to inspire.
So then according to what hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
herefrom, do you make use here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in a wise and understanding Spirit.</p>

               <p>I did see a Vision, which was thus
presented, as the form of a Hand, which
seemed to be grasped very close: out of
which sprung a living Creature, peeping
through the Fingers, and so by degrees did
quite break through the Fingers. First
appeared the Head, as in the Likeness of
a young Dove; but the Body was of the
colour of a Ruby, having Wings and
Fire-sparkling Eyes: which as soon as it
got through the Hand, it mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as into the Air, where I saw it no
more. This thing seemed very strange
to me, and for some days the meaning
was concealed, having other Ideas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening,
wherein my Intellectuals were
exercised. But this being brought to
remembrance, there was something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
to be understood from it, as by
the Spirit of Wisdom and Light was
made out very significantly.</p>
               <div type="interpretation">
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:29870:112"/>
                  <head>The Interpresation of this Vision.</head>
                  <p>As first, by the Hand, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
Strength, Power, and Activity, as
when God is said to do any marvellous
or unusual thing, it still goeth under
the denomination of his Hand. As it was
upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was in the Visions
of God, his Hand was said to be upon
him. And again, The Hand of the Lord
is nor shortned, but said to be stretched
out as a strong over-spreading Hand.
Therefore after the similitude of a Hand
the Creating Power doth go forth, as in
Vision it was shewn thee, what in time
might be effected. Then this Question
was put to me, What now dost thou
believe that living Creature to be, which
was so wonderfully formed in the Hand?
Ah my Lord, I do make no conclusion
hereof, I wait singly to participate of
thy Mind, whose sweet Voice and Sound
I through thy Grace am learned in, and
do hereunto attend. Therefore speak
my Lord yet again. Then did this
Word pass through me, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a Spirit's Speech, saying, The
Living Creature, which did break away
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29870:112"/>
through the Hand, doth figure out
that which is of great import, as namely
a Cherub Birth. Whereof the <hi>Elisha</hi>
Spirit hath Prophesied should be brought
to pass, where the least expectation
might be. As in the case of the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi>
who was strangely surprized, when
the Prophet did her greet herewith:
Even so unexpectedly will the Earth be
blessed with such a Birth, that shall be
hatched under the mighty Hand of
Power: which will ascend straitway to
this Mountain high. And it was further
hinted to me, that as I could not see nor
understand any matter contributed, to
be the substance of this Living Creature;
so it must be here. Which as I was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of in my self, that Scripture
was struck upon me, It is the Stone,
that is cut out, without Artificial work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or known matter. Therefore said
the Spirit, so consider of it: this is that
holy Breath, that none indeed can tell
from whence it comes, nor whither it
goes; it resteth upon whom it self wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and there contracts incorporeal
matter; that so a Body Cherub-like may
go forth from under the overshadowing
Hand. Know of such like the New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:29870:113"/>
and Earth are henceforth only
to be furnished withal. Therefore for
certainty that Word will be made good,
Behold the Face of all things will renew.
But how? No otherwise, but by the
Powers, that shall go forth from this Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub-Birth.
That when once got through
will numerate, as those mighty Angels
of the Resurrection; who will be of
great force to pour out the Vials of
Wrath upon the Dragon and Beast,
Who hath had his Root and Seat in man's
inward part, and there hath made all
the defilement. Therefore Vengeance
upon the Beast will be ere long taken,
because he hath been so mingled, not
only with gross Sensuality, but also
with the Serpently Property. That all
now, who are herein found, who are
designed for the Kingdom of Heaven,
must suffer under the Violation of this
blest Birth, whose rising will be the fall
of what is Fleshly. For saith he that
maketh all things, Yet once more an
End is come of all Flesh before me. A
New Creation is to succeed out of, and
from under the hiding Power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Hand, in such who now cloathed
are with this present Creation, in such
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29870:113"/>
rough Beast-like Garments, whereof they
are ashamed. Therefore it is that such
mean perishing Coverings, which are not
so much as Moth-proof, they do seek to
make comely to each Mortal Eye: but
here is a Birth of another Nature and
Consistency, that neither needs, nor will
accept of any of this vile matter from the
grosser Elements; knowing well, that
course Linnen, which is spun out from
thence, will no way become such, as must
pass into that City: Which is so bright
and clear; where nothing is worn, but
what is Aethereal and trausparent. The
Light there is such, as soon makes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of what is contrary. Then said
my Spirit, Ah my Lord, thou hast spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of great things to come, happy is that
Age, who shall see such a Birth-day as this.
But this question, my dear Lord, resolve
to me, which is this. What hath made
this Spiritual Birth thus long to stick in
the World? <hi>Ans.</hi> Because this out
Birth by way of Natural Generation,
hath now had such a long circling Life,
in the deep impression of the Stats; that
it is rooted as a strong Oak, that would
give way to no other, but to the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Ax of this Birth of the Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:29870:114"/>
Which by reason of long custom, and
habit is grown too stubborn and strong,
for the young plant seed to deal with
it. It meeting with many disadvantages,
both as to place, and Persons, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of things in and from this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
That so it need to be no wonder,
that this Birth find such difficulty in any
for to get through: But this old oaky Birth
shall not be only lopped by degrees, and
the root of the matter left still to spring
from generation to generation, in those
who are allotted for Redemption. No,
know you, Jesus will not have it run by
natural Course to the end of Time.
Thus his Trumpet hath already sounded
to awaken some, that did as others sleep
in the dust; who are risen to a better
hope, seeking to be cloathed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Robes. To such, as first do look,
and do keep close under this hand of
power; this Cherub-Birth will appear,
and then let not such fear, that their old
terrestrial Birth shall their more superior
and heavenly Image outwear. The wise
in heart are given to understand these
things, who are diligent to enquire,
when this Birth will be perfected.</p>

to me, as upon a Mountain, a

to it was so high, as it seemed impossible

not the Wings of a Dove. Neither could

After the representation hereof was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Upon which complaint the springing
word thus said, how is it? that thy soul
is hereat disquieted, that thou canst not
possess so immediately, what is made
known to thee in Vision and Prophecy?
The ground hereof is known to Wisdom,
who also will satisfie thee, why this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet be attainable.</p>
               <p>First consider thy present Existency,
that it is in a very low degree, inferior
to the Angelical Sphear, nay hardly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29870:115"/>
meet for what might be enjoyed in the
Paradisical Orb. That pure leavening
Unction hath not gone through Body,
Soul, and Spirit, so as to change through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
into its own Nature, which hath
hindred you: For nothing of corporeal
matter could ever thither up ascend,
though the Will and Spirit put forth
with great earnestness out thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
But then again, be it given ye to
understand, that this presentation doth
signifie the reviving the remembrance
of what hath been prophesied in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Ages. For Similitudes will go
before to usher in the real thing. The
Preludiums of which have so long slept,
that some fresh warnings hereof will be
given to them, that wait for and believe
in their day, to see the Kingdom of God
in its height of glory. As this City is a
true figure hereof, which seems yet to be
at a great distance from this low World,
as to its mighty height. Which is a
Confirmation to that old Prophecy, the
Mountain of the Lords house is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above all mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntains, and thereto will
be the flowing of Dove Spirits, as to
their own habitation. From hence, a
sweet and fresh Manifestation, by way of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:29870:116"/>
a renewed Prophecy, did open from those
words, That it shall come to pass in the last
days, and which thus spake: That the Lot
of this fulfilling Prophecy might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by some in this Age. For which end,
this Transient Vision of the City was
shewed, for to quicken and revive the
hopes of those, who were Mourners to
see themselves remote herefrom; because
of the wonderful distance, and height
in the situation thereof: which caused
such anxiousness through their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
to reach up thither; as not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any possibility to come to God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Palace, where only was our hoped for
freedom.</p>
               <p>But while I was in this demur and fear,
a swift Messenger from this high and
lofty Place did reach out his hand to me;
and suddainly this House, which was so
far off, was now to me as nigh. For I
did see it pass by me, as in a clear
Glass-case, as if it had run upon a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
Wheel, so swift that I could only
spy through the Glass, a light transparent
Glory: Which left me in no little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
because not taken in hereinto. But
that word was spoken presently for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
Thou canst not follow now, but
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29870:116"/>
shalt afterwards. Then did the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
commune of these things further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, revealing the mystery of this City,
as to its consistency. Its Building is of
a threefold quality, as to the making
out of its glorious Variety. The first
foundation-matter was all Saphire-like,
of such virtue and clarity, as it extracts
the Jasperstone, and so consequently the
the ghostly Ruby, of which three this
City is compacted. And is exalted
above all degrees of created beings, that
none can come to dwell here within this
deified place; till a high Chymical, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
do proceed from each stone in this
Building, for a separated operation. For
these stones will attract only out of the
Soul and Spirit, what is their own;
Therefore expect no less then three ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing
fires to pass upon you, before
ye can be Inhabitants in this transparent
City of Glass. The Saphire, which is
the Fathers fiery Property operates in the
Spirit of Salts searching quality, to find
out all corruptibility. Then secondly
Christ the Jasper-light sends out his
warm fire Blood-stone, both to purge,
cleanse, and heal. Then the third dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Power will let out, such a flood of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:29870:117"/>
Oyl, of his own high persumed Nature,
mingling all through the foregoing Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
fires in a blessed light flame, as will
burn away the first gross Elemental Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which hath prevented the Spirits
ascent into this Mountain of the Lord's
House. But however, draw you near to
the foot of this City-mountain, which
while ye fit therein waiting, this very
Mountain may melt, and before you
bow. And this City, which is called
everlasting Righteousness, and Strength,
will through its pure constellative vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
exhale and draw you up into it self.
Where ye then ever will be with the
Deity in Berill flaming Bodies and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
according to the ghostly Purity of
might, as those who are ready for this
spiritual and suddain flight.</p>

               <head>April the 26th. 1677.</head>
               <p>As I was considering of the openings
which I had, of that Vision relating unto
the Cherubim-birth, which was hatched
under the Hand of the Power: This
Query arose in me, how the Spirit of
this New Creature was sustained? And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29870:117"/>
which way it could draw in that food,
that constituted it to be of that strength
and excellency of Body, and Spirit, that
it could mount away, as a Dove into an
unknown Orb? Ah, my Lord, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Birth is this? Shall such a Birth
ever be known to have existency in this
terrestial sphere? Sure such a Birth is
only meet to be Born, where is a pure
and unmixed Element, which may not
be in strife against it. For verily it is
hard and very difficult for such a Birth
to be nursed and brought up to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where all things work cross, rising
up against it. Because it is a strange
Child that beareth not this worlds
Image; as for example in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
his Birth being extraordinary, and
marvelous, so soon as it was but noised
abroad, Councel was taken for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him: nay he had much ado to live
out his determined time; but as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
himself by his inward virtual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
upon every storm and assault. The
world that lieth in the evil of darkness,
could not bear such a Light to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, whose life was that which
did reprove them; Therefore it is no
needless question to ask of the most high
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:29870:118"/>
Wisdom, how in this Age such a Birth
may be succoured and sustained, till it
hath got a body of might and fortitude,
which no weapon can destroy or hurt.
The resolve must be fetched up from the
deepest of all centers, as it is a matter of
the most primary consequence to them,
who have such a Birth in such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Principle for to bring up; a Birth
which is from the power of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing
hand. Hence then for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to this Query, saith the all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit, be it given you to understand,
That every Birth of what kind soever,
brings along with it, through the wise
Provision in Nature its own nutriment.
That which is of corruptible seed, hath
what answers to it, of its own perishing
Quality. What feeds on flesh, either
as to its fleshly mind or body shall suffer
loss to purpose; though all the care be
to prop and nourish it to make it a well
favoured piece of mortality. Which to
the most holy is a strange Similitude,
which he hath no delight to see, or
know his own any longer in. Therefore he
inciteth and calleth to look after another
Birth, that may be all of Quintessential
matter, of the very Nature of the Deity,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29870:118"/>
such a pure thing may have corporal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
a while, for its visible case. As
your Immanuel had assumed, as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sackloath; in which he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himself for the sins of the world,
and for that end sacrificed it: Who,
though he took it up again, it was for
the manifestation of greater wonders by
it, through various changes, which it was
made the subject of. For in that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he was known, and then again in
such a figure unknowable to them, who
were daily conversant with him. Who
after that the pleasure and design of the
Father was in that body finished, then
the power of the inward spiritual body
was manifested to anatomise the visible
humanity, for that was not to pass into
the Heavens. From all which learn we
to discern, where the Christ like birth
with his spiritual body is, though cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a corporeal figure. And that ye
may not be mistaken, take these special
signs, to know where it is truly fixed
or impressed.</p>
               <p>First then know, this overshadowing
hand, through which this birth doth
spring, incompasseth only, what is Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disical
ground: there it drops in, its golden
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29870:119"/>
seed. This ground in its true native
Virgin pureness, must be separated from
the common cursed matter, of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the earthly birth. These two
different soyles are to be found in the
first <hi>Adam</hi>'s generative off-spring, but it
is so mingled and overrun with the dark
muddy element, that great care, labour
and painful industry is used for its reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
out, by the wise and learned Spirit
in the heavenly Chymistry, rightly to
prepare for this holy Birth. Which will
be easily known from the course and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimental,
that is in the image of the
earthly.</p>
               <p>For first, here is a pure conception, as
from the high and pure radical infusive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that quickens the Virgin soil, and so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operates
it into a spiritual Body, that it
may be all of one, and the same pure,
clear, undefiled, subtile matter with the
quickning Spirit: that you may know,
what that is, which contributes to the
Christ-like Births, wherewith it will be one
and the same, that it may degenerate
in nothing, from the first perfection and
pattern of his Life. But only this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
man may be excused, from that
personal suffering in the tragical part, as
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29870:119"/>
an outward death. Which will not be
required upon the same account, having
finished the mystery of the mystical
death, through this Birth taking place,
and bearing dominion over the outward.
But now to resolve that Question, What
this Birth that is from above, which is
coagulated into one unmixed matter
must live upon in the house of humanity.
Which for a time it must be brought up
in, as Christ himself was, and tempted
with the evil fruits, that will be daily
proffered from the market of this world,
but yet in no danger, though in minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For it is left under the guardian
Spirit, who warns it what to abstain
from; whose nature and composition is
of such heavenly essentiality, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
naturally to obey the Paradisical
laws. Which is the second character of
this New Creature.</p>
               <p>Then again in the <hi>third</hi> place, while
but in its Infancy, it will suck of no other,
but its Eternal Virgin Mother; lay it to
any other, and it will be sick to Death.
And if at any time contrary Food is
forced upon it, it doth presently Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it up. Then when grown to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
degree of strength, not only
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:29870:120"/>
the pure Milk of Wisdom, its Mother,
those living Precepts of her Word, but
the very Body of the Deity, which is
the spiritual Flesh Christ spoke of, and
the Blood the Milk of the Word. But
when come to that Age, as to be able to
take and feed upon that Body, that is
extracted out of the very Being of all
Eternal Spirits, of what kind must this
be brought forth? but even such a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Body, as Christ told them, could
never taste of Death. For as he did
live by the Father, by feeding upon the
very power of the God-head. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that Birth, which was of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
should live eternally, by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self upon his divine Flesh. Your
Fathers, saith he, did eat Manna, and
are dead, but I the Bread of Life will
sustain you, and thereby immortalize
you, if ye henceforth do feed upon no
other, but me the Tree of Life. It was
further revealed to me, That the Mould
and Paradisical Matter was found in us,
and brought out of all dispersions into
one holy lump, formed and quickned
by that pure azure stream or breath,
which did present it self by way of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this in process of time might
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:29870:120"/>
come to be no less than God manifested
in our fleshly forms of Corporeities;
therefore let us be careful and watchful
over it, and to hide it under the shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
hand of the everlasting power;
forasmuch as it is enclosed with a
terrestrial form, as its house, where the
light of the Sun, Moon and Stars of this
Visible Region did break in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
would assume a government over it:
which might bind, and keep it under,
as upon the outward elementary Spirit.
This was my fear and jeoperdy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, the everlasting Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did satisfie me, declaring, This was
a free birth, not subject in any respect to
the rudiments of this world, because,
that nothing of these essences did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
mix. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> depravity in the Nature
of sin was here infused. Therefore this
Birth may stand upon its royal freedom;
for to be born free from sin is a great
and mighty thing. Therefore know
your New Birth-prerogative, and come
not under the power of what this holy
inspiring breath is come to set at liberty
from. For the true Heir is a Son of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
in bondage to nothing, when
once he comes to know himself, he will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29870:121"/>
then assume that Sovereignty, which
shall make the corporeal life bow unto
him. Nay, as this encreaseth, and grows
up to its princely greatness, this Land
will be too strait. For out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
God will call this his Heir, through all
terrestial Walls and Gates, to come up
unto that free City, where the Trinity
in Majesty will give out their sealed
Commissions, for what this Birth of
might and excellency hath further for
them to do in this low Region. For
that which hath been, as the high build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wall of Perdition, betwixt these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and the Mountain upon which
the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> stands, by such strong
Angels as these, you shall see broken
down without tool or weapon; and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
made, which the Eagle Eye of this
Birth will spy, and will be so skilfull,
as to know its way through the cloudy
Air, to mount <hi>Sion</hi> Hill, the mystery of
God in both Principles to fulfill.</p>

               <p>In the Morning after the Doctor had

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which was said in me, was that Spirit
and Breath of Life, that must put the
grosser Element to flight. Then it was
further opened to me, that from this
perfect thing, would go forth an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
Mist, that should renew the face
of all things, in such whose inward
ground was measured out by the Golden
Reed of the Spirit. Then was further
shewed me, the twofold nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of this Breath: That as it could
quicken and be a seed of Life in matter
meetly prepared for it: So likewise this
Breath would extinguish that Life, which
worketh in contrariety against it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is written, <hi>Oh Death, I will
be thy Death.</hi> When all conclusions be
tried for the expiation of the earthly
birth, there is no other, that can so
eternally anatomize it, as the Body of
Sin may be said to cease, and not to be,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29870:122"/>
but by the Spirit of the Lord, blowing
upon the fleshly form of it, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be so goodly. Verily this Life
hath been too hard for all other weapons,
that have been tried upon it, since the
full outward death could not conquer
this Life of Sin. As Christ told the <hi>Iews,</hi>
if they did not believe on him, as the
resurrection of another Life, they should
die in their sins. So as the mortal death
cannot quit from that second death which
follows that corrupt Birth-seed, which
was not in this Life demolished. But
then from hence, this doubt will arise,
<hi>Who is it, that hath left this Testimony
behind them, of all past Generations, that
before the mortal death did overtake
them; they had first cleared themselves of
that vile and corruptible birth of sin?</hi>
Sure saith the objective Spirit, if this be
strictly examined, how few, or scarce
any will be found, but did mortally die,
before the inward body of sin was totally
expired. If so, how then could they
immediately pass, where nothing, that
ever was of the polluted Nature of Sin,
could come in. As to this obscure and
deep Query, of which I my self with
others, have been universally ignorant,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29870:122"/>
as not finding out the several reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
that Spirits did pass into: The
letter of the Scripture not opening so
positively, what relateth hereunto, as
plainly to determine this doubtful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
But it hath been kept dark, in the
foresight of the most holy wise God.
Who hath left himself free, to give the
key of the knowledge hereof in what
Age, and to such in that Age, as shall
be worthy of such secret. My Spirit
hath been often solicitous with the Lord
for this thing, as in case my Body might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
break from my superior Spirit, and the
Mortal part die before the evil essences,
which are called Sinn be extinguished, as
to their very originality, then into what
Orb shall such a Spirit enter? that may
be almost but yet not quite got free from
every relick of sin. The Key of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Door was hereupon put into the
hand of my Guardian Spirit, the mystery
hereof to unlock, that this great secret
might be revealed, and that hereby the
Elect might be undeceived. Who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less believed, but that though they
should not come to see, and feel sin fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
through <hi>everlasting Righteousness</hi>
coming in, as a Conqueror: Yet whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:29870:123"/>
got loose from this temporary life, they
should strait ascend into that principal
City of the great King. Which was
once my belief, according to that tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
manuduction that I was under. But
since of meer great and unparalled Love,
another deep is discovered, from out of
which a sure and pure word of Reveala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath sprung both as to this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Obscure things. And that the
opening of this Truth might not go forth
only in the authority of a private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
when indeed there is need
enough, for all Spirits to be tried, that
do take this Covering. For this cause
a Scripture foundation was given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and ratifie, what was so freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
into the mind. As first that word
was given to me, to consider of, as in
the 14th of <hi>Iohn</hi> 2d verse, <hi>In my Fathers
house are many Mansions; if it were not
so, I would have told you, I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a place for you, and when I have done
that, I will come and receive you to my
self.</hi> From which words, it was given
me thus to understand, that by House
the Spirit doth signifie the Locality of
God's invisible Kingdom, that hath va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Regions, for dwelling places, as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29870:123"/>
it is said, there are <hi>many Mansions,</hi> in
which are degrees of Glory. <hi>Solomon</hi>
in the mirror of Wisdom had an account
thereof, when he had built that Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
House and Temple for the Most
High. Which made him as in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Extasy cry out, <hi>The Heavens of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
cannot contain thee.</hi> So it is said
of our Lord Jesus, that he ascended up <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ALL Heavens.</hi> By all which we
may conclude, that there are degrees of
Heavens, and yet all within the Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sphere. For <hi>Adam,</hi> before he had
awakened the sinful essence, was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
in one of the Heavens, which
had the Title of <hi>A Paradise,</hi> because of
its serene and fruitful soyl. But yet
God's local Habitation was not here, but
he sent forth his influencing mist; and
here did with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> frequently
commune, while they were undefiled:
but they being once found, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of this purity, this Heaven
could not bear their corruptible Image,
for the worm of mortality could not
here live. Upon which God said, Let
them out of those Mansions, that are
near to me: let them be driven out for
the present. Therefore let this suffice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29870:124"/>
from the Scriptures themselves: not to
mention those particular Idea's and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations,
that to some it hath been
given to see these several Heavens;
which upon others cannot be imposed
for to believe, who yet have not those
anointed Eyes given to see withal. But
surely there are some standing in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Body, Whose Spirits have
roved to and fro, to see these several
Mansions, with Spirits of all sizes and
degress, who are herefor designed; Only
hereout excluding those, who are for
the Dragon's Kingdom. Who do pass
away in a reprobate sense out of the
Body. Those left-hand Goats have no
portion within these Eternal Gates: a
deep Gulf is fixed. It is only of the
Sheep and Lambs that I am to treat,
who have found out this new, and only
Life path-way. Who though they are
not come to the top-stone of perfection,
before they see the dissolution of the
body; Yet having attained to a
good degree, they may come unto the
very next Throne Region: and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
stay, till they have drawn, and
assumed a heavenly clarity, that is such
an Essential Body, against which no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29870:124"/>
by the highest Courts of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
can be objected. These now are
the highest degrees of those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Perfection be wrought, do cease out
of the Mortal Body. Then again there
are of a lower degree of growth; <hi>Now
what reservatory is there for them, who
may be but young in the New Birth?</hi>
As to this, it was clearly imparted unto
my Intellect, that such did enter into a
more inferiour Mansion than Paradice,
for that was too pure and serene for
such. Therefore a lower degree is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, till they do attain to an
Increase of the Divine Nature. They
want not here their true Pastoral Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
for the Spirit of Christ is every
where with his own. Therefore it was
said, that he went and preached to the
Spirits in Prison, that were disobedient
in <hi>Noah</hi>'s days. For should all the old
world have been cut off at once, and
sealed under a final condemnation, the
Attributes of God's Love, Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Truth, and Long-suffering would
have been obliterated: wherefore he must
have yet had respect unto such <hi>after</hi> the
dissolution of their bodies; as had a
sense in them awakened, for compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29870:125"/>
and sorrow for what Evils they had
committed <hi>in</hi> their Bodies. To confirm
this, that we might not be altogether out
of hope for such as may die in the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Regeneration it is given me
to declare that if these pass out of the
Body, such cannot go indeed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to God. For such will find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
they must wait till they have got
somewhat more, then what they went
out withall in this world; and then
shall they be admitted to see God. Surely
there is a Provision made, for a perfect
Salvation in another Principle, besides
this. For which we have that word in
<hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 3. 19. by which also he went
and Preached unto the Spirits in Prison.</hi>
Also these words seem to speak fully to
this 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 6. For this cause was the
Gospel preached to them which were dead:</hi>
which generally is applied to such as are
living, and yet dead in sins. But by the
foregoing verse, it concerns the first Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>verse</hi> 5. who saith, the Apostle
speaking of Christ, is ready <hi>to judge
the quick and the dead;</hi> so that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,
there is a Ministry belonging to
the <hi>dead,</hi> that are not here made perfect.
Much more might be enlarged upon some
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29870:125"/>
particular sights and manifestations, that
have hereof been given to some in the
Spirit. From hence ariseth this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>If this be a Truth, why was it not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
declared, and clearly revealed, as
a foundational Doctrine?</hi> To which it
may be answered, That the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
did judge it meet to conceal this
mystery, because none might take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to turn the Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness:
and thereby to neglect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
opportunity, for working out their
own Salvation in this present time; which
would make for a far and more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weight of Glory. Therefore left it
was for the Worthy to have this Secret
made known to them by the Spirit of
Revelation, who God foreknew would
not take Liberty to continue in sin; that
this Grace after Death might be made
manifest towards such, as did stand in
need hereof. But now to great, holy,
and aspiring Spirits, these lower Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their Fathers house are too mean:
who cannot be satisfied, to be so many
degrees remote any time after death,
from their God, and Lord Jesus, since
Liberty is proclaimed to work through
all, while we are in this terrestrial Body.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29870:126"/>
For there will be more joy and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
in Heaven, for one such as shall
finish their work here, so as to make a full
conquest, then for milions of Souls, that
in the invisible Regions must perfect
what was lacking to compleat them here.
Oh said the Spirit, it will be well worth
your Labour and great Travel, to break
open this deep Gate, and so to put on Christ
your Lord, as in his all-powerful body,
that ye may make hereof, but one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
flight. This was the Mark,
that was after Christs ascending so eagerly
aimed at, and by some in that Age reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to. For Christ could not lose the
effect of his prayer, in that he did make
his request, that those whom the Father
had given him, might be with him where
he was, that so they might see, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the same glory, which could not be,
till they had gotten the victory. For to
none else is the admission given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Kingdom, according to that in the
Revelations, <hi>to him that overcometh,</hi> will
I grant, saith Jesus, <hi>to sit with me in my
Throne.</hi> But this may be objected fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Those, who had the Holy Ghost
poured down in such an eminent manner,
had their way made very easie, who was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29870:126"/>
as their fiery Chariot, that cut their
work short. And if any now in this
Age, had such a high endued Power,
it might soon give them a translation out
of all mortal impediments. As to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
this: The Holy Ghost in that day
was given, after a visible manner, as a
sealing Character, displaying, and acting
forth himself in Gifts, and Power, and
miracles: but now the same Spirit works
in its beginning after another manner;
where it falleth, it doth all its mighty
works Within, before it will shew forth
his power Without. For if the Apostles
had not been purified by the Holy Ghost,
and inwardly sprinkled with the Water
of Life for Soul cleansing, they could
not have rejoyced in that assured hope
of entring into the joy of their Lord
and Master. Then was it plainly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me by the Spirit, that the Holy
Ghost would not now in this latter Age
act out his Mighty Deeds by any one,
till their Hearts were perfectly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith. That Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repeated to me: <hi>who after
believing, were s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aled with Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Promise.</hi> Though in that day,
soon upon Christs ascending, the Spirit
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29870:127"/>
of working power was suddainly show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
down upon some, as in the Acts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made, who had no foregoing work
of sanctification upon them. Upon which
it made the Apostles themselves astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Holy Ghost should be sent
down upon the Gentiles also, who did
not believe in the Lord Jesus. But that is
now ceased. The giving forth of the
Holy Ghost in this day, will first produce
inward effects, and be a Spirit of <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
seasoning the Vessels within, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
it with the pure fire of Love and
Joy. And then being all divinely lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened,
there will be found all sufficiency
to do the most wonderful things; easily
flowing forth from the substantial body:
which by degrees may work it self fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
through the humane form, in great
splendor and glory. So from hence we
are taught, how the Holy Ghost hath his
first inspiring work upon us: To make
all clean, pure and perfect within our
Minds and Wills. For we shall be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
what he doth first in, and for us,
before he will shew forth by us the Seal
of his great Power to what lies without
us: Who by signal Working Powers,
and Gifts are to be convinced and brought
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29870:127"/>
over to the Faith, which will work by that
Love, that will be shed abroad by
the Holy Ghost. Whose first enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and stirrings, ye are, saith the
Holy and True, to cherish and wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
till ye are leavened throughout
with Righteousness, Light, Love and
Joy: Which will make way, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Wisdoms Power, and God's
all sufficiency in a more marvelous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then ever. Blessed highly are they,
whose lot it shall be to come up to the
Mount of God's Habitation, through all
these degrees. This word take along
with you; for certainty, that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
for the close, wise, persevering,
diligent Spirits to see this great and
mighty salvation in the Lord Christ's
Kingdom, in and through the ghostly
power working mightily.</p>

               <head>April the 28th. 1677.</head>
               <p>This Morning awaking about three
of the Clock, my Spirit after some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ejaculations, was inkindled through
the Love-melting Powers of the Spirit of
my Lord Jesus: which did pass as a
burning Lamp through all my Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
finding there matter to feed upon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to its own light property,
whereby refreshing was found. After
this I slept till five a Clock, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, as by me surmised. Then
I was awakened with the beholding
one in the figure of a man, in a blue
clear firmament, enclosed as in an oval
frame, Rainbow-like: his Countenance
was grave and majestical, facing me with
great majesty. Upon the sight of whom,
I did feel within me a mighty rapture of
joy. So I making to get nearer to this
Person, thus plainly portraied, then he
did further withdraw; for such was the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervour of my Spirit, that I would have
proceeded into the very Circle, where
he was. Who seemed to be in the very
fashion of a man from the Loyns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29870:128"/>
but I saw no Legs or Feet; but
he fixed his Light Countenance still on
me, which was no way terrible, but all
reviving. Now I was expecting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to be spoken from him, but the
voice was uttered within me, saying
thus, This is the Sign of your Lord from
Heaven, that Jesus whom you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to see. Upon which words, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
again to break through to him,
upon which this Representation did pass
away, that I could no longer gratifie my
spiritual Eye, with this blessed Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
After whose departure I was left
sad, for I would willingly have left my
corporeal form to have entred into that
Oval Cloud, where I might have joined
the Hand of my Spirit with his. But
then it was again further revealed to me,
that if this sight was so pleasing and
grateful, what would the coming in of
the Fathers glory be, which would be
much more, then what I now did see.
Then this word spake in me, go on to
believe, and ye, who look for me, shall
yet further see greater things then all
this.</p>
               <p>Some days after this Vision, it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifested to me, that this visible
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:29870:129"/>
Figure of my Lord Jesus did signifie the
formation of himself in our corporeity,
which would be much more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
then in beholding him in a distinct
Personality as without us, till we can
come to say, as he is, so are we. Till
which there can be no fixed view, for a
constant retaining of his now glorified.
Person in our Eye. Now it was given
me to understand, that the Reason I
could not be admitted, to enter into
that Oval Light where he was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
was because, said the Spirit, thou
art not come to the same perfect state
and degree in which you did him see;
wanting yet, your more high, clear and
elementary Body; so that ye could not
possibly make your pass unto him. But
only hereby, your Jesus knoweth, that
these transient sights would have a pure
magical power upon you, for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the same likeness within you,
that was shewn outward. For it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to me, that all representations
that did not work to this effect, would
be little available, as to the fruition of
the blessed Object it self. Then I was
cautioned to be heedful in this respect,
and to watch how to receive all power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29870:129"/>
impressions hereby: all which was for
the bringing on the heavenly Birth, to
every degree of perfection. Then no
strange nor unusual thing, it shall be to
see the very express glory of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
when you are Christed, and all clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
upon with him. Then shall ye see
That in your selves, which to others is
invisible. <hi>Philip</hi> could not see the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Christ: while he was looking out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
for some wonderful appearance
of God in visible Glory, he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how uncapable he was of that
sight; but Jesus invites him to see, and
know the Father in the pure simplified
humanity. God will to all first mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself here, in that which can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the Christ-like Life: which is the
only light and medium, in which we can
see God. Christ would have directed
<hi>Philip</hi> to have looked for this Vision
of God in himself, but he knew he was
not clarified in his Mind and Spirit for
that species: his Eys were not anointed,
the Holy Ghost not being yet given to
him. Therefore Christ directed him to
turn his Eye inward, to see the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Divine Power and Presence
of the Father in and by Christ. Who
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29870:130"/>
gave him this rebuke: Have I been so
long with you, and yet have you not
seen the Power of the Deity acted forth
in me? The Disciples were but of dull
sight, and flow of belief; so that it was
not the conversation of Christ, although
all holy, perfect and good, in his Visible
Figure. That did give the transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till he did convey his Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into them, they could not rightly
know him, nor yet the Father in him.
Then the Spirit ecchoed this through
me, O haste, and seek to be baptized
by the Holy Ghost, that ye may both
know, and be perfect in the Father and
in the Son; then may you see God in
Christ apparently. God in God, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in an immaculate Nature, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the essence of a Spirit out of
Nature. From hence learn to see your
selves all fully in Christ, as anointed by
the Holy Spirit into him, and then you
will not make complaint, for want of
the visibility of his glorified Person.
When ye shall see your selves in him,
and know him in your selves, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Image of the invisible God. Then
you cannot but walk in the constant
sight of that, which is all beautiful,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29870:130"/>
comely, sweet, and ravishing. For then
ye will never care to turn your Eyes,
nor set your Foot out of this pleasant
Habitation, when the Holy Ghost shall
be ever in you, the Tabernacle of God.</p>

               <p>THIS Morning it was much impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon me, that though all
Watchfulness and pure Conversation are
the product of a Spiritual Birth; yet
there must be something, besides willed by
him, who is said, to have received gifts
to dispose of, as a purchased possession
for us. He is ascended to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
head, where all diversity of Gifts
are commandable: that may be of great
profit and use to his Mystical Body;
which thereby may come to the perfect
Unity. For it was given me to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that our Lord Jesus, though born
into the humanity all immaculate, yet
was afterward signally anointed with
the Holy Ghost, before he went upon
his Ministerial Function, which gave him
power to effect those great things in the
World. So that though he was born of
the Holy Ghost, yet there was a further
Sealing Power contributed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For when the Jews were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29870:131"/>
that he made himself equal with
God, he confirmeth it by this evidence,
that the Father had shewed him all
things, that himself could do: from which
sight as a peculiar Gift, he did work hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
such works as did bear witness
of the Supream Power of the God-head.
While my Intellectual Mind was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon this Subject, and withdrawing
from my outward animal sense, I did see
in a paper figured out the forms of two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Persons folding up a Vail, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
which had been spread upon a
Writing, that was given me to read.
Which was plain and legible, but I could
not understand the Language; it was
said to be Seraphick. This Writing
which was so fair was turned into a Blank,
and then again appeared as in a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
which I was very solicitous to
have read. But it was revealed to me
immediately, that this was a high and
peculiar gift, that did belong only to that,
which was born out of the Lilly root.
Which mast be brought up, where it must
hear this Language spoken frequently;
till which no knowledge there is in the
Divine Magia. For Spirits who had
these deep wonders to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w, could not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29870:132"/>
make any intelligent hereof, till they
had learned this Seraphick Language both
to hear and speak withall, and so I was
left in the demur hereof. Only this
Writing I saw taken by the hand of a
Person, to whom I said, give it me, for
it belongeth not to you, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gave to the view of another<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that
was present: but neither of them could
find out the Language of the Writing.
By which my Spirit did conclude, that
we must proceed to a further learning,
for to know what is in the heights and
depths, wherein all lawful and allowable
secrets are couched, to be understood.
Had not <hi>Moses</hi> been taken up to God
forty days, and in that holy separated
Mount, been all new organised, he could
never have understood God's speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; so as to comprehend, and know
how to make an interpretation, and how
to bring it down unto the people; by
translating it out of the Seraphick
tongue, into the formal speech of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
organical Creatures. So from
hence it was given me further to see,
that there was a New Ministration,
which I had not looked into, that was
of great expediency.</p>

of this Vision, and making my applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for our enrichment, with this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
gift, it appearing to be of great
use and consequence: I presently found
my self environed with a body of Light,
with a noise as of rushing waters, which
were called the Seraphick sounds, for I
felt a mighty sweet influence from them.
Finding my Spirit sinking deeper into this
heavenly center; whereout did arise
gusts of Air and Flames of Celestial Fire,
with springs of Water, as a fountain of
Joy, and dust of Gold all sparkling,
and herewith mingling; and this was a
wonderful presentation. All which I
did as sensibly feel to strengthen, to
quicken, and enliven the inward; as I
often naturally felt the influences of the
outward Elements upon the outward
Body, to cause Dulness, Pain, Grief,
and Sorrow. And further, there was a
Voice, that did distinctly eccho in me,
that all these influencing Powers from
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29870:133"/>
the heavenly Body, did come down to
enrich, and make fat the Soil and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Ground, in which the unction
Birth was rooted. For this Pure and
Aetherial Body (which hath commixed
it self into such a high Essentiality) is
designed to feed, revive, strengthen,
and rejoyce, what is of its own Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Body. Therefore it is meet for
such, in whom this New Birth is raised,
that they do often bring and lay it where
the warm beamings of our Sun may
overshadow it: that is, that the quint-essential
power of all things may send
forth its strong spiritual influences upon
it; so hereby it may grow mighty and
and strong to relieve the depressed Life
from the grosser Element, which hath
enkindled, whatever is of torment, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

which I omitted before to mention: Who
were figured out to be Angelical Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
sent to draw away, and to wind

the Writing; By this it was signified,
that there was one remove made, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the understanding, and knowing,
what was further therefrom to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.
For already there was much of the
Vail removed, which hid the meaning of
the Spirit in that visible Writing: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
also to the Scriptures, but was now
upon the removing, that so the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Spirit might come to be

me, why I could not read, when the
Vail was removed, seeing I had sound that
favour as to have that covert taken off,
that had darkned, and hid the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mystery from the understanding?
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29870:134"/>
Why might it not be given me to know

it contained that, whereof the Scripture
had made no mention, and therefore it
was presented to me in an unknown
tongue and language, which should be

carrieth that Lamp, which never goeth
out. All of her Births will have the

them; so that whatever may come forth
in Proverbs or Dark-sayings, the Spirit
of Wisdom and Revelation is at hand to
interpret. None of her Off-spring shall
be brought up illiterate, but shall be
taught in their own Mother-tongue,
who shall come to be a People of a Pure

Upon this Birth then will be hung all

upon the concluding part thereof, I saw
in Vision, a Covering passing before me,
the ground was scarlet all set or wrought
with studs of sparkling Gold, with this
word going along with it: Of such like
as this will be the Furniture of that place,
where the Most Holy will dwell. Then
in Prayer I had a suddain aspect of a
Countenance, who looked all pleasant;
and this word came with it, and said,
<hi>Iesus look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>npon them, and said, Ye are
not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi>

               <p>This Morning a shivering, influencing
Power, and Presence was witnessed about
my heart. After which this salutation
I had, in the known speech of that,
which did so gird about the Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Mind, uttering these words: wilt thou
make a full dispose of thy Spirit, Soul,
and Body unto thy Lord, who is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to assume all to himself, that he
might make it his proper Workhouse?
But consider well, and be not rash in this
thing: for if thou dost contract to make
all over unto me, thy true Immanuel,
then nothing is henceforth hereof, to
be parcelled out from him, who is come
to be a Purchaser for the whole; that
none may come in for any part besides
me. For I have a sufficiency of stock to
set all awork. In this your Jesus will
be properly all, who well knows upon
what account, he demands to have all
turned over to him, to act, work, and
do wholy after the pleasure of his own
Spirit. For while the exteriour Will,
and the rational Mind with all their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29870:136"/>
train of senses, do but in part bare rule,
and here up and down float; (though
giving their Vote according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and sober part of things,) all those
must give place to another Birth, that
will excel all this Righteousness. Now
you that are come to that degree of
knowledge, as to discern the right-hand
Gate from the left: Who have been
sometimes under the Discipline of the
Spirit, as also sometimes under the Gifts
aud Powers from the Celestial Orb: to
you then, who have thus tasted the Lord
is gracious, can ye give up all proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in your selves, to be in very deed no
longer your own; Being come to that
grown Age, as to make a true sale of
your selves to such a Purchaser, as is
come to buy without Mony, or Price,
or any thing of this Worlds Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise?
You are now known to him, and
he to you, who now proffers to give his
own Life for yours. Oh who would not
strike up such a bargain, as this is, that
so henceforth for you to live, it may be
Christ. Who will at another rate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
your very corporeal state, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
much better advantages, then ye have
done, while ye live under this Starry
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29870:136"/>
Regions influences, which is the light and
might of the Man of Sense and Reason,
whose Sun must so go down, as never

            <div type="vision">
               <head>May the 9th. 1677.</head>
               <p>This day my Spirit was cast into a
very serious and deep debate about that
Proposal, which was the other morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so audibly made by the Spirit of
our Lord Jesus unto us. Whose Faces
hereunto were set, and our Minds here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
inclined. I had another onset, by
the Friend of him, who most willing is
to become our Bridegroom. Who still
urged this thing mightily, concerning
the actual passing away of our selves, so
as to be entirely the Lords, moving it
again in this word: Who, who can
come as a very Christ to be, who stands
in humane property, but those who have
bequeathed themselves away, as to move
from another Life, in which they may
in winged Power go forth. I found my
Spirit as in <hi>Peter</hi>'s frame, when our Lord
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29870:137"/>
repeated the question so often, and so
suspiciously concerning his loving of
him: Even so verily, I found my Heart
troubled, and my Spirit grieved, that
my Lord did by his Spirit press this
thing so hard upon me, as if my Love
and Will were hereunto doubted of by
this my Lord; from whom knowingly
I would reserve nothing, that could be
demanded from me. Whose Love-fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
hath been so strong, as to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my whole Spirit to him, who, I
do believe, will renew another more pure
and powerful Spirit in us. Then was
this by the Spirit further spoken in me,
True it is, that thou lovest the Lord
thy God with thy whole Soul, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is more then all Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
or Worship, though spiritually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted:
yet this is not enough; For
Love as it may work in an ardent Spirit,
by and through internal flowings to the
Object, may stop again: This many have
reached unto, and yet have doubted in
it again. Therefore God would have a
pledge left in his hand, something given
him as a fruit of Love, to wit, Life it
self must seal the Truth hereof, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along with it. Christ was put upon
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29870:137"/>
giving this proof to his Father, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in bare love, but by laying down of
his Life, for which saith he, I am belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of my Father: <hi>Iohn</hi> 10th. So as
God had this proof from him, so he
expects the same from you: who if you
love the Father and Him, then his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
will not be to you grievous.
Ye will then observe all the Antecedents
belonging to this Law of Love. Which
Love rightly born carrieth a mighty
force with it; it cannot deny, or keep
any thing back from that which it is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in: as hath been evidenced by those
great Saints, before Christ's Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and since. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
love God, when he forsook
his own People, and Land of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
to go where the Lord gave him a
word of Command to go: yet this was
not sufficient, but ye did see God would
prove him further, as in <hi>Isaac</hi>'s death.
Which when God saw, that he stopped
not in that, which touched the very
Life; nay then said the Lord, Because
thou hast done this thing, in blessing I
will bless thee, I am now sure thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
and fearest me, and therefore God
will be thy exceeding great reward;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29870:138"/>
which the Patriarck did fully witness in
his day. Numerous instances might be
added out of the Scriptures hereunto, as
also the late and private experiences of
holy Souls, that have been obedient to
that true Prophet and Seer, that daily
giveth, and maketh known the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of God. Under which seal opening,
ye are come. To which Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
give now an obedient Ear, saith
the Holy and True. Upon this I made
my application in great earnestness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Power and Life, that
stirred in me; being greatly distressed to
know, what was further to be given up,
and parted withal, that consisted in the
power of our own Wills; having gone
far in the self-abnegation, suppressing
and keeping under the earthly part, that
so sin could not reign, but be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condemnation: So as to this degree
some are come. As I was thus silently
in the Spirit of my Mind parling, this
word was uttered to me, All this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
but the very giving up of the
Life must be, that my Name may be
written in the very Blood thereof, and
be returned in a Life-quickning Spirit
again. Then will the property of that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29870:138"/>
which was dull, dark, and corrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all light, vigorous, pure, and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline,
as the Spirit of Christ was in
the Corporeal Figure. The same Mind,
which only respects things that are above
in the Fathers Kingdom of Glory is to
be in you, as it was in Jesus your Lord.
For this is the sum and head to which
all Prophecies and Revelations tend,
even the finishing of this Mystery, Christ
the Light, Wisdom, Power, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God: Which can be brought
to pass only by giving up, and laying
down our Life, as to all sensitive proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
which is the highest, and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
act of the Will-spirit to give its
Name up thus and to subscribe your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Soul, and Body in the Blood of that
Life, that must die, that so Christ may
be only alive in you. And albeit while
ye are laying down with great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that Life, which is so agreeable to
this terrestrial Life; because of contempt
and dishonour, that it suffers hereby:
As your Lord in his Crucifixion went
through so by your spiritual mystical gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up your Lives, though as to this
worlds eye in shame, rebuke, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
yet in Truth and Verity, it shall rise

in Strength, Victo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and Power in

the Gates of your Enemies. This is
most wonderfully deep, if it may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed
by the Spirit in you.</p>

            <div type="vision">
               <head>May the 11th. 1677.</head>
               <p>My Spirit entred into a deep sense,
upon some occasion that was administred,
how apt it was for such, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon them part of the Ministry to
ingross and confine it to Persons, and
Sexes: and to bring down the superior
Spirit and Light under the inferiour
Government of the low and mean Spirit,
that respecteth man, and savours that
Glory, which is after the Flesh. For
Christ told the Jews, they loved the
praise of men, more than that of God,
in that they sought honour from one
another, as the great and learned Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
who in their high learning, despised
an illiterate Christ, (as they called him.)
From whence I did observe that the
leaven of such a Spirit might be ready
to mingle with some in this present Age,
though partly illuminated in and through
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:29870:139"/>
the knowledge of the Mystery of God
in Christ: As I was pondering, I say,
and considering these things in my Mind,
and making request, that nothing of the
exterior might have wherein to glory;
but that God would appear in such, as
little, and nothing were in their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
and that all Flesh might be silent,
that Spirit might only go forth in its own
Power and Clearness: Upon this I had a
full gust come in upon me, with this
word speaking in me, There is a Gospel,
that nothing of man shall mingle with:
that shall only be intrusted with such
Child-like Spirits. For which nothing
of the Creatures Testimony will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for it will be the Breath of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
Power, of which none shall be
ashamed. Then was that Scripture the
next Morning spoken to me, <hi>Be not sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but followers of them, who through
Faith and Patience inherited the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
Which word was taken up by
the Spirit, and spoken audibly unto us,
upon the account of that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before in way of Prophecy, as to that
unmixed Ministration, that should arise
in some qualified for it. Of which much
was revealed in the discoursive way of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29870:140"/>
the Spirit: that there was now given to
all an open Door, that would look here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
from that in the <hi>Heb. 6. v.</hi> 11. where
<hi>Paul</hi> directs this word in general to the
whole Body, consisting of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>And we desire that every one of you
do shew the same diligence, to the full
assurance of hope to the end:</hi> Here is
none left out, but both Sexes implied.
Whose work and labour of Love in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
to their fellow Saints, according
as they had tasted, and received of the
heavenly Gift, God was <hi>not unrighteous
to forget.</hi> Therefore from hence he did
incite them to go forward, not excluding
the Female, but laying it as a weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both Male and Female, as all one in
the Spirit, to <hi>shew the same diligence,</hi> till
they could get through the vail: where
they might come to the lively Oracle;
leaving the lower Principles and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations,
as to the very knowledge of
Christ in his first appearance. Who hath
left the whole Creation still groaning,
and waiting to be delivered from the
present mixed and imperfect state. Such
I mean in this Creation as are here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
to a more high grown state,
as to be minding and waiting for that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29870:140"/>
blessed hope, and more wonderful and
glorious appearance of Christ, no more
to leave us in the weakness of sin and
corruptibleness. This hath had its long
day in the world, its Sun is upon set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
and then but one short interposing
Night will be, before the everlasting
Gospel-day shall break forth; whose
Breath is at once all redeeming power.
So it was further shewed me, that there
should not be another Christ revealed,
but the same that was, in a more high
and transparent manner. Who, as the
mighty God and Saviour, is to compleat
the work of Salvation through a more
perfect Ministry, that shall be committed
to elected Angels: that shall be sent
forth in such a Gospel-seal, as none shall
be able to counterfeit. For this word
as a secret, was given me to hear, That
the Gospel, that in these last Ages, since
Christ was preached to the Nations of
the World, was not of that force and
might, as to overthrow the Seal of the
Beast, and thereby to recover man out
of his deep relapse. For though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of this all-powerful Gospel did for
a little moment after Christ's ascention
break through with the Holy Ghost, as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29870:141"/>
some first fruits thereof, yet it soon
retired and shut up again. But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
said expresly, Be ye of good chear,
whom God doth greatly love: and
know this gloomy day is far spent;
there is but a short night, before the
everlasting Gospel shall break out.
Then be ye Watchers till this Morning
do dawn, put on your armour, and
be not as others, who slothful are, not
believing to such a Gospel-day. But
pray that ye may be intrusted with the
first openings of this Gospel-breath;
which will devour and lay waste the
Kingdom of the Dragon and the Beast;
that so in the Power and Splendor
of a glorified Christ, ye may come
to reign on and over the Earth. This
everlasting Gospel will soon gather in
its own heavenly Train: but in Hope,
Diligence, and Patience do ye remain
for it.</p>

as light as the Firmament, and there I
saw the figure of a Book; it had no

any thing therein written, that I could

as transparent as the flaming light. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this came forth out of that bright

posture, rejoycing about me
with pleasant bright Countenances, and
would have me repose my self in the
same alacrity with them; but I was more
sad and ponderous, and could not move
with that agility, which they did with
their Airy Bodies. But I soon did feel
a mighty influence from their Bodies;
though at their first appearance, I was
as one surprised: but such was their
great affability, and friendliness towards
me, that in a little while I was in their
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29870:142"/>
liberty, and joy. Which no sooner I
was made sensible of, but they told me
they must withdraw unto their own
place: I then desired they would not
leave me, but let me go along with
them, which they could not permit at
this season. This brought heaviness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me again.</p>

the Doctor in a place wide and spatious,
it seemed to have no limitation either
by Walls or Gates; and I being alone

people did come in upon us. So then
the Doctor said, this multitude will not
be dismist, till they receive somewhat of
that, which the Lord hath made us
Stewards of. Then did the Doctor
preach that, which was of great force
and power, so that they appeared to be
very attentive thereto. Upon which I

               <p>This Morning the Mystery of the
Glassy Book, which was revealed unto
me, by way of Vision in the 13th of this
Instant, was opened very conspicuously.
For as I was walking in the solitude of
my Spirit, this stirred again in my Mind,
being presented with this Scripture, <hi>We
all as with open face, beholding as in a
Glass the glory of the Lord are changed
into the same.</hi> From whence it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
unto me, That this Book did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Spirit of the Lord Jesus,
which was the mirror, by which we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could see the Father's Glory. And
further in that this Book was different
from all other Books, because there was
nothing therein written; which was more
marvelous, and gave me occasion to
query with my Lord about it: What
this Book was, which had no Seals upon
it, nor any engraving in it? Then was
it thus resolved me, That it was that
which would put an end to all other
Books: it was beyond all literal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
they would not be needed,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:29870:143"/>
when this Chrystal Glass was revealed.
This would be the sum and substance of
all Times finishing Mystery; according to
that in the Revelation mentioned, of the
Book which was open in the Angels
hand, which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw, when the seven
Thunders uttered their voices, and he was
ready to write; but till the dispensation
of the fulness of time, there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.
<hi>The Glass</hi> that compriseth all
Wisdom, Knowledge, and Sight of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
things, being given forth or held
out for such, who do really prize the
substance, which is the Living Word it
self; and that above all Shadows, Sounds
and Declarations. Christ is to arise to
them higher, from a sealed Book to an
open one, that is, from Letter to Spirit;
giving himself not only as a Book to
read, but to eat down. Ye shall tast this
Chrystal Book, and thereby come to be
in the express clarity of it, all clear in
Judgment and Knowledge. It will then
be connatural to prophecy and reveal,
whatever is seen in the Eternal Glass of
all Wonders. Oh, not to hear only, but
to live the Word of Truth: which is
all sweet to that part, which retaineth
the Divine and Pleasant Savour of God
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:29870:144"/>
in his Transparency: but it is bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in the Bowels or Heart of the Earth,
it cannot be well digested there; the
operations are so pure, that it will work
out the internall gross matter, that hath
the thick darkness over all brought; that
so all of one entire clarified piece might
be come in the Nature of that Glassy
Book. Which is an all-seeing Light,
from that one everlasting day to see uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
and infallibly? Then was it set
much upon me, to seek when and how,
and upon whom this finishing Mystery
might be witnessed. For it did seem to
me, that this would not be a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
till the <hi>end of Time;</hi> because the
Angel, who had the Book, compassing
both Sea and Land, protested <hi>Time
should be no longer,</hi> then till the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Angel, be ready to sound his
Trumpet: which is not yet in any part
of the Creation effected. Therefore this
unsealed Book will be given to none,
till the seven Seals of the Written Book
be first broken up. These are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that may be gathered from the
Holy Writ. Therefore this clear and
unsealed Book, as it alluded to that in
the Revelations, may not be reached
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:29870:144"/>
unto in our Age. So then to what end
was this Vision of the Book opened and
shewn, if not for particular Propriety;
that we might hope not only to see this
Chrystalline Book, but for to be the
Glass it self? Thus arguing upon, or
from my inferiour Light, I did sensibly
feel a more high and superiour Light in
that very instant of time overshadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, saying, Will ye of that sort also
be? Do ye see this Chrystalline Day so
far off, as to give up the last breath of
your hopes; as if God had set the bar
of his decree here against you so as not
to look for that Angel to stand upon
your Earth and Sea with this unsealed
Book in his hand? <hi>Answer,</hi> Far be it from
you such doubts to entertain, who have
felt already the gathering together of
this Glassy Sea, and commixture of it for
a sublime Body of Glory; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Age of all Time shall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
If ye can but endure the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Glassy Fire, which will
make serene and pure: for it is of the
same Flame and inkindling Light of the
immense Deity; so as it is there a bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Spring of Fire, which will strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renew it self in you. Oh pray, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:29870:145"/>
this Fiery Oven, ye may come to walk;
that then nothing impure there may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main:
but such like burnings may all
creaturely things devour, which cannot
be a subject Matter for the heavenly
Power to work upon.</p>

uncessanty: as a Clockwork; having their
Spring-motions: and from thence the
Chrystalline Substance began to appear.
Of which transparency, that which is
called Wisdoms Glass is made out.
And none ever did, or can see, any part
of the Celestial Beauty of Holiness,
without this Wheel come in them to be
formed. Which was declared to me, to
be the creating Power, and energy of
God, who produceth those little Wheels
to work, act, and move answerable to
the great ones. Then it was spoke in
me, Behold and see in these Wheels, the
whole foundation-work of the New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
For hereout will come that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who shall appear as a flash of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29870:145"/>
that will burn through Flesh and
Bones, Rocks and Stones, that will be
all at liberty, resting only in habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of purity. These lesser Wheels care
not to live out of the great Wheels, as
the center of their Springing Life: which
they will still turn into; for they must
all connaturally work, act, and move
together. Then was it made out to me,
that the two great fiery Wheels was the
eternal out-flowing <hi>Deity;</hi> manifesting it
self in the working Wheel: which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the clarified Body of Infinite <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
which moves always in Light and
Fire-celestial; all whose works are
wrought through Fire, because of clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Then was it further opened, what
the two other Wheels were in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
The one was our own Eternal
Spirit, as it is come back again to live
abstracted out of gross matter and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The fourth Wheel is the Chrysta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Pure Corporeity, in which this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life-flash will move it self conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
So as now all four will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
in their working power, when
Wisdom's Glassy Book shall be found in
any one. Which is as a new organical
Body, that hath all radical Powers, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29870:146"/>
Senses, as a rising Morning without
Clouds; being as that Wheel, with Eyes
fixed round about them.</p>

               <p>My Spirit upon this Manifestation sunk
down, as into a Central Flame, requesting
to abide in that, until <hi>Iehovah</hi>'s Wheel
had abstracted the grosser part from my
self. Oh what can us separate here-from,
but the fervent burning of these Wheels?
For the Idea's thereof by these Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Similitudes are far from satisfying,
without the very inkindling powers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be felt, that can only mount us from this
Earth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen was it revealed to me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that these Wheels had not in any
of these late Ages run in the pure fire
of conjunction. For where all four are
found in any one Person incorporating
together, there Wonders will be wrought.
For then Gospel Ministers will go forth,
as mighty flames of Fire. Then cried I,
Ah! my Lord, when, and in whom shall
all these Wheels meet together? It was
said by the Springing word within me,
that it would be accomplished in them
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29870:146"/>
that were numbred in the <hi>Glassy Book.</hi>
Which was not to be read, but tasted,
and felt. <hi>Therefore this Councel of the
Spirit was given, that whenever we did
feel in our selves, any breath of Sacred
Fire rise, which opens from the great
Wheels: then our own Spirits, that is a
Spark also of Celestial Fire, should abstract,
and presently herewith mix; and then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
it may fall into the deep abyssal
center. Which will bring forth all these
working Wheels in their order, which will
work high and powerful. If ye steadily
join all the force of your superiour will,
and in no part be divided, then will you
feel these Wheels begin, to be in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
quality; burning up all that is
not of the nature of the Glassy Sea. Then
this Rule I also received, that we should
forbear to be drawers of water, from the
Sea of this World; for that would quench,
and damp this Fire, and especially before
it hath got the dominion, and mastery:
but then it is above all floods, nothing
can drown it, when all Powers Celestial
are united together. Another Rule given
was, that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we should make daily applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for full vials of Oyl to be poured forth,
that is, much of the sweet sappy flowings
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:29870:147"/>
of the Spirit, as Rivers of Oyl: which
will make all these flaming Wheels work
up to a Seraphick height; so as hereby to
look terribly for Glory and Beauty for
Perfection.</hi>

               <head>May the 23th. 1677.</head>
               <p>As we were met together at prayer,
I had the presentation of a Golden Cup,
out of which did rise a flame of Light,
as Fire bubling beyond the Brim of the
Cup, and it was thus spoke, <hi>who so are
able, let them drink of it.</hi> Upon which
I considered hereof, expecting a further
explanation of this Vision. Which this
Morning thus opened it self: that the
Cup, which was all of Gold, presented
Christ in his pure Corporeity, who had
been tried through all Fires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
was made a meet Vessel to retain the
essential Spirit of the pure flaming Deity,
that springs high beyond the bounds of
humanity, as the Fire did above the Cup.
Then it was revealed, and uttered by a
still voice, that as I did see, the rising
of this Fire, even so should be the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Ghost. For it was his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:29870:147"/>
Fiery Baptism, wherewith many should
be sprinkled from its going out. Oh
my Lord, why was this Cup tendered for
those, who were not able to drink down
this Spirit of Fire? Would it might be
our lot. Who surely would rejoice to
drink down a full draught hereof. Oh
dear Jesus, that by thy self thou wouldst
hand this Cup unto us: as once thou
didst in the figurative way to thy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
After I had much, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
inlarged my self in Spirit to my

in me, Ye must first arrive to this Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>In the night being cast into a sleep, I
saw this Golden Cup again, which was
presented to my intellectual sight, some
days before, as I was in prayer. Now
again passing from one to another, some
few Persons of us being met together.
The Person that handed this cup to us,
was in the Garb of an Officer, with a
Gown; and when he came to give it to
me, somewhat he seemed secretly to
whisper, which the rest were not to hear:
which I thought carefully to observe, but
when I awaked, I could not remember
any thing of the words, which I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
was of concern. I only well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Ministrator of this Golden
Cup, which did not flame out as it did
before; but there was an Oyly Liquor of
flame colour in it, which tasted like to
pleasant Wine. After I was come out of
this Night Vision, I waited, what would
be spoken herefrom further to me: which
interpretation was presently given. the
Officer personated our Lord Jesus, to
whom the great Majesty had given the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29870:148"/>
Power of Administration. For there is
no true Sacramental Institution, but when
he is present himself; who knows those
Sanctuary Vessels of his own Body, that
be thereunto affixed, and who are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from all common use. He walks
amongst the Golden Cups, to convey
Flaming Spirit and pure Oyl of Light:
he doth not put off with dead heartless
Signs, but letteth in his flowing Nature
as Spikenard; that when any have drank
hereof, they do feel an inebriating Spirit,
that burns as fire upon the Altar of their
hearts: as a signal witness, that the right.
Administrator hath opened himself, in a
Celestial Fire-spring. Which is the Pool
of the Holy Ghost, from which every
Sanctuary Vessel is to be sprinkled. Take
ye heed hereto.</p>

               <head type="sub">This Vision was just upon the Doctor's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a House.</head>
               <p>THIS day I had a very deep sense
opened in me, upon a Vision of
several Pits, that were filled with mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Water: so thick they were together,
that my self with some other Persons,
could not know, how to pass, without peril
of falling into some one or other of them.
But our way lying through this place,
we could no way avoid, but we must go
through it. Which was very hazardable,
irksome and grievous: but through fear
and heedfulness, watchfulness and prayer
we did get through. And this word I
did hear speak, saying, This shall also
turn to your salvation through earnest
prayer, from the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus. Then again this night I saw, as
two of us were going upon our way with
great earnestness, to be at the end of our
Journey, there fell a suddain showr,
and stopped us: so as we feared, lest the
night should come upon us, before we
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:29870:149"/>
should reach the place, we were designed
to. This Vision did plainly speak out,
there was some present danger at hand:
which made me desire to be apart, to
know the mind of the Spirit herein; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
those Dicissitudes, which might
happen for our further probation. Then
was it shewed me, that those Pits which
I saw, were promising advantages from
the Earthly Region. Which stood open to
plunge us into their deep Abyss, as which
would drown our superiour Life in their
muddy waters. For this word came to
me, while I was considering hereof: Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
here for your Life sake, for what
have you to do in the way of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi>
Upon which I prayed earnestly,
that we might be kept from the many
evil occurrences, that might happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the removal, to an outward habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which I foresaw might be hurtful for
the present to our Spirits. For which
cause those things were presented; for
how would the Prince of this Earth, and
Aiery Region triumph to see us, who
have disdained his Kingdom, and all the
preferments of it, to be catched by any
baits from it? For I heard this word say
in me, there would be a great acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29870:150"/>
from out of the bottomless Pit, could
they but bury your fire-sparkling life
therein. Therefore fear always, while
you have any thing to transact, where
Satan hath to do.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Showr, that came while
we were journying on, it was opened
to me, that as to the working-wheel of
Fire, there might be some stop. For
there was nothing more injurious than
floods of Water upon fiery Wheels, that
is, heavenly Spirits involving themselves
with earthly things: though good and
lawful to others, yet not to us, who
had the <hi>Nazarite</hi> Vow upon us; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such Laws and Institutions, as were
not made known to others. Therefore
that which might be justifiable in them,
would not be to us, because under great
Light, Revelation and Direction. The
Spirit in us bearing witness hereunto,
that is to be of great binding Force,
and Powers, to keep us in all wariness.
Then is this word uttered, as I was
hereof writing. You of all others, I,
saith the Lord, have desired for to keep
separated for my use: therefore take
heed, what you let in to my Temple
Body. Oh saith the Just One, that I could
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29870:150"/>
but have such large Credit from you, as
I had from some in past-ages; that could
lean and rest upon me, without the
Crutch of Reason under their Arms. For
alas! you are yet but as Children, that
are not able to stand alone. You dare
not trust your selves upon the bare
ground of Faith, and that makes you fly
so readily, to what is before your sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Eye. True, Oh Soul, thy terrestrial
man hath a near disposition to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of this earthly Climate, and runs
thereunto upon all occasions, as to its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
and providing Mother, knowing
yet no better; having found all sensible
sustainment thereby, according to the
manner of this fallen Creation. But
know, you have a Mother of a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that is more true and natural to your
Spirits: and she would now you should
come to understand, and know her to be
the Everlasting Wisdom of the Mighty
God, that can do much above Nature
and Creature for you: Who would have
you desert all other, and hear, and learn
from her mouth; from which doth drop
the Law of Love and Kindness.</p>

               <p>Upon this Manifestation and Councel
of the Spirit, I found all my internal
Powers strongly knit together, to find
out this more sure and all-sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
For there was somewhat in me
of Infinite Being, that was too great to
be kept under the tuition and law of
that, which was earthly and terrestrial.
From out of the bounds of which, my
Spirit would break away, to live to obey
that Law of Faith: which hitherto no
Adeptist, that I know, hath arrived to.
Which hath failed as to my own part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so oft have I given place to self-reasoning;
being by a Foster-Mother so
long brought up in that way, that death
it is therefrom to withdraw. But taught
I am, not to favour my Life herein,
though daily solicited hereunto by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Spirits. Who do cry, spare that
delicate natural thing, which this world
doth glory in. For indeed it hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
all in a forcible stream: but now, in
Spirit I do see, this great Volative will
be dried up. For this Night I did see
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:29870:151"/>
by way of Vision, a muddy Sea boyling
as a Pot; but under it to my great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
there was an invisible Fire hidden
under the Mud and Water. Which I did
view; thinking at first sight nothing less,
but that the Fire would there be choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but it did get the Victory. And in
the Morning, as I was hereof consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was opened to me, that this Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Sea was the natural rational Life, that
must be purged by Fire; till all consumed
it be in such, who like worthy Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall come to shew themselves, in the
Life of Faith. I did also see a Clear
Water separated from the Muddy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
which by the Fire was driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as if it had been a Spring. From
whence it was given me to understand,
That there was a pure Heavenly Matter,
which when the Celestial Fire did work
in any, it would separate from the gross
and evil quality. This Muddy Sea was
said to be the rolling Motions, that work
from the common sense of earthly
things, taken into the Mind: which
makes it soul and muddy. Now what
can purge this but fire, that lieth in the
deep beneath: which gradually worketh
through it, by virtue of an Eternal force,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:29870:152"/>
and might, when once struck in, by the
Saphire Stone of the Deity. Then it
inkindles every property, and becomes a
pure Fire Element, which suffers nothing
combustible to mix with it. After this
I did see, when the Fire had got the
mastery of this pudled Sea, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all as a bright Firmament, and there
sprung up a wonderful Tree.</p>

               <p>In Vision was shewn me a wonderful
Tree, which was strange and amazing,
being out of the course of Nature of all,
which formerly I had seen. The Body
of it, was of the Fire Element, and the
Branches thereof were clustered with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
sparkling Stones of all manner of
Colours, which were of such a dazling
Glory, that nothing less, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of this Tree could give the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of sight. For as the day doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the night for Light, so did these
Stones for lustre excel, what are of the
choisest of this Creation. It no sooner
appeared, but it did again disappear: but
it left its light Raies upon my Mind, for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:29870:152"/>
some certain time. Whereupon this word
was spoken, <hi>This is the great original
Saphire-Tree, which as a Light springeth
up out of the Dark Valley.</hi>

               <p>Being much inquisitive to have the
Mystery of this Oriental Tree, that sprung
out of the pure Element, opened further
unto me; as I was waiting in the Fire of
pure silence, it was revealed, that the
Tree was shewn to make known, that
this was a degree beyond all in Paradise:
For no such lustrous Tree could be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in that Sphear. Trees of Life and
Righteousness might spring thereout, but
this Tree was a Diadem of Glory, that
doth grow out of the Element of the
<hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> Then was it upon my
heart to plead thus with my Lord, Ah,
my Jesus, what doth this signifie to us
as to our present state? This surely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
the highest latitude of Glory, which
thou thy self art capable of. We have
many removes yet surely to pass through,
before we can come to the Clusters of
this Stately Tree. As we now appear,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:29870:153"/>
what is more contemptible, and vile?
And if so in our own Eye, what in thine?
Therefore what Time will or may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for our transportation into such
Fire Stones of amazing Glory. This and
much more, which would be too nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to record, was my Expostulation.
To which the Spirit made reply thus,
that this Vegetable Stone must have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Transplantations, before it could
rise, to such a degree of Celestiality of
Glory.</p>
               <p>As first out of the dry, hungry, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Earth to a Ground moistned with the
dew of Paradise: there it hath a certain
season to work through, as a Plant of
Righteousness, sending forth its fruitful
operations according to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
constellations, which work with it.
It shifteth it self into various forms, as the
Center doth open for Multiplication of
the Vegetable Life: to bring it forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
manifestation of those more eminent
Fruits of the Spirit. As in clusters of
Love, Patience, Meekness, Faith, Hope,
Joy to perseverance. All which are to

for a higher Transformation. For when

               <p>This Morning, about four of the Clock,
awaking with a raised Mind, ready to
entertain discoveries from that invisible
Orb, to which my whole Heart tended
to; I found my self suddenly carried out
of my animal sense, and several idea's did
open to me from the Upper Region. I
saw in the Firmament of the Heavens
Bright Figures, like Half Moons, and
great rolling up and down of the Starry
Heavens, which seemed to be in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Commotion. Then there were great
fears at the sight hereof, among the
lower Spirits of this Region. Then I
saw somewhat like a Standard set up
with a Writing upon it, proclaiming <hi>War
with all the Inhabitants upon the Earth.</hi>
And about these I did see Bows and sharp
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29870:154"/>
Arrows; and because I saw this Piller
or Standard at a distance, I thought it
was, or might not be real: and so I went
to it, and touched it with my hand, and
read the Writing, which was, <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie

after this, I saw the Clouds of Heaven
pass away, and various Persons of great
Majesty descended down to the place,
where the Standard was set, and they
appeared, as those that were Judges of
the Earth. And two or three of them
made towards me, to have spoke with
me, and their Presence was terrible,
that I shrunk away. For my mean Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity
was very inconsistent to their

followed, This is the Lord, who after

               <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> place, Then again watch
not only against the Invasions from what
Ministers from this visible Principle, but
from a near and more inward Center,
whereout the Serpent may move, and
twist himself, while yet you are, but in
the Paradisical Property. For in this
first Transplantation lieth all your danger.
Therefore if all the Fruits of this mystical
Life-tree, can but reach to a Golden Hue,
so solid as to become a fixed Seed, then
ye are out of all hazard and fear. But
cast this Seed into Earth, Air, Water,
or Fire, it will attract to it self, out of
every thing a bright consuming Glory.
Then this word was added, saying,
Weigh and consider this mystical thing;
for here lieth the highest state of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Observe, the Most Holy in all
his removes, within your Heavenly Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
for every new ingraffing from the
Mighty Arm of Power, will be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that he will not leave you, till
Scions ye are made, as Branches of this
<hi>Saphire</hi> glorious Tree.</p>

               <p>This Morning this word was given me
to feed upon, saying, I the Most Holy
will Tabernacle with with a Spiritual
Mind. My Life and Peace as a Spring
will bubble there. The carnal and earthly
Mind is Satan's seat, the pure Mind is God's
Throne. Now choose which of those you
will give place to; for accordingly your
Mind must be ordered: If for the high and
most holy Society, then all Spiritual.
Then was that Scripture repeated to me,
<hi>For to be carnally minded is death, but to
be spiritually minded is life and peace.</hi>
Which life of Carnality is enmity to God,
who will be evermore a Stranger to such,
who shall know nothing of his Love, Joy,
Goodness, Power, and Sweetness. For
if they commune with earthly Spirits,
and things of this terrestrial being,
then such dark influences are left upon
their Minds, as make them altogether
unmeet to talk with God: or to take in
of those Species, which tend for transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring
the Soul into a bright body of
Glory. When the Mind is pestered and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:29870:156"/>
overcharged with thoughts, that tend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for this gross elementary Life, there is
no room for the Holy Ghost, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
and cometh from such a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
being of holiness, as the Father
of Spirits is.</p>

               <p>I saw a Ball of Fire, and out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
went Flakes of Fire, and fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
thorny Bushes; so as they were
no more: being consumed by the Flame.
And it was said to me, these are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
and dispersive Powers, that will
go forth from the substantial God head
to devour the Shrubs of the Earth. Then
after this internal sight, I was as in a
sleep, where much combustion, strife,
and spiritual Labour, for the attainment
of somewhat, that was of Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
And such was the clamorous
onset of earthly Spirits, that for a time,
I found my self sunk down into a dark
Vally. Upon which I awaked with
great perplexity. Then after this I saw
in way of Vision, a rich Golden Sledge
set up, and I was to slide down upon it:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:29870:156"/>

               <p>This Morning as I was recollecting my
interiour Powers and Faculties, which I
found had been somewhat scattered, by
being let out and employed upon secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
concerns: and which I found was as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Thorns, grievous and unsavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
Upon this my Spirit made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
with Soul-meltings, for Life-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and restitution to those wonted
familiarities, and divine discoveries;
wherein consisted all my peace, life, and
satisfaction. Upon which my care now
was, how we, who were under a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
obligation, should discharge our
selves of all, and every weight that had
beset us. For it was presented to me,
that while we were gathering together,
what might accommodate our outward
man, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the sticks to warm him
after his perilous voyage; even so we
upon necessary and lawful things being
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29870:157"/>
employed, were in danger of the poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Vipers, which would stick so close
to our hands, as we should be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to awaken and call up the Most Holy
Adjuring Power of the Mighty God.
Whereby we might be able to cast them
off, before they infected our pure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life-blood; that so we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
forward in our Spiritual Work. For
this word was spoke, why seek ye to
dwell in ceiled houses, and let the most
holy in your selves lie waste? Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
this word met me, Take heed of
the Commonsewer that corrupteth the
whole Earth; that it break not in upon
you. For it is a <hi>Noah</hi>'s flood: it will
sweep all away, that are out of God's
Ark. Upon which warnings I guirded
up upon my Watch-Tower, to hear what
would be further opened to me. Having
had somewhat yesterday passing through
me upon <hi>Abimelechs</hi> taking <hi>Sarah</hi> from
<hi>Abraham:</hi> The Meaning of it was this
day made out further unto me; the
Spirit taking up that Scripture, as in
way of a Parable, to shew us the danger
in passing through with the Virgin Mind
amongst Foreigners and Strangers; though
not intending to take it up as a dwelling
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29870:157"/>
place, but only to sojourn as <hi>Abaham</hi>

            <div type="vision">
               <head>Iune the 24th. 1677.</head>
               <p>Now after this manner the Spirit did
parly or commune with me. Know, that
ye have had a call to pass out, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the throng of the worldly Spirits;
whereof <hi>Abraham</hi> was a type, whom God
called to sojourn as a Stranger, removing
from place to place, till he did come to
live alone by himself, and to be planted
as a Root for a mighty Off-spring.
Wherefore the Most High had designed
him, and so <hi>Abraham</hi> with his <hi>Sarah</hi> went
through the Philistines Country, and was
in danger to have had <hi>Sarah</hi> violently
taken from him, who was to bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the blessed Seed. Even so it was opened
after a high mystical manner, that this
<hi>Abraham</hi> did represent the Spirit of Faith:
whom God would bless and make fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
through Marriage-union with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Wisdom. And it was further shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
me, that there should be a Male, and a
Female, that would be made choice of,
to bring forth an eternal spiritual Off-spring
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29870:158"/>
for a true Church. Which should
be known from all others by terrible
things wrought in righteousness through
the Ghostly Power breaking forth. And
therefore note and observe, said the
Word of Life, whether or no, God in
the Spirits voice hath not spoken to you,
to come out of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> Country;
considered both as to the vain, evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
of Persons without, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirits within the Region of the
Mind: from both which there is to be a
real departure out. And as there are
two Persons, that are thus to be depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
visibly, who are to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hdraw, and
and plant themselves, as out of all other
gathered Fellowships of the World: So
are they to be extraordinarily endowed in
giving proof of Love, Faith, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him, that hath power thus to
dignifie and make blessed. God knows
<hi>Abraham</hi> was such as one, as would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself in all perfect walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and answer whatever Trust was
committed to him, by the Most Holy
and just one: to keep every Charge, and
Command given, as did appear, when
he came out of his own Land, to go
where he knew not. Now it was from
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29870:158"/>
hence revealed, that <hi>those who shall be
counted worthy, to bring forth a pure
spiritual Generation must come out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
as well as externally from that
Native Country, where numerous Spirits
that have no Visible Bodies do dwell,
and have their concourse in the Mind
after a magical manner. Now here will
be the trial, for to go through their
Eartbly Regions, and not be hurt. For
no sooner did</hi> Abraham <hi>falter in his Faith
through fear, but his Spouse was taken
away,</hi> which if he had kept up in the
majesty and authority of Faith, and had
owned her, then the dread of that
Power and Spirit of Faith, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Beauty and Innocency would have
been upon <hi>Abimelech,</hi> so as there would
not have been any attempt of that kind.
From whence this was a warning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in particular unto us: given in our
present journying on, through strange
People and Nations, which lie in our
way, before we can come to <hi>Hebron,</hi> the
City of <hi>David</hi> our King. And these
are mystically opened from within us,
as occasions offer from without. For the
Prince of this World knowes, herein he
hath great advantage, while but passing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29870:159"/>
through his Dominions, he will have one
device or other against those, who are
designed to pitch their Tents remote from
his Territories. Therefore he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir
himself to raise all Forces to stop
their Progress, that if possible he might
keep them under his Arbitrary Power:
Seeking always of subtilty to weaken
the hand of Faith, by alluring away the
Virgin Love, and so he would make a
separation. For in the pure conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith and Love, they are knit
together as the Bridegroom and the
Bride, to travel together, till they obtain
the promised Seed. To whom all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of strength doth belong, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to govern those Nations, that
would usurp an evil Power over the
blessed Seed. <hi>Oh, saith the living Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

which the Virgin Spirit of Love will

of her who is travelling in the greatness
of his strength. Every Arm of created
Power is too short to bring it forth. <hi>God
must bring forth God.</hi> Then queried my
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:29870:160"/>
Spirit, where, and how, and after what
manner will be so marvelous a thing?
Sure nothing of mortality can compass
such an Immensity, as a Gods excellency
in this World to be manifested. <hi>No</hi> said
the Spirit of Councel, <hi>the Terrestrial Man
cannot have any share herein,</hi> either to
conceive or bring it forth: But yet such
may be the high act of Love in the Most
Holy, as to open his Mighty Name <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>
through that mean form of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and send forth somewhat of a deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
express of his Existency, in terrestrial
Creatures; so as to make them signifie
unto the World, what power it is that
moves through them. Who have been
in strong and unwearied travel, for this
all-saving Birth of Almighty Power. For
indeed such a Birth is needed in the
World, that may deliver from all the
evils of it. There is nothing, but an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
Force will conquer the sinful
Authorities, that have been so long in
Government over all the Creation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what are ye to look, and wait for,
but the Birth of this Mighty Prince <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
to arise in, and to go before you;
for it is by meer strength, that he must
prevail, to subdue all Nations, whether
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:29870:160"/>
they be within or without. Many have
been the forerunners of this by inferiour
Births, which ye have passed through.
As those of Regeneration, and Divine
Inspirations, and Productive Revelations,
all in order hereunto: But all these have
been too weak and too short, to deliver
out of the Servile Spirit. The Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Power doth yet keep and serve it
self upon you, and will not let you go
free; till this Mighty Prince doth arise
to remand you back unto your own
Land, and native Freedom again. Thus
I did evidently see nothing, but the
all-saving Arm could pluck us back again.
And moreover this word was with me,
and in me spoken. Pray for the <hi>Cyrus</hi>
Might to be joined with the <hi>Nazarite</hi>
Wisdom of Purity: for without Power
ye cannot perform any of my Pleasure,
in subduing the Babylonish Power, that
hath enlarged it self over the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal

elected ones in this World, that their
Redeemer is now a Mighty King over all
Kingdoms. And this day is drawing near
for the revealing of this his shut up
Power, that hath been reserved with him
in the Heavens. By reason of which, a

do now cry unto this Mighty <hi>Cyrus</hi> to
appear, and to break for them this Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish
Yoak: which hath made them so

to serve with rigour under the Prince of

Verily to such as do sigh and mourn,
for all the Abominations of Desolations,
which they see to be of Authority. To
such, I say, the Most High will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

For nothing, but Seraphical Pleasure is
here with the highest Peace, Joy, and
Rest from all former Toil, Labour, and
Sorrow. <hi>And the Law of God as a Gulf

               <p>Then was it with me to enquire with

this <hi>Zions</hi> Reign? All things yet in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

The Prince of Might yet hath no
Birth in the World, for to bring into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istency
this New Creation, Who then
shall be, the beginning of this Celestial
World; seeing that from some one or

               <p>As to this, some days after, I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with good and comfortable
words: that we might not sorrow as
those, who do see nothing of this rising
day. For while my Spirit was groaning
in the Kingdom of Tribulation and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I heard this sweet saying, <hi>The Birth
is Love, That shall restore the Kingdom
of Ioy and Power.</hi> And as it doth grow
near, the Pangs of Love will flow upon
you, which will be <hi>Sions</hi> mighty delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<hi>Therefore revive, when Loves
throws do take hold upon you; for it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
foreruns the breaking forth of the
Son of Ioy, and Strength:</hi> who will rule
the Earth, and ease the Nations of their

                  </gap> Griefs, and Torments. Then
was somewhat opened to me of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of a great Key, which I did see in
way of Vision, held out unto me; which
was so great and weighty, that I made
question in my self, whether I could
carry it; and was loth to take the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of it, not then understanding the
intent, why it was shewn and tendred.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:29870:165"/>
But this Morning considering hereof, a
voice did sound through me, This is the
mighty Birth-Key, which shall open the
<hi>New Ierusalem</hi> Glory. No terrestrial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can it hold: for it is all massy and
refined Gold, that will open the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

                  </gap> hen was
it highly impressed upon me, what this
Key did further signifie unto us. Then
another word did swiftly put forth in
me, saying: Those to whom this is given,
will have power to bind or loose, to
shut or open, to kill or save alive, and
also to charge or discharge from the guilt
of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For it is the Key of Knowledge,
and sound Judgment, and acteth absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the express Power of the Most
High, to fulfill every jot and tittle of his
Eternal Will. God the Father will well
satisfie himself in such, whose propriety
it shall be to possess this all powerful
Key. Ah, my Lord, is there any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow
abiding in corporeity, that is so eyed by
thee, to be an Instrument to act in the
Power of this mighty Key? Sure no
Prohibition, or Decree is gone forth, but
some one or other may be designed by

thee hereunto in this Age. But then the
Spirit said, they must be such, as are
annointed with that high <hi>Composition Oyl,</hi>
which at once doth clarifie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume,
as an attoning <hi>Incense,</hi> whose flame
never goeth out, till this Key be wrought
out in the Fire Center. Then was this
word of Councel given unto me, Set a
work all your present force and might:
it will be worth the laying out all your
cost and labour hereupon. You have
an all-skilful Guide, that is master of
this Mystical Science: but he loveth not
to have to do with any Spirit, that is
divided, with one Eye looking forward,
and with the other backward. He
knows he shall never have Honour or
Credit, by such as are halting between
two Principles; sometimes rising up in
the Fiery Wheel of Faith, then sinking
down in the Leaden Scale of Sense,
which bringeth back, what Faith hath
brought forward. Which is the great
Energy, that giveth the formation, to
this all-sovereign Key, that is propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of; but none have been found here
for worthily qualified of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

of this low Region, that so you may
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:29870:166"/>
make this, your entire business: From
which let there be no starting, as ye
would enjoy the blessed Projection of
this Key; that will open for you, and
will unfold to you the 1000th Number
in Wisdom's Roll.</p>

                  </gap> who

this word did further proceed, Whoever

to it. The third Pipe was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
Water, which keeps and maintains all in
an immaculate Life of Purity. Out of
these the Divine Nature is extracted.
And who ever do not lay their internal
Spirits to suck out of these P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pes, can
never arrive to any strong Spiritual Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For what doth it avail to have
the knowledge and revelation of this in
Mystery, and be at a spiritual distance
herefrom? If Jesus, while i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had not lain close to his Fathers
heart, drawing continually, although high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fssenced in Spirit; yet he could never
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29870:167"/>
have grown, if he had not derived fresh
Infiniteness of Strength and Power to
hold up the God head Soveraignity in the
Manhood. <hi>So likewise the Spirit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
did teach us, that we should strive
to reach to the heart of Iesus in Spirit.</hi>
Here did meet me this Objection, But
how shall we thus abstractedly have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

                  </gap>
so that we know not how to meet him?
This Question was thus resolved me.
These Pipes, like <hi>Iacob's</hi> Ladder, were
fixed for descending Powers to descend
through them. <hi>It is granted, that we
cannot reach up to our Lord, till we have
a full grown Spiritual Body. Therefore</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there is that Spirit
in us, which by the drawing down this
Life sustenance, may recover its ancient
sublime and paradysical Body, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
not of Flesh, Blood, and Bones, but
of an immortal Virtue, Power, and Strength;
answerable to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Heavenly</hi> Jerusalem <hi>State.</hi> Then was it
further shewed me, That through these
three Conveyances did run all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weighty precious thing, that was now
inherent in God the Son. For want of
understanding, and not finding out the
way of this mighty attraction from the
head-substance, We have discovered the
shame of our Nakedness; wearing only
the vile cloathing which is infirm and
weak, obnoxious to all evil, and death;
fit and meet only to walk and converse
with Creatures of a mean and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sort, such as this World is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
withal. But now a Summons

                  </gap>ering, sorrow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency,
but of God-like Authority.
Which will be the Sealing Commission
of the Everlasting Gospel Prerogative:
that will no more go forth in weakness,
but in the finishing Power of a mighty
Salvation. <hi>Seek, and pray ye for such a

so changing his Corporeity into an

yet to be done for us. For while the
Ear of my Spirit as the Oracle of God,
doth stand open, clear, and free, from
the twisting stuff of all low, imaginary
things, the voice of the Most High, doth
frequently cry through me: From whence
<hi>I can conclude, that the Spirit of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

for which do ye, who are one in Faith,

was discoursed in the way and method
of a Spirit, how that <hi>the latter Crop of
the Spirit should be much greater and
more plentiful, than what was in the

which was but as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

withdraw; and a long restraint hath been,
as to what they witnessed in their day.
All that can be said of what hath been
enjoyed by the highest order of Saints,
since the Apostles days, is but a sowing
into the Spirit, through divine and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Light entring in, for conviction,
illumination; thereby to make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation

were immediately inspired with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.
<hi>Vpon which, to this day, there
hath been a total and full resting, as if
God had nothing more to reveal to all

Scriptures, (or rather the Spirit of them)
did point out in them to a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
of Spirit, that was to be poured
forth. But till then, saith one in his
Epistles, Ye do well to take heed, as to
a present measure of Light, which in
this long and cloudy day seemeth great
and lustrous; <hi>but there is a Star to rise
out of your own hearts, that may outshine
all, that hath gone before, if you watch

that we might have further grounds of

upon themselves, as their Birth-Star.
Which shall multiply unto the seventh
Number: which only qualifies to stand
within the Circle Throne of the Most
Holy. The seven Stars which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to be held in the hand of Jesus,
your mighty Prince of Peace, are to be
distributed as the Badge, or Inscription,
of such as shall be so perfected for a free
pass into the <hi>Jerusalem-glory;</hi> there to
be in Oneness with him, without rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
to their Kingly Priest, in all his
Thronely Principality: and to be added
to the enrolled numbers of the Ancients,
which are come to be Victorious over
the World, through great Tribulation.
So ye will be followers of him, through
this Rising Star.</p>

               <p>This Morning the Living Word spake
in me, Thou dost not yet sound the
meaning, and depth of that, which is
further to be understood of <hi>the Residue of
the Spirit;</hi> but I am come to search, and
give thee further knowledge herein. As
thus, the Golden Cask of this Rich Oyl
hath been in part let forth: seven Pipes
for the venting hereof, are as an Emblem
to present the seven Spirits, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
do proceed. Now well observe, how
many of these Spirits have been drawn
out of the Golden Vessel, which represents
the Body of the Deity, either in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
or present Age; and you will see,
what is come, and what is yet more to
come, till the seventh Number be finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
First consider the Prophecies, and
Promises, how they run in the Scripture
Roll. The Spirit is distinguished with
seven Properties, or Operations, and
Working-powers; each of these Spirits
hath their Office and Ministration, as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29870:172"/>
dividing to each one in the Body of the
Spirit, according to the measure of the
Gift of Christ.</p>
               <p>As <hi>First,</hi> The Promise of Grace and
Supplication is to empty out it self.</p>
               <p>Then a Spirit of Love, Joy, and Peace
is the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a Spirit of Consolation, of
Prophesie, and Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Spirit of Councel and
Sound Mindedness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Spirit of Truth, Wisdom,
and Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Spirit of Faith, for Heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Internally, and Externally, and doing
thereby Miracles of all kinds.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seventh,</hi> This is a Creating Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that goeth forth to give Being and
Existency to what seemeth not to be; it
works on this hand, and on that, and
yet nothing, which is inferiour unto it
self, can it see. It works all in a silent
still way: what it speaks, it effects; and
what it effects, speaks forth what it is.
It needs no Orator to go before it, to
declare from whence this Holy Breath of
Almighty Power doth move; it resteth
where it will, yet unseen; yet felt,
known, tasted to good purpose, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:29870:172"/>
it abides; it being the head prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
Spirit that governeth and sendeth
out the foregoing Spirits, and uniteth
them into one entire Spiritual Body.
Now, said the Most Holy Inspirator, I
have here shewn to you the seven
Ascending Steps, by which you must
come up to your Mansion Glory, to your
Throne Dominion; to be what you were
designed for to be from before all Worlds.
Come now, and see what process you
have made hereunto, and how many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
ye have taken. Comforted ye may
be, who do ascend up here together in
Faith; though many attempts, and that
strong ones, have been to pull you down,
and to prevent your further ascent. But
be strong and resolute this day, from that
power already received; that you may
go up, and stand upon that last p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved
stone of Wisdoms strength, and might.
Which will bring Majesty and Honour to
you; but Horror, Confusion, and Shame
to what ever hath sought hence to draw,
and plunge you in with them, into the
dark center of this dismal Sphere. The
which evermore fear, and avoid as the
Dragon's Cell, where he loves to dwell.</p>

               <p>This day much refreshment from the
bright beaming Countenance of my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Lord, through free converse with
him, came thereby to my Spirit. My
Spirit being moved to plead propriety,
in what the Father had given unto him.
Whom after the way of Spiritual Sight,
I did behold a smiling Face, looking
through a ray, like to the Sun; and a
voice spake, I will see you Face to Face,
that you may hear my voice: then will
your Joy be daily full. Then this word
I did hear, It is well you now do believe,
that all Spirit and Mighty Power is with
me, to provide for those whom my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath given me in charge. I am no
engrosser to my self of this <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
treasury, but do will, that ye should be
joint-heirs with me, in the same Body of
Glory. <hi>But it is the vehement, strong,
thirsty Ones, who can draw out that Life,
which I now do live in, and that in the
highest degree of Perfection.</hi> Which
makes me stand up in the head fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
to impower gifts of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:29870:173"/>
according as you are able to
partake of them. Oh that you would
lie close in your Spirits, to that Breast
which is in pain, by reason of its fulness,
till it hath emptied it self, with the
sweet lusciousness of the Gospel Milk.
When tasted, it will make you be always
lingring and strongly desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The office of my Spirit is like a true and
faithful Nurse, to lay and to give the
Mouth of your own Eternal Born-Spirit
hereunto; but then of it self it must
draw, and ye must not be discouraged,
though at first, it doth not come so flush.
But some pains must be taken by you in
this Spiritual Exercise, before the Breast
of Life will open fluently: But when
herein you have once got the victory,
the Bottles of Heaven, will run free,
emptying forth the very marrow and
strength of the Deity. What else think
ye, can make great, strong, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Divine Nature, but this very
Life-substance, which by the Mouth of
the Spirit, highly magical is constantly
attracting? Then will ye be answered,
in what you have been so long in Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travel
for.</p>

               <head>Iuly the 19th. 1677.</head>
               <p>This word was with me early in the
Morning, Pass on ye Worthies of the
Lord, through all measures of my Spirit,
till you come to all seven Degrees. Rest
not in the shallow parts or streams, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye come to float in the place of the
Broad-waters, where the Spirit will be
to you unmeasurable. For though it is
an undiscernable strength, yet in it lieth
the whole omnipotent force both of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and destroying, creating and nullify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This Power will be inherent in
them, upon whom the seven united Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
shall rest, and dwell. Which indeed
will make you excel the very Angels, as
to dignifying Power, which never was
their natural dowry, as it was yours in
the beginning; but that you have lost,
through sin and earthliness entring in,
which hath made you thus feeble, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and weak, that you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
till these my seven Spirits do
come, each one gradually in their course,
to renew your strength, <hi>through the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
concurrence of your wills.</hi> Which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:29870:174"/>
to me, I your Lord do own, you have
given in. Therefore my Spirit, I am
moving upon the Face of your inward
Deep, till the whole mystery of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Figure shall again be restored.
Therefore I am calling the Eye of your
Minds inward, that so ye may take
knowledge, how many steps you have
gone up to this Throne, and so be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to pass forward. You are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to the third measure, which is the
Spirit of Prophecy and Revelation: here
is a pleasant standing, because you have
prospects of the unknown Scenes of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great advantage is from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you do live in the divine Idea's of
what is contained in the invisible Sphear.
Yet far be it from thee, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

higher there are, which have been seen
in the Mount of Vision. Who then now
as high descended Spirits, <hi>will</hi> in mighty
Faith attempt them, and renounce what
ariseth of fear and doubt? <hi>As Faith and
Love are the Wheels that do hither bring,
so fearfulness and unbelief do the Wings
of the Mind bind down.</hi> Oh how flow
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29870:175"/>
of heart have you been to believe, what
of these Ministrations hath been so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
prophesied by my Spirit? Come
forward on, and put forth that little
grain of Power, which you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in your selves, and see what you
can make hereof. The more you act
it forth, the more it will encrease. For
as the Ministration of Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
doth more clearly immerse you
into the knowledge of what is unknown:
So the Mystery of the highest degree
of Faith must necessarily therefrom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to work, and that in such a way,
as may be a sealing to what is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for manifestation. For a let into
invisible Species of things cannot but
quicken up Faith, and make it strong
in God: by which it may easily, yea
most naturally act, and go forth in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>culous
Deeds; for confirmation to
others of, what by a bare Testimony will
not be believed in, a residue of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
For this is also surely reserved,
which is the sixth step to <hi>Sions</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But before this can be perfected
in any one, that do look Here for it,
they must be of a through grown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the Life of Revelation.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29870:175"/>
                  <hi>These Gifts will not come down by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
rushing showers, as it was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times.</hi> But henceforth they will
be Consequents, which will follow those,
who do gradually grow up from the
very Birth-day of the Spirit into all the
sublime perfections of Holiness, as their
constitution into a Christ-like Nature.
For it is the Root of that Heavenly
Matter, from whence Gifts of this kind
do proceed, and will in such pure and
sanctified Vessels be inherent. For they
only stand in the Light, Councel, and
Will of the Trinity, ready to obey and
execute his Will, here on Earth; as the
Angels of the Presence, who truly and
faithfully do go forth in the Light,
Power, and Force of the seven Spirits:
whose fortitude it is to secure from all
the wrathful conspiracies, which are in
this evil World.</p>

               <head>Iuly the 20th. 1677.</head>
               <p>This day upon a foregoing Word;
which opened it self in me, as we were
met together to breath the Life to each
other, a superaddition thereof was given
me. The word was from that of Jesus,
crying in the great day of the Feast, <hi>If
any man thirst, let him come unto me,
and drink; then out of their Bellies shall
flow Rivers of Living Waters,</hi> (speaking
of the Spirit.) The Jews Feast being the
Feast of Tabernacles, was highly at that
day solemnised; from which the Lord
did take an occasion to invite to another
manner of Feast, presenting himself as
the principal Dish to feed upon, and
Well of Life to draw the Waters of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
from. It was again revived to
me in this word, You are come to the
festival day of the Spirit. Set by it,
esteem it: spare not to take your fill.
Tell me, Oh ye that beloved are, what
from this Heavenly Table, where all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Spirit is, what is most relishable
to your Heavenly Palate? Had not I
known you to have been in the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29870:176"/>
hunger and thirst after that Food
which is all Spirit and Life, you should
never have drawn near to my Table.
For to others this kind of Fare has been
little understood, or tasted of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not desired. It is the pure Birth of
the Spirit, that can only live upon that,
which is Spirit: as none can know the
things of God, but the Spirit; so none
can taste God, but what is born of God.
What else did your Lord Jesus live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
during the time of his abiding in
the humanity, but the Essential Power
of the Deity? He still drew it in, as the
Invisible Bread of Life, which he had to
eat that the World knew not of. Now
said the Spirit unto me, <hi>It will be to you,
according to what you believe or thirst
for, or after; whether for the Milk, or the
strong Meat of the Spirit.</hi> For this is
called the Feast of the Spirit, because it
multiplies it self into Corn, Wine, Oyl,
Milk, Hony, Marrow, and Fatness. There is
nothing that can be named for refreshing
and strengthning, which the Spirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
doth not afford to the strong in Faith.
Then again a further Information was
given, concerning the Ministration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
that though this Mount of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:29870:177"/>
Vision, was not to be for ever the
fixed Rest, of such who are under such
a dispensation, which must be owned as
a high and rich Prerogative; Yet warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had this day, hereupon, still to
wait. For the Spirit did expresly speak,
that we were come, but to the shallows
of that unmeasurable Deep: our Feet did
but yet stand upon the Golden-sea brim,
and that we must yet abide a while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou
this Chrystalline Stone, till launched
into the deep ocean of all Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Knowledge, of what is within
the Vail. Where all things of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Glory are to be seen, not as in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
or Figures, but in their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Beings, as the heavenly things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Then through the Oracle-ear,
this word did sound to me, Ye have not
yet known, what it is to be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into the Spirit; that is, as if you
were without a Body of animal sense,
and changed into an unmixed Body of
Spirit. For thus it was with <hi>Iohn,</hi> when
he saw and talked with the <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega.</hi> Then the word of Jesus was made
good to him; as one of them, who did
not see death, till he had seen the Son
of Man in Majesty, coming in the <hi>New
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29870:177"/>
Ierusalem Glory.</hi> But this he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have beheld, if he had not been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for the time being, into a Spirit.
Which had so penetrated through his
gross material Body, as that he knew
himself only in a Body of Light. Therefore
he called it the Lord's Day; such a day,
as the dark Night of an earthly Body must
fly away from: For it could not abide,
when though, but in the Vision of so
immense a Glory, that dispersing it self so
variously into the Images of what, so
long had lain unseen. Even so verily,
deeper may be your entrance into the
Heavens to hear and see, what there is
reserved, as your Dowry, among those
High-Throne Principalities, which <hi>Iohn</hi>
did see. Fear not, I say, through this
bright day to pass; though the night of
your Body of earthly sensuality shall by
degrees pass away. Care not to hazard
all that; so as ye may be taken up still
in the Visions of the mighty <hi>Alpha,</hi> where
new Scenes of Glory may open to you
daily.</p>

               <p>As we were in Prayer met together,
this word passed through me, which
plainly thus spake: These are the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Spirits, O Father, that will not let

not a little revive me, and added a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

               <p>This Morning I had this further Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
pourtraid out to my Internal
Eye, The Figure of a Fleshy Heart with
many Eyes, and a Mouth, from
whence issued out a white Stream like
a Breath. From which it was said, draw
near, and receive in what floweth out
here, which I assaid to do magically, as
well as I could. Then when I was come
to my inward understanding Spirit, to
know what this might signifie, This word
did pass through me, This Breath is thy
Spirits Meat, by which ye are to live
day by day.</p>
               <p>This Vision contained very much in
it: which was made out, as it was cast up,
and called over again in my Mind, afresh
teaching being herefrom given unto me.
How this was the new Heart, which would
be as the Well of deep Waters, in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it was fixed. Many were the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Properties, which do belong to this
Heart: For it was the Figure of the very
Heart of God the Son, lively discribed in
the rising <hi>Magia.</hi> Then were the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29870:179"/>
Working-Powers and Properties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
unto me; and I was also made
to understand, what I never before did
sound. For it was whispered to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ear, saying, Thou little thinkest,
or perceiveth what lieth concealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these Triangles. An immense Treasury
is here couched: Who can fathom his
own heart, much less this, which is so
all-seeing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to give the several Properties of the
Heart, full of Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First Property.</hi> No slumber doth happen
on them at any time. For flumbring and
sleepy Eyes argue a state of weakness;
but these are perfect Eyes, strong Eyes,
in their full strength and clarity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Property.</hi> They are watchful
Eyes, waking Eyes; looking every way
unto the heights above, and down to
the depths beneath, and to the bredths,
and lenghts of what in all the World
are seeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Property.</hi> These Eyes are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernaing,
and piercing Eyes: The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
excellency of these Eyes is this,
because their faculty is to pierce into
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29870:179"/>
things so, as nothing can be hid or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from them. This all-seeing Heart,
was with the Prophets of old; from
whence they were called Seers. When
<hi>Gehazi</hi> would have hid from <hi>Elisha,</hi>
the gifts of reward received from
<hi>Naaman;</hi> faith <hi>Elisha,</hi> went not my
Heart with thee? There is no hiding
from the Eye of the Heart. <hi>Samuel</hi>
from this inward sight could tell <hi>Saul,</hi>
that his Asses were found, and how that
he was designed for a more weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than to look after them; having
the matter of a Kingdom to propound
to him from the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth Property.</hi> The Eyes of this
Heart are clear, single, pure Eyes, and
purged from every Mote; It is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
property of this Heart to see God:
and this Heart hath a Mouth in it to
speak from; and it speaks to the Most
Holy: and it hath an Ear to hear also
therefrom. So that it is both a seeing,
hearing, and speaking Heart; therefore
God sets a value upon such a good
Heart. Such a Heart <hi>Caleb</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had: which Heart much answers to
God's own Heart; for it is God's own
Heart, in man's Heart. As it was said
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:29870:180"/>
by one, We have the Mind of Jesus: it is
as if he had said, we have the Heart of
Christ. <hi>Therefore the New Covenant runs
all upon a New Heart:</hi> Gods Heart, in
man's Heart, making man's Heart a New
Heart. All the Revenue of Eternal Life
is Entailed upon what issues from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Heart, made new from God's
Heart, indwelling in man's Heart. Here
verily you are come to the grand business;
for what the whole tenure of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
and Promises points out unto, is
to this seeing, hearing, and speaking
Heart: as it belongs to the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is God's Heart in Man's Heart,
making it a new Heart. For God's Heart,
or Christ's Heart, is the warm Life-moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that floweth through man's own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Heart. Thus God's Heart in man's
Heart, makes man's Heart a new Heart,
and a good Heart: and makes man's Heart a
seeing, hearing, and speaking Heart. When
man's Heart is made single, clear, and
pure, purified from every mote of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
and from all sin and self; then
it can see God, and hear God, and speak
to God. For it hath the Heart of Christ
in his own purified Heart. <hi>David</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the worth of such a Heart, when he
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29870:180"/>
so earnestly prayed, for the creating a
clean Heart in him. It is a meer act of
Creation, by first raising or putting forth
a power to dissolve the old dark earthly
stony Heart: which the new Heart of
Christ must come in the place of. For
there cannot be any agreement betwixt
them, while they are together. For till
the old Heart is worn out by degrees,
Oh, what strife, war, and contention is
between them, so long as the earthly
part can hold it out, (as is found by the
Saints experience) till the Heart of Jesus
comes fully to be fixed in the old Heart.
Then from the sight of Christ's Heart-Eye
in our new Heart, the pure Life will
stir essentially: and such Spiritual Motions
will spring, as great Peace, Love, and
Joy will come in upon you, as a bubbling
Water of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth Property.</hi> From Christ's Heart in
a good Heart made good, the new World,
and the Nature of Paradise is placed
there; and this new World is always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
the good Heart by internal Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Heavenly things, generated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
answerably to what the Mind is
employed upon, and raised up into. As
in an old unregenerated Heart, this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:29870:181"/>
World is placed in the midst of it,
provoking the Mind with those earthly
species that riseth from it to a close with
them: So here, new Idea's arise, and are
abundantly brought forth from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Heavenly World, placed in a
new and regenerated Heart. Which the
Spirit of a good Heart feeds upon mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously,
while this Worldly Heart doth
see nor tast nothing hereof. So strong,
so high are <hi>Zions</hi> Walls that are built
for these holy Hearts, that no groveling
Spirits, nor low earthly Hearts can tast
any thing of their Seraphick Life. Whose
natural soil it is to live like the Hearts of
Beasts, breathing after their perishing
Fodder, and sensual Pleasures; but this
Heart from Jesus in a Regenerated good
Heart is created for better things. It
knows its own true temperature to be
such, as can no more lust after, what is
terrestrial. Because it hath been so much
touched upon by the Divine Flames of
the most Holy Altar. Because also it hath
been so often impressed from the sealing
Powers of the Deity. Whose breath doth
so strongly move, as to maintain upon
the good Heart a pleasant soft Fire, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as a signal Witness, that a Sacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29870:181"/>
liveth there, for whom is provided
the best of Celestial Chear. Also because
the creating Word may still renew, a
fresh Life, with all its secret, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Retinue of pure Spirits, that may
be refreshing to the Solitary: who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have made their choice to live in
the Heart of Jesus, till with their inward
Eyes they have spied, where that only
massy Gold-stone of all-working Powers
doth lie. Which is only sounded by
these Hearts: but to raise up this all-gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Power is not found out by them, till
they are come to have more innate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Communion with this Heart. For
by virtue of their Co-Union, there will
be co-working. For thus it was betwixt
God and Christ; there was but as one
Heart betwixt them, in which they did
in all things agree. From whence it was
said, hitherto the Father doth work, and
I work: that was by a mutual agreement,
going out in acts of Power, from deep
Councel and Wisdom, as foreseeing all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of things. So it will be between Christ
and a Christian: when they have co-union
of Heart, then there will be co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
together b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tween Christ and a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
Co-union of Heart, is when Christ's
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29870:182"/>
Heart dwells in a Christian Heart, and the
Heart of a Christian is one in Union with
Christ's Heart. Then will follow intimate
communion, and co-operations in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               <p>This word run through me, as a burning
stream, saying, Seek, make out with all
speed for a partnership with this perfect,
and all-powerful Heart. For it will not

Reflective Light; but it will give an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

Wisdom's Pearly Stone doth shine, and
hence all her Divine Magia doth work:
Let it not stagger thee, that little hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that might demonstrate the Heart-Power

may be thine in an absolute propriety.
Such an innate life of conjunction will

more expedient, than to be found in this

most perfect and all-seeing Heart, that all
you do may be wrought herefrom. Then
further it was testified, that it was not
the sudden flights of the Spirits up into
this Heart, which would do or perfect
the remainder of what was to be finished.
For in that, there might be an uncertain
motion; as our own Hearts sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, and then again down: by reason
of which so little hath been brought to
pass. For a steady Heart and Mind is
Wisdom's Pavilion where she dwelleth,
Therefore this caution and word of
Councel, the Spirit did give, that when
carried up at any time by the Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Heart of Jesus, there to fix for

               <p>The word of Admonition was given

               <p>From these words it was shewed me,
that it was not sufficient that we were
under the distillings of the Spirit-doctrine
to drink it in, so as to let it pass away
again; but this word of Truth was to
dwell, and to be deeply rooted in us, as
it is brought forth into a plain discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by way of Precept. For in this day,
the Word of the Lord coming to any one
immediately, is so rare and pretious, that
God looks that they whom he shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

will cause the Spirit to retire to its own

               </p>
               <p>This Councel did very much reach
my Soul, engaging all the Faculties of
my interiour Mind, lest at any time I
should let slip any word so expresly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto me from the Spirit; for it is
love, and grace, worthy of all acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And I must own it is good dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the droppings of this Fruitful
Bough, which is loaden with all sweet
Hony-dewes; that no sooner are touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the twig of Faith, but the Eye
of the Heart is both enlightned, and is
therewith highly refreshed, as with its
true natural food. Therefore One, many
Ages past, experienced this, when he
cried out, <hi>Oh, how sweet are thy words
unto my taste, yea, sweeter than hony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my mouth.</hi> The respect that the Most
Holy, and Worthy Ones will have for
this Living Testimony, will be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a disrespect and a real disgust to
whatever, is not given out from a fresh
annointing. For the Right-born Spirit
trieth all by its tast; it can know old
stores that has not that juicie Life and
vigour in it: like Fruits that have been
long plucked off from the Tree, or like
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29870:184"/>
a Flower that hath lost its true Life-scent,
by being cut off from the springing Root;
and so both Fruits and Flowers, though
once fresh and good in their proper time,
yet when laid up, and their moisture gone,
and dried up, are no longer so. And this
is well known and discerned by such a
Spirit, as has liberty to go into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
and Garden of God to pluck fresh,
and gather according to present spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And although there has been a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon an old Store laid up, yet
know it is not to be so always. The
seven years Famine of the Pretious Word,
and Ministry of the Spirit is come to an
end with some already. Who have made
use of it for those ends designed: which
was to sow their ground with it, and
that by the hand of the true Seedsman,
the Spirit, who hath made choice of
good and well-prepared ground to cast
in that, which will, bring up a fresh
Crop of Spiritual Plants, and so still.
As it was in an inward Idea shewn me,
A Field of Corn, when ripe, it sheds it
self into the same ground, out of which
it sprang, and so renews Food again:
Even so the Eternal Grain of the Living
Word sowes it self, and thereby we have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29870:184"/>
it fresh in all its springing variety. Now
who once have a Seed of a right kind,
and a Ground or Holy refined Mould,
choicely separated from all vile and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mixtures, they may promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such a wonderful rich encrease, as
thereof not only to feed the Mouths of
their own hunger, but may furnish
others with this Life-bread, which
springeth out from this Celestial Grain.
Which will not come up barely as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into the pure soil, but it will be
still shooting up and altering it self till
the gross Body of it be changed into a
more excellent property: even so the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Grain sown in good Ground will
not come up bare Grain, but it will
bring up with it the Stalk of Plenty and
Fruitfulness with it self, even the one
Stalk with sevenears; which number sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the seven Spirits before the
Throne, in which subfists Perfection.</p>

               <p>I saw in the Night Vision, a Measuring

Over which some were designed for
to pass, and were commanded to follow
this Child, clothed in white Linnen, in
a swiming posture without fear. For
there would be no danger, so long as
the Child, with the Measuring Line, went
before us, as our Guide. Then answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Spirit, I am not skilful to swim
over such deep Waters, as these are, and
how may we trust our selves with one,
that seemeth to be of so little stature as
that of a Child? Then when I came to
consider of the Vision, I was made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the meaning of it: Why a Child
must be the Guide and Leader of such,
as were to swim from one measuring deep
to another; till they had reached to stand
upon the Rock, where the everlasting
hidden Power was. Then said the Word,
know thou herefrom, that it pleaseth the
Ancient of days to take up the form of
a Child, to shew there must be all Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29870:185"/>

God will fill such with a Spirit unmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and make them skilful Guides to
launch the Ocean deep, to fathom the
secrets of the Immense Treasury: None
can be Swimmers here, but such as little
are, who are come back to a Child-state.
All that are within this Compass of the
Measuring Line, are ruled to search out,
what its Length shall give forth day by
day. For that Ancient Spirit, which was
said, did move upon the Face of the
Waters to bring forth the first Creation,
doth now move through a Figurative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a Child-like Spirit, to fathom that
Wisdom, Knowledge, and Power, as may
bring forth the New Creation. Which

               <p>This Night I dreamed of a Person, that
was unknown to me, who came, and
put a Piece of Mony in my hand, and said,
go with this, and recover that Estate,
that hath been so long kept out of thy
hand. I was much taken with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Stranger: and as I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how to effect it, I awaked. And
thereupon found my Spirit, in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for Prayer, breathing forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the present sense that was
upon me; and indeed it was a mere
Ghost-like Power that moved me, and
made request freely in me. After this
my Spirit sunk down into a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersement,
with somewhat of a high Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiality:
that I felt as a Covering upon
me, which drowned all my outward
sense. During which time, the Heart
which I had formerly seen as in a flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mold, was now presented with a
Golden Case on it. Which was some
few days past intimated, or called by
the name of a Caul of the Heart. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which I had several matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:29870:186"/>
glansed in upon me, which this
Morning were more clearly made out in
the Divine Magia. This Heart thus
clothed upon, was presented in a wakeful
Vision, as the piece of mony was in my
natural sleep, and I heard this word,
saying, Oh, here is inclosed within this
Heart, that which will fetch back all
those riches of eternal substantiality,
which was forfeited into the hands of
the great Landlord, who is Owner, and
Possessor of Heaven and Earth; and is
relapsed ever since <hi>Adam</hi>'s day. Which
none from his time could ever buy out
the full and perfect Revenue hereof, till
a Marriage Union was entirely made
with this perfect Heart. Which was
thus further amplified by the Spirit, That
the Heart was of it self to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
distinct from the Caul, so figured
out in a fleshly form, as it first did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
unto me. Which signified the gift
of the New-born Heart, for softness rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to take in what Impressions, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
would make upon it. Meekness and
Gentleness being the matter of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
its Element which it liveth
in, is the Water of Life: from whence the
Pulse thereof doth beat and work. It
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29870:187"/>
swims in its fire-spark of Life in <hi>Shiloh</hi>
Streams of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is suckled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> meek Water of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline
Purity. Which rendereth it meet
for to be the Eternal Virgin, that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
again in Mother <hi>Eves</hi> place. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the Root of the first Created
Matter, being left in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Line, and
Posterity: which, in some, who are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
in the Love-decree, will have it
awakened, and thereby obtain it through
strong Attraction, which can never
cease working through internal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Which indeed proceedeth from
the Fountain-Heart of Jesus, that now
stands in the room of the degenerated
<hi>Adam.</hi> Who by dividing from the Heart
of God, had lost his spiritual force and
might for communication of Goodness
to his Off spring. So that there must of
necessity be found another way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
to feed and supply the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hunger, which is very mystically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
in. None can any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
discern, but such as are centered in
the very Life-vein of the Holy Trinity:
from whence the true feeling and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is known. The Talent that Christ
makes mention of is thus to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29870:187"/>
A spark of Celestial Life is to be
found in the Embers of Naturality in us:
which being sought out, and found, and
separated from what would have extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
it, then becomes desirous of
an Inkindling. For if it abides alone, it
will die: therefore it would attract a
help for to maintain its Life, which is
only to be had from the pure Altar-coal.
Which must alone feed and increase this
Spirit of Fire-life, which mutually co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
in order to the great design of
a Christ-like Perfection, which fallen
man is to be raised again to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of. Now this word with great
Power was spoke unto me: Be ye, whose
Sparks of Fire are added to your Persons,
by the inspiring breath of Al-mightiness,
still so industrious as to recruit, and
gather in, what hath been (even before
you were visibly existing) unadvisedly
run out, and lost of this weighty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Which I, the Spirit of Jesus, am
come to tell you is yet recoverable: as
you do stick and cleave to me in that
all-furnished Heart of most purified Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
Then I your Golden Case, as a
defence will be, to secure your springing
Treasure within that Heart-excellency,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29870:188"/>
which will advance you to a much more
higher state than that of the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s
degree. Oh, how will it make for the
Praise of the Head-Power, and Prince of
this New Creation to rake out of the
dark Embers of Terrestriality, such spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Diadems of Glory? Therefore ye
holy Ones, this is well worthy of your
persuit. For what a dignity will it be for
you, not only to recover in, what your
first Father <hi>Adam</hi> lost, but to come into
an Augmentation in a Spiritual State?
And as you are now sunk down so many
degrees below the Paradisical Life, to
your shame and great debasement: So
by virtue of this renewed Heart, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Golden Caul as its Habitation,
ye shall rise seven Steps beyond whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
your Predecessors knew in Paradise.
For had they stood, but in this Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Hearts Unity, they should have
known greater tranquillity in a God-al-sufficiency,
and would have been more
satisfied in an open Vision of Glory. Oh,
my Lord, thou bringest wonderful things
to Light: and hast added hereby a new
Life to our Hopes; therefore we will be
encouraged, onward to proceed, this
perfect Heart for to attain. Which is
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:29870:188"/>
to be separated from all Hearts, that are
centered in the gross sensuality: and
which are circled about with the Gall of
bitter Enmity unto thy Nature; which
is all Gentle Meekness, and Seraphick
Purity.</p>

with some other Idea's: Three distinct
Hearts. The one was a dark stony Heart,
it looked like a piece of Flesh, that was
dead and rotten; upon which did fasten
many grievous Serpents, that fed upon
the flesh thereof. Then I saw another
Heart, that had all the pleasant aspects
of a Face, with Wings fastned by the
Ears: wherewith it did fly away from
the dismal Heart, up to another Heart,
that was fixed in a bright Orb; it being
all in Charity, sending forth streams like
Gold to relieve the other Heart, which
did fly unto it. And it was said in my
hearing, These are the Streams that shall
for ever make glad thy Heart: because
thou hast from the Vile Heart fled away.

in a bright Aetherial Cloud, in

Element, which hath brought all this

What further hast thou to charge me

rowsed up the Accuser like a Lion bold,
and thus wise did speak: Oh thou great

thy R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>deeming Blood, as to release from
this Vile Body, that is obnoxious to all
Maladies, as to Complaints of Penury, and
Distresses? Even whereof, those that are
given to thee, no more be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than the Children of my Kingdom.
Nay, they are necessitated to come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
for succour and supplies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their exteriour part: or else their
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29870:190"/>
very animal life might fail and die. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
thou art indeed to be that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
which careth for thy Sheep: but
they are found stragling, and shifting up
and down, even for their temporary susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
They are apt to crave among
those of my Fold, who do make no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to any thing, which is brought in
by the Spirit of Faith. Such who are of
my Lineage, go upon a more sure way,
prospering by their industry day by day;
they, as the Palm Tree, do flourish, and
spring, through all Toyl, and do wait,
and so become Honourable, and great
in the World. While thine, as poor
Abjects, are the scorn and derision of
all my Kingdoms. Preferments debar'd
from them; they have looked long for
the day of Jubilee, when they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their great Lordships and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
but nothing hereof is yet seen.
Even they, who obtain the greatest
Friendship with the Almighty, nothing
hereof do yet come to know. Where is
now then (if thou a Mighty God and
Saviour art) any thing signal for the
Complainants, that are in distress in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
yet so grosly Corporeal? So that no
distinction is made from mankind in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29870:191"/>
in any visible Power or Dignity.
As to this, my Off-spring do much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
thine. Therefore I need not fear,
but my Kingdom will yet encrease, while
thy little Flock are kept so low, poor,
and needy in this Region. Here ended
the Serpents expostulation with the Lord

               <head type="sub">The Reply of that Bright Spirit against

               <p>O Satan, thy Nature is to vilifie, and
to strike with thy Scorpion Tail against
my Head-soveraignty, pouring out Floods
of Contempt; which do rebound back
to thy self. Now to answer thee in all
particulars of thy Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to thy assuming the Figure
of that Vile Body, which is compacted
all of putrefaction: for this thou dost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
me, that I do it not transform.
Now though I stand not liable to give
any account to thee of my Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
herein; yet for the sakes of them,
who have been hereinto inquiring in fear
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29870:191"/>
and humility, and have heard this thy
severe Charge, I shall Answer. It is then
Objected, As to that ignominious form
of Corporeity, which the Fellow-heirs
with me do bear: upon which a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
hath been expected, that yet
no such thing doth appear, but they do
still expire in all things like others.</p>
               <p>Answer. <hi>There is good cause, why it
hath been so hitherto; because the Fire-spark
of the Deity hath not burnt through
in any, for the consumption of the dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssy
part: meeting still with cold muddy damps,
that have often choaked the Life-flame;
which is cast in from thy ingendring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</hi>
Who, since <hi>Eves</hi> day, art upon
the revenge to slay, and destroy that
which remains of the Heavenly Matter.
Thou hast had thy inrode, as a subtile
Spirit, for to prove and tempt all of her
Race; propounding this as an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ever to see corruptibility made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime.
Thou hast by thy craft thus raced
out that grain of Faith, that should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this White Lilly Body. For my
way of redeeming proceeds from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Heart-center: Thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through Soul and Body in fiery streams.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29870:192"/>
                  <hi>It is a deceit to believe, that I am come
to redeem any other way.</hi> I shed my
Blood to purifie and cleanse the inward
ground; that so the godly Plant of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
might grow thereout, whose
clothing is of unchangeable Glory. For
my own Life wrought it self thus
through: while I was found in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mould, the invisible Perfect thing
could put transparency upon the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Body. So no other way can I
bring any to my own transfiguration, but
by the same inkindling, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
springing up gradually. All of this
kind will be understood, when the
Wheel of the Will stands free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clogged
of all the Serpents suggested in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity

have the Heart-purifying work evaded,
and us to look for Redemption to come,
as a violent shower to wash away the
Vile Body at once; which is contrary
to my working method. Whose inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Operation is to set free that, which
is under great labour and strife, to get
up to a flower of rich scented Glory.
Against which, O Satan, great hath been
thy despight.</p>

                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:29870:192"/>But now as to the Second Charge, <hi>That
my Sheep are put to their shifts: and how
that I suffer them to be exposed to great
necessities, so as to have their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
out of the Store-house of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or else their corporeal Bodies could
not be sustained.</hi> I Answer, It is true,
O Spirit of Subtilty, that mine are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to great sufferings and trials; or
else how could they be conformable to
me their Head? There are also many
considerable Reasons, why for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

of thy Charge will turn against thy

                  <hi>First,</hi> If they were not to be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the universality in the effects
of that Curse, that came upon all <hi>Adam</hi>'s

                     </gap> to a certain number, in securing
them from all of this Worlds Calamity.</hi>
Therefore the Father hath in wisdom
permitted it, that thou mayst have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to accuse the Just One. As in <hi>Ioh</hi>'s
Case, thy envy was great, because he
was perfect, and upright. And being but
in a flourishing state, as to Honour and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29870:193"/>
Riches, and all fulness from this Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
What advantage didst thou take
thereby? Remember that word, <hi>Does</hi>
Job <hi>serve God for naught, is there not a
hedge made up of all plenty and good
things about him?</hi> So then if mine elect
ones were not in common with thine, to
take their lot, thou wouldst have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to glory in: <hi>but now thy mouth must
be stopped,</hi> in that those, who belong to
me are more deeply exercised in all suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
necessities, <hi>as daring to hunt after
nothing of this Worldly Pomp.</hi> Whose
Eyes see through all these contemptible
things: And as they live in me, they
are in-seeing into another manner of
Sphere, wherein their Portion is. <hi>Yet
know, they shall lose nothing by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humbled,</hi> through manifold distresses,
and penury, while they are in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
submission, and have hereby accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the chastisement, that is due to their
lapsed state. All of which kind shall so
operate, as to work out their freedom,
when I have proved them by all the evil
consequences of the Curse; so as that I
may say, they have been tried through
all Fires. Fo so it doth become mine all
for to be, as weighty stones of Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:29870:193"/>Then was this Discourse maintained
in my hearing: my Lord still taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to resolve my doubts, and satisfie
my queries. This Word was uttered,
But what thinkest thou, O proud Prince
of this exterior World, who so many
Ages hast by thy Agents lorded it over
my Heritage; If that thy time is near
upon expiring? In that I shall call thee
to an account, who hast abused thy
Soveraignty. For all who have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
by thee, have been cruel in their
Arbitrary Government. So that Injustice,
Oppression, Pride, Self-love, and Vain
Glory have born the sway to this day.
Therefore it is no marvel, that those who
are as the Pearl in my Eye, have been
in such distresses; and oft-times forced
to gather up the scraps, which thy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Brood do let fall from their
rich furnished Tables. This hath been
long permitted, but now <hi>I am come to
tell thee, that thy Lease of Years is near
worn out, when thou must give up to me
the Kingdoms of this World. Who will
seek out such, as shall be after my own
Heart; that shall raign over thee, and
thy Hierarchy on this very Earth. Know
such I have this very day in my Eye.</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:29870:194"/>
Who are Meek, Patient, and Lowly,
and who have been proved <hi>Iob</hi> like, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the loss of all, that pleasurable
has been as to this Worlds esteem. These
have stood against all thy malice, and
envy, which hath been poured out by
Instruments so assumed by thee. These
are those to whom the Dominion shall
first come, and so by degrees run through,
till this World shall be no more thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For the Kingdoms of this World
shall be given to the Saints of the Most
High. Then thou and all thy sin-loyal
subjects shall be ashamed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
gnashing their Teeth, when they
shall see thee put out of all power and
authority. And those who have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lamb faithfully through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Patience and Tribulation, shall
be thus rewarded with Crowns each one,
as from the annointing Power, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>This Vision was shewn me. I with
another Person was ascending up towards
a Mount, which was all green: and we
were discoursing, if we could come up
there, how we should then have escaped,
what we saw cause to fear. For I did see
many Vipers lie in our way; and one
did seem to fasten upon the Heel of my
Fellow-traveller; which I set my Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on, and so escaped from it. And as we
passing still on, after some space of time,
there fell a Dark Mist, so dismal as we
could not see each other: which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rerrible to me, for we had lost each
other; but I saw it dissipated, and the
lost found again.</p>
               <p>Upon this was opened unto me, in
what danger we were. And it was said,
Pray; for there is Cloud of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that hath already essaid, that the
work might be retarded. Moreover this
word was with me, Rise, <hi>O Abigail,</hi> with

               <head>August the 18th. 1677.</head>
               <p>After this I had a word followed me:
crying still in me, <hi>Turn not out of the
way of the Spirit.</hi> Which the Morning
before was in the Scripture Phrase given
to me, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, or else it will
little avail you, to have transient visits
from the Spirit, only to give councel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
if it be not in every jot and tittle
obeyed.</hi> For <hi>walking</hi> implies that prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.
Then was it shewed to me, where,
and what were the Walks of the Spirit.
First they were walks very high and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
and private. <hi>The Region or Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
was so pure, that no gross earthly
Spirit could have any consistency with it.</hi>
Then it was said again to me, that such
Spirits could only live here, that had
their first inkindled breath from this pure Element.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29870:195"/>
And such as are born again out hence, <hi>can
well agree with no other Air.</hi> These
pleasant walks of the Spirit, are all very
lofty: and those, who stand in the low
bottom of this Principle, cannot see into
that pure Sphere, nor yet be walkers
there. For they are among pure Spirits,
all of one sort, such as <hi>Ioshua</hi> was to have
the priviledge to walk amongst. If he
would walk in the ways of the Most
Holy, and keep his charge, and abide in
the Inward Court; The Angel protested,
he would give him walks among those
who stand by the Lord. Which was no
small preeminence, thus to be among the
Triune Society. Even so it was to me
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estified, That if we would but keep
within the circle-walks of the Spirit, we
should be conversant with the Trinity.
And hereby it was said, we should escape
the hurtful influences of those, who
walk and live after the fleshly Birth. <hi>For
what we are conversant withal, such we
are:</hi> For <hi>whether Spiritual or Carnal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to either, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> its impression
readily.</hi> Therefore this word came ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<hi>Know and keep Company with your
Bridegroom's Spirit: That will bring you
into high and worthy acquaintance indeed.</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:29870:196"/>
Now then consider, ye stand now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two Cross-ways: the one is on the
Right-hand, the other on the Left; the
one ascends, the other descends into this
Worlds deep. Now <hi>there are those, who
would keep their walks in both these ways;
sometimes they would be soaring up to
God's Holy Mount, then descending into
the Foxes holds, and dens,</hi> where all
unclean Spirits are. And such as are of
<hi>this sort will never make any riddance up
to the Mount of Glory.</hi> Therefore this
word of Loves advice I give, saith he,
that is the way of Truth, to you who
are called out of the Worlds walks;
That you stedily keep your Eye, where
the Spirit doth make his Tract for you;
and that you do keep on your daily
pace. Follow still the Measuring Line,
that doth ascend strait upward. For
there is no admittance herefrom to turn
aside, because great loss will be sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
To go backwards and forwards can
produce nothing but wo and ill; For <hi>no
progress can any such make in this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
State.</hi> And as these walks are
high, so they are very private, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
No evil Eye can espy the Roads
of the Spirit. What of gross Corporeity
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29870:196"/>
can pierce into this bright burning Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the pure in heart walk? A
strong enclosure here is, so as no Beast
of Prey can break in to disturb the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacements
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rene Souls, that have got
in here: they are secured by Cherubims,
who hold out for their Guards Flaming
Spheres, that so they may rest void of
fear. Then as to the pleasantness of
Walks, they are all smooth and plain.
A sound bottom they tread upon, being
all paved with solid Gold; which is so
transparent, that its very reflexion gives
light to walk by. Then again of each
side, such Plants do grow, as are known
by Name: They be most odoriferous,
sending out such sweet perfumes, each
Flower spinging out of the Spirits Root;
such as Joy, Peace, Love, Meekness, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness,
and Faith, with all tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionateness,
encreasing to all perfect
Good. <hi>You may easily know, when you
are in the right Walks, by these spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fruits on either hand of you:</hi> and
by the high Throne Powers here greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you with fresh and new discoveries
of their Kingdoms Secrets. <hi>None that
have walked here, can ever more desire to
turn aside, because they can see, taste, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:29870:197"/>
feel (in their degree) what the very Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
can make them blessed in, from what
they possess in themselves, as immense Ioys</hi>
that are unknown: of which some daily
droppings ye will still meet with. For as
ye do abide in the Spirits habitation,
Worthy things ye may expect, which
your Father doth secretly keep in his own
Breast, as ye are made meet for them.
To which end I will open a burning
Spring within you: which through a soft
breath of Celestial Air, shall maintain
heavenly clarity. Then will your God
walk absolutely with you, and will be
henceforth no stranger to your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>But then watch to it, that when he
come, he may find you waiting there,</hi>
within that pure and all-indurable burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sphere: sucking and drawing still in
the fresh gusts of Endless Love, which
may work up to a refining Element.
Whereby Paradise that hath fled away
from this Principle, may now again bud
forth, and recover you out of the Curse.
This is the very way hereunto; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saith the Just One, take all heed to
keep in the Spirits Walks, as you would
see that renewed state of Liberty, yet
once again revealed in you.</p>

               <p>There appeared to me two Trees, the
one in a Field, the other grew under the
shadow of a mighty Tree, as in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
place, with a Wall about it, that
was all set for Fruit: the other was all
blossomed, but on a sudden a shaking
Wind came, and blasted the whole Tree,
while I was viewing it. Then it was
cried in my hearing, Transplant this Tree,
or else never to Perfection will any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
come answerable to that Tree. Let it be
fixed under the warm shade of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Tree for fruitfulness. From this
presentation I was given to understand
somewhat, that answered to that matter
of doubt, which was often raised in me,
what was the Reason, that such a fair
progress should be made of growth, in
this Tree richly flowred from the very
Life-sap with beauteous appearances.
Which in way of similitude answers to the
state of a Soul, that hath the Life-root
in her; but its plantation being out of
the warm shelter, standing bleak, and
open to the sharp blasts, on every side
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29870:198"/>
cold storms beating upon it, cuts off the
tender Blossom, which would come to
substantial Fruit. This was shewn me
to be the very cause, why so many
holy good Trees of Righteousness, could
not reach to the full grown Fruit, but
withered off in the very prime of their
spring. For by fruitfulness here, I was
given to understand something above,
and beyond a pure and lively Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and a shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing forth in those
known Ornaments of Love, Joy, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Patience. These I may call
the sweet scented Blossoms; <hi>here many one
stops, and goes no further on:</hi> but sheds
them abroad. And then by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life commixing with the cold sharp
Element of this visible Region, <hi>are they
generally cut off, before any such high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of all-fruitful Power is got up unto.</hi>
As was expressed in former Ages, when
their Fruit was apparent from the root
of God's Almightiness. <hi>Our Lord means
this fruitful Birth of Power, when he
telleth them of the absolute necessity of
their abiding in him, as the Branch upon a
Tree.</hi> As much as if he had said, ye
can do no mighty works, till you come
to be brought under me, as that out-spreading
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29870:198"/>
Tree of Life. If so, as he told
his Disciples, ye abide in me, and
my words abide in you, then ask what
ye will, and it shall be done. From
hence it may be truly inferred, that
the eminent fruitfulness, which God
the Father may come to be glorified in,
consists in a large and full ability to do
and act such things, as Christ himself
did in his assumed humanity, who was
a Tree of all kind of Fruitfulness. Now
by this Vision, it was also thus given
me to know, that the Tree, which did
stand in the wild field of Nature with a
Fence, did well signifie the true Life-off-spring
of the Most Holy, who might
proceed to such a degree. But while
walking in the open bare Principle of
this World, where storms of all kind
of Temptations would set on it, it is
altogether improbable that any such
could come to any ripe powerful fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
Therefore the Voice did cry
from the upper Spheres in Loves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
for a Transplantation to be

               <p>I have great Soul-wrestlings about a
restraint from the Broad Walks of the
World. The former part of the Night
I spent thus, being made sensible of the
divine pleasurableness of keeping to the
Narrow Track of the Spirit. I was then
greatly thoughtful, how we that were,
as in the midst of a thicket of wild
thorny Bria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, should pass out as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
to get into that privacy of
walking with God, according to the late
words of Councel received from the
Spirit; which word followed me still.
In the midst of these solicitations that
sprung in me, I was overset with a drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
upon my animal sense. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
I saw my own Person with
another, got up a good height upon a
mighty Bank, where some stragling
Houses were; and we were minding to
do and act some petty matters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
in them. Of a sudden I looked
down, and beheld a Sea at the bottom
floating; and a Voice cried, <hi>Hast way,
for here is no stay. This Bank with all
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:29870:200"/>
its Buildings will be overflown, when the
Sea breaks in.</hi> With that I was afraid,
and called to my Friend with me to
draw up higher, for here was no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for us, the danger was so imminent.
Then was shewn to us, through some
degrees of ascent, a place all plain, of
each side railed: in into which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to make our way with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But the ground being parched,
and bare, and slippery, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to stay each other by the hand;
till we came to that pleasant Walk, which
was so secured, as before was mentioned,
where we were without fear. Then
were we in another Region, all encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with a bright Element with two
Globes, all with spangling Sparks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them: Which was a Vision so Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as could not well have been born,
if the bodily senses had not been sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
that so the Spirit might actuate
free in its own Specie. Whereby it
may positively be concluded, that the
activity of the corporeal faculties are a
great impediment to Divine Vision.
Therefore taught I am, whenever I
would attain any thing of this kind, that
then I must be slain to the exteriour
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29870:200"/>
imaginariness: and that an absolute death
is very meet in this case. For there by
the Spirit of the Mind is made free to
slide down into its own Abyss, from
whence it was, before it came into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <p>This Night I heard a Voice cry within
me, <hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega: <hi>this is the
Name by which I will be known unto thee.</hi>
Which sound awaked me, and thereby
quickned up all the internal Powers of
my Mind to attend the meaning hereof.
Which, as from a Spring, thus opened,
That to know the Lord Christ by this
Name, would be of a very considerable
advantage to us upon several accounts.
For consider, what this Name carries
and bears on it: signifying everlasting
Power, Strength, and Fortitude. I am,
saith he, not only to be known in my
Weak, Ignominious, Suffering, Dying
Name, but in my Living, All-powerful
Name; especially to them, who are now
to be raised up by me, to this state of
Celestial Dignity, as to be anointed Kings
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29870:201"/>
and Priests to reign upon the Earth: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was necessary at the first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and work of regeneration, that I
should be known to you by my Name
Jesus, for conformity to my death. There
is an appointed time for this also, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which ye have witnessed; for if
my Suffering, Dying, and Bleeding Name
had not first past through you to cleanse
you from sin, and thereby to obliterate
the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s Name, ye could never
have been capable of this new Name.
Therefore I your Lord am not ashamed
to say, I am he that was once dead, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
out of that corporeal weakness, that
thereby I might recover my own ancient
Name, which I had with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World was. Even so know
that it was expedient, that you should
know me, as in Union with me in this
Name, though in Death, Dishonour, and
Contempt; yet not still here are you to
abide. For I am come to appear to you
in that rising, glorified Name, that was
from everlasting, which death could not
cut off from me. It was only shut up
in the immense Deity, till the Death for
sins cause was finished. Which verily
being victoriously overcome, behold I
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29870:201"/>
have put on that wonderful Name;
That Secret hath been hid ever since the
Creation in its lapsed state: but hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
I will manifest, and open this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Name unto them, who have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into my dying Name, as a
foregoing preparation thereunto. To
such I will proclaim my Name <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega,</hi> wherein is Love, Grace, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Goodness, Peace, and Joy from
first to last. Then again they shall
know further Strength, Power, Victory,
Salvation and Dominion through being
baptized into this Name, which will be
the effectual sprinkling with Life-power
from the dead.</p>

               <p>Then was figured out the Morning
following, somewhat that looked clear
as Glass, or Water coagulated like Ice,
which was of a dissolving matter, yet
formed as into a square stone; with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Gold upon it; and it was held
out by a Hand breaking through a white
Cloud. And this word came with it,
<hi>Take eat this down, ye who have been
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:29870:202"/>
made to drink into the Lamb's dying
Name: Whose right it is to take hereof,
that it may mightly operate in you.</hi> Then
said I, ah Lord, who can eat down,
what is so hard congealed, this seems
improper to be? This was answered from
that Scripture, of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s taking the Book
out of the Angels hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. and
was commanded to eat it down. Then
was that Scripture repeated also <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
Except ye eat my Flesh, and drink my
Blood, ye cannot have Life by me; then
was I convinced of the necessity thereof.
For it was said, that this was the very
White Stone, that had that New Name,
which was <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> engraven
upon it. The Properties of which was
not sufficient to be only revealed, and
proclaimed to the understanding; for it
would slide away therefrom again. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it enough for to taste only by one
transient Vision hereof, but let it be thy
daily meat. For this Stone, though it
appeared rocky and clear, yet to the
Heart-mouth, it will be all candy and
sweet, dissolving it self as it emptieth it
self. Oh, then this did further arise
from the anointed Name, which had
poured in of its virtue, in which I did
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:29870:202"/>
feel afresh, at the present time of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hereof, that I might hereunto set
my Seal of the rich effusion which did
come hereout. Who can best describe
the Properties of this Name, but such
who feelingly feel the Virtue of it, who
according to the measures that it hath
opened it self, so may they declare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
As <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> when examined
by the Rulers, by what Power they had
made the Lame-man to walk, It was
boldly affirmed by <hi>Peter,</hi> that it was by
this Name Jesus, which is changed now
into the Name of Soveraignty and Power,
by which they acted forth. Had not
this Name been poured in, and they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it, then none of these worthy
deeds could have been done by the
Apostles. But it was evident, that this
Name of Strength and All-healing Power
was with them; and their very Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
were confounded at it. So ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
this mighty Name is rising again,
for very much of it did open it self, as
to the preparative quality, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
Miraculous Workings visibly upon
others. For this word was given to me,
saying, This my Name shall burn, as an
Oven within, till there be no more
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29870:203"/>
matter for the Evil One to work upon;
that so the Proverb may cease, Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
heal thy self. Or pluck, out the Mote
or Beam out of thy own Eye first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou undertakest for another. For
now consider, that to act and work, and
to do all in my Name uncontrollably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to power and might, it is very
necessary: that so ye by a celestial tie of
a powerful Engine, may absolutely
turn the whole course of the active Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which is so prone to promote, and
give all its force to strengthen the man
of sin and his Kingdom. Now here
the effects of my Name shed in will
first be seen: you shall know it not only
by taste, but witness it, running through
in every Intellectual Part, as burning
Gold healing and purifying. This will be
the first wonderful projection of this
White Stone within. Then further it will
proceed, ye need not make any doubt,
take only this my Councel, and follow:
what hath been revealed to thee. Let
not thy hand slack herefrom, though
there should be none to bear them up,
but the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega:</hi> who is without
shadow of change, and he is alive to bring
the Kingdom yet about. Verily, there
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29870:203"/>
is nothing, which the Prince of this
World doth so much dread and fear, as to
lose his Seat and Place: so that he can
have no more inrodes within, by awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
any evil essence there; my Name,
as Moulten Gold, burning him out of
the internal part as often. By my Spirit,
said the Holy One, this Principal thing
has been pressed in divers ways of Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and set before you variously in
Similitudes. All which is to provoke you
to follow on jointly; that so this my
Name might be as one in you, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
thereinto; without giving way
to what may be suggested from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for scattering, still to keep off that
great blessing, which you may obtain in
praying from this sweet Name Jesus, now
changed into <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega:</hi> whereby
the Kingdom will come into you i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Power, through this glorified Name run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as Golden Oyntment, in you and
through you. Then know, that the
Kingdoms of this World are become his,
who hath proclaimed this mighty Name,
and hath poured of it into you. By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of which they verily shall become
yours: and thereby ye will despoil the
great prerogatives of the now present

Reign of the Serpent, and the Beast in
this visible World.</p>

               <p>I heard this Word this Morning, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and praise worthy indeed shall such
be, who make the first battery upon his
strong Holds and Territories; so as to
lay them waste in this terrestrial state.
Then this word was further given me.
Oh, the Sinless state will do it. Then
there were in way of Vision, several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as written upon, to my view; and
a Voice spake, Get them signed with this
wonderful Name, and then you may
have what you will granted by him who

answered to a word which sometime I
had before, of getting Bills of Faith
subscribed to. Then was further open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me the great freedom and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that we might have, by Entring our
selves into this Name: or rather by its
entring into us, for the dispersing all its
Powers. Oh, what singular advantage

to it. Christ told his Disciples,
that hitherto they had asked nothing in
his Name. Verily the same may be said
of us: We have often pronounced this
Name literally; but that hath been little
available. But we have not so asked, as to
breath forth all pure flames from this
Name, without any of the old Name
mingling with it; for if so, then immediate
effects would follow. For if at any time
all pure Inspiration did open from this
Name, what is there to be named, that
we might not be able to work and do,

               <p>This Night, somewhat before break
of Day, I did verily believe there lay
one by me in the Bed. At which I was
put into some fear: but then it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Figure of my deceased
Husband. Who discoursed many things
to me, challenging Conjugal Love, and
the renewing of that old affinity, which
was betwixt us, with manifold circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
thereupon attending. At which,
at first, I was somewhat disturbed; but
I took courage, and discoursed with
him, and told him, I fear'd to have Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with any inferiour Spirit, till they
had got up to the highest perfection;
and asked him several questions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, he seemed to be silent,
and could not give me satisfaction, as
to his being in that full growing state,
for the compleatment of this glorification.
But still I beheld him magically hovering
about me, and he asked me for a Bible.
While, I thought, that he was now above
that way of knowing God, which I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
much, that he might now know, as
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:29870:206"/>
he was known: but he gave me no answer
thereto. Then he proved me with some
small Pence, which seemed to be like
Gold: which I set light by, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; as not understanding wherein
they could be of service to me, aiming
at greater things from Wisdoms Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
After I had said, that since his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
I had made choice of an unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
Mate: for whom I must now be,
and for no other, but as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
in his glorified Body; where I
should rejoyce to know him, and to
meet him. Upon which he disappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And then coming to my exteriour
sense, I understood in what a Magia
Trance I had been. After which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four a Clock, I found my self all
inspired for Prayer; that I might learn
to understand what the Divine Will was
hereby. And as I was considering in my
Mind of that departed Spirit, that appeared
magically unto me; This morning it was
spoken to me thus, I have now proved
thee, whether thou wouldst be for me,
and for no other Spirit inferior to me,
who am the Lord, thy Redeemer, that
hath given and shed my saving Name
into thee. Which is a considerable earnest
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:29870:207"/>
of what I further intend, as thou abidest
in Nazarite Chastity, knowing no Spirit,
more but what can mate it self with me, in
high Celestial Unity. Therefore hereunto
watch, that at no time supplanted thou be,
of what is designed by holding out in
loyalty upon every account. For I should
not take it well, that you should run
into any one, if distinct from me, though
an Angel, whose Habitation may be in a
more high and heavenly Sphere. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a check for this was given to the
beloved <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose heart was apt to
run into the Angel, that shewed him the
great Visions: therefore was he bid to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, and to keep nothing less in his
Eye, than the Supream Deity, albeit that
it is in a glorified humanity.</p>
               <p>From hence I took occasion, for to
make this Objection to my Lord, If thus
We must be, dear Immanuel, allotted for
thee alone, Why is it then, that thou
with thy all-taking Humanity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality
will not dwell with us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
as to be a covering to our Eye,
and a perpetual attraction to our Minds.
For through absence of thee, we often
find, that temptation gets ground; for
verily all our Spirits are for mutual asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation:
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29870:207"/>
therefore when thou dost retire
from us, we are then apt to fall in with
somewhat that is near unto us. For
thou thy self knowest, that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
of such working, stirring Esse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that must spend themselves, either
upon what is essentially good or evil; as
either of these have greatest affinity with,
and dominion over the Mind. And if
through a superior light, we swerve and
turn aside from all that is grosly earthly,
and that is of known sin; yet here we
may be nevertheless at a disappointment
of that express and actual conversation
with Thee, as thou art now a transfigured
Corporeity. So as great is our present
disadvantage hereby, Oh Lord Jesus.</p>

after which you do make. I will
be yours, as you are mine, and free from
all others. No cause of jealousie shall be
ministred on my part; for as a sealing

plunge; not knowing how to take it out
without a Guide. And so likely we might
spend, and run out our whole time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had attained half thereof; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
learning, and yet not perfected.
Therefore while I was in this demur, a
word came to me, This skill must spring
from that New Birth within. Yet it is
in vain, for any, by imitation, ever to
attempt the Christ-like Life, till they be
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:29870:209"/>
born again. As that grows up to the
degree of Divine Capacity, so it will be
all perceiving: and will aptly find out
the Mystery of a God's likeness, though
incarnate in this terrestrial State. Where
Precepts and Patterns of Evil are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
inviting; so that ye are in danger
of taking a wrong Pattern out. But this
pure Birth in you will prevent that: for
it scents all, what is of this Principle, as
a putrefactious life; and therefore flies
from it to its own express incorruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
For which will proceed Gifts, and
Powers, answerably to what your Head
Pattern here acted marvelously. <hi>Look to
it, for the Root of this Matter must rise
from within your own inward holy ground.
Call up the Ghostly Power of Might, that
lieth hidden there, and then ye may be
able to produce the same wonderful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
piece, according to the form of the
New Creation, which must bear down,
and outdo all, which came in by the fall.</hi>
Then was it further given me to know,
that there would be a trial and probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of what ever was wrought: it
must be brought to the view of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judge; whose rejoycing it will
be to pass the Sentence of Justification,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:29870:210"/>
found in the imitation both of the Death
and Life, from the Birth Spirit which
was in Jesus, <hi>and is now entred into us,
to bring forth the same express Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
in all glorious variety; as in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so in the rising, conquering, reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life: Which is not to be manifested
barely by Words, but by mighty Deeds,
and Works, from the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi>
Whose day of Love, Light, Peace, and
Joy, is already working, known, and
felt in the New Born.</p>

               <head>August the 29th. 1677.</head>
               <p>This Night I saw my self making hard
towards a place, wherein I was assured
of all desirable good, as relating to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and Place. And as I was striving
to reach thereto, there came a stubborn
prancing Horse in a Cart, and there was
one went by to guide him; but the Horse
was so headstrong, that he would no
way be governed, but would run in a
hostile way towards the Gate, that gave
entrance into this secure place. Seeing
which, I ran with all might and hast, lest
I should be stopped; and just as I was
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:29870:210"/>
entring in at the passage, he came furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
upon me to grind me with the
Wheels. So that I was put to it hard,
but I passed through to great admiration,
as if I only had a Spirit without a Body:
so swift was my escape out of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
For I saw it a perfect design to
have prevented my going in; then took
I care of the well minded Person, that
would have otherwise ruled this head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
Beast, if he could have managed
him; but such was his inkindled rage,
that he would stand cross the Gate to
hinder him, that was to be his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
from following after me. But he
wisely crept upon his Knees under the
Cart, and so got in, and shut the Gate
upon this tyrannical Beast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Vision had a considerable speaking
in it unto us, when we cannot but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
there is a foreseeing watchful Eye,
that does warn us of all evil occurrences,
that may ensue, while yet we are but in
our travelling way. True it is, we are
running hard to enter within the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Gate: but much lumber and stuff
there is which hath loaded the Cart of
the Mind, which is drawn by the prancing
Horse of the Will; that doth drive furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29870:211"/>
and will not be under check or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
by that which doth see its danger.</hi>
This Principle with all its cares, busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and employs are dangerous to step
in, as a grinding Wheel, to prevent our
passing into that pleasant place: Where
not any of those Inhabitants are found
in any working dress. For they lived
there by a Creating Breath, that renews
all fresh supplies. There needed neither
Building, nor Planting, nor Vine-dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
nor Seed-sowers: for it was uttered
by voice to me, that passed through me,
This is the place of <hi>Iehovah</hi>'s rest. Who
so can get through hereinto, shall have
cessation from all their works; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they relate either to the Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour,
taking thought or concern about
its Salvation: or to the Body exteriour, for
Food and Raiment, Health, or whatever
else makes the Life worth living in: it is
to be here. But then my Spirit object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Ah, my Lord, who ever could pass
in here, while on this side of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
death? Happily some there be, who
in Purity and Faith, having finished their
terrestrial Life here, after their bodily
dissolution, may (unknown to us Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this working restless World)
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29870:211"/>
enter in there. But no President we
have of any that could ever pass, but
through that known universal death of
the Corporeal Body. For that would be
a great and marvellous thing, beyond
ever what was yet heard of; that ever
any went in and out amongst us, that
could give an account of passing out,
from us into that Paradisical Sphere: it
being shut up, ever since <hi>Adam</hi>'s turning
out; therefore in this present time we
must not look for it. For this weighty
matter of doubt, I besought the Lord
earnestly for a resolve in, whether or no
such a Translation might be hoped for,
and believed in, before death was tasted
of? My Spirit did very watchfully wait
for an Answer hereupon: which after
some time was thus given to me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
and from the Word of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was uttered. True it is, Oh Soul,
that none hath entred these Gates in a
mortal shape: neither can any, more than
a Camel can pass through the Eye of a
Needle: unclothed ye must be of sins
body, the gross bulk thereof cannot pass
in. And though ye have been Let hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by this full fraughted Principle, yet
possibly ye may grow so wise and subtile,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:29870:212"/>
as to pass through, by the virtue of that
pure leavening Name. Which like Oyl of
Gold will all overflame you, and so turn
Gross Earthly Matter into an Aetherial
Spiritual Body: for none but such can
come to be so near the Trinity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it the death of the outward Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that can fit it hereunto; for if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
body of sin be not as well put off,
as the outward, it will avail little, as to
thy entrance into this Supernal City.
Therefore now, if in the throng of all
present Temptations, ye can but get the
conquest, then this blessed change will
be from a Terrestrial Glory to a Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
What though this hath not been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced,
neither before, or since the
Lord's appearing in fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, let not that
sink down your hearts into discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>For there is such a Fire-stone to
burn, that now is kindled: that will effect
greater things, than yet ever have been.
Therefore stretch out the Neck of your
Faith right forward hereunto; for the
fearful, doubtful, and impure will be shut
out of all hope of entring here.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said the Just One, <hi>Faith in God
will remove this laded Cart: which did
appear to stand in your way</hi> The fury
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:29870:212"/>
of the Beast and Dragon also are very
great against you, animating such as are
nearest unto you, and of dearest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to stop your way: But be ye both
advised, by watching all opportunities,
through Patience, Wisdom, and Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, to keep on your way. <hi>For
by the creeping through is signified great
Humility: by which the Serpents subtilty may
be supplanted. Let this then now stir up
all care and watchfulness; for ye will be
put oft-times (while ye are in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
to great distress, but keep the blessed
issue always in your Eye, and that will
renew strength continually. For all of
this high concern must be effected through
immutability, pressing hard; though the
Wheel of this oppressive Principle threatens
to grind you. Yet be constant and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
unto the end, and ye will receive
the Crown of Life.</hi>

               <head>August the 31th. 1677.</head>
               <p>I saw multitudes of People this Night
presented to me of several Habits, and
Languages, all in business and traffick:
saving a few that were together gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of these. Who were in a cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from all matters of entanglement, in
a waiting, interceding posture. Of whom
it was said, That these few should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a strong Nation, and rise up to
take the Prey from the strong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For if there were not some allotted
only for the Sanctuary Attendance, in a
Consecrated Spirit of anointing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the immense Glory, nothing
of the Mind of the Most High would
come to be known in their days. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
it was shewn me, that by those
Multitudes, which were of all sorts
and kinds in their several employes,
that run on in the concerns of those
are petty things, and satisfied with
such mean atchievements as this Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
affords; it hath been permitted,
that they should arrive to no greater,
than visible things: and That only, by
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29870:213"/>
continued exercise both of Minds and
Hands. But now by that other sort,
which I did see do nothing, but stood
waiting in a silent posture, as if they
had departed from the whole universe
of their Fellow-creatures, <hi>These united
ones were to break open a fast enclosed
Center; where the natural freedom, and
commanding Power of Paradise lieth.
These all are by pure severation, not only
from the mixed Congregation of the wilder
sort, but from those, who were as Cakes
baked but of one side, who were not
throughly leavened with the Altar-fire,
themselves also to divide.</hi> For the Word
thus spake: Such who are all of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
mould, who do seek nothing else,
but the plucking down of the man of
sin from his great Seat, which he hath
gotten in the World; and this must be
done by sequestring from the confused
noise of all, what may promote here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
For to some it will be given thus
closely to set to the work. Or else what
can be brought to effect of the primary
state for to regain the antient Liberty,
and sinless Innocency; with higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of what is now the superadded state.
Which will ask the whole Age of man's
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29870:214"/>
Life, for to give attendance hereupon.
Which will be worth your daily setting
to, that hereby you may undermine the
Strong Tower of him, who would keep
up his regency in the divided property
of part good and part evil. For so long
as this is allowed him, he will have the
greatest share of this Worlds Kingdom.
Now then, who would not set close to
this more superiour Business, to find out
what lieth hid in the Magia Storehouse?
Arts of a wonderful degree present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
here. For as ye can wade through
this deep Ocean, great mysteries will
flow out. As ye may see comparatively
what the spirit of a man hath attained
to by external industry. This hath
brought forth all, that is delightful to
the humane sense: whereby all are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who have looked hereinto. Oh,
the lustrous state, that now this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is wrought up to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is become such a
Golden Bait, that rare it is to find any,
who are not biting and nibling hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If therefore the wisdom of that,
which is but Earthly, hath found out and
invented such an inviting variety, to
make this Creation so desirable; What
may not such reach unto, who have the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29870:214"/>
advantage of that Spirit of Wisdom,
that truly inspireth to know from the
originality of all whatever is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended?
This Anointing is the light,
that makes manifest, what lieth in the Abyss
of Eternity: And verily such as wholly
bend the force of their Spirits hereunto,
may attain to great Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and so bring forth that, which
may far outshine, what is now existent
in this Creation. For till such deep ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Spirits are born, who come to
make Projection through internal sight
of what is in the first cause of things, the
Kingdoms of this World, with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
thereto belonging, will be too
hard for you. For that Grand Prince,
that ruleth, and hath such command in
this lower Sphere, hath since the first
Age of this World raised ten to one his
Magnificent Seat in the Heart of poor
deluded man. So that they, whose lot
it is to live in this latter day, have greater
provocations to overcome: as it is truly
said, the last days will be perillous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
through the devises of the Evil
One; who in, and by his Agents finds
out new inventions to enthral and busie
the Mind withal, to prevent the taking
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:29870:215"/>
in the true sense of what was, and might
be again that blessed state of sinless Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
For such hath been this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
subtilty as to be a Lying Spirit in
those, who are Teachers, to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the impossibility hereunto. By which
he doth keep his Seat of Supremacy uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
hereby in the Mind; For so long as
this is, he knows no Power of Soveraing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will outvy his. Therefore this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of my Lord was expresly given:
And further, this word, this Morning,
was added hereunto, That we should
drink in this Pure Doctrine from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who said, Be ye found faithful to the
interest of your Lord's Kingdom; that it
may, through you, while in the World,
be so manifested in Wisdoms Force, and
All-spiritual Might, through studying out
all Divine Arts: as hereby you may pluck
down the Proud and Lofty from their
self exalted Spirit in the Diabolical Might.
Your true Labour herein shall have such
success, as you may bring great acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and renown to your Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
through all Worlds, and to your
selves Peace and Joy, Honour and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because many hereby will flow in into
my Great Name. When they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:29870:215"/>
that you do bear the Standard of
my Spiritual Might, in Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Now therefore be vigilant
according to what hath been revealed,
for the Love that ye have for my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
to appear so in this World, as all
of the Old Dragons may come absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be shaken, and overthrown there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
For whatever ye do think this Prince
of Darkness can suppress, he will. Who
is so Mighty in this Low Region, till
Great <hi>Michael</hi> doth arise to give Crowns
to those, who have been long in the War.
To whom yet no Kingdom hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but do wait here in expectation for
it, and do not start from their Standard.
Such, Oh such be ye: that yet ye may be
trusted with great Command, to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

               <head>September the 10th. 1677.</head>
               <p>THIS Day I was calling my self to
an account; being sensible of that
usual Springing Light, that was something
shaded, and Revelations restrained for the
space of a Week: occasioned by disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thoughts, and letting in, and busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Mind upon inferiour things of this
Worlds concern. Whereby I was made
suspicious of a greater loss sustaining, than
any thing of this World could repay me.
And although there was nothing, which
I did engage in, but what might seem
very just and reasonable to the Eye of
all Creatures; yet that could not be my
justification. Because we were under an
unknown Nazarite Law, that was in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
given: and therefore accordingly we
are bound to obey it, who are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
herein. Hereupon I descended down
into the deep Region of the Spirit,
where I did attend to hear, what would
be answered. Which was again through
Grace renewed: For thus, I did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking
word hear; Did not I by my
Spirit oft declare, that it would be hard
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:29870:216"/>
for any one to keep my charge, who had
not first cleared all scores of this Worlds
Accounts; that so ye might have nothing
to do, but to attend fully your Lord's busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who hath called you for such a
Principal End, out from all this Creation
Service. Henceforth then cease to be the
Servants of Men: for since the day of
your free assignment of your selves, His
you are, to whom you did your selves
bequeath. Upon this word I found a
great conflict in my self, having a great
desire to depart, and to throw off every
weight, that would tie, and engage my
Mind. For I did well see an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to be alone the Lord's servant: and
to give my self up in constancy to that new
revealed Ministery; though I should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
incur all Creatures enmity. For my
Lord by a secret voice doth follow me
close; so that from Loves Charms, I can
hardly get loose. Yea he drives upon us
so hard, as plainly we might see the Holy
Ones design is to make a breach betwixt
this World and us; as foreseeing that
none till then can aptly be for his use
and service. And verily this is the Cup
that is given us to drink of, and to leave
nothing thereof behind. It was, what
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:29870:217"/>
our Lord proposed to the two Sons of
<hi>Zebedee,</hi> who were ambitious to be equal
in the Kingdom with him: Who told
them, They did not consider what they
did ask. For if they did come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what a Death-cup they must
first drink of, they would not have
climbed so high in their desires. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dealeth plainly with them, and
shews them both the necessity, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
thereof; but gives the disposal of
those Throne-instatements to his Father
only. It was also at this time spoken
in me, that we had begun to drink of
this Cup, wherein the deadly draught
was, which would crucifie us to this
world; but as yet we had but drunk
the Upper part of it: the Portion being
so bitter, we indeed could never get it
down at once. Upon which the Spirit
giveth this advice, Not to let one day
pass without imposing upon our selves a
draught out hence to take; till all be
exhausted, and drunk out. For the Cup
is very deep: and at the bottom thereof
doth lie, that which will us from this
Principle absolutely unty. Therefore
let us not herefrom cease to drink each
one, to whom this Cup is given, and no
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29870:217"/>
time let us lose; for through continual
sipping we shall see it lessen, and so by
degrees the effects thereof, upon that
which is to die, will be felt. O who
will be so valiant and worthy in this
Age, as to hold out to the very last as
the bottom of this Cup to see? Then was
it said to me, There was at hand imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
for such another Cup, wherein
was the everlasting Water of Life. The
operation of which is not expedient yet
for to be uttered; till some have of the
first Cup drunk all. O, Lord Jesu, be
thou to us, what thou wert, when thou
didst take the last part of this Cup.</p>

               <p>Being in great agony in my Head and
Teeth, through a mighty flux of Rheum,
this exercised my Faith, and proved my
Patience internally, for some days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and gave me to see, I was under a
mortal influence, as well as all others.
To which in humility I bowed, using yet
some means to free my self from the
present malady and grief that was upon
me. After which not being answered
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29870:218"/>
in the effect: but my distemper still abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I was convinced, that I should have
only applied my self to that Sovereign
Name, wherein my healing was to be
found. Upon which I prayed to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Omnipotency, owning my neglect
herein, in that I had not looked only
for cure therefrom, to bring down help.
For which cause I did believe, that I
suffered under the Starry Constellations:
with which the Grand Adversary did
conjoyn and concur, and send out his
evil influences; rejoycing to see any,
who thought themselves above his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
raies, should fall under, and be
subjected thereunto with others univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally.
The sense of which I deeply took
in, and found in my self a disquietment
thereat, uttering to my God many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
Upon which, this word came
to me, saying: When thou hast tried all
ways and means, know for a surety, it
is the touch of the Deity alone, that must
thee ease. Hadst thou here first fixed thy
Faith, thou mightest have been released
from thy mortal grief. Therefore now
get up upon the Legs of thy Faith, and
stand without staggering, and thereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
health may flow in. This was a
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29870:218"/>
mighty word of support: but much more
ado I had to rally up my Faith, to eye
no other, but this Invisible Power for
ever.</p>

               <p>The next day I had a sweet respite
from the raging force of that predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
humour, which had so afflicted my
exteriour part. And in the Night, I saw
my self taken into a place, of which it
was said, the Night shall not be known

Dead of the Night, yet for brightness it
was as the Noon Day; which light seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me to descend out of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Orb, than this visible Element.
And I felt presently therefrom a warm
Beam sent from the pure Deity, which
did me exceedingly lighten; so that for
the present time, I was as one out of the
Body of ponderosity; dreading, again
therein to be found. For who can do
less, than despise their corruptible Image,
that is so subject to these outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

they come to know and feel in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29870:219"/>
and degree that one Element, of
which Celestial Bodies are framed, which
can know neither sorrow, nor pain? Oh,

                  </gap> or putrefaction? Is
it lawful to have an expectation hereof,
before we lay these Bodies in the Grave?
Yea, assuredly such a day there is to be,
which will swallow up the night of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
that all of the one clear matter
of that invisible Element, shall be in such
changeable Raiment, as that it will us give,
to see the face of God in Clarity. For
this word was given into me, that those
who could hold out in a steady strong
Faith, might know in verity such a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
so as to pass out of Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
into an Aethereal Glory; putting on
that, which can pass into the everlasting

would be very hard: yet sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <p>In the Night I had a Vision of the
Doctor, whom I did see in great concern
about building a foursquare Room all of
clear Glass: neither Timber nor Stone was
in any part to be added thereto. And I
viewed it from first to last, till I saw it
finished by his own hand. Who with
great ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity said to me: Here we will
wait in all reservedness, till the Glory
of the Son of God appear. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
This will be hardly secure, for
we shall be seen through this Glass, and
envious Spirits will break in, and so disturb
our attending here. No, said the Doctor,
we shall here learn the Art of the Divine
Magia: whereby we shall keep all Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out. Or else that indeed would not
be a sufficient Fence for us, in regard
found there is none, who are resolved
to enter in there with us; but we both
will abide there, till others of the same
Spirit shall come into us.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Opening and Interpretation of
this Vision</head>
               <p>Was given to me: That this denoted
the Doctors care and diligence in making
provision for that, which was of greatest
consequence in his Eye: by methodising
first all things outwardly for this free and
quiet assignment. Though according to
the present conjuncture of things, this
seemed then much to contradict, and to
prevent the same: which was objected to
me. But it was answered again by the all-knowing
Spirit, That there was that so
deeply inlaid; that would thrust out
whatever would detard, from setting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this more Principal Building, to which
all must give way. This Glassy Room
doth represent a pure and clarified Mind:
in the which, we jointly wait together
as in one Room; being of one Mind, and
the same Belief, upon the great Work:
minding one Calling and Election here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and not giving herein any account to
any one, that hath not Faith. For I had
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29870:220"/>
advice, that it would little signifie, to
make any publication hereof, otherwise
than <hi>Noah</hi> did, to wit, by an actual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for convincement, that we are of
those, who are forewarned to withdraw
from all of this tempting Region. For
a deluge upon the World is foreseen, that
will strip her naked of all her pompous
appearances: for all of this shall be once
again desolate. Therefore the Word
pronounced a Blessedness indeed upon
those who were found enclosed within
this Glassy Ark. <hi>For it was testified
that</hi> Noah<hi>'s Spirit would yet return again
to condemn this present World: and that
it would be demonstrable in some one or
other. In whom a Spirit of Faith would
stir, as from the Light and Knowledge,
of what the Spirit of Wisdom dictates to
them: and so it will be given to One to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from. It was also signified to me,
that such Preachers of Righteousness would
rise, near upon the third and last Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
who will internally prepare the
Transparent Court for the Holy Ghost; by
disappearing, and winding off from that
first Building. Which is so thick, dark,
and gross, as through that, no sight into
matters of Celestiality could ever be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29870:221"/>
Therefore a Chrystalline Body
is to be built up by the Tool of Faith, to
be an Eternal House, for the Spirit to
dwell and act in. As of</hi> Enoch <hi>it was
said, he was translated by Faith, so as he
did not see death.</hi> Enoch<hi>'s day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verily, the seventh thousand year from</hi>
Adam <hi>is now approaching, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be shortned. Wherein the World
that now is, that consisteth of Inhabitants
made up of gross, elementary matter,
shall suffer a dissolution: by that pure
burning Element, that will break out from
the Glassy Sea; in each ones fiery proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
inkindling the breath of the Almighty
Oh then a Creation of another kind, than
what now is visible, shall be in pure and
perfect existency. For the Most High and
Holy One doth in Wisdom see meet to
make a transmutation among Mortals:
For neither the World before, or since the
Flood, hath any way been pleasing unto
God.</hi> Therefore expect now daily, the
mystery of the Incarnation will begin to
work, in some hereunto elected. Who
of a <hi>Noah</hi> like Spirit raised, will be
first to embody themselves in that Ark,
which is pitched? within and without
with the Oily Spikenard of the Spirit,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29870:221"/>
that is the Invironing Power, that will
keep off all Batteries, that shall be made
against this Transparent Ark. Thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Vision it was revealed unto me,
seeing, that after this manner the third
World is to succeed, it would begin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Method here described by the
Figure. But Oh, my Lord, Who shall be this
second <hi>Noah,</hi> who may assume such a
Transfigured Body? Whereby an answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Off-spring may be all of clarified
Spirits and Bodies, to replenish the New
Creation, in which God may be well
pleased. It was answered, That <hi>Elias</hi>
would come, and take up his Mantle
again, and do the Mighty Deeds, which
shall make good all Prophecies. But it
would only be known in its day, who
should personate this Faithful <hi>Noah:</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this know, Where you see Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to work in any one so high as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
all sensibility, such a one shall surely
lay God's Foundation for a New World.
Now then give way unto that transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
TREE, which doth yield altogether
the Fruits of <hi>Faith.</hi> The root thereof
is to be found within your selves. This
is its springing day, therefore let not its
season pass away from you, as it hath
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:29870:222"/>
done from others. It is not enough to
know it springing in your inward ground,
but the constant feeding is that, which
by degrees will bring Redemption. For
by keeping to this fixedly, you will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
the Life of Sensibility, which hath
done all the injury in confining you still
within the shell of sinful mortality. From
which there is no other way to be freed,
but as you can move in the very body of
all-mighty acting Faith. This kind of
Faith hath had a long sleep: but the great
Arch-Angel is now come to awaken it
with his Spirit in them, who are laid in
the Lord's Death-tomb; that will first
hear this Trump, and be raised in meet
bodies, and clear for the Bride. Who
may ascend into the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with
a blessed off-spring of new-born Spirits
from this Principle: and so bring down
him, who is King of the New Creation
to reign in the Earth.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was considering this
change, that eating on Faiths Tree would
produce. Which was nought else, but
the Power of Omnipotence, which would
beget to an unchangeable Life, if the
right kind of this Faith could be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For, by way of similitude, a Tree
with Branches of several Fruits of Faith
was presented to me, and every sort of
Faith had its proper use. But not to
mention those common Fruits, that grow
very frequently in the internal ground
of those, who are looking after renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Those Fruits, as it was said in
another case, our Fathers ever since
<hi>Adam</hi> have eaten, and are found mortal,
and so are deceased. But this Principal
Fruit, in which is to be tasted the strong
Spirit of the Life-Essence of the Deity,
will be of another effect: to wit, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life will be sucked in verily by that.
But who can give us of this right Fruit
of Faith to eat on; seeing it is out of all
mortal reach? We long have fed upon
the Fruits of the lower Branches of this
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:29870:223"/>
Tree, as others have; but hereby no
mighty thing hath been done, nor any
translation out of this death-vally hath
been seen. Ah, my Lord, what a great
thing is this, that now thou art putting
us upon? Surely thou dost not permit
us to aspire after that, which is not at
our hands required, but to become such,
who are to walk with thee in the New
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> Glory: and to be like pure
Nazarites, all white in Bright Bodies,
and Seraphick Flames in pure Spirits.
But Oh, this Choice Fruit, which the
Flaming Sword doth keep, must come
by gift. As it was shewn to me in, and
by a representation of a Pearl: which in
way of Vision I did see was brought
from an unknown Land, and tendred
unto me, as free, out of a Persons Hand,
which was unknown to me; having other
sparkling Stones, which were all tendred
to me: but the Pearl was of great Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
much outvying the rest.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Interpretation of the Vision of the
Pearl seen in the foregoing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</head>
               <p>I coming to consider of the Pearl, it
was by word given unto me, saying, This
figures out the pretious Pearl of Faith,
that shall again be given to the Saints for
to work miraculously by. Who in long
Patience, and Hope, have waited for the
Manifestation of such Powers and Gifts,
as become the Glory of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to shine forth in. This is that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Pearl, that is the Stock and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
that Wisdom doth be queath to such,
who have sought to be Traffickers on
those Substantials, as are to be found in
the other side of the Glassy Sea. For
nothing, that can be gathered up here,
out of all this Worldy State, we can
make any Heavenly Merchandise of.
Therefore our Lord doth oft commend
unto us this pretious Pearl of Faith, as
well knowing, this is a Gift worth seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and looking after. It is such prizable
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:29870:224"/>
Jewel, if once in our possession, that we
may have any exchange for it; do but
send it out, from whence it came, and it
will turn to treble advantage. But when
I considered, that this Pearl had not
made of late years upon any one such
rich return; hereupon I questioned
whether to any it should be given in
these latter Ages. So it was given forth to
me from a true and certain record, That
though this supereminent and all trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting
Faith was the meer Gift of God;
yet there was required those inferiour
Acts of depending Faith to be put forth;
by way of persuance of this, which
crowns all the lower degrees, that must
be as the ascending Steps to this Throne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominion,
which is called Faiths Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>So that the lower degree of Faith in
us must reach after the highest, by a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
seeking, and improving the present
Faith attained.</hi> For that Scripture was
repeated by a secret Eccho of the Spirit,
<hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for:</hi>
The Faith in God will forcibly draw into
possession him, who is the Author and
Spring of this Almighty Faith, that can
do whatever it pleaseth. <hi>Therefore it is
said, seek, and ye shall find,</hi> that is, <hi>we
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:29870:224"/>
must grow from one ground of Faith to
another, and not give over as fainting
and disponding, till we ascend from Faith
to Faith;</hi> so near to the heart of God our
Father, as to affect him with such Faith
as worketh by Love: that so the grand
mystery of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s all-effecting Faith may be
both revealed and dispensed as a Gift
unto us; and then we have the Substance
of whatever hath been hoped for.</p>

               <p>As the Doctor was in Prayer, this
word passed through me: Ye shall be
marked with the <hi>Fathers Name;</hi> then no
slaughtering weapon can harm you.
Upon which word I much exercised my
Mind; diving to know the Spirits mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what that Mark would be, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what manner it might be imprinted
on us. And I as attended with all heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
the rising Spring of pure Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was thus given me to understand,
That to be marked with the <hi>Father's
Name,</hi> is no less than to be transformed
into a Virgin Body. The bearing of
this Name in the Forehead was shewn
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:29870:225"/>
to me, would be the putting on a visible
Form of God, as considered in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Figure. Which may admit of such
a kind of pure matter, as hath not been
seen or understood: therefore it is well
said, none can know or conceive what
they may be changed into. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his
Visions saw the Lord in several appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Lustre and Glory. There are
degrees of Celestial Clothing: <hi>Esaiah</hi>
had a sight of God, that made him cry
out, he was <hi>undone;</hi> seeing the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableness
betwixt the brightness of a
sparkling Glory, to a dark polluted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Likewise <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw the flaming
Majesty of Glory, that the very Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims
covered their Faces at. Upon
which the Spirit did set it home upon
me, that we might not over-rate our
selves, while the Lamp of our Eternal
Spirits were but yet under the covert of
a dark earthly Pitcher. For no Glory
can shine out, till that be broken away
from the internal Flame, that lieth hid
within. Which is the true and right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Spirit, who when it comes to call
over its high and eternal pre-existency;
considering what it was before it came
into this Body, and taking in the Divine
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:29870:225"/>
Sense hereof, is not at rest, while
yoaked and hanked with such course
and putrified matter, as these fleshly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
do consist of. Seeing therefore a
Promise is left us, both in general and
in particular for returning in, to such a
refined corporeity, as may best agree
with the pure Trinity; Let us draw up
hereunto, with full assurance of Faith,
that so we may hereby reach to this all-securing
Mark: which will redeem us
from among the Inhabitants of the Earth,
and give us entrance to our own Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Place. What is it that hath made
all to die, and leave their Carcases un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
in the Region of this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but the resting satisfied in that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
form of Flesh in all its diseased
properties? There hath been only a talk,
and a belief concerning a Redemption,
but all the highest have reached no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than a Regeneration in Part, and
an illuminating of the Mind. But where
is there, that fair Image of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that shall never fade nor die, that
our Lord verifies he would raise up in the
last day? Which was declared to me,
<hi>to be a Resurrection out of the Grave of
that Mortal Body, which, at present, we
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29870:226"/>
visibly carry as a Sepulcher: in which there
may mistically lie hid, such a Spiritual
Body, as only the Trumpet sound of all-powerful
Faith can bring forth into visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
That so to some it may be given to
see the breaking through of that, which
may resemble the Glorified Figure of him,
who is the First-born from the dead.
This is that Body, in which the Lord
Christ did the Will of his Father: and
we can never expect to go on to do it,
but in the like Figure of all-powerful
Spirituality. In which the Life-quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit may have a suitable Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body to actuate it self, according to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts own original purity. Who by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a terrestrial Form, that is only
animated by a Life, which is from this
visible Element, causeth the great contest
and strife, so as the Spirit cannot do, or
act, according to its own eternal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
The which we now coming to
understand, do see how by this animal
Life of sense, we are bounded and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from this we are made to seek after,
our disappeared and paradisical Body.
And truly, were it not for the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and strong instigation which I feel
again from him, who would be unto us
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29870:226"/>
altogether this immaculate body; I have
enough strong Temptations from my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
part, to acquit all such hopes and
expectations, and to be satisfied with a
mixed state, as to the one part heavenly,
and the other part earthly the whole term
of Life here. <hi>But having had so many
remembrances by Voice and Vision, that
constrained me to pry into this Mystery,
and having many Testimonies from the
Holy Scriptures to confirm what was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
revealed: which came in, and were
opened to me, to prove the certainty and
and lawfulness of such a Hope, as cannot
make ashamed: I am not suffered to let
go the Faith, and shall only in brevity men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
those, which were brought before me.</hi>
As first, That of the 17 of <hi>Matt.</hi> Christs
own Transfiguration, as the first fruits of
this New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> state. Then that of
the 3d of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6, 7, 8, verses, That which
is born of the Flesh, is Flesh; and that
which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit;
though this hath been hitherto under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
only of the Birth of the Mind, and
of the Souls Regeneration, yet a much
deeper thing hath been manifested to me:
to which I must give ear, to wit, <hi>the Fleshly
Birth brings forth the Feshly Body, but the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:29870:227"/>
Spirits Birth brings forth a Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
I am not ignorant of the many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
that will be made against most
of these Scriptures by all such, as only
do look through the vail of sense. Then
again that of the 1st of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the 12th verse to the end of
the Chapter; <hi>That whole Chapter is to
be understood according to a transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

verse. Your Fathers did eat Manna in the
Wilderness, and are dead, 50th. verse.
This is the Bread that cometh down from
Heaven, which a man may eat thereof, and
not dye, 58th. verse. This is that Bread,
which came down from Heaven, not as
your Fathers did eat Manna, and are
dead: he that eateth of this Bread shall
live for ever. These pretious Scriptures
did fully learn and satisfie me, that such
an incorruptible state, that should never
see death, was by us to believed in, <hi>Iohn</hi>
31. 26. And whosoever believeth in me,
shall never die, believest thou this? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:29870:227"/>
more to this purpose were called over,
and interpreted, which may come forth
in their season; these for the present may
suffice. These Holy Scriptures give us
to know, <hi>That we, as to our visible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
are in a strange deformity; out of
which, we may lawfully hope to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
And whoever have Faith herein
without wavering, may certainly see such
a translation. For this word did sound
in me, According as your Faith extends,
so it will in this respect make an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Oh who, but such as are mighty
in Faith, shall live to see the old Mark of
of the Beast worn out, and the Fathers
Name planted and engraven on us. Which
will make us, as the sparkling Stones of a
Crown lifted up, and as an Ensign, where
the place of our Habitation, by the Most
Holy shall be appointed.</p>

was made mention of again. For it
was said, That none should ever sound
this Trumpet, but such, who could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to walk and move upon Faith's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ground. Then took I occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
earnestly to interceed; and while
I was praying for this Mystery of Faith to
be revealed, it was spoke in me, Thou seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that, which is so weighty and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
that time must be allotted to draw,
or extract out of the full and perfect
Number of Coessentiality of Spirit, which
is attributed to the Holy Trinity. Into
this thou must search and dive, for thy
Spirit is of the same Eternal Line and
Nature; and it may recover, what it
hath lost by descending into this terresti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
World, of which course matter, thou
hast formed a body of flesh about thee:
wherewith be content for a while, till
the pure spark Faith shall refine it for
thee, and make it all sublime.</p>

               <p>The profession of Faith was still ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon me, as the only Gift, which
would renew all things out of the old
frame of Nature. For the teaching, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
did further reveal to me, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency
of this Golden Grain of Faith,
which is the product of the Deity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it shall be found. Therefore I had
a charge in these words given me, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Suffer not so rich a Talent as this
to be hid only in, and with the Sacred
Trinity. Come, Oh thou restless Mind,
and I will shew thee where, and how
thou must feel this Creating Breath in
its first beginnings of Life. These Rules
therefore observe constantly: First, Then
know, that the Center of this high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Spirit of Faith, lies in the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Ocean deep of Love. So then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
take notice, that only a mighty,
vehement Spirit of Love, shall bring
forth the Life-acting Body of the Holy
Ghost, which indeed will all be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in Loves strong ardency. See now
then in what ground, this choice Pearl
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:29870:230"/>
be found; the meer strength of Love
must give entrance, where this almighty
Dowry is. Love raised up to its first
Virgin Purity, will make Faith descend
in all its as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umed Majesty. Love and
Faith have an overcoming Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
attending them: God will suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be conquered by the Spirit of
Love and Faith, as he saith, concerning
the work of my hands command ye
me. Nothing can God detain from such,
if they remain in the ardency of this meek
Love-fire, as in a still flame. Therefore
through the augmentation of this pure
burning Breath of Love, which as an
ascending Spirit, can pass into the very
secret abyssal Deep to draw into it self
that very Faith, by which all things have
received their existency; Such a Spirit
sent forth in the cooperation with Love,
will effect that transparent formation,
which may well become the pure Beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Glory of the Blessed Trinity. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receive this from the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Witness, That Love is, and must be
as the circling Ring, in which this spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Stone of Faith will fix it self as a
signal Monument. Wherefore now see a
pretious bundle of Love is all necessary,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:29870:230"/>
as a prepared Vessel, into which the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
drawn Matter of all Spirits may be

Then search and try your selves hereby,
whether you have this Faith of Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which will go forth in all Spirit and
Life. <hi>There hath been a great mistake
about that, which is called Saving Faith,
whenas there hath been no Salvation
wrought by it, because the old form of a

in a dead actless Faith, but to you it is
given to search and seek, that ye may find
the quickning Spirit of Faith. Which ye
shall know by its working effects.</hi> St. James
<hi>in his Epistle gives a true Character of it,
when he speaks of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Faith,
which was evidenced by Works, by which
Faith was perfected. Henceforth, saith the
true Author of it, Let mighty Works, and
Deeds justifie the Spirit of belief, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what degree it is risen. Contend
for the ancient prerogative which was with
the Saints of old; for it is that</hi> Energy
of God, <hi>by which all in you must be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
new, to the magnificency of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who will first appear to you by this
Spirit of Faith; that so you may raise
your own dead, and set at Liberty that,
which hath groaned under the first</hi> Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
<hi>Birth.</hi> This pure extraction of
Spirit may have a hidden Birth in those,
who are in the Life of perfect Charity,
and they not know at first, that this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gift is there. For the very hour
and time of this Golden Balsom droping
in, may not be perceived by the Vessel
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:29870:231"/>
or Person that receiveth it. As Christ
told <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> that this Holy Breath,
none could perceive its coming in or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, so Christ in the Spirit doth
again confirm this word. And this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
is given to you, who are stirred up
here for to wait; seek, and pray, know
it may be with you, e're you are a ware.
Your Obedience will be fulfilled in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up constant flames of Love, to the
fountain heart of the Blessed Trinity. In
which at one time or other the Breath
of the Holy Ghost will mingle, and then
in pure humility you may try to excite
its Power forth, so as it may be brought
into no derision. But first find such abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as your Lord did, when he said <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus
come forth,</hi> which was Faiths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Seal; which both lawful and
expedient is, for the Lambs followers to
receive. Be you now then such, as need
not be ashamed of this lively Hope, and
steddy Profession of this <hi>Faith of God,</hi>
as an Inspiring Breath, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
give a high and wonderful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
No impossibility in this Vocation
will be understood, because its Working
Tool is the Creating Word. After this
free and open discovery let into my
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:29870:232"/>
Mind, I found Faith and Love winged up
as a Twin Spirit springing, that if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this superexcellent Gift might be so

               <head type="sub">The Interpretation of the Vision upon the
first day of October.</head>
               <p>As to this Vision, the Interpretation
thereof plainly is read in the Book With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which beareth the living Testimony
hereunto; signifying those living Acts
of Faith, which sometimes have carried
our Spirits up to <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Hill. Where not
only Batteries are from the potent King
of this low Region: but he doth make
war with, and by his Agents, as taking
notice, we are those, which do separate
from his Kingdom. Therefore we may
expect nothing less, but a Beleagering
throughout; especially when they
perceive that we are such, as would
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:29870:232"/>
overturn that indeared Life of Sense,
that hath been maintained so long in its
range in opposition to Faith's S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veraignty.
But while here we stand, like <hi>Elijah,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Faith's Mount, we can command Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Bands, Chariots and Horsemen of Fire,
that will come in to help upon Faith's
Alarm: and so shall all weapons of War be
frustrated. Therefore fear not ye, who
are upon Faith's Ground, saith the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
But the word of his Councel,
thus spake in me, rather beware of those
more close and subtile Enemies that are
within your own house, which will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment make war upon those lofty
aspirings and ascensions of Faith; they
are more dangerous Enemies, who can
so swiftly raise indeed up the strong
Forts of Reason, and can display all their
Faith-destroying Arrows to wound the
Heart and Life thereof: Threatning, if
ye still hold out, and will not again
descend into the gulf of Sense, then ye
must be liable to the peril of Famine,
Nakedness, Poverty, and all kind of
Reproach. If ye will not yield to
the Laws of Reasons Kingdom, such
Destructions must necessarily befall
you. Now then for caution, said the
Spirit of Life, cast up the Accounts of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:29870:233"/>
present and future times, and in the clear
Eye of Light, thou both backward and
forward maist make discovery, that such
Arguments as these, have frighted down
thousand thousands of Souls, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
would have kept Faiths Ground.
Therefore at this very day among the
professing part of Christianity, such a
Faith is only of reputation, as will not
expose to loss, shame, and disgrace, but
can fall in, and hold correspondency
with what is agreeable to the animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But hearken ye, who do so much
search after this life, consider if you will
adventure up to this Hill, what shots,
not only from the World below, but
what will break in, as Floods, from all
dark Centers, to bring you back to live
in the warm habour of Sense and Reason.
Then this word further arose from the
pure motion, saying, Therefore now that
ye are diving for this pretious thing,
I would that no mistake should be upon
your Mind, if you would come to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that Life that <hi>Adam</hi> had: Which
was indeed an unmixed Life of Faith,
before the relapse did take hold upon
him, I say, if ye will fix your Minds to
this Life, then stay, and lean your selves
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:29870:233"/>
upon this Faith-alsufficiency, and do not
think to carry two Lives in one Body,
that are contrary to each other. For this
Spirit of Faith can only agree with what
is willing to bow, and be all friendly
with it, as a suitable Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e unto it.
Canst thou, saith the Spirit of Faith,
walk out as <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
did with me, they saw nothing before
them, as to the visible but Earth and
Air, and yet nothing mistrusted, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided
in what was not seen; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were abundantly recompensed. Such
as these, who have put out the Eye of
their Sense, and have thrown away the
Crutches of Reason, doth the Spirit of
Faith seek to walk with, that so they
may live upon Hony out of the Rock.</p>

               <head>October the 10th. 1677.</head>
               <p>There was this Morning a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to me like a Garden: where many
sorts of Flowers were, but all single
Plants, save one. Which grew up with
Twins upon one Stalk, three times two,
and one more from the same Root;
which grew right up with its Head bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:29870:234"/>
down towards the rest: It seemed to
be like a Tulip; the Colour being of a
very dark Murray. The other Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
grew round about it, and they were
overspread with Caterpilla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and slugs,
which did devour, and spoil the beauty
of them; which I much lamented to see.
But suddenly a shower came, and washed
them all away. Yet afterward I saw
them come on again, when the shower
ceased. And I marvelled that the Tulip
Branch was still kept free: And while
I made this Objection, how it should
come to pass, that being in the same
ground, it should be exempted? It was
answered, Thou dost not see the deep
Spring that lieth under ground, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
this Branch continually. Then
saw I waters rise, and all over it baptise,
so as the dark colour was changed into a
green pleasant appearance to my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
sight: Then after a little space,
the Spring did rise mighty high, and did
it so drench, as from its greenness, it was
changed into a Lilly whiteness; which
was very marvelous to see such a sudden
transmutation upon this Branch. Oh, my
Lord, signifie the true meaning of this
similitude, for it seemeth to have much
in it.</p>

               <p>This Parabolical Vision was as a Text
and Doctrine given, upon which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit might make its comment. By
the Garden was given me to understand,
that inward flourishing ground of the
Eternal Mind, out of which a crop of
pleasant Plants did put forth from the
Seed of the Spirit. The Eternal Sower
planting himself in the midst hereof as
that Lilly Branch, which grew up in its
twined might and beauty to the perfect

               <p>Now it was queried by me, <hi>Why those
single Plants, which were Divine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the Mind, proceeding from
the Root of Life, should be under the
Power of these Despoilers?</hi> The cause
hereof I was then made to understand,
why those heavenly cogitations, that
would proceed forward to all Divine
Virtue were over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>un by the devouring
Worms. It was therefore resolved, that
it would continue st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll so to be, while
they did put forth themselves from one
weak stalk, in the scattered confusion of
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29870:235"/>
a dispersed property. Now being thus
obnoxious to the intemperate motions
of the visible Element, and mixing
therewith, they are subject to smitings
of all kinds. And though through the
help of those distilling showers of the
Word of Life, oftimes refreshing this
inward ground, and cleansing it from
this swarming, flying, and superfluous
thoughts which the Slugs and Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars
did really figure out, they are
freed herefrom; yet upon the cessation
of these upper and outward Showers of
a visible teaching Ministery, they are apt
to swarm again upon the Mind, to stain

forth in the single and divided property.
So that while the inward is thus invaded
upon, no Fruit can be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
for as fast, as it comes on, it is
eaten off: so the Work, while standing
in this posture, it is always doing, yet

after, and for its Restoration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
striving against the Stream, and
Tide of Profuse Imaginations: which

               <p>The first part of the Night, I spent in
recollecting and calling over this whole
Weeks Transactions, which I had little
satisfaction in. Because it was not upon
such a Service, as it was meet, I should
ever and always be found imploied in.
For whatever of the necessary concerns
of this temporary Life did call me off,
from this Heavenly Calling, it became
as Gall and Wormwood, and brought a
heaviness upon me. So that I made my

                  </gap>pplication in the deep inward sense

Earthly matters should croud in upon us,

Who had so much avowed our selves the
Lords Servants only to be, and therefore
our Spirits could no otherwise be but
troubled, when hurried by that, which
was so great a Set-back to our Spiritual
Profession, that is in imitation to our Lord
Jesus in his Holy Priesthood. While I was
considering the closeness of this Work,
I was cast into a Sleep: and I was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
awaked by one that called, and
said, If you do not take good heed, and
quicken your Pace, a dark Mist from the
Earth will rise upon you, and then you
will be prevented of entring into the
Third degree, where is no Eclipse.
Which Word I took hold off, for it came,
very seasonably. Some space of time
after in the same Night, I went in Spirit
to One, that also was herein concerned
with me, to give him a Spiritual caution,
and be moaned with him the loss of time.
And the same Person, whose Figure was
named to me, appeared in a White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>1. Upon an occasion of disturbance, by
a disquieted Spirit in the Family, I pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out the sense thereof unto my Lord
in Prayer, why such a grieving Thorn
should be our troubler. So I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all to him, who I did believe would
clear me, from all unjust Clamours, in
Truth and Innocency. After which, I
found a suddain sweet Calm, and peace
brought into my mind. Which caused
me to repose in a quiet natural Rest. In
the Morning this Word came in to my
support, Be not dismayed at the Blast of
the terrible one, who hath poured forth
Hellish Fury. Be still found in the Long
suffering and Patience, and then this
shall all turn to the furtherance of that

Change into such a Spiritual Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,

I can have no free access, nor be taken

into the Marriage-Bed of inflamed Love

               <p>As soon as I came out of Sleep, after
the Nights rest. This word met me, Oh
that I might awake, with thy Image
perfectly: then should I behold thy Face,
and not be reproached, because of an
ignominious Body. Whereupon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the weightiness of the Word, and
it was opened unto me, that it related
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:29870:245"/>
to a Resurrection stare after a Death-sleep
in the Grave, of the Body of Sin,
out from which the Spirit awakeneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the God-likeness. Upon which there
was presented unto me, a clear Crystal
in the figure of a Heart, which hung by
a Pipe, through which a stream like
Blood passed into the Heart: which
was said to be the pure Life-Seed,
that conveyeth it self from the Fountain-Heart
of the Godhead. As it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a Birth answerable to the
very Heart of God, which would be the
true and original matter of a divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
In which only the Life of God
should move, as it did in the Person of
our Lord Jesus. Whose Heart was fed
from the Heart of his Father, and so ours
from his, when so purely generated as
his, from the Seed, or Incorporating
Power, of the Deity. For it was made
evident to me, that the New Birth-heart
conceived in us, must be from the
Root of the same holy and unmixed
matter, and answerably: in order to a full
redeeming from the old polluted Heart,
out from which are the Issues of Death,
which is said to be the heart of <hi>Stone.</hi>
Now it was shewed me, that Fallen
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29870:245"/>
Man did carry about him three Hearts.
As <hi>first,</hi> the Heart of a Beast, as it may
be said of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he had a
Beastial Heart. <hi>2dly,</hi> The Heart of a
Man, which comes up to Sensibility and
to Rationality. <hi>3dly,</hi> A Heart in which,
as to the outward Birth, remains some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of an Eternal Essence, as a Spark
of Light, which <hi>Adam</hi> had in <hi>Paradise:</hi>
and this we call Man's <hi>Eternal Heart.</hi> And
this in the highest Improvement, is in much
Imperfection and Instability: sometimes
in a raised Life towards God, then sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down as a Stone again into the Earth,
according to the outward Constellations,
that do mutually concur in the good and
evil. The effects whereof, we have sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
felt, by an inward strife and war,
through the divided property of the Soul,
which moveth sometimes from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Center towards its primitive Being
before the Fall. So as in this contest,
without conquest over the earthly part,
Millions of Souls have past away out of
the Body. And fearing least it should be
so with us, another Heart is shewn unto
us. For none of these can bring us near
unto God. And therefore remove, and
give them up, and pray vehemently that
we may see this old sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29870:246"/>
within us, and then such a new Heart, to
which is annexed a pure burning stream,
which becomes a quickning Spirit.
Which will make essentially the great
alteration, so as we shall find our selves
new-born perfect Creatures. For it is
of that high deified Composition of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as it forceth all polluted matter of
contrariety from it to fly. It is such a
pure thing, as it will be contracted into
it self, and live alone in an absolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
There is no allowance given for
any of those forementioned Hearts with
it to commix, no more then Clay or Iron
with Gold. The Spirit of this Heart is
most subtle, penetrating, bubling, and
still flying upward above all low things.
As its Birth is from the Heart of the
Deity, so there again it will live.
Truly, at the consideration, that there is
such a Heart to be given, my Spirit is in
an astonishment. Therefore I call all ye
Throne-Angels and Seraphims, to be
with me in wonderment, that such a
Heart shall come in any one to be fixed
substantially. For what less will this
come to, but the making good of that
saying of the <hi>Lycaonians,</hi> who said to
<hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> The God's are come down in the
likeness of Men.</hi> For as the Heart is,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:29870:246"/>
so is the Man, a Godlike Heart overturns
the whole Course of Nature, and changes
all into another Scheme, answerable to
the first moving Cause: Which sends
forth Life and heat into all parts, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
so spiritually, for the existency of
the divine Nature. And further it was
given me to know, that it was a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
act Creation: A drop let fallen from
the Heart-blood of God, for Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling
into such in whom the Virgin
Crystal Mold is formed, that here for
hath been making way in preparation
through many Washings and Cleansings,
and Heart-relinquishings. For this
Word came closely unto me from the
Lord, and home to me: <hi>Suffer and endure
ye must who are looking for the gift of
this New heart, Such a breaking up of
the Old, as a dying man when his heart-strings
are loosening.</hi> This is the true my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Death: this is to be a dead man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
which many have sought, but
could never find. Because they did not
strike at the heart-root: for so long
as there is life remaining, it will Send
forth it sin-reviving Effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For what
if thou shouldest cut off this &amp; that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
yet life may be at heart still; and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:29870:247"/>
then what avails hewings and hackings,
and suppressing; the root of the evil
life being still there? The work is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done, because the life of sin is still
sending forth one bitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ume or other:
to pain, and afflict, what would be at
ease and rest. Now what remedy can for
this be considered, said the Holy One, but
the plucking up, and breaking the very
heart-strings, that its Life may be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to divine Justice? for so it must
be both a passive and an active Offering, for
the Sin that hath been commited in the
body of the flesh. Which mystery hath
not been understood: but know it for
an everlasting Truth. Let not the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of this Death be grevious, because
it will certainly usher in some what, that
will be Equivalent to the deep springing
heart of the Deity; whereout issues of
Life, Love, Joy, and Peace will flow.
They thou shalt know no more strife, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or pain; because the root of all
this is by death taken away. Therefore
Repent not that ye are entring into the
very way: Fear not to fail the old heart
melting, for when that faileth, another
heart and Spirit will be given. Which
is of that strength, courage, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:29870:247"/>
as that ye shall be spirited for the
great and primary business, and for the
work of trust for God and the Lamb. So
all may see what the effect of this New
Heart will visibly produce in you.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was in a very deep
and secret consultation with the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
Word, concerning this great
Change. For this is but yet known in
us, how that every motion and thought
springs from the mixed heart. But now
great searching thoughts were, how we,
if possible, by any means might attain
to this perfect Heart, which was all clean
within. For it was made equivalent,
that hereby would be the whole over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
of the old Creation; making
way for the new in each one, in working
a through demolishment. For which
this Word of advice was given: Let it
not seem incredible unto you, that the
old Heart shall fall away, though it is as
thy Life-Essence: where that Law is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,
which hath brought all into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
At the release of which a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:29870:248"/>
working Heart shall be planted in its
place in great renown. Therefore watch
daily hereupon: for believe affuredly, that
this Covenant will be made good, as ye
have Faith to believe, that the old stony
Heart shall be rolled away, which only
hath kept, and would still prevent this
Heart rising far. Where new Laws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the new frame of things shall
be understood, by such a chosen Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as all of Spirit shall be compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and by Gods own Heart-strings of
Love, stand everlastingly together
tied as Christ's perfect Spouse and Bride.
Now then hoist up your Sails of Faith,
and keep upon the broad Waters of
Love's deep, that spring from the silent
Desart, till all full Treasures of Joys and
Peace shall upon you meet.</p>

had in a Contemplative way with
him, who is invisible, I saw of a suddain
a Rock fashioned out like an Arch,
whereinto a way was made to pass, and
it was pretty spacious. At the first it
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:29870:248"/>
seemed to be somewhat dark, which
made me fear to enter in: but presently
a Table was there, upon which was a
blazing Light, and it then became all shining
and exceeding lustrous to invite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. But about the Light, there did
appear a company of dark coloured
Flyes, which fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they would have obscured the
Light: but as they came up to it, they
were consumed by it. So considering
these divine Idea's, the Word came, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Enter ye hereinto, whom the sacred
Vow of Separation is upon. For here
is a Munition-Rock for your Security.
Oh that here you may be hid, and hope,
and quietly wait for the Birth of the
pure and perfect Heart. In which ye
shall see the Face of God, whose Voice
may be frequently heard in this secret
place, therefore Love here to abide: for
here is the Heavenly stillness.</p>

               <p>The whole employ and exercise of my

New Creature is formed with all
new and fresh Organical Senses and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
proper for Communion with
the highest purity and goodness. As it
was shewn me, that the Heart and Spirit
that mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of its own Sphere, and low
Birth of Life, that only reacheth to
things that are seen, and knowable by
the highest graduated Life of Reason,
which is altogether to seek in matters
Celestial and Eternal. Now that we
might come to know the Invisible, only
wise and everlasting God our Father, it
must be through the medium of such a
Spirit, as may be the very conceptive part
of the New Heart. From which springs a
clear Light that giveth understanding in
the mystery of God, and in what relates
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:29870:249"/>
to the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus. Which
is hereby to be revealed only, as this

from whence it proceeds infinitely, and so
sounds, and finds infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in the immense Being. By vertue of a
new Covenant tye, which the Spirit of a
new and perfect Heart is for ever under
the obligation of a Love constraining Law,
from which there may be no departing.
But while upon these Myrrh-dropings
my Soul was feeding; this Word for
Confirmation was added: What if this
may become such a time of Love, as by
passing by to look upon thee, I shall
Swear unto thee and not repent, that I
thy God will be unchangeable: And will
enter into such a Covenant, as thou mayst
henceforth become mine. Then shall I
know what to do with thee for further
Glory and Excellency. For in that thou
wilt be commendable to thy God, whose
Eye only can take pleasure therein. Then
was presented a transient sight, to wit, a
Pool, wherein I was bid constantly to
wash and bath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the Word signified,
that such Virtue was herein, as it would
make White the very <hi>Blackamore</hi>'s Skin,
and cleanse away every Leopard's Spot.
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:29870:250"/>
For it is a Bath of burning Oyl, that will
the first Birth of the earthly Heart to
purpose try, and melt away; that so all
pure Spirit of Life may spring, and a
body of a shining Skin, as a Cherub-Covering
be given. For it was revealed
to me, that this should be done unto us,
as we were become the Lord's by League
and Covenant. Whence it stood upon
the Honour of the Lamb, and of his
Kingdom, for us to be found all clear
and perfect, through this Pool of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming
Blood, that throughly Baptizeth
all, who are in the true Memberhood of
his Body.</p>

Star, as from the Invisible Orb, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:29870:250"/>

here in a Lordly dish, wherein the true
Body of your Jesus is both tastable and

to drink in, it will make them Spirits,
as all burning Flames. Upon which great
things were further opened in the Magia
Line. Which, could I have but totally
acquitted, all those motions that concur
to sense-awakening, I might have given
an account of an infinite space, into
which my Spirit was launching, but was
driven back by some stirring Essence,
that would not let my Spirit pass naked,
and pure in. But this Word came, tho
thou canst not pass now, yet thou shalt,
after thou hast eaten of this Lordly dish.
Which will turn Nature into Spirit; then
thou may into the secret ranges of all
eternal heights and depths as an Eagle
flye, and see, and know what lies beyond

               <p>This divine Speculation which I had

those infinite heights and depths, which
did but just open upon me, but then shut
up. But my Spirit did make again a fresh
onset, if by any means I might pass into
that profound light Orb, according to
the Nature of a Spirit. For an eccho did
cry in me from that Sphere, that the holy
Trinity was there in the highest dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

motive to attract my Spirit out of this
vile Corporeity, from which I found
much resistency. For I perfectly felt
somewhat therefrom did rise, that did
bind my Spirit. I was in great struggle
for some hours, for the Spirit wrestled
for a full Liberty. Then came this Word,
saying, By all these Encounters the way
will be made. Only keep thy course
strait on towards the everlasting deep
Gate, according as ye shall feel the Wind
of the Spirit driving thereunto, and so
wait with it to mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in a Body of Flesh, to be as free as a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:29870:251"/>
Bird, which can when it will fly from his
Nest! This was to me a new revealed
thing, by which great discoveries may
be made in the invisible Region, who have
been altogether Strangers, to what is
transacted there, because the sensitive
Soul doth claim such a Marriage Union
with the Spirit, that neither what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or what is to come must sever them.
This is the Law of degenerated Nature,
which lawfully may be broken. For
the Spirit of the Soul is not for ever to
be confined to the soulish depravity,
when once it comes to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that it is a pure Grain, let fall
from the Deity into the soulish property.
Then it will not suffer it self to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
as under a Mountain-weight. No
sooner doth it spring and rise above the
Ground, as an ear of Corn which doth
grow ripe, but a separation from the
earthly part or ground may be made by
the mighty Lord of the Harvest, who
will come to reap where he hath sown
pure Spirit. And that in the very time
of this exteriour Elementary Being, Christs
Last Day of Resurrection and Ascention
shall appear through the Might of this
precious Grain of the Deity (by which
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:29870:252"/>
I mean the Eternal Spirit of the inward
man, which is a Spark descended from
the Deity, and it differs from the eternal
seed of Christ's Deity, which is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
with this for its Resurrection and
Ascension sake.) This spark of Eternity,
the Spirit of the eternal Soul belonging
to the inward man, will free it self from
all, and every corporeal tye. For no

                  </gap>errestrial Image, though accomplished
with all external Righteousness, can ever
attract this superiour spirit to be in a
conjugal Union; because it is too much
below, therefore it now seeks release
from it, as being ashamed of all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
circumstance concurring to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Life, which would hold it so fast.
But Wisdom and Counsel is come from
him, who will be Salvation to the ends
of our Earth. His Spirit it is that hath
called us from the other, to an eternal
conjunction, with that wherewith it might
most suitably agree; so as to raise and
heighten the Spirit, to such a high degree
of sublime purity, as that it might pass
as swift as a thought, into the deep
space, where the infinite Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
might come to be conspicuous with
the glorious Trinity, and with all those
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:29870:252"/>
innumerable Spirits, who incompass the
Throne-Majesty. Such Visions of Glory,
Spirits have been carried into, while in
the Body, and so it shall come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and that more frequently and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.
For upon an earnest enquiry here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
it was revealed unto me by this

and the Gate thereof should stand
open, to such as could drink of the Brook

also, that as yet there was a dark gulf

so that at present, none could see their
way, till the Son of the Everlasting

affirm this, that sound Truth, Wisdom
and Knowledge, must from hence be let
in to our Understandings, and it will be
much to our satisfaction, when we shall
hear and see, what is without and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this gulf of Sense and Reason,
which have kept out of the Lamb's fixed

Kingdom. And what will these storms
be, but the rushing Powers coming down
through the Salvation-Horn, which will
be blown from God's Mountain-Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
The sound of which is already

where our King and Lawgiver may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

That we may come to know in certainty

all of pure refined Gold, and spiritual
matter infused therein together, what

               <p>As we were in the Spirit of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
attending together, a transient view
of full ripe Sheaves was presented, as a
testification, that we should bring of the
first ripe Fruits, as a pure Offering to the
Lord, according to what hath in the days
of our sorrow, heaviness, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
been purely sown in the Spirit. But
it was also shewn me, that this should not
be accomplished, till we had fulfilled our
set-time in the Wilderness. For this is an
Ordinance that was given by God to <hi>Moses</hi>
while <hi>Israel</hi> was yet in the Wilderness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came into the good Land. This
instruction was for time to come, saying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Now behold the first Fruits of the Land,
which thou hast reaped, thou shalt offer
unto the Lord thy God. So according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:29870:255"/>
the first ripe Fruits of the Spirit must
be wholly dedicated and brought into the
Store-house of the Lord; rejoycing and
making everlasting melody in the Courts
of Holiness, as the Joy of Harvest. Oh! this
is the desirable day, but who hath it
seen? because they have all dyed short,
before entring into the good and fruitful
Land, one Generation passing away after
another, as we have seen it. But it is
decreed eternally thus to be? No, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
no: there is a Generation to
come, that shall not only sow, but reap,
and pay their Tythe-Offerings to the
great <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King. There is a
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> who will out-live all
the spirits of Unbelief. Who have been
faithful Spies to search, and find out
the virtue and glory of Mount <hi>Sion's</hi>
Land. Whereupon the Spirit did the
History take up, and did it mysterious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to our state at present very closely
apply. As thus, that <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi>
signified the Unity of the Spirit concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in a strong Faith, the Spirits of our
Minds agreeing mutually with the Spirit
of Jesus, and so both do agree to pass and
see the goodly Spaces of Eternity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all things be so, as hath been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:29870:256"/>
of, concerning the matters of Christ's
Kingdom. To which we are annexed
Heirs, and therefore concerned to take
our flight thither, to view all within the
New <hi>Canaan.</hi> For our Lord did know,
that a sight before hand of this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
would greatly satisfie. As it was
with the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who gratified
both her Eye and Ear, in the state of
<hi>Solomon's</hi> Kingdom. Now then may not
we in the Spirit of Faith, and rising pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christ's Spirit, come to have such
a pass over <hi>Iordan's</hi> flowing River?
Hereupon it is cleared up to me, that it
is most lawful and expedient to take such
a heave or flight in the Spirit. For which
end, in obedience to the counselling
Word, which to me was dropped in; Let
us then be, as a goodly Ship, who would
launch into the Ocean deep, and would
swim upon the broad Waters, all tackled
and trimmed, and pitched within; that
no place may be found for bleaking, and
our pure and white Sails stretched out,
all in a readiness, lying at the very Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the Anchor of Hope; waiting
to see when the Gusts and Breath of the
Holy Ghost will turn our Ship about,
and blow all South, that we may suddainly
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:29870:256"/>
be cast upon the Rock of Pearls and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones in that Land <hi>Beulah,</hi> that
is so little known. But who now must be
hither our sure Pilate, but he that hath
already there been, even that bright Star
that can steer through Fire, Water, and Air,
having himself broke through all these,
and so will do no less for us, if we shall
be found in such a ready posture, as here
hath been described. Now let us give
all place to this <hi>Ioshua</hi>-Spirit in our Bark,
who will make a remove for us out of
the Wilderness. He doth but wait for
the mighty Birth to be here brought forth,
that so we may pass away jointly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.
It was further also denoted
to me, that all the murmuring and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Spirits should be wasted away
in the Wilderness, who have murmured
through fear and distrust: For these can
have no share with us, whether they be
with, or without us: all are excluded;
none but <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> will enter in
with us to view, and will have possession
with us in the Land <hi>Beulah.</hi>

               <p>A very curious Question did stir in my
Spirit, why such a concealment of the
Heavenly Things was in this time of our
Lord's mediating Priesthood? And why
no more visible Effects were produced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Members on Earth, as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection-day.
For since the Apostle's
Age, little hath been wrought in any
miraculous way, further then by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Light, and Spiritual renewings, and
the Love of God shed abroad with the
Blood of Spriukling: which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree, that yet any have arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
But all this did not appear to me,
to be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t which the perfect Restoration
must further make out; nay, what the
Apostles saw and heard in their time,
who had the first Breathings from Christ,
after his Ascension. Yet all then, and
since have been exceeding short, of what
is in reserve to be revealed. As I do
know this from a sure Word of Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so herefrom my expectation
hath been greatned, and the Pool of my
Mind stirred, and troubled, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:29870:257"/>
as from a central Fire boiling up, to
clarifie that, and so the gross thick and dim
Eye might be single and piercing to see if
possibly into its own original body of
Light. That so hereby a clear Aspect might
be of what hath been acting and working
in order to the Consummation of another
more pure and perfect Creation. Thus
being upon an internal search, into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this high Nature, this Word was
brought into me, saying, Why art thou
troubled that such long respit hath been,
as to the Manifestation of the absolute
Reign of the Lamb, that was slain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Might hath not been shewn, nor
his Power wrought, nor his Wonders
done in the Earth? Yet now look for a
greater Overturn then ever through the
whole fallen Creation. This long ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
shall not nullifie it, for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
will have its revealing Day: for
the Golden Sand of the half hours Silence
is running out apace, which must be first
expired out in Heaven. It was then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me to understand, that this Half
Hour of Silence hath been ever since the
Holy Ghost appeared in Cloven Tongues
of Fire, upon those, who in a travelling
Birth did here wait for it upon the Lord's
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:29870:258"/>
Promise. For since that time, little news
hath been heard from Heaven, only the
Beloved <hi>Iohn</hi> had the last, great, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Revelation from Jesus. Since that
only such a Ministration hath been, which
hath taken up their Testimonies in a still
and private way, opening the Mind of
the Spirit, in the Doctrine of the Old and
New Testament. But for a new and fresh
Word, that may be said to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from the Lord, which hath not
been before, truly it may be said, as it was
in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time, that the Word of the
Lord i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>pretious in this day.</hi> We may
travel from East to West, from Nation
to Nation, and scarce find a true <hi>Seer,</hi>
with whom the express<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Word of the
Holy One is. Some hidden ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the stuff of this Principle there may
be, who will not be known till the Lord
calls them out, to unfold boldly his
Mind. For this is an Age that can as
little bear, as any formerly, such Truths
as will shake their whole righteous Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
as it may be so termed, and others
whose Lives and Loves are in that, which
must also be laid wast in the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
which is coming upon all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things. Therefore never more need
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:29870:258"/>
then now is for true and anointed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to enquire how things are going
in the invisible Kingdom. For all the
Plat-form is first laid there, how things
in this external state will be. Therefore
it is needful, that some must be here tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared for it, and should never be
off their Watch-tower, but be listening
continually. For it was said, upon the
enquiry of a Spirit, That the half Time
of Silence was now upon breaking up,
and mighty Powers would begin to work.
Therefore let the regardful understand
the present Motions of the Heavens.
Though our Lord Jesus is shut up from
all mortal view, yet the effect of those
invisible Workings may be known in our
low Heavens, and may be felt by such,
whose Hearts are bent, and full stretched
out to the Heart of a glorified Jesus.
these will attract down Light, and so the
lower Heavens may so contact with the
upper, as to become all privy to the
great Affairs, Counsels, and Designs,
which are stirring within the Globe of
Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Query is,</hi> By what way or mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

yet have upon them the thick film of Mortal
Sense?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:29870:259"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no other Medicine here
prescribed for it, but to wash often
in those clear and pure Waters, which do
run from the Crystal Throne into one
Pool. This doing day by day, minding
when those Crystal Springs do bubble
highest, the strong force of which, doth
wash off the rough scales of Sense: Then
shall we become all seeing into what is
both near and afar off, as to the working
of the divine Mystery. This word of
Counsel was also added, that whoever
did seek this great gift, to know the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Magia in its Eternal Motion, they
taken up will be, like <hi>Enoch</hi> to walk
with God from among Men in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Region; where no evil Wind or
corrupt Air may blow upon them. These
great and weighty Crown-Jewels, which
for the last Age are reserved, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon such separated <hi>Nazarites,</hi>
whose Walks and Conversations are in
the <hi>Immanuel,</hi> where the Vail and Face
of the Covering will be done away.
when no need there will be of crying,
<hi>Come up, and see,</hi> for in the very Eye of
Light, we then shall comprehend, and all
Invisible things shall stand as naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. But oh thou Lamb of God,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29870:259"/>
when shall thy Hand of Might be stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, to bring these mighty things to
pass for any one.</p>

               <p>In the Night I had hard wrestling with
somewhat, which had brought an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
of gloominess upon my Heavens:
which I could not well bear, but did
row as against Wind and Tide, to get out
of the danger of those Floods, that did
violently break in. And through
earnest and strong Supplications, I was
heard in that I fear'd. For my Jesus to
my aid did come in, and in truth made all
miraculously to be still within me, and
did charge with great authority all those
troublers of my Joy and Peace to depart,
saying, <hi>Who is it that hath any thing
to do here, where my living Name is
engraven? Have not I chosen thee for my
own purpose? What then do mean these
strange Injections here to throng? Fly
O ye dark Clouds from my habitation, for
I will dwell in all Light with my separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Spouse, who hath Covenanted within
the Circle of a Love-flaming Heart, still to
wait for me her Lord.</hi> Accordingly, so
soon as I could thereinto retire, a mighty
sweet transfusion of Light did every
where about me meet. And this did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
usher in the whole influencing Body
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:29870:260"/>
of the Trinity. I was never made more
internally sensible of their environing, and
out-spreading Banner, which as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was stretched out to secure me from
the Waters, which the Spiritual Harlot
sitteth upon, and that in and very near
us. For the Seat of all these whirling
Imaginations, are shewn me not only to
be as an Accident, now and then happening,
but this adulterous Spirit claims, and
would have a fixed Seat in the Mind, and
therein bring all her worldly Sorceries,
to infect the mind, and betray it into the
gulf of Perdition. Which was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and kept off by the suddain and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
introducing Power of the Trinity:
that encompass those who are in fear of
such overflowing from these bitter and
brackish Waters. For this I may give,
as a known experience, and write upon
it <hi>probatum est,</hi> that we at no time are
now necessarily exposed to be overcome
with any evil of Sin, though it lurks
and beleagers very close; For strong and
mighty is now the Spirit of the Lamb,
who is assigned to come in for our rescue.
Therefore if we do earnestly implore for
the Captain of the Lord's Hosts, who is
to deliver his Lambs from the Mouth of
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:29870:261"/>
the Lyon that roareth for his Prey upon
immortal Souls, they will be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This often witnessed hath been, that
we might not cowardly fall under the
Hand of the Man of Sin. For this Word
was given, while I was in spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
Hold out for Victory, I am your
Life-guard, and ye shall never perish out
of my Hand. There is nothing sure
more pleasing, then to see the Enemy of
Truth and Righteousness so worsted and
kept under Ground, that he may lift
up his Head no more within your Tent.
Where then like <hi>Iael,</hi> thou shalt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Blessed of Women, that art so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as to smite <hi>Sisera</hi> to the Ground,
never more to rise again. There is a
Nail within thy Tent, which thou shalt
be taught, how to use it, that so the full
Execution may be upon the troubler
of <hi>Israel,</hi> by the united force of <hi>Barak</hi>
and <hi>Iael</hi> together. <hi>Barak</hi> signifies Jesus
Christ, the Prince of strength, valour
and might, that makes <hi>Sisera</hi> to fly into
that Tent, where the Nail by Wisdom's
Hand will surely be fastened. Then not
only the <hi>Song of Deborah,</hi> but of the <hi>Bride</hi>
and the <hi>Lamb</hi> will be sung. When thus
overturned shall be the whole Principality
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:29870:261"/>
of <hi>Sisera</hi>'s Kingdom, that so nothing of
his Seat and Throne within us may be
found. This for us the Lord is now do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it is marvellous in our Eyes.
Being we are called out to be Followers
of the Lamb in spiritual War, till all
shall bow and fall down dead before us,
that hath contradicted the absolute Reign
of Jesus in us. Let us go forth in that
mighty JAH, that is with us, who will
make all Kings and Nations to tremble
before us, as we shall move forward in
that power. Who hath promised that
yet in the Wilderness we shall be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
till the mighty Prince thereout shall
go before us, as the <hi>CYRVS,</hi> which
shall perform all those great things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
concerning the bringing in and
establishing of the everlasting Kingdom.
Which the Holy Ones hath so long kept
out, in waiting for this Man of Spiritual
Might to go forth for the recovery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For hitherto little hath been done,
as to a full and total Conquest over those
great potent Powers of Darkness, that
have withstood <hi>Michael</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
But this Word was given me,
That though it hath been so permitted,
yet now the Day of the Lord's contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:29870:262"/>
for full Vengeance was near, upon
those secret and home-bred Enemies of
all Righteousness. Therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our present Might, we should
strike the Nail into the Head of the
<hi>Sisera.</hi> And this will give such a proof of
divine valour to our God, that we shall
be spirited for more wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
and so subdue mighty Thrones
and Powers in wicked places, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of him, who is the Captain of the
Lord's Host, hereby to lead captive
what hath captivated us. And then let
us meet our <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King, with all
the Spoil thereof, as a Trophy of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Who hath ready in his hand the
reward of a Diadem and Crown, which
he hath reserved for such Conquerors.
This is the great Motive to animate our
Spirits, that so we might know, it is not
a light or momentary thing we do
fight for, but what is weighty and
eternal. All which is to make us in good
earnest, according to a Word, which
through me did sound, saying, Put not off
your Armory that is of the Spirit at all,
for in that ye will make all Life-killing.
Darts to rebound back again, &amp; no Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
thereinto can pierce. And know, that
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:29870:262"/>
in this Holy War, my Peace shall be
your Garrison. Therefore hold out, till
the Kingdom is given up unto you, which
hath been kept away, and still will be,
except the Prince of Might shall take it
again in you by violence. For which
cause, I am come to stir you up, that so
what was designed from Everlasting, may
now be positively claimed by my Spirit
in you. Know it is all pleasing to your
God, that ye should be found in such
great Undertakings. As your Spirit is
great, and from a high degree descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so answerably do ye aspire for no less,
then what you believe your Lord through
Conquest in possession hath now obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:29870:263"/>
Wave upon Wave did beat in, but so
powerful was the Celestial Flame, that
nothing more of the Floods were seen.
And there did distinctly appear a Figure

               <p>This Manifestation was very suitably
presented to my inward Mind, which
was drawn up into a deep and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
how long it might be, to the
full Conquest and Victory over the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Spring of Sin, with all the evil
Consequences that thereupon have fallen
out. While my Spirit was herein much
exercised, this came before me, and
brought a Message with it for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and support, who are enclosed in
Faith's Rock, which in particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and made out to us that the Vision
did plainly speak to us. Who though
gathered into this Rocky place, said the
Revealing Word, yet see ye are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the violation of these tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:29870:263"/>
Waves, which at times and seasons
may break in upon my precious Ones. As
in him, on whom no matter of Sin could
be found, yet there Temptations did
sometimes abound, who was still found
in the Rock of the Deity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
told his Disciples, that because
they had continued with him in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
therefore he would give them a
Kingdom, because they suffered, and
were one with him in all Temptations,
not to fall under them, but to get power
over them: that this gave Title unto the
Thrones there mentioned. Now from
hence it was further opened unto me.
That the Fire which first sprang out, that
was so often damped by the Floods, and
quenched by being too weak to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, it was shewn me to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
that remained of a pure and divine
Essence, that would still live in Nature,
as for to refine it, and reduce it into
what might make it like to God again.
But being so strongly beat upon by the

doth encompass as a full S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the great Leviathan moveth, which also
are the Seat of the Beast, that doth make
War together against that Holy Seed,
yet remaining within the Rock of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Humanity. So that it is in great
danger to be often extinguished, for here
is two contrary Elements, the one in strife
against the other, the boisterous Waters
of the Senses awakened from the tempting
Region of these various things, which do
so well suite with fallen Nature, that they
may well be too hard for that little Spark,
that striveth to rise, but hath been beaten
down, as we in our selves have witnessed.
Whereupon we may expect a stronger
force will come unto our help, seeing
such a strong resistancy is made in order
to the stifling of that breathing Life,
which hath struggled to live in dominion,
and to prevail over all, but hitherto yet
found insufficient. Upon which this
Word of Counsel was given from the

Everlasting Flames, and the Bush of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity

to be nigh, when as the Child of the

him. Who now shall have Faith in their
Earth for these things? to what a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
state may it bring them up unto?
Therefore let us improve every such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
and extend our Faith to the
great Augmentor of our weak Flame,
that if possible, such an encrease of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Flame may make with us, as to
dry up all, that hath encompassed our
Rock. It may now be a time and season,
when that such a bright flaming Body may
be of stead unto us, which can at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
ascend, and secure frail Corporeity.
It may be well worth enquiring after the
excellent Properties of such a divine
Creature, which doth move under the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:29870:265"/>
Cherubs Wing, where it can pass to and
fro unseen. Oh let us further dive into
this Magia, for great advantage may be
made for us, to raise out here such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
as may set us above all fear of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
in a day when Perils, and great
dangers are threatned, as an overflowing
Scourge, to break in upon the World.
It is time for us to know, where to hide
where no destroyer may find us. Which
only must be within the Flashing Skreen
of the Holy Deity or Trinity, where
we may walk in all safety, though the
whole Earth be laid in desolation. Oh
thou mighty Shield of Faith, bear us up
upon thy Wing. Let thy Word (oh Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus)
which saith, Come to me, be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make us tread upon the Sea; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off every boisterous Wave, that
would make us doubt. Now then upon
the broad Rivers, oh mighty God, let us
come to thee, and be afraid of no Flesh,
that would hurt, or oppress. Let thine,
who are environed with the Spirit's
Might, make that only their Anchor-hold
evermore.</p>

               <p>In the Night my Spirit was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
taking in several Ideas of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things into my mind, pressing hard to
pass into the Circle-Door of Life. But a
sweet still Voice did eccho in me, saying,
That pure thing only, which through
this Circle-Eye of Eternity did come
down into Nature, can be the Door of
Entrance again, as it circleth in its Blood-Life,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:29870:266"/>
and thereby raise up it self, and
quicken it self into such a Spirituality, as
ye need to ask no leave to enter back to
your own proper Place, from whence
your immortal part did proceed. For
now the Eye that is fixed in you, will be
both your Guide, and Entrance hereinto,
if ye in Union will ever more with it
keep, and concur with it. Then it shall
carry, and lodge you in the Bosom-Circle
of Eternity, as in a fiery Chariot.
The four Wheels upon which this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
doth move, are Faith, Hope, Joy and
Peace. These will bear away the Lilly
Branch to be planted, where it may green
and never fade, because the River of
Life runneth there evermore. Oh when
shall we be severed by this Chariot; who
would see it gladly, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thy Heart, dear Jesus, is towards
us, and that thou wilt live no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

this Circle-Eye, but in this Flaming Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
that doth move upon four Wheels.
Let not the principal Agent be wanting,
but that all may concur together in us
by that Ghostly Might, that may give a

               <p>Great eagerness of Soul was renewed,
for the passing in through the Needle-Eye
of the Glorified Humanity. The Zeal and
Love did wonderfully hereunto concur, so
as to devour and eat up all those strong
Reasonings of Contradiction, that else
would be working in the Mind. From
which being in a good degree cleared,
through the Mystery of Faith, working
by the Spirits operation, great calmness
of Mind was known. In which time the
Circle-Eye did open again, encompassing
me round with waving white Clouds, and
one did descend and did pass through the
bright Circle, as an Arrow for swiftness,
in the Figure of a clear Body, with a
Branch in his Hand, the Leaves whereof
were shining as Gold, the Fruits were as
a Cluster, were in variety of Fruits
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:29870:267"/>
were growing together. It was reached
out, and a Voice did after the manner of
a Spirit speak, saying, This is Fruit from
the Tree of Life, that is now planted in
the Land of <hi>Beulah:</hi> Eat hereof and give
forth, and be blessed in it for ever. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
I did feel sensibly a little strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Virtue come in, which I would
have conveyed to another after a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Spiritual way, that was at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
While I was in thoughtfulness
hereupon, the same Person was presented
to me, as if he had already hereof par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
for there was strengthning Meat
given into his Hand, wherewithal I did
see him feed a Bird, that flew gaping to
him, being all craving and hungry, chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still as it was fed at his Hand.</p>

            <div type="vision">
               <head>December the 21st. 1677.</head>
               <p>After all which, I was to attend the
Effects of every such presentation. This
Morning I found my Mind wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for Introversion. Upon which
the Vision was more opened unto me.
For the Spirit did talk with me, telling
me, that this was a manifestation to shew
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:29870:268"/>
the Care, Love, and Friendship of our
mighty Throne-Prince, who does as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convey the transmuting fruit invisibly
from himself as the Tree of Life. That
so the introduced Birth of Spirit might
grow and encrease, it being its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
nourishment, without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live, till it come up to a strong mans
degree. For that which is born of God
doth feed only upon what may transform
into a God-like Being. Which is the
Lord Christs office and business to heig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
up to that, that so there might not be
any loss sustained, by the fall of the first
<hi>Adam,</hi> in those who by this living Word
are quickned again unto Life. For it was
opened unto me, that none could be
capable of this high kind of feeding, but
those in whom Christ was spiritually
formed. For this was all spicy, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
virtual power, to bring forth such
Celestial new Creatures, as may ascend
up with the same swiftness, as that Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim
which did come down. For it
was said to such who are changed all
Spiritual, that inviting Word doth stand
for ever good, whosoever will, to them
the Door stands open to come themselves,
and take of the Tree of Life most freely.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:29870:268"/>
And they will have the honour to bring
down, and give forth Heavenly Tasts,
and from their divine Bodies will go forth
the healing Virtue: As it was opened to
me, that these Golden Leaves had in
them the Balsamick Cure, to restore to
a perfect divine Body, where from all
Soveraign Power should proceed imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culately,
according to that high state,
which our Lord is now in, in the Body
of Glory. Therefore this Counsel and
Word of Comfort was given, that we
should here cast the Anchor of Hope, for
the passing through every Door of our
own Senses, till we had got beyond the
Vail of Flesh, into the Circle-Body of the
Holy Ghost, which is appointed for our
present Mansion and Dwelling. Where
no more working Source shall open to
disturb our Peace and Joy. Our Life
sustainment shall be effected, by the holy
Seraphim day by day, till the half time
shall fully be expired. Then it is given
me to see, and to believe, that guarded
along we shall be out of the Wilderness,
by this Angel of God's presence, who
hath promised, he will not leave us, but
see us safe within the Everlasting Gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:29870:269"/>This is only the charge, that is left us
to observe at present, that we keep the
Inward Court of our Minds from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
things, and as hollowed Vessels to
take in, what from God's own Table,
as a daily portion is sent in. Who will
never fail to give, what shall seal us for
the day of this full redeeming Power.
Therefore upon this promise we are to
hope, and quietly wait; for he will come
with the shout of a King to the pure and
Virgin-Spirit, wherein Love and Faith
have looked for him. Therefore be not
weary, not faint in your minds; for to
you the Son of Righteousness will appear
for full Salvation.</p>

with all vehemency, lest the Spark of

Who in bindings, and spiritual

with me, therefore obliged to be fellow-helpers

and this Word on his behalf was given in,
saying; I have heard the bemoaning of

Spirits have been working, but they shall
all be broken as a Potters Vessel, while

should have no part with her in divine

that it was not the Time, nor the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
revealed yet, how they should be
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:29870:271"/>
overturned. God had permitted her,
though a Lamb of Christ's Fold, to be
sifted and tryed through the opening of
a Center, from whence Spirits did strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus prophecy, as to the time and
manner, and did upon her Spirit impress
the time, and so deceived her herein. The
Lord restore her, and give her a more
distinct discerning of Spirits, from the
several Centers, from which Sounds and
Voices do proceed. <hi>The Kingdom of
Love,</hi> cryed the Voice in me, <hi>is that

raise up, to be eminent for trust, in the

the Design of this Passage is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that of the Author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, when he represents
the Great and True <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> to be
<hi>without Father, without Mother, without
Descent.</hi> Which cannot be understood
any otherwise then of an earthly Father
and Mother, and an Earthly Descent,
it being immediately afterward added,
<hi>having neither beginning of Days, nor
End of Life.</hi> The which Words can
by no wise be applicable to his Outward
Corporeal Birth from the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
Wherefore the Apostle herein directs
them to look for another Genealogy, and
higher Descent; while he seems to take
away for the present (or rather to pass
over) the former. So that he would
not have them to fix their <hi>Eye</hi> upon his
Temporal Generation in an Elementary
Form which had both beginning of
Days; and end of Time, but rather to
look to the Generation which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Time from the Eternal Father,
through the Womb of the Morning;
from whence all Angelical and Human
Spirits were afterwards produced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call'd <hi>Sons of the Morning,</hi> that is of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:29870:275"/>
the Immortal, Virgin, Heavenly Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or Matrix. Which Celestial Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
being overclouded in many of the
Angels, through their <hi>Tartarosis,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in seeking to sink
themselves into their own Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Will, that so they might be as
<hi>Elohim;</hi> by Precipitating their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Forces from the Centre of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will, and going forth from a proper
Centre of their own: and also in
all the Human Race, through the
Birth of <hi>Eve,</hi> entring into the Lust and
Strife of the Elements, deluded hereto
by the Seven-Headed Serpent; cannot
possibly reappear till the Seven Heads,
Powers, or Forms of the Serpent be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<hi>Bruised</hi> or Crushed. This is to
be done in each particular Soul, which
hath within it self as the Kingdom of
Heaven, so also the Kingdom of Hell, as
it were in miniature; before there can
be an Attainment of that Person to the
Redemption of the Body, which is the
visible Adoption, Recognition, and Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sons and Daughters of God.
And it is likewise to be done in the
whole Church Universally, by the Seed
of Immortality flowing through the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:29870:275"/>
Glorious Humanity of <hi>IESVs.</hi> Which
Seed as it raised up his mortal Body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
also but raise up, in due time, all
his Members: and cause the vanished
Image once more to appear, and the
Lustre of their first Nativity from God
to shine forth, as without any Cloud.
Wherefore let the Reader remember
this Caution, not at all to look Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
or to seek here or there after
Particularities or Personalities, which
will nothing avail him to know, and
probably may do him great Hurt: but
to retire into the inward Depth
of his own Heart, that he may there
come to know such a Birth from out
of the Womb of the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
Mother, as is so much spoken of in these
Writings, and may be a Witness of the
trampling down the Serpents Power
and Polity. Then would he not be
Solicitous about whom should be first
Honour'd by Christ with the Marks of
his Refurrection, but would endeavour
to press forward to it, by the only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
Emulation of Humility, Love,
and Faith. That if possible he may
arrive to the Right of the First-born
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:29870:276"/>
Heirs of God in the <hi>Melchisedeckian</hi> Line.
And then also would he clearly see, that
nothing that is here said tends to the
Lesseuing, but to the Greatening rather,
and extending the Merit of <hi>IESVS the</hi>
Son of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>True</hi>
Christ, Blessed and Adored for ever:
to whom every Knee both in Heaven,
and in Earth, and under the Earth shall
bow and Confess him that is, that was,
and that is to come.</p>
