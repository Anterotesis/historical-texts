            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Reſteth yet two obiections againes the ſtabilitie of the kirk in al veritie.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19327:36"/>
The firſt is, that the particulaire kirk may erre, whilk may be ſchawen by manie exemples: &amp; therfor the kirk catholik and vniuerſal may erre. The ſecond is, that the kirk Catholik is repreſented by a general concel: but the general concel may erre, and hes erred: Then the catholik and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal kirk may erre. To confirme the firſt obiection they collect againes the Iewes kirk the faultis committed frome the beginning of the warld to our Lords tyme: to the whilk albeet it be eaſie to anſwer, yet becauſe it is not our queſtion, wha ar ſpeeking of the Chriſtian kirk, I wil paſſe it for the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as making no thing agans ws. I ſay only that they ſal not be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil to ſchaw anie errour in the Iewes kirk approuued by publik conſent. For the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of death pronunced by Caiphas aganes our Lord was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayeserroniouſe of it ſelf, (if we wald
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19327:36"/>
lay aſyd the wicked mynd wherfra it proceded) ſeing it was according to our Maiſters will <hi>(qui paſſus eſt, quiae voluit)</hi> and Gods awen decreit of his infinit mercy and loue towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd. And S. Iohne approueth it as coming of the holy ſpirit, wha pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by the mouth of an wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man. The words of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ar thir: <hi>But one of them named Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Io. 11. 49.</note> 
               <hi>being the high preeſt of that year, ſaid to them, yovv knavv nothing, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo yovv conſider that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for vvs that one man die for the poeple, and the vvholl nation perish not. And this he ſaid not of him ſelf, but being high prieſt of that year, he prophecied that Jeſus shuld die for the nation, and not only for the nation, but gather into one the children of God, that vvar deſperſed.</hi> wherby we may vnderſtand the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the decreit, notwithſtanding the wickednes of the inſtrument.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19327:37"/>
God bliſſeth his people by Balaams mouth: but this is maire ſolemne, <note place="margin">Nom. 23.</note> ſeing that IESVS CHRIST is put in poſſeſſion of his inheritance by the ſentence and decreit of the ſynagoge pronunced by Caiphas at that time high prieſt, Chriſt being declaired to be hee, wha was to redeame the warld with his death, by the whilk the ſacrifice of Aaron was to tak end, the ſynagoge hauing reſigned oueral right to the true heire, &amp; that by a general conſent, to the Iewes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and inexcuſable condemnation.</p>
            <p>As to the reſt of the argument it followeth not. The particulaire may erre, ergo the general may erre: For the partes (whilk ar as it war particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laires) of the elements do perish eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts notwithſtanding doeth remaine, yea and recouuer at one ſyd, what they loſſe at the other: for it is impoſſible that the hail ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19327:37"/>
can perish all at one tyme, I meine naturallie.</p>
            <p>So we ſee men die euerie day and that in great nomber at ſome times, yet becauſe there commeth others in their place, man can not perish alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe God hes bliſſed him, and all leuing things by theis words <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini.</hi> Ariſt. wald haue anſwered <hi>homo non moritur, ſed hic homo.</hi> And whilk is maire, as man in particulaire remaining man, that is, retening the nature &amp; proprieties of man, can not die (for if he die he ceſſeth to be man) ſo the particulaire kirk remaining kirk, that is remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the doctrine, vnion, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholik kirk, can not erre: for if she fal in errour of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine generally receaued and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, outdrawing hir ſelf frome the holie Catholik kirk, shee is no maire kirk, but as à dead body poſſeſſed by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19327:38"/>
ſchiſme and hereſie. But if shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in obedience and vnion with the Catholique kirk, albeet shee be aſſaulted with anie ſeiknes, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any wound of errour, yet by the lyf, ſtrenth, and health of the hail body of the Catholik kirk, shee may recouuer hir health. Euen as we ſee the finger being cut of the body, the interne and inward forme being loſt, it loſſeth the nature of à finger, althoght the material part remaineth as before: But remaining ioyned and vnite with the body, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding any infirmitie or wound, it may be cured &amp; hailled, by reaſon of the lyf &amp; health of the reſt of the body with the whilk it is conioyned. A greene tree by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſtormie wind, froſt or ſeaſon of year may tyne the leefis, or branches ſome tyme, whilk the ſpring or ſpace of tym will bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but if the ſtok be rotten or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19327:38"/>
drawen out of the ground, ther is no hoppe of leefis, meakelles of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. he moſt plant an other tree, wha wald ſee leeſis or branches there againe: whilk experience can not be ſoght in the kirk: For IESVS CHRIST wil plant no other; and I knaw not wha culd tak the charge in his place. for it hehoued him to do better then our Lord hes do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne before him, wher by the promiſes maid to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kirk might ons be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished, ſeing that Chriſts kirk hes failled by interruption, as they ſay: whilk can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be, notwithſtanding the faill of ſome partes, prouyding the parties noble keip their integritie: but they being loſt, there is no moyen to ſett wp againe that kirk; they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſett wp an other, if they haue receaued that power. And this far for the firſt obiection.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond we receaue the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19327:39"/>
propoſition as good and true, if they vnderſtand à general concel laufully called, halden, concluded, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: for doubtlesſic à concel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the Catholik and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal kirk, whilk we beleef can not erre: but that ſic concels heserred or culd erre, we deny plainlie. Yet to proue their ſaying, they alledge that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels ar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire one to an other, whilk cannot be but errour of one, or baith the parties. And farther, concels hes corrected concels, as ſayeth S. Aug. but correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſay they) preſupponeth errour: for the proofe of the firſt they bring exemples at her of particulaire and prouincial ſynods agains gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concels; or conuenticuls of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks agains à general, or els concels ſuſpect and diſawoued agains à lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and general: Wherfor that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing againes ws, no maire, then maketh againiſt the authoritie

There can not be anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction in à kings or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moune Weatlh edicts, or actes, for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, or agreing together the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of particulaire towns or ſchyrs, or for condemning of rebelles, and their famouſe libelles: or by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of actes neuer approued by his forfathers; yea nor for changing of anything of policie in à better form being admoniſt by good experience, althoght it haid bein otherwayes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19327:40"/>
by à parliament before; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyding the mattres of them ſelf war indifferent. Where it is to be notted firſt, that we ſpeck here of general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and not of particulaires, whilk as they may erre, ſo aught they to be corrected by the generals (as meineth S. Auguſtin aganiſt the Donatiſts) if there be anie thing wrang. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it is to be notted, that this diſput ſuld be takin of thinges appertining and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſubſtance of the faith, wher there can be no changing or varietie, meakelles contrarietie: for it that is ons veritie remaineth ay veritie, becauſe the veritie is but one, whilk may be maid maire clear and plaine, not changed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire. But things appertining to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ciuil diſcipline, commoune po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and ceremonies, becauſe they touch ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times but ſingulaire mens actions, or certaine contrayes &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19327:40"/>
or els ar maid by reaſon of the tym; not onlie may they be changed, the circumſtances being takin away, but ſome tym of neceſſitie man be changed, except men wilfullie wuld tyn all: of whilk things S. Aug. may be underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for it is certaine he culd not vnderſtand of mattres of faith, ſeing in his dayes there was but tw a general concels halden (except ye wil compt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel halden by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles at Ieruſalem for one) the firſt of Nice, and the firſt of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, whilk with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent ar eſtimed to be without errour, &amp; ſo culd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue correction the an, frome the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thridlie it is to be notted that we vnderſtand the only concluſions, whilk ar takin in the general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, &amp; not al things whilk ar do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne or ſaid during the tyme the concels haldeth, as in diſputes and conference; whilk things procedeth of men, and may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19327:41"/>
therfore be conioyned with errour: and ſo can ſerue for na argument agains our ſentence. Althoght the matter requireth an maire ample diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (if our intention haid bein to expone this ſubiect at lenth) yet this may ſerue for the preſent.</p>
            <p>But or I paſſe farther I wald pray yow not to miſtak me in my former diſcourſe (for I ſee many miſtaken in the ſame matter) as if I wald thruſt doune, and tread vnder foot, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the authoritie of the holie ſcriptures, by hauing recourſe to the kirk in ſeiking the true ſence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: we acknawlege them baith in equall dignitie, veritie &amp; certaintie, becauſe they ar baith of the holie ſpirit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their vertue and force of him, as the Ambaſſadour and Ambaſſede or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion of the King or prince wha ſendeth them. The an derogateth no thing to the other: for if there be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19327:41"/>
anie thing obſcure in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, why may we not ask the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours iudgment without anie preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his commiſſion? or rather as appertining to him, why shal we not ask his iudgment? for the lettres often times ar verie ſchorte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tining ſommerlie the matter, who is maire ample declaration is referred to the Ambaſſadour, wha for that cauſe is ſent with lettres of credit, he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes not being neceſſaire, becauſe the lettres might do all, except they might not authoriz them ſelfs.</p>
            <p>The kirk is Gods Ambaſſadour ſent to declaire his will, hauing the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for lettres of commiſſion and credet, &amp; that in maiſt ample for me; as we haue ſchawen before: why shal not hir voice be hard before al others in declairing the true meaning of hir commiſſion? shal I ask at anie other why shee was ſent? The kirk &amp; the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19327:42"/>
ſcriptures ar twa lauful ſiſters of one father, none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuld be caſſin out, <hi>Alterius ſic poſcit ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>res &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurat amicè.</hi> Therefor Sanct Auguſtin ſayeth, <note place="margin">To. 7. con.

So without anie preference we proue the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the kirk, and by hir alſo the true ſence of them, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion and the intelligence therof, is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Ambaſſadour.</p>
            <p>IESVS CHRIST proued him ſelf to be the true Meſſias promiſſed to the Iewes, and that by the prophetes and law: becauſe all things war com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleet in him, that war foreſpokin by them to be in the true Meſſias. The ſame was donne by the Apoſtles and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19327:42"/>
is donne now euerie day agains the Iewes: yet it is not to be concluded that the prophetes and law ar prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our Lord. It is inough that the witnes be of ſufficient credet and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the parties. If any man refuſe this dignitie to the kirk, I wil pray him pardon me, if I ſay he doeth that whilk Satan deſyreth maiſt: for he laboreth to tak away the three thing is whilk onlie doeth aſſure ws of our Maiſter &amp; Lord IESVS CHRIST, to wit, the kirk, ſcriptures and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: whilk may be eaſelie ſeine: for the kirk being eſtimed à liar, &amp; worthie of na credet, what can be thoght of the ſcriptures &amp; miracles, whilk we knaw by the kirk only: but if the kirk be (as shee ſuld) of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authoritie with al true chiſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thois thinges can not be called in doubt. And why ſuld not hir depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be hard, or rather hir iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

receaued, in whatſomeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion, as à thing apperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning iuſtlie to hir, and whilk shee may better knaw then any other, by reaſon of the ſtrait alliance betwixt hir head and ſpouſe IESVS CHIRST and hir? Shal euerie man knaw the will of the Lord, and ſenſe of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, &amp; his deare ſpouſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shalbe ignorant?

And in very deed, neane of thes new factiouſe ſectes can haue credet till they haue perſnaded their

auditours that the ſpouſe of our Lord is an vnworthy lear. O blaſphemouſe toungis, and foolish hearars, wha ſo rashlie geueth credet, to an thing of it ſelf ſo incredible, &amp; ſo perniſiouſe when it is receaued. Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ws to hear the kirk, Knox and Caluin forbeddeth ws, &amp; wil, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low only the ſcriptures, that is, theirs or out awin iudgement.

            <p>Now if we ſuld preferre the kirk to the ſctiptures (whilk we do not, althoght we preferre hir to priuat mens interpretation forged now of new, whilk when we contemne and

am aſſured that the Miniſters wil not ſuffer within their iuriſdiction anie man to ſtart wp at his awin hand of his particulaire and priuat authority making aſſembles apart, althoght he ſuld preach the ſame doctrine, and adminiſtrat the ſacramentes in the ſam fashion grounded on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, now receaued by the hail Miniſterie of Scotland; whilk confeſſion they force, or wald force al men to ſubſcribe.

nature of the ſchiſme is ſic, that as the diuiſion of anie member frome the body, bringeth certaine death &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of lyf (whilk can not be haid but in, and with the haill) ſo doeth ſchiſme in the kirk, to him wha is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyded frome the kirk.

            <p>But to retourne to our propos, it is altogether requiſed, that the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp; lawful power be ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in thes, wha wald co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand and rule in the houſe of God: the law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ws al ſubiect &amp; equal: the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie (whilk ſuld be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by him, wha hes it) maketh the diſtinction &amp; difference betwixt ws, and geueth charge to an aboue the otheris: for what domination or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>In this general, I doubt not but the Miniſters and I wil agree verie eaſely: For I ſee Beza one of their brethring auoueth that none ſuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, or <note place="margin">denotis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae</note> haue charge in the houſe of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſic as ar ſent by God, whilk ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he wil haue rueled according to the order whilk God him ſelf hes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtableshed in his kirk, and thinketh it nowayes lauful to anie man to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat this order: yet that our Lord and Maiſter is not bound thereto, but may diſpone on the houſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he thinketh beſt, notwithſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this order; if in caſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be entred in the place of order, that is, if the ordinaire vocation eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by him ſelf in the perſonnes of the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſours, shal faill &amp; inlaik (whilk, as we haue prouen before, can not be) for laick

I wil weal it be ſo (for namaſuld or can deny that ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane power to IESVS CHRIST, althoht it be brought in here vpon an abſurd ſuppoſition, if true paſtours inlaik) prouyding there be no interruption in the gowernement of the kirk, that is, prouyding the kirk neuer want lauful paſtours neceſſaire for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Chriſts myſtical body, whilk is but one, &amp; can not ſuffer ſo euident co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uulſion: for by diuiſion it man be twa bodyes. whilk muſt be if the extraordinaire ſucced not inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the ordinaire, when he shall inlaik.

            <p>Lat ws then ſpeek of this vocation, ſeing it is ſo neceſſaire that without it the charge can not be weal donne.

            <p>This power and vocation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">de notis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae &amp; c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.

The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaire lauful (ſayeth he) conſiſteth in certain rules ordinat by God, whilk ar three: to wit Examination &amp; tryal of doctrine &amp; maners: Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maid by the kirk: And Impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands or ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Lat ws apply thes three rules to the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Knox, Caluin or Luther: for if it be not found lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; iuſt in the firſt authour, in the reſt it can not be better; <hi>Quod ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio non valuit, tractu temporis conualeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere non poteſt.</hi> The langar that vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leſteth, the worſe. Now to ſay that anie of them haid their calling of the Catholik &amp; Romainekirk (as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19327:57"/>
ſome do is ſay, when they ar preſſed to ſchaw their halding) it is no thing to the propos; for the Miniſters, to lat the warld vnderſtand that they will not ſerue them ſelfs therewith, will haue al men refuſe &amp; abiure al right they may haue by the Paip and kirk of Rome: as may be ſeine in their confeſſion of faith. And Caluin with the reſt of the Miniſters of Geneua wald not ſuffer the Bishopes of Troy and Neuers (wha leeſing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik kirk flaid to them) in any wayes to preach til they haid abiured al po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer receaued before, &amp; taken of new their commiſſion and authoritie of the Miniſters, becauſe in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the former was not lauful. And in veritie the vocation comming of the kirk of Rome can ſerue them to no propos. For ather it was good or not: If it was good, doubles they haue loſt it by their ſchiſme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19327:57"/>
ſeing they haue left the kirk, of whome they haid their vocation. The lyf can not be communicatted not extended to members ſeparated from the whol body. No man gaueth power to be abandonatted, nor to arme men &amp; rebelle agains him ſelf, nor to be caſſe out of his a win place: Princes gaueth power to inferiour magiſtrats, but retineth ay ful power to them ſelfs, to diſcharge or punish all rebellious perſonnes whatſoeuer degree or preheminance they haue within the realme. the higher place the greater fal, &amp; greuouſer paines to follow therevpon. <hi>Potentes potenter torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta patientur.</hi> If it was not good it was null of it ſelf, of no valour in the gauer, &amp; ſo nul in the receauer on force they man think ſo, if they wil abyd at the firſt principe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to wit, that the Paip is the great Antichriſt: whilk ground if it war
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19327:58"/>
true (as it is maiſt falſe) it behoved their vocation to be null: for what cometh of the Antichriſt (wha shalbe as it war Satans eldeſt ſonne) muſt come of Satan: as whatſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of IESVS CHRIST commeth of God, becauſe he is Gods eldeſt &amp; onlie naturall ſonne. Wherfore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ordinaire calling of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Romaine kirk, it followeth that they haue neane at al. for if they haid anie of the Catholik kirk (as in deed ſom of them haid being prieſts) they loſt it by their ſchiſme, and can haue neane from any other, but from them ſelfs. And ſo I may ſay of him whaſoeuer shalbe firſt amongs them, that whilk Optatus Mileuitanus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth of Victor firſt bishope of the Donatiſtes: <hi>Erat ibi filius ſine patre, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro ſine principe, diſcipulus ſine magiſtro, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens ſine antecedente, inquilinus ſine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, hoſpes ſine hoſpitio, paſtor ſine grege.</hi>

Lat wstak anie of them, whatſoeuer he be, and we shal ſee it to be ſo: For as to the examination &amp; tryal of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, wha culd exame him, ſeing he haid no man aboue him, nor of higher power. And farther that proue culd not be maid vpon the firſt, ſeing he was the finderout of the doctrine, he preached: wherfor it was vnknawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to others, ſo they culd not exame him there vpon. ſure I am that they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19327:59"/>
wil not aſcribe this examination to the people ſeing the people ſuld be teached and examinated, not teach and examine: but of this ſchortlie at maire lenth. As to the maners, I find not that a nie of them war angels, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of thes wha hes followed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, I ſay no farther, I excuſe not the faults &amp; vyce of the cleargie; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das might tyn the Apoſtolat, he culd not defyl it, meekel leſſe tak it away or mak it inutile in others.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the libre &amp; free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the perſone examinat, maid with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent &amp; knawledge of the kirk where he fuld exercice that charge &amp; function. This can not be found in the firſt and ring leaders of this new kirk: for what kirk culd choiſe them ſeing they war before their kirk: for they wha leued in thos dayes knew no ſie doctrine, nor doctours; and ſwa nather culd exame the doctrine

nor elect the perſonnes, whois opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions war ſo new at that tyme, that they war not yet hard of.</p>
            <p>But ye will ſay that their doctrine was maiſt ancient of it ſelf, althoght not knawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo publikly.

But to retourn to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos: this ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of paſtoures culd not com of the people, becauſe at the beginning of this new religion al the people was Catholik, &amp; knew no ſic doctrine nor doctours, &amp; ſo culd not mak the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſtors wha war firſt actors of this tragedie. Mairouer Beza in his <note place="margin">Epſt. theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. 83.</note> epiſtles ſeimeth nowayes to approue this populaire forme of gowerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the kirk. Wherefore ſeing the firſt Miniſters nather haid Examination, Election nor Ordination, or Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, it may be eaſelie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they haid no lauful ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire calling, and ſo culd not gif any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19327:64"/>
true vocation or calling to others, becauſe they haid it not them ſelfis.</p>
            <p>Lat ws go forward. the Catholik kirk (ſay they) hes tynt the ordinaire vocation, and they haue found the extraordinaire. We haue tynt one thing, and they haue found an other; it is iuſtly reanco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tered with our tinſal. But ſeing they haue not found our gear, we can pretend no right therto: ſo as we pretend no right to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaire calling, they can prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no tytill to our ordinaire, as ſaid is.</p>
            <p>They ar called and ſent extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nairly (ſay they) to gowern the kirk of God: if their vocation be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair it paſſeth the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the order Apoſtolik: For how can it be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolik without continuation ſince the Apoſtles, not hauing beginning nor authoritie of their vocation. If the race and ſucceſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles be loſſed, why waunt they them
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19327:64"/>
ſelfis to follow the Apoſtles? at leeſt they follow them not in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore: the tytils and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Apoſtles can ſerue them for no thing. They muſt ſchaw their new halding, ſeing the ancient tytles ar expyred and rune out; if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth no man hauing the right of the Apoſtles the, Miniſters can not haue it. We muſt ſee their new charters paſſed vnder the great ſeel of IESVS CHRIST marcked with miracles wroght by the holy ſpirit: if they can ſchaw anie ſic thing, it will put them out of trouble, and ws out of doubt, and tak away al ſchadow of excuſe, whilk otherwayes we might iuſtlie pretend for our diſobèdience.</p>
            <p>But in good conſcience may we cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det them, wha with their ſimple word wald mak ws beleue that the ancient ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apoſtles is perished? Shal I not think (if that be true) that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19327:65"/>
the tribe of Leui was mair deare to God, then the ſpiritual poſteritie of the Apoſtles, yea then the poſteritie of IESVS CHRIST him ſelf, out of who is ſeedes mouth, the veritie ſuld <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 21.</note> neuer depart. shal it ſerue for nothing that that wynzard was planted with our Maiſters awin hand, boght with his death, nurished by his Apoſtles, watred with their blood, &amp; with the blood of ſo manie thowſand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, keeped by the aſſiſtence of the holie ſpirit, in the learned and Godlie fathers, &amp; in their poſteritie? Shal the order of Aaron be ſo far preferred to the order of Melchiſedech? the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the ſpirit, the figure to the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and man to God? Shal the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue the honour to haue reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the kirk, whilk the holie ſpirit by his negligence haid tynt? their onlie hand hes halde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord in his right: Weal, geuing and not granting that

our Maiſter haid tynt his inheritance in this warld for à tyme throgh negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his officers, or rather by their malice &amp; knaverie: he hes caſt them out: he hes placed in their place and charge others, more worthie. Yet or I ſee their letters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, I wald glaidlie knaw why they war geuen: for it culd not be à light cauſe whilk moued God to geue à new charge. They wil ſay, perchance, to reforme the kirk, &amp; tak away the manifold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes that war baith in the doctrine and maners. A iuſt reaſon truelie &amp; à charge worthie of eternal memorie and thankes, and maiſt neceſſaire (if it be true) to be put in execution, for the publik good, ſaluation of many ſauls and (whilk is the principal) for Gods glorie, and he to be praiſed &amp; loued wha doeth his duety in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſame: But with what ſinceritie and Godlie dealling it hes

If they feared the peſt, or rather the iuſt punition, I excuſe their flight, yet can not praiſe them, that they choiſed rather to ſeall their doctrine with other mens blood nor with their awin. But to paſſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaire ſtoutnes (whilk hes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to ryf the kirk in peeces by

If there was no kirk at all, when they come, their commiſſion was in vaine &amp; ſerued for nothing: they ſuld haue paſſed bak &amp; taken an other, to mak wp &amp; buld of new à kirk, and not to reform that whilk was not: for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation preſupponeth à ſubiect and matter laicking ſomething neceſſair to the perfection: ſo their procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if there was no kirk) was nul of

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19327:69"/>
Lat ws ſee the great ſeall and mark of this extraordinair calling, that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and winderful warks aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we may knaw that it is God wha ſent them, and that it is his wil we receaue them with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and obedience. I knaw they wil anſwer me here, that they ar not obliſt to bring miracles, ſeing they teach no new doctrin. I pray al good &amp; Godlie Chriſtians conſider if this be à propre anſwer &amp; to the propos: For firſt they tak that for à proofe, whilk is in controuerſie betwixt the parties, as is ouer euidentlie knawen: for we ſay (as we shal be hable to proue by them ſelfis) that the doctrine they teach now is new, at leeſt in many heades of controuerſies, Secondlie the propheres, wha broght miracles, broght no new doctrine, other wayes they culd not haue bein receaued, the law being ſo formell agains them.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19327:69"/>
Thridlie it man be new to ws, ſeing that nather we, nor anie of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers before Knox euer hard of it in our contray. Laſt of all, we ſeak miracles for their alledged extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair &amp; marveilous calling, &amp; not for their doctrine, whilk can not be true, ſeing it is ſo new, the veritic being ſo auld. Our Maiſter &amp; Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth ws in matters of religion to obey his kirk: and obey &amp; acknawledge none other. Why shal we now heare the Miniſters without anie aſſurence of their charge and commiſſion, ather ordinaire or extraordinaire? If anie man wald ask of the ſubiectes of à noble man (wha war out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray) the mailles &amp; dueties, alledging he haid commiſſion of their maiſter: Wald they not iuſtlie anſwer, that their maiſter before his parting out of the contray, haid put order to all his affaires giuing charge to certaine

Now there come neuer anie prophete for ſo weaghtie à matter as this, for whilk, they ſay, that they ar come, to wit, to reſtore the ſpouſe to IESVS CHRIST, the body to the head, to mak à new flock to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinlie

If à ſimple alledgence of reformation be à ſufficient varrand, we shall haue in continent good ſtore of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and extraordinaire paſtours to correct, or rather to corrupt, the harl warld.

But if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other thing requiſit to haue and procure credet, whateuer is neceſſair in one is neceſſaire in all, ſeing there can be no authoritie and power but in the ordinaire: becauſe it onlie was ſufficientlie authorized by IESVS CHRIST, and executed by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (wha receaued it immediatlie of

            <p>Some anſwereth that it is à great miracle and ſufficient to proue Gods wil and pleaſour, that in ſo ſchort à tyme they haue drawen ſo manie to them frome the kirk of Rome.

            <p>I knaw ſome, for defence of the Miniſters, ſayeth that their vocation is nather altogether ordinaire, nor altogether extraordinaire, <hi>partem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens ab vtroq.</hi> that is (when al is weal conſidered) nather the one nor the other.

            <p>But is it poſſible that they wil ſerue them with the kirk of Rome, ſeing they haue taken for à ground of their religion and lauful cauſe of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that the Paipe is the great Antechriſt?

               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:19327:84"/>
ther man be there power to mak à pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour. Sua where there be twa or three in anie houſe they muſt conſtitut à à paſtour to them ſelf, and ſo change al priuat houſes in kirkes, contraire to that, whilk we ſee now in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where kirks ar turned in priuat hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Mairouer if that war the ſenſe of Chriſtes wordes, it ſuld appertine to the people to cal the paſtours, whilk the Miniſters of Scotland verie wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as yet hes never approued. And laſt of al, this culd mak no thing for the firſt Miniſter, wha being allone culd not be elected by twa or three.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding of al this, I will giue and ſuppon in this matter alſe far as I can without preiudice of the veritie. I wil ſo enter for the preſent to receaue the extraordinaire voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whilk with reaſon can not be receaued, except it haue à verie good warrand) if it can ſerue ws to anie vſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19327:84"/>
as I fear it can not do: For if ſo many hondreth yeares vnion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik doctrine can not ſerue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ws in our ordinaire right, how shal ſo many hondreth day lie confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions iuſtile maintaine them in their extraordinaire vſurpation? But to what vſe can their extraordinair cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſerue ws, althoght we wald re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it? There be maire then à hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth diverſe religions (atleeſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions vſurping the name of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) everie one condemning an other, &amp; aſcriving to it ſelf that glorious title of true extraordinaire calling vnder pretence of the pure &amp; true word of God, and adminiſtration of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. What shal I do in this great confuſed multitude, where neine can ſtand ſeure, except al his compagno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be declared vſurpers &amp; fals prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? Ye will ſay perchance that the Miniſters of Scotland hes neene of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19327:85"/>
thes ſectes amongs them, where of they ar verie glaid. I wil not for the preſent conteſt therevpon. But ſure I am, that they wha hes not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Scotlandis religion amongs them, ar alſe glaid, and ſindrie, wha hes it, wald be glaid to be quyt therof. I may truelie ſay with an ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſpeeking of the philoſophers of his tyme, that all theis ſectes may be falſe, but ſure I am there can be but one true. If al can not be true, whome shall I credet? Whome shall I follow? I can not credet nor follow them all, ſeing they ar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traire, every one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning an other. The chooſe muſe be difficil, ſeing that everie one ſayeth ſtoutlie that he hes the trueth. Everie man pretendeth the verity, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſcriptures, confereth place with place, confirmeth his awen opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (if ye wil beleeue him) ſolidlie and refuteth all others ſufficientlie.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19327:85"/>
But if ye will credet all the reſt, he ſayeth nothing to the propos, except ſo far as he agreeth with every one of them in particulaire.</p>
            <p>Swa whaſoeuer will agree with any of them, muſt on force diſagree with manie. And yet there can be but one trueth: &amp; if we wil beleue the greateſt parte of them, neane of them hes the trueth: becauſe for one wha affirmeth he haith the trueth, there be an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth wha gainſayeth him. For every one of them alledgeth that al the reſt goeth wrang, whilk is verie eaſie to be beleued, becauſe the Catholique kirk ſayeth the ſame of them all, shee being, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they war not to ſay the lyk of hir. And how can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment think otherwayes of them? We ſee the ſcripture taken by them al for an ordinaire proofe of their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaire calling: it ſpeeketh (as they ſay) in al their fauoures. Yet can we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19327:86"/>
not be of ſo manie religions: nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knawledge or obey ſo many paſtours of ſa extraordinair &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But ye wil ſay that he ſuld be receaued, followed &amp; obeyed, wha agreeth beſt with the ſcripturs. That is maiſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, if it can be knawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But who is iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe taken in the matter? Neane wil heare the Catholique kirk, becauſe they haue left hir: &amp; ſo as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſubiectes can abyd no thing but iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of their ſchiſme and errour.

The craw thinketh hir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen bird faireſt: and vaine men eſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth maiſt of the birth of their awé braine. So shal I be in lyk paine and difficultie, as before, not knawing whome to follow, whome to flee. If they ſay that I muſt read the ſcripturs and follow thois, wha ſtandeth beſt by the veritie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tined therein. What?

Man I be à profound theologue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knaw my paſtoures?

According to this forme, in Scotland the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters following the doctrine of Sir Iohn Knox, or frere Iohn Crag ar thoght to haue à good calling. In En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Bruniſtes, Puritains, &amp; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Luif, or any hid new invented fantaſy, thinketh their paſtors truely called.

            <p>In Almanie there be good ſtore of theis new extraordinair called me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the freedome of the townes maketh manie free vocations: For there they haue liberty to think, ſay, and follow what euerie man pleaſeth.

can not be haid by anie otherway a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges them, wha wil haue the holy ſpirit ſpeeking no farther then he whiſpereth in their eare. True it is that where there is Princes wha com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, the people muſt change their religion with their maiſter: Als lang as their maiſter is Lutheria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they muſt ſay with him: if he changeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion or dieth, they muſt be reddie to receaue ſome other faith. This hes beine ſindrie tymes experimented in that contray. But in free townes as euerie man hes receaued of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preaching, he iudgeth the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſay the ſame, where our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone prouerbe may iuſtly be implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed, as the fool thinketh, the bel clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. If their war publick place in Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for Miniſters of other ſectes, I doubt not but they wald ava<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their cauſe alſo.

without anie acte of parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ty them to à certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of faith (whilk in Almanie hes maid this multitude of extraordinair vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) wald do the lyk amonges ws. How miſerable be the eſtait of Almanie in that diuerſitie of religions, if not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie at leeſt priuatlie, I think euery man knaweth, wha hes beine there. It is maiſt certaine that in ſindry tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there be publicklie profeſſed ten, twelf, yea tuentie or 22. ſindry faithes everie one deteſting an other. As to the priuat opinions, I haid an evident experience my ſelf in our voyage of Italie, retourning to France throgh Almanie the yeare of God 1600. in the moneth of December. For being in Auſburgh (where publik exercice is granted onlie to Catholiques and Lutheria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) we war at the table à good nomber (I think aboue 12) of honeſt, lyk men of diuerſe nations, but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle

maire diuerſe of religions, where one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany maire zelous then the reſt (as it appeared) taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our being at the Iubilee, did ask ſindry curious queſtions there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. A Frenche gentilman, wha was come frome Rome with ws, picked with the matter, mirrilie, &amp; yet cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſlie, did pray the companie, if it might be without their offence to grant him à requeſt, whilk being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, he ſuld anſwer to their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions according to his knawledg, if he fand it agreable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this being proponed ſo diſcreatly and honeſtly (as that nation can do it verie weall) it was not onlie accepted &amp; granted of all the companie, but alſo maid à great ſilence throghout all the table, everie man being deſirous to knaw his requeſt.</p>
            <p>Then hauing thanked them all, I am deſirous (ſayeth he) to knaw what

            <p>Skairſlie haid he ended his propos,

Amonges many notable thinges I hard of him, I remarked this hiſtorie as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirſing the ſingularities of the court of parliament of Paris.</p>
            <p>King Louis the 12. being earneſtly requeſted and prayed by one of his fauorits and greateſt courtiers (wha

The King on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation partly for iuſtice cauſe (of whilk he was verie zelous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for called the father of the people) partlie for the affection he bure to the gentilman, did promiſe him all aſſiſtance, not onlie in ſpeeking to his iudges, but alſo with his awin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, if that might bring anic thing to his right.

hauing entred in the matter with alſe great eloquence, but meakle better right, maid the king firſt to doubt, nixt to incline ſumwhat, and laſt of al to approue ſo his title, that before he haid pleaded out the cauſe, the King burſted out with theis words, <hi>Monſieur le preſident, ils ont tous deux gaigné.

And ſo before the laſt aduocat haid ended, he paſt away. He haid beine verſed in the greatteſt affaires of Europe during his tyme baith in peace and weares, and haid experimented baith good and evill fortune before, and in his regne, yet not being trained wp in matters of law and iudging of proceſe, he was eaſelie moved to baith the ſyddes by eloquence filled wp with appearand reaſones. But as à maiſt worthie and

noble Prince he did acknawledge his awin imperfection, leaving the iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſic affaires to the ordinaire officers of iuſtice, to iudge as they thoght maiſt reaſonable, as wha by lang and daylie experience, great knawledge of the law and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manie difficill actions paſſed by their hands, was ſufficientlie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aganes fraudful craft of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wha eaſelie may circumvine à new iudge.

            <p>This hiſtorie was pronunced with ſic grace and authority that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our diſpute, &amp; pleaſed verie weal the hail companie; and (if I be not deceaued) is not vnpropre to end our preſent diſcours, whilk is of the ſame ſubiect.

ſure I am if this ſubiect haid fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in an eloquent mans hand, that it might haue beine traicted mair quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klie &amp; maire plainly and with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentemente of the reader. I haue done what I culd, and not what I wald, except that in partie I haue done what I wald, ſeing I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin to the ſimple &amp; vnlearned as I culd and according to my poſſibilitie, I knaw not if according to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. Howſoeuer it be I wil pray the good reader to tak my panes in good part. Perchance ſom other ſory to ſee a good cauſe ſo vnſkilfully ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled by me, wil tak occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do it, as it ſuld be done. whilk wilbe very eaſy to many learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whilks therbe guid no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
