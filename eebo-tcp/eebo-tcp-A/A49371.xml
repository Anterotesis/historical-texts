            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Loyalty and Glory of the City of BATH: BEING A True and Perfect Relation of the Wonderful Ceremony, and Tranſactions, that were lately performed there.</head>
            <p>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <l>A Splendid Triumph late at <hi>Bath</hi> was ſeen,</l>
            <l>Upon the Crowning of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To ſhow their Joy, (and Thanks to Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,)</l>
            <l>And to their Prince, their Loyalty and Love.</l>
            <l>But to proceed, to this great glorious ſight,</l>
            <l>1. Firſt came a Hundred Heroes clad in White,</l>
            <l>And in their Hands, each Warlike Youth did hold,</l>
            <l>A Naked Sword (bright as the Burniſht Gold.)</l>
            <l>In Marſhal-order, thus they paſt along,</l>
            <l>Applauded, and admir'd by all the Throng.</l>
            <l>Theſe ſeem'd the Guard of what ſucceeded there,</l>
            <l>2. A Train of Beauties, (like <hi>Aurora</hi> Fair.)</l>
            <l>Two Hundred Virgins (like an Army bright,)</l>
            <l>As Sweet as Innocence, and Fair as Light.</l>
            <l>Each wore a Crown, had Scepters in their Hands;</l>
            <l>Scepters, and Crowns, and Beauty, All Commands.</l>
            <l>About each Tender Maidens ſlender Waſt,</l>
            <l>A little Bagonet was buckled faſt.</l>
            <l>Two Flags were carried in the midſt of theſe,</l>
            <l>With Motto's, that do all True Subjects pleaſe.</l>
            <l>The Motto's in Embroidered-Work were ſeen,</l>
            <l>The Words, <hi>God Save King</hi> WILLIAM <hi>and the Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EEN,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>This is a Joyful Day, and let all thoſe</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Periſh, that wilfully their Peace oppoſe.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>3. Next after, like the <hi>Scythian</hi> manner, came</l>
            <l>A Brave Illuſtrious <hi>Amazonian</hi> Dame.</l>
            <l>The Leader, and the <hi>Queen</hi> of all the reſt,</l>
            <l>With Golden Truncheon, and a Velvet Veſt,</l>
            <l>A Plume of Purple Feathers on her Head,</l>
            <l>Plaid, as ſhe paſt along, and ſweetly ſpread.</l>
            <l>A Golden Sarſh, about her Waſte ſhe wore,</l>
            <l>And thus the Warlike-Beauty went before.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Bellona,</hi> ſtrait was Raviſht with Delight,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf was taken with the Sight:</l>
            <l>He ſtood upon an aged Mountains top.</l>
            <l>And on her Head, did Pearls, and Jewels drop.</l>
            <l>4. Next Twenty four march'd under her Command,</l>
            <l>Each had a Dart, and Javelin, in her hand.</l>
            <l>Her Right Breaſt ſo conceal'd, that none did know,</l>
            <l>But that ſhe really might draw a Bow.</l>
            <l>5. Then Thirty Ladies more did after move,</l>
            <l>(All like Fair Bloſſoms in the Bloom of Love.)</l>
            <l>Theſe Richly dreſt, in their fair Hands did hold</l>
            <l>Quivers, and Arrows, that were tipt with Gold.</l>
            <l>They had their Motto's too, to ſhow their Might,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rather than looſe the day we All will Fight.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Theſe on their Heads did Crowns of Lawrel wear,</l>
            <l>(Lawrel becomes the Witty and the Fair.)</l>
            <l>6. In order Trumpets ſounded, Drums did beat,</l>
            <l>Colours were flying, to make all compleat.</l>
            <l>In the Town-Hall they had a Banquet fine,</l>
            <l>(Sweet-Meats for Ladies, and for Hero's Wine.)</l>
            <l>Bonfires, and Bells, and all they could deviſe,</l>
            <l>With Acclamations ſounding to the Skies,</l>
            <l>In Praiſe of Him, who came (with Heav'ns high Hand)</l>
            <l>To drive <hi>Rome</hi>'s Prieſts, (thoſe Vipers) from our Land.</l>
            <l>Thoſe Locuſts, that to <hi>Lucifer</hi> beſpoke us,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Mock-Religion is a <hi>Hocus-Pocus:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As <hi>Satan</hi> once to <hi>Eve,</hi> in <hi>Eden</hi> came,</l>
            <l>To Vitiate, and Corrupt the Heavenly Dame.</l>
            <l>To bring in bold Rebellion, Sin, and Strife,</l>
            <l>To make Old <hi>Adam</hi> weary of his Life.</l>
            <l>So Jeſuits, (thoſe ſubtil Serpents) come,</l>
            <l>To <hi>England</hi>'s-<hi>Eden,</hi> from <hi>The Den</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With <hi>Sodom</hi>'s fatal Apples, to increaſe</l>
            <l>Our Sins, corrupt our Church, and ſpoil our Peace</l>
            <l>Religion, (that Fair Dove) with Golden Bill,</l>
            <l>And ſhining Feathers, in her Cage lay ſtill;</l>
            <l>Silent, and Sad, Perplext with Fright and Fear,</l>
            <l>But ſince, (by Providence) ſhe is got clear.</l>
            <l>She now upon the Syccamore may ſing,</l>
            <l>And Clap for Joy, her Purple-colour'd Wing,</l>
            <l>Give Thanks to heaven, and to our Gracious KING.</l>
