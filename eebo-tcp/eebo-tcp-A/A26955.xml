            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Deſire not to be planted in any ſuch place, (though it ſeem a Paradiſe,) where God is moſt unknown, and uſed as a ſtranger, and where Saints are wonders, and examples of ſerious piety are moſt rare, and where a Heavenly Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is known but by reports, and reported of according to the malice of the Serpent, and repreſented but as fancie, hypocriſie or

faction: where ſin moſt proſpereth, and is in leaſt diſgrace; and where it is a greater ſhame to be a Saint than to be a ſwine; a ſerious Chriſtian, than a ſeared ſtupified ſenſualiſt: Bleſs you from that place where the weeds of vice are ſo rank, as that no good plant can proſper neer them: where gain is Godlineſs; and impiety is neceſſary to acceptable obſervance; and a tender Conſcience, and the fear of God, are chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of one too ſurly and unplyable to be countenanced by men; where the tongue that nature formed to be the Index of the mind, is made the chiefeſt inſtrument to hide it; and men are ſo conſcious of their own incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, that no one doth believe or truſt another: where no words are <hi>Heart-deep,</hi> but thoſe that are ſpoken <hi>Againſt Chriſts cauſe and intereſt,</hi> or <hi>for their own;</hi> where a vile perſon is honoured, and thoſe contemned that fear the Lord: Bleſs you from the place where truth is intollerable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth cloaked with its name: where holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is lookt at as an Owle or enemie, and yet hypocriſie muſt ſteal its honour from it: where he is a Saint that is leſs wicked than infamous tranſgreſſors; and where <hi>Dives</hi> life is blameleſs temperance; and where Pride, Idleneſs, Fulneſs of bread, and filthy fornication and laſciviouſneſs, are

the infirmities of Pious and excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: where great ſins are ſmall ones, and ſmall ones are none; and where the greateſt muſt have no reproof, and the Phyſicion is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the greateſt enemy: where chaffe is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at the price of wheat, and yet the famine is <hi>of choice</hi>: where <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things</hi> are meaſured by <hi>Intereſt;</hi> and duty to God derided as fully, when ever it croſſeth the wiſdom of the world, and hated as ſome hurtful thing when it croſſeth fleſhly men in their deſires: And where <hi>Dives</hi> Brethren are unwarned; and none are more ſecure and frolick, than thoſe that to morrow may be in Hell; and as at the Gladiators sports, none complain leſs than thoſe that speed worſt, <hi>quia caeſi ſilent, ſpectatores vociferantur.</hi> Old Travellers are uſually moſt addicted to end their days in ſolitude; Learn to contemn the world at cheaper rates than they; Neither hope, nor wiſh to live an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and die a <hi>Socrates;</hi> A Crowd or concourſe, though of the greateſt, where is the greateſt tumult of affairs, and confluence of temptations, is not the ſafeſt place to die in: and I have moſt mind to live where I would die.

The Proverb ſaith, He ſhall have fleas that will lye with the dogs. Deſire not that condition, where all ſeem friends, but none are friends indeed; but they that ſeem to be your ſervants, are by flattery ſerving themſelves upon you: Where few perſons or things are truly repreſented; but men are judged of by the deſcriptions of their enemies, and the Lambs have the skins and names of Wolves: and the beſt are odious when bold calumniators load them with odious accuſations. In a word, deſire not the place, where the more men ſeek, the leſs they find, and the more they find, the leſs they have: and the more they have, the leſs they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: Where the more are their proviſions the leſs are their ſupplies: the more their wealth, the more their want: the more thier pleaſure, the leſs their Peace: the greater their Mirth, the leſs their Joy: the greater their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the leſs their ſafety: Where the great Miſtake about their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> their <hi>Beſt,</hi>

Keep all clean and ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> that there may be little of loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſaffect you, or terror to frighten you from your ſelves; It is a frightfull thing to be much converſing with a guilty ſoul, and hearing the accuſations of a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt: And it is an unpleaſant thing to be ſearching in our wounds, and reading the hiſtory of a life of folly; eſpecially of wilful ſin, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful neglect of offered grace. Make not ſuch work for your ſelf, if you love it not. We make our beds ill, and then we are aweary of them, becauſe they are ſo hard: Our Comforts are more in our own hands then in any others: The beſt friend or Paſtor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo much to promote them, nor the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemy ſo much to deſtroy them as our ſelves. If we will ſurfet, and make our ſelves ſick, we muſt endure it. If Waſps and Vipers be our gueſts, no wonder if we dwell not quietly at home; and if we ſit not at eaſe, when we carry thorns about us. Folly and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence breed our miſery: It is the ſmoak of our own corruptions that troubleth our eyes,

It is pitty that man ſhould be his own afflicter, but ſo it is: And, as the proverb is, he hath great need of a fool, that will play the fool himſelf; ſo I may ſay, He hath great need of a tormenter, that will be a tormenter to himſelf.

            <p>Madam, I have added theſe Directions not principally for you that have learnt the Art, but for your hopefull Sons and Daughters, who muſt be taught theſe things betimes, and for your friends who will be invited hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for your ſake. They that know you not, will think I have taken too much liberty, and ſpoken too much both <hi>of you,</hi> and <hi>to you;</hi> But I appeal from ſuch: They that know not how eaſily you can pardon any one, except your ſelf, will aggravate the weakneſſes which your charity will cover. I was purpoſely the longer becauſe the Treatiſe is defective; And if one Kingdom do not hold us, and I ſhould ſee your face no more on earth, yet till we meet in the Glorious Everlaſting Kingdom, we ſhall have frequent converſe by ſuch means as theſe, notwithſtanding our corporal diſtance: And as I am aſſured of a room in your fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayers, ſo I hope I ſhall remain,</p>

            <head>To my dearly beloved the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Burrough and Pariſh of <hi>Kederminſter</hi> in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS I never deſired any greater prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, than to have continued in the work of my Miniſtry among you, ſo I once thought my days would have been ended in that deſired ſtation: But we are unmeet to tell God how he ſhall diſpoſe of us; or to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know what changes he intends to make. Though you are low in the world, and have not the Riches which cauſe mens eſtimation with the moſt, I ſee no probability that we ſhould have been ſeparated till death, could I but have obtained leave to preach for nothing.</p>
            <p>But being forbidden to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in that Dioceſs, I muſt thankfully take the liberty which ſhall anywhere elſe be vouchſafed me: And while I may enjoy it, I take it not for my duty to be over queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, though the wound that is made by
<pb facs="tcp:59452:27"/>
my ſeparation from you be very deep. And though to ſtrangers it will ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſuch ſeverity had never been exerciſed againſt me, but for ſome heynous crime, yet to you that have known me, I ſhall need to ſay but little in my defence. The great crime which is openly charged on me, and for which I am thought unworthy to preach the Goſpel, (even where there is no other to preach) is a matter that you are unacquainted with, and therefore, as you have heard me publikely accuſed of it, I am bound to render you ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as is neceſſary to your juſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed the Kings Majeſty, (in the proſecution of his moſt Chriſtian reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of uniting his differing ſubjects by the way of mutual approaches and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to grant a Commiſſion to twelve Biſhops and nine aſſiſtants on the one ſide, and to one Biſhop and eleven other Divines and nine aſſiſtants on the other ſide, to treat about ſuch alterations of the Liturgie, as are <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>the ſatisfying of tender conſciences,</hi> and to <hi>the reſtoring of unity and peace.</hi> My experiences in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaty (for Reconciliation in matter of Diſcipline) made me intreat thoſe to
<pb facs="tcp:59452:27"/>
whom the nomination on the one ſide was committed, to excuſe me from the ſervice which I knew would prove troubleſome to my ſelf, and ungrateful to others; but I could not prevail. (But the Work it ſelf, I very much approved, as to be done by fitter and more acceptable perſons.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded by the Kings Commiſſion, I took it to be my duty to be faithful, and to plead for ſuch Alterations as I knew were neceſſary to the aſſigned ends; thinking it to be treachery to his Majeſty that entruſted us, and to the Church and cauſe for which we were entruſted, if under pretence of making ſuch Alterations as were neceſſary to the two forementioned ends, I ſhould have ſilently yielded to have [<hi>No Alterations</hi>] or [<hi>next to none.</hi>] In the concluſion (when the chief work was done by writing) a Committee of each part, was appointed to manage a Diſputation in preſence (by writing alſo.) Therein thoſe of the other part formed an Argument, whoſe Major propoſition was to this ſenſe (for I have no copy) [<hi>Whatſoever book enjoyneth nothing but what is of it ſelf lawful, and by lawful authority, enjoyneth nothing that is ſinful</hi>:] We denyed this propoſition; and at laſt gave divers Reaſons
<pb facs="tcp:59452:28"/>
of our denyal; among which one was that [<hi>It may be unlawful by Accident, and therefore ſinful</hi>] You now know my crime; It is my concurring with learned, reverend Brethren, to give <hi>this Reaſon</hi> of our denyal of a propoſition: Yet <hi>they</hi> are not forbidden to preach for it, (and I hope ſhall not be;) but only I. You have publikely heard, from a mouth that ſhould ſpeak nothing but the words of Charity, Truth, and Soberneſs, (eſpecially there) that this was [<hi>a desperate ſhift that men at the laſt extremity are forced to</hi>] and inferring [<hi>that then neither God nor man can enjoyn without ſin.</hi>] In City and Country this ſoundeth forth to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. I ſhould take it for an act of clemency to have been ſmitten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly for nothing, and that it might not have been thought neceſſary to afflict me by a defamation, that ſo I might ſeem juſtly afflicted by a prohibition to preach the Goſpel. But indeed is there in theſe words of ours ſo great a crime? Though we doubted not but they knew that our Aſſertion made not <hi>Every</hi> evil accident, to be ſuch as made an Impoſition unlawful, yet we expreſt this by word to them at that time, for fear of being miſreported:
<pb facs="tcp:59452:28"/>
and I told it to the Right Reverend Biſhop when he forbad me to preach, and gave this as a reaſon: And I muſt confeſs I am ſtill guilty of ſo much weakneſs, as to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>ſome things not evil of themſelves, may have Accidents ſo evil, as may make it a ſin to him that ſhall command them.</hi> Is this opinion inconſiſtent with all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Yea I muſt confeſs my ſelf guilty of ſo much greater weakneſs, as that I thought I ſhould never have found a man on earth, that had the ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a man, that had made queſtion of it; yea I ſhall ſay more then that which hath offended, viz. <hi>that whenever the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or forbidding of a thing indifferent is like to occaſion more hurt than good, and this may be foreſeen, the commanding or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is a ſin.</hi> But yet this is not the Aſſertion that I am chargeable with, but that [<hi>ſome Accidents there may be that may make the Impoſition ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>;] If I may ask it without accuſing others, how would my crime have been denominated if I had ſaid the contrary? Should I not have been judged unmeet to live in any Governed ſociety? It is not unlawful of it ſelf to command out a Navy to Sea: But if it were foreſeen that
<pb facs="tcp:59452:29"/>
they would fall into the enemies hands, or were like to periſh by any accident, and the neceſſity of ſending them were ſmall, or none, it were a ſin to ſend them. It is not of it ſelf unlawful to ſell poyſon, or to give a knife to another, or to bid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do it: but if it were foreſeen that they will be uſed to poyſon or kill the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is unlawful; and I think the Law would make him believe it that were guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not of it ſelf unlawful to light a candle or ſet fire on a ſtraw; But if it may be foreknown, that by anothers negligence or wilfulneſs, it is like to ſet fire on the City, or to give fire to a train and ſtore of Gunpowder, that is under the Parliament houſe, when the King and Parliament are there: I crave the Biſhops pardon, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that it were ſinfull to do it, or command it: Yea or not to hinder it (in any ſuch caſe,) when <hi>Qui non vetat pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care cum poteſt, jubet.</hi> Yea though going to Gods publike worſhip be of it ſelf ſo far from being a ſin, as that it is a duty, yet I think it is a ſin to command it to all in time of a raging peſtilence, or when they ſhould be defending the City againſt the aſſault of an enemy. It may rather be then a duty to prohibite it. I think <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake
<pb facs="tcp:59452:29"/>
not any thing inconſiſtent with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God or man, when he bid both the Rulers and people of the Church, not to deſtroy him with their meat for whom Chriſt dyed: and when he ſaith that he hath not his Power to deſtruction, but to Edification. Yea there are Evil Accidents of a thing not evil of it ſelf, that are cauſed by the Commander: and it is my opinion that they may prove his commad unlawful.</p>
            <p>But what need I uſe any other Inſtances then that which was the matter of our diſpute? Suppoſe it never ſo lawful of it ſelf to kneel in the Reception of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be impoſed by a penalty that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an Accident of the command, and maketh it by accident ſinful in the Commander: If a Prince ſhould have Subjects ſo weak as that all of them thought it a ſin againſt the example of Chriſt, and the Canons of the general Councils, and many hundred years practice of the Church to kneel in the act of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Lords days, if he ſhould make a Law that all ſhould be put to death that would not kneel, when he foreknew that their conſciences would command them all, or moſt of them, to die rather than
<pb facs="tcp:59452:30"/>
obey, would any man deny this command to be unlawful by this accident? Whether the penalty of ejecting Miniſters that dare not put away all that kneel, and of caſting out all the people that ſcruple it, from the Church, be too great for ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (and ſo in the reſt,) and whether this, with the lamentable ſtate of many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and the diviſions that will follow, being all foreſeen, do prove the Impoſitions unlawful which were then in queſtion, is a caſe that I had then a clearer call to ſpeak to, then I have now. Only I may ſay that the ejection of the ſervants of Chriſt from the Communion of his Church, and of his faithful Miniſters from their ſacred work, when too many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations have none but inſufficient or ſcandalous teachers, or no preaching Miniſters at all, will appear a matter of very great moment, in the day of our Accounts, and ſuch as ſhould not be done upon any but a Neceſſary cauſe, where the benefit is greater then this hurt (and all the reſt) amounts to.</p>

ſaid to <hi>Love God</hi> then the <hi>Creature</hi> by that act, becauſe he is the Ultimate firſt intnded <hi>end,</hi> and principal <hi>object</hi> of that <hi>Love</hi>; And as the <hi>means,</hi> as a <hi>means,</hi> hath its eſſence in its <hi>relation to the End</hi>; ſo the <hi>Love of the means, as ſuch,</hi> is accordingly ſpecified: And ſo we may ſay of our <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> that <hi>nothing but God</hi> is to be ſtudied or known: becauſe it is <hi>God in the creature</hi> that muſt be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It is a defective Similitude (as all are) to ſay, [<hi>As it is the face that we behold the glaſs for:</hi>] For <hi>God</hi> is <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> then the <hi>face</hi> in the <hi>glaſs.</hi> But though all the <hi>means</hi> be <hi>united</hi> in the <hi>End,</hi> yet are they <hi>various</hi> among <hi>themſelves.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though we muſt ſtudy, know and Love <hi>nothing but God</hi>; yet muſt we ſtudy, know and Love many things <hi>beſides our ſelves</hi>: The means that are many, muſt all be thought on. More <hi>ſtrings</hi> muſt be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then <hi>one</hi> (how near ſoever) if we will have any Muſick. More <hi>Letters</hi> muſt be learned than [<hi>I,</hi>] or we ſhall never learn to read.</p>
               <p>All men will confeſs that to confine our <hi>charity</hi> to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and to do good to no others, is unlike a Chriſtian: To deny to feed and clothe our Brother in his need,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59452:128"/>
is to deny it unto Chriſt: And it will be no excuſe, if we were able, to ſay, <hi>I laid it out upon my ſelf.</hi> And the objects of our <hi>charity</hi> muſt be the objects of our thoughts and care: And it will not ſuffice for our excuſe, to ſay, [<hi>I was taken up at home; I had a miſerable ſoul of my own to think on.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And yet if theſe <hi>ſelf-ſtudying</hi> ſouls, that confine almoſt all their thoughts unto <hi>themſelves,</hi> would but ſeek after <hi>God in themſelves,</hi> and ſee his <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> it were the better: But poor ſouls, in the darkneſs of temptation, they overlook their <hi>God</hi>; and moſt of their ſtudy of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> is to ſee <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>his workings</hi> in <hi>themſelves:</hi> To find as much of <hi>his image</hi> as they can, in the <hi>deformities</hi> or <hi>infirmities</hi> of their ſouls; but the <hi>image of God</hi> they overlook, and hardly will acknowledge. And ſo, as <hi>noble objects raiſe</hi> the ſoul, and <hi>amiable</hi> objects kindle <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> objects fill it with <hi>delight</hi>; and <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>all</hi> in <hi>One perfection,</hi> doth <hi>elevate</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> it, and make it <hi>happy</hi>; ſo <hi>inferiour</hi> objects do <hi>depreſs</hi> it; and <hi>ugly loathſome</hi> objects fill it with <hi>diſtaſte</hi> and <hi>loathing</hi>; and <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>mournfull</hi> objects turn it into <hi>grief</hi>; And therefore to be <hi>ſtill</hi> looking on our <hi>miſeries,</hi> and <hi>deformities,</hi> muſt needs turn
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59452:129"/>
calamity and wo into the <hi>temperament</hi> and <hi>complexion</hi> of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>This much I thought needfull to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here to prevent miſunderſtanding and miſapplication: that while I am preſſing you to <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>know your ſelves,</hi> I may not encourage any in extreams, nor tempt them to make an ill uſe of ſo great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a doctrine: And indeed the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſad calamity of many poor drooping afflicted ſouls, that are ſtill poreing exceſſively on their own hearts, commanded me not to overpaſs this caution. And yet when I have done it, I am afraid leſt thoſe in the <hi>contrary extream,</hi> will take <hi>encouragement</hi> to <hi>neglect themſelves,</hi> by my reprehenſions of thoſe that are ſo unlike them.</p>
               <p>And therefore I muſt add, to ſave them from deceit; 1. That it is but a <hi>very few</hi> that are faulty in <hi>overſtudying themſelves,</hi> in compariſon of the many thouſands that err on the other hand in the <hi>careleſs neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting</hi> of <hi>themſelves.</hi> 2. And that it is <hi>ſymptomatically</hi> and <hi>effectively</hi> far more <hi>dangerous,</hi> to ſtudy your ſelves <hi>too little,</hi> then <hi>too much.</hi> Though it be a fault <hi>here</hi> to <hi>exceed,</hi> yet it is for the moſt part a ſign of an honeſt heart to be <hi>much at home,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59452:129"/>
and a ſign of an Hypocrite to be <hi>little at home</hi> and <hi>much abroad. Sincerity</hi> maketh men <hi>cenſurers</hi> of <hi>themſelves.</hi> For it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them more <hi>impartial,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to know the truth of their condition: It cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them of that folly that before made them think that preſumption ſhall deliver them, and that they ſhall be <hi>Juſtified</hi> by believing <hi>promiſes</hi> of <hi>their own,</hi> though <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the <hi>word of God</hi>; yea by <hi>believing</hi> the <hi>promiſes of the Devil,</hi> and calling this <hi>a Faith in Chriſt:</hi> They are <hi>awakened</hi> from that <hi>ſleep</hi> in which they <hi>dreamed</hi> that <hi>wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> would ſave them from the <hi>ſtroke of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and that a ſtrong <hi>conceit</hi> that they ſhall not be damned, will deliver them from damnation; and that they are <hi>ſafe from Hell</hi> if they can but believe that there <hi>is no Hell,</hi> or can but <hi>forget</hi> it, or eſcape the <hi>fears</hi> of it. Theſe are the pernicious Concluſions of the ungodly, diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their lives, and intimated in their preſumptuous reaſonings, though too groſs to be <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>expreſly</hi> owned: And therefore they are undiſpoſed to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial acquaintance with themſelves.</p>
               <p>But grace recovereth men from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and makes them know that the <hi>Judgement of God</hi> will not <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59452:130"/>
of <hi>men</hi>; and that the <hi>knowledge</hi> of their <hi>diſeaſe</hi> is neceſſary to their <hi>cure</hi>; and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of their <hi>danger</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>prevention</hi>; and that its the greateſt madneſs to <hi>go on to Hell,</hi> for fear of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that we <hi>are in the way</hi>; and to <hi>refuſe to know it,</hi> for <hi>fear</hi> of being <hi>troubled</hi> at the news.</p>
               <p>And an upright ſoul is ſo far <hi>fallen out</hi> with <hi>ſin,</hi> that he taketh it ſeriouſly for his <hi>enemy</hi>; and therefore is willing to <hi>diſcover it</hi> in order to its <hi>deſtruction</hi>; and willing to <hi>ſearch</hi> after it in order to a <hi>diſcovery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he hath in him ſome meaſure of the <hi>heavenly illumination,</hi> which maketh him a <hi>child of light,</hi> and diſpoſeth him to <hi>love the light,</hi> and therefore <hi>cometh to it that his deeds may be made manifeſt,</hi> Joh. 3.21. Hypocrites are quick-ſighted in diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>infirmities</hi> of <hi>others</hi>; but at <hi>home</hi> they ſhut the windows, and draw the curtains, that they may not be diſturbed or frighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſin; Thieves and ſleepers chooſe not light: Darkneſs ſuits the works of darkneſs.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59452:159"/>
them: We tell them of their <hi>fall,</hi> their <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi>; of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>free ſalvation,</hi> which they may <hi>have</hi> if they will but <hi>come to him.</hi> But, alas, we cannot make them believe that <hi>they</hi> are ſo <hi>ſick</hi> as to have ſo <hi>much need</hi> of the <hi>Phyſicion:</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>dead,</hi> and have need of a <hi>new creation,</hi> as to the <hi>inclinations</hi> of their hearts, and the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>buſineſs</hi> of their lives. We are ſent to tender them the <hi>mercy</hi> of Chriſt, but we cannot make them believe that they are <hi>miſerable.</hi> We are ſent to offer them the <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>eye ſelve,</hi> and <hi>white rayment</hi> of the Goſpel: but we cannot make them know that they are <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>naked</hi>: We are ſent to call <hi>them to Repent</hi> and <hi>Turn</hi> that they may be <hi>ſaved</hi>; and we cannot make them know that they are ſo far out of the way as to <hi>need</hi> a <hi>change</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> Here they ſit before us, and we <hi>look on them</hi> with <hi>pitty,</hi> and know not how to <hi>help</hi> them.

You will then ſee that there is no ſalvation, by all the blood and merits of Chriſt for any but the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but O that we could <hi>now</hi> but make you underſtand it. We look on them with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59452:159"/>
compaſſion, and think, Alas, poor ſouls, as eaſily and quietly as you ſit here, a change is neer. It will be thus with you but a little while, and where will you be next? We know as ſure as the word of God is true, that they muſt be converted and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, or be loſt for ever: and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them believe, but that the work is done already. The Lord knoweth, and our conſciences witneſs to our ſhame, that we be not half ſo ſenſible of their miſery, nor ſo compaſſionate towards them as we ought to be: but yet ſometimes our hearts melt over them, and fain we would ſave them from the <hi>wrath to come</hi>; and we ſhould have great hopes of the ſucceſs, if we could but make them <hi>know their danger</hi>: It melts our hearts to look on them and think that they are ſo <hi>near damnation,</hi> and never like to <hi>ſcape it,</hi> till they <hi>know it,</hi> till they <hi>know</hi> that their <hi>corruption</hi> is ſo <hi>great,</hi> that nothing but the <hi>quickning ſpirit</hi> can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and nothing leſs then to <hi>become new creatures</hi> will ſerve the turn: But if we would never ſo fain we <hi>cannot</hi> make them <hi>know it</hi>: O that we knew how to acquaint them with their caſe?

the light of Chriſt might ſhew them their condition! But when we have done all, we find it paſt our power.

               <p>In ſumm, <hi>If your very hearts do now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly conſent to the Covenant which you made in Baptiſm, and your Lives expreſs it to be a true Conſent,</hi> I dare ſay you <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi> though you know not <hi>juſt when</hi> you firſt <hi>conſented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come on then, and let us enquire what you ſay to the ſeveral parts of your <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If you are ſincere in the Covenant you have made with Chriſt. <hi>You do reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſent, that God ſhall be your only God, as reconciled to you by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Which is, 1. That you will take him for <hi>your Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> or <hi>your Abſolute Lord,</hi> and <hi>give up your ſelves to him as his Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>You will take him for your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour, and Conſent to be ſubject
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59452:177"/>
to his Government and Laws</hi>; taking his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> for your <hi>Guide,</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of your <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>you will take him for your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Benefactor, from whom you receive and expect all your Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>to whom you owe your ſelves and all, by way of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>: And that you take his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> for <hi>your Happineſs it ſelf,</hi> and prefer the Everlaſting Enjoyment of his <hi>Glorious ſight</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> before all the ſenſual pleaſures of the world.</p>
               <p>I would prove the neceſſity of all theſe by Scripture as we go, but that it is <hi>evident in it ſelf</hi>; theſe three <hi>Relations</hi> being <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>our God in Covenant.</hi> He is not <hi>our God,</hi> if not <hi>our Owner, Ruler</hi> and <hi>Benefactor.</hi> You profeſs all this, when you profeſs but to <hi>Love God,</hi> or <hi>take him for your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Covenant of Baptiſm</hi> you do profeſs to <hi>believe in Chriſt, and take him for your only Saviour:</hi> If you do this in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 1. You do <hi>unfeignedly Beleive the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of</hi> his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Articles of the Chriſtian faith,</hi> concerning his <hi>Perſon,</hi> his <hi>Offices,</hi> and his <hi>ſuffering and works.</hi> 2. You do <hi>take</hi> him unfeignedly for the <hi>only Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Saviour</hi> of mankind, and <hi>Give up
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59452:177"/>
your ſelves</hi> to be ſaved by his Merits, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he hath promiſed in his word. 3. You <hi>truſt upon him and his promiſes,</hi> for the attainment of your <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> your <hi>Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>life to come.</hi> 4. You <hi>take him for your Lord and King,</hi> your <hi>Owner and Ruler</hi> by the right of <hi>Redemption</hi>; and your <hi>grand Benefactor,</hi> that hath obliged you to <hi>Love and Gratitude,</hi> by ſaving you from the wrath to come, and purchaſing eternal Glory for you, by his moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull condeſcenſion, life and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> you are engaged to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If you are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in <hi>this branch</hi> of your <hi>Covenant,</hi> 1. You diſcern your <hi>ſins</hi> as <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> as the <hi>corruption</hi> of your <hi>ſouls,</hi> and that which diſpleaſeth the moſt Holy God. 2. You <hi>ſee</hi> an <hi>excellency</hi> in <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> as the Image of God, the rectitude of man, and that which fits him for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſedneſs, and maketh him amiable in the eyes of God. 3. You unfeignedly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> to be <hi>rid of your ſin,</hi> how dear ſoever it hath been to you: and to be perfectly ſanctifyed by the Holy Spirit, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59452:178"/>
in the uſe of the means which he hath appointed: and you <hi>conſent</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as your ſanctifier do <hi>purifie you</hi> and <hi>kindle</hi> the <hi>Love of God</hi> in you, and bring it to <hi>perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>Baptiſm</hi> you profeſs to <hi>renounce the world, the fleſh, and the Devil:</hi> that is, as they ſtand for your Hearts <hi>againſt the Will</hi> and <hi>Love of God,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> of the <hi>unſeen world</hi>; and againſt your <hi>Faith in Chriſt your Saviour</hi>; and againſt the <hi>ſanctifying work</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If therefore you are ſincere in <hi>this part</hi> of your <hi>Covenant,</hi> you do upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration perceive all the <hi>pleaſures, profits</hi> and <hi>honours</hi> of this world to be ſo vain and worthleſs, that you are <hi>Habitually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi> to prefer the Love and favour of God, and your ſalvation before them; and to be <hi>Ruled</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> rather then by the <hi>deſires</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>worlds allurements,</hi> or the will of man, or the ſuggeſtions of the devil: and to forſake all rather then forſake the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Sanctifier</hi> to whom you are devoted, and the everlaſting life which upon his promiſe you have taken for your Hope and Portion. This is the ſenſe of Baptiſm, and all this in profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59452:178"/>
                  <hi>Eſſential</hi> to your <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> muſt be <hi>Eſſential</hi> to your <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Profeſſion</hi> of it was neceſſary to <hi>your infant title</hi> to the outward priviledges of the Church: Your own <hi>perſonal profeſſion</hi> is neceſſary to your continuance of thoſe priviledges, and your viſible Chriſtianity and communion with the adult: And the <hi>Truth</hi> of what you <hi>profeſs,</hi> is neceſſary to your <hi>reall Chriſtianity before God,</hi> and to your <hi>title to ſalvation</hi>: And this is it that is to be now enquired after. You cannot hope to be admitted into Heaven, upon lower terms then the ſincerity of that profeſſion with entereth you into the Church: While we tell you of no higher matters <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>your ſalvation,</hi> then the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of that which is neceſſary to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I hope you will not ſay we deal <hi>too ſtrictly</hi> with you. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire now by a diligent tryal of your hearts, whether you <hi>truly conſent</hi> to all theſe articles of <hi>your Baptiſmal Vow or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> If <hi>you do,</hi> you are <hi>Regenerate</hi> by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> If you <hi>do not,</hi> you have but the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Regeneration: which aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth your guilt, as a violated profeſſion and Covenant muſt needs do. And I do not think, that any man worthy to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59452:179"/>
with, will have the face to tell you that any man at the uſe of Reaſon, is by his Baptiſm, (or any thing elſe) in a ſtate of Juſtification and Salvation, <hi>whoſe heart doth not ſincerely conſent to the Covenant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and whoſe Life expreſſeth not that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence therefore you may perceive that it is a thing unqueſtionable, that all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are yet unregenerate and in the bond of their iniquity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All thoſe that have not unfeignedly <hi>devoted themſelves to God,</hi> as being <hi>not their own but his. His</hi> by the <hi>title of Creation,</hi> Pſal. 100.3.

And he that unfeignedly taketh <hi>God</hi> for <hi>his Owner,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Lord,</hi> will heartily <hi>give up himſelf</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>They firſt gave up their own ſelves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And he that entirely giveth up himſelf to God, doth with himſelf ſurrender <hi>all that he hath</hi> in <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>reſolution.</hi> As

               </p>
               <p>And he that <hi>giveth up himſelf to God,</hi> will <hi>live to God:</hi> And he that taketh not himſelf to be <hi>his Own,</hi> will take <hi>nothing</hi> for <hi>his Own</hi>: but will ſtudy the intereſt of his Lord, and think he is beſt diſpoſed of when he honoureth him moſt, and ſerveth him beſt, 1 Cor. 6.19.20.

               </p>
               <p>If any of you devote not your ſelves unfeignedly to God, and make it not your firſt enquiry, what <hi>God</hi> would have you <hi>be and do,</hi> but live to <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and yet think your ſelves in a ſtate of Life, you are miſtaken, and do not <hi>know your ſelves.</hi> What abundance might eaſily ſee their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition in this diſcovery!

               <p n="3">3. All thoſe are <hi>unregenerate,</hi> that <hi>depend not upon God as their chiefeſt Benefactor</hi>: and do not moſt carefully apply themſelves to him, as knowing that <hi>in his favour is life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. and that <hi>his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better then life,</hi>] Pſal. 63.3. and that to <hi>his judgement</hi> we <hi>muſt</hi> finally <hi>ſtand or fall:</hi> but do ambitiouſly ſeek the favour of men, and call them their <hi>Benefactors, (Luke</hi> 22.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.9.) whatever become of the favour of God.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59452:192"/>
he thinks the other hath the beſt cauſe, till perhaps he hear both ſo long, till he know not whoſe cauſe is the beſt: The perſon that now is a <hi>zealous lover</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> (when it hath procured entertainment by the happy advantage of friends, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Miniſters, Magiſtrates, or common conſent being on its ſide) may poſſibly turn a <hi>zealous adverſary</hi> to it, when it <hi>loſeth</hi> thoſe advantages: when a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſhall change his mind, how <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>flock</hi> may he miſlead?</p>

               <p>So when you are clear and vigorous in the <hi>Life of faith,</hi> and can abhor all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>unbelief,</hi> and the beams of ſacred Verity in the Scriptures have ſhewed you that it is the undoubted word of God, and you have quietly bottomed your ſoul on Chriſt, and built your hopes upon his promiſes, and can with a cheerfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt let go the world for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of your hopes; remember yet that there is a <hi>ſecret root</hi> of <hi>unbelief</hi> remaining in you, and that this odious ſin is but imperfectly mortified in the beſt: and that its more then poſſible that you may ſee the day when the tempter will aſſault you with queſtionings of the word of God, and trouble you with the injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of blaſphemous thoughts, and doubts, whether it be true or not! and that you that have thought of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, of the Immortal ſtate of ſouls, with joy, and ſatisfied confidence, may be in the dark about them, affrighted with ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſtions of the enemy, and may think of them all with troubleſome diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting doubts, and be forced to cry with the Diſciples, Luke 17.5. <hi>Lord increaſe

               <p>

               <p>I am troubled that I muſt tell you of ſo ſad a caſe, that even the children of God may fall into, leſt by troubling you with the opening of your danger, I ſhould do any thing to bring you into it.

               <p n="3">3. How little are moſt Chriſtians trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for want of <hi>Love to men!</hi> (to Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, neighbours and enemies) how cold are their complaints for their defects in <hi>this,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>other</hi> of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints! But is there not cauſe of as deep humiliation for <hi>this ſin,</hi> as almoſt any other? It ſeems to me that <hi>want of Love</hi> is one of the moſt prevalent diſeaſes among us, when I hear it ſo little ſeriouſly lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I oft hear people ſay, O that we could <hi>hear</hi> more <hi>attentively</hi> and <hi>affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,</hi>

There is ſo little pains taken to bring the heart to the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> and ſo few and cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts put up for it, when yet the heart is backward to it, that makes me conclude that <hi>Charity</hi> is <hi>weaker</hi> in moſt of us then we obſerve. And indeed it appeareth ſo when it comes to <hi>tryal:</hi> to <hi>that tryal</hi> which Chriſt will judge it by at laſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. When <hi>Love</hi> muſt be ſhewed by any <hi>ſelf-denyal,</hi> or <hi>coſtly demonſtration,</hi> by parting with <hi>our food</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> to ſupply the wants of <hi>others,</hi> and by <hi>hazarding our ſelves</hi> for them in their diſtreſs, <hi>then</hi> ſee how much we <hi>Love indeed!</hi> Good words coſt little: ſo cheap an exerciſe of charity as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Jam. 2.15, 16.

               <p n="8">8. Another inſtance of unobſerved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart, is, <hi>The frequent and ſecret inſinuations of ſelfiſhneſs in all that we do toward God or man:</hi> When we think we are ſerving God alone, and have cleanſed our hearts from mixtures and deceit, before we are aware, <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-eſteem,</hi> or <hi>ſelf conceit,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> do ſecretly creep in and marr the work. We think we are ſtudying and preaching, and writing purely for God, and the common good, or the benefit of ſouls; and perhaps little obſerve how ſubtilly ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs inſinuates, and makes a party, and byaſſeth us from the holy ends, and the ſimplicity and ſincerity which we thought we had carefully maintained: ſo that we are ſtudying and preaching, and writing for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> when we take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>When we enter upon any <hi>office,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

               <p>When we are <hi>doing Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>ſhewing mercy,</hi> in giving <hi>alms,</hi> or exhorting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to repent, or doing any other work of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> we little think how much of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is ſecretly latent in the bent and intention of the heart.</p>
               <p>When we think we are defending the truth and cauſe of God, by diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, writing, or by the ſword; or when we think we are faithfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining on one ſide <hi>order</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> againſt <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>turbulent diſquiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> or the <hi>

               <p>But above all others, Chriſt himſelf, and the Holy Ghoſt that ſearcheth the hidden things of the heart, hath warned <hi>one ſort</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59452:210"/>
to be ſuſpicious of their hearts; and that is, thoſe that <hi>cannot bear the diſſent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of their brethren in tolerable things,</hi> and thoſe that are calling for fire from heaven, and are all for force and cruelty in religion; for vexing, impriſoning, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, burning, hanging, or otherwiſe doing as they would not be done by, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in their own caſe.

               <p>So alſo men are fouly and frequently miſtaken, when they are zealouſly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt their faithfull Paſtors and their brethren, and vilifying others, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, and troubling the Church, upon pretence of greater knowledge or integrity in themſelves: which is notably diſcovered and vehemently preſt by the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where you may ſee how greatly the judgement of the ſpirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our hearts doth differ from mens judgement of themſelves. They that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59452:211"/>
had a <hi>maſterly, contentious, envious zeal,</hi> did think they were of the <hi>wiſer ſort</hi> of Chriſtians, and of the <hi>higheſt form</hi> in the School of Chriſt; when yet the Holy Ghoſt telleth them that their wiſdom deſcended not from above, but was earthly, ſenſual and diveliſh, and that their envy and ſtrife doth bring confuſion, and every evil work: and that the wiſdom from above is neither <hi>unholy</hi> nor <hi>contentious,</hi> but <hi>firſt pure, and then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be entreated,</hi> Jam. 3.17.</p>
               <p>You ſee then how oft and dangerouſly we are deceived, by unacquaintedneſs with our ſelves; and how <hi>ſelfiſh carnal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ends</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> are oft mixed in the actions which we think are the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for <hi>wiſdom, zeal,</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> that ever we did perform. O therefore what cauſe have we to ſtudy, and ſearch, and watch ſuch hearts, and not too boldly or careleſly to truſt them!</p>
               <p>And it is not <hi>only Hypocrites</hi> that are ſubject to theſe deceitfull ſins, who have them in dominion, but <hi>true Believers</hi> that have a remnant of this carnal ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh principle continually offering to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate and corrupt their moſt excellent works, and even all that they do.</p>

               <p n="10">10. <hi>We are very apt to think thoſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be purely ſpiritual, which in the iſſue appear to be mixed with carnality.</hi> Our very love to the Aſſemblies and ordinances of worſhip, and to Miniſters, and other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord; to Books, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; are ordinarily <hi>mixt</hi>; and <hi>good</hi> and bad are ſtrangely complicate, and twiſted together in the ſame affections and works.

               <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Holineſs as denominated from the <hi>object,</hi> is the <hi>Conſent</hi> to the <hi>three Articles of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> 1. <hi>That we give up our ſelves to God as our God and Reconciled Father in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>That we give up our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt as our Redeemer and Saviour, to recover us, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us and bring us unto God.</hi> 3. <hi>That we

give up our ſelves to the Holy Ghoſt as our Sanctifier, to guide and illuminate us, and perfect the Image of God upon us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Sanctification as deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from its <hi>oppoſite objects,</hi> is nothing but our Renunciation and Rejection of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> of <hi>Pleaſures, Profits</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> as they would be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before God,</hi> and draw us to forſake him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Sanctification as denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from <hi>our Faculties</hi> which are the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of it, is nothing but this <hi>preferring of God, and Grace, and Glory</hi> above the ſaid <hi>Pleaſures, Profits</hi> and <hi>Honours.</hi> 1.

               <p>But <hi>beſides theſe</hi> there are many <hi>deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualities</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> which we may ſeek for, and be thankfull for; but are not <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> to our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Such are

our <hi>ſtate</hi> doth not change at all as theſe <hi>feelings</hi> and <hi>Affectionate</hi> motions of the ſoul do; but we are ſtill in our <hi>ſafe Relation to God,</hi> while our <hi>firſt Eſſential graces</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; though our failings, dulneſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and wants, muſt be matter of <hi>moderate filial humiliation</hi> to us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In our judging of our ſelves by our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> two <hi>extreams</hi> muſt be carefully avoided: On the left hand that of the <hi>Prophane,</hi> and of the <hi>Antinomians</hi>; The former cannot diſtinguiſh between ſinners and <hi>ſinners, ſanctified</hi> and <hi>unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Juſtified and unjuſtified <hi>ſinners</hi>; and when they have once conceited that they are in the favour of God, whatever they
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59452:219"/>
do, they ſay, <hi>we are but ſinners, and ſo are the beſt.</hi> The latter teach men, that when once they are juſtified, they are not for any ſins to doubt again of their Juſtified ſtate, leſt they ſhould ſeem to make God change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>other hand</hi> muſt be avoided this <hi>extream</hi> of perplexed doubting Chriſtians, that make <hi>all their ſins,</hi> or <hi>too many of them,</hi> to be matter of <hi>doubting,</hi> which ſhould be but matter of <hi>humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it is a very great difficulty that hath long perplexed the Doctors of the Church, to define <hi>what ſins are conſiſtent, and what inconſiſtent with a ſtate of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Salvation,</hi> (which if any diſtinguiſh by the names of <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial,</hi> taking the words in no other ſenſe, I ſhall not quarrell with them.) At the preſent I ſhall ſay but this for the reſolving of this great and weighty queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not the bare <hi>Act of ſin in it ſelf</hi> conſidered, that muſt determine the caſe: but the <hi>Act</hi> compared with the <hi>Life of Grace,</hi> and with <hi>true Repentance.</hi> Whoever hath the <hi>Love of God</hi> and <hi>Life of Grace,</hi> is in a ſtate of Salvation: And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſin conſiſteth with the fore-deſcribed <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> (viz. <hi>The Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall

And <hi>true Repentance</hi> proveth the pardon of all ſin: And therefore whatever ſin conſiſteth with <hi>Habitual Repentance,</hi> (which is <hi>the Hatred of ſin as ſin,</hi>) and hath <hi>Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> when it is <hi>obſerved,</hi> and there is <hi>time of deliberation,</hi> conſiſteth with a <hi>ſtate</hi> of Grace.

And many miniſters that are truly Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, are yet ſo unskilful and ſo weak that we have no encouragement to acquaint them with our ſtate.</hi>

               <p>To this I anſwer: It cannot be denyed but all this is too true; and it is matter of lamentation, and muſt ſend us to God with the old petition which Chriſt himſelf hath put into our mouths, Math. 9.37, 38. [<hi>The harveſt truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few: Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harveſt that he will ſend forth labourers into his harveſt.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But conſider that this is no <hi>wonder,</hi> or <hi>unuſual</hi> thing: For all this, there is no nation under heaven that hath more able faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, then are <hi>in theſe Nations.</hi> Alas how much of the Church is guided by meer <hi>ignorant Readers!</hi> and how much by <hi>ſuperſtitious deceivers!</hi> Did you know the caſe of the poor Chriſtians in the Ethiopian, the Greek, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Churches, you would bleſs God that it is ſo well with us: Even when the Church was in a <hi>narrower</hi> room, yet God complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.10. [<hi>Many Paſtors have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed my vineyard: they have trodden my Portion under foot: they have made my pleaſant portion a deſolate wilderneſs: They

               <p>But whom can the proſperous blame ſo much as themſelves, if they are undone by the deceit of flatterers? It is their own choice: They love to have it ſo: They will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure faithful dealing.

And he that reſolves to caſt away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,

and will pleaſe his appetite and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, come on it what will, muſt take what he gets by it, and bear the endleſs wrath of God, that could not bear the neceſſary warnings and ſelf-knowledge that ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it; Did theſe men hate ſin and the meſſengers of Satan, they would not hate the Juſtice and meſſengers of God. But while they damnably Love fleſhly pleaſures, they cannot ſavingly Love the word that chargeth them to let go thoſe pleaſures; nor the perſons that croſs them in the things they love. And thus poor worldlings are ruined by their own deſires: It ſeemeth ſo ſweet to them to live in ſin, that they cannot endure to know the bitter fruits of miſery, which it will at laſt bring forth: They are conquered by their fleſhly luſts; and therefore they hate the meſſengers of that ſpirit, which would fight againſt them. Satan doth perfect his former victories in them, by diſpelling or diſperſing the auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of Chriſt, that were ſent for their reſcue and relief.

                  <hi>complaining</hi> where there are ſo many weak and poor: and many a <hi>groane</hi> where there is ſo much <hi>pain.</hi> To ſhew us the <hi>Sun</hi> at <hi>midnight</hi>; and convince us of <hi>Love</hi> while we <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>rod</hi>; and to give us the comfortable ſenſe of <hi>grace,</hi> while we have the uncomfortable ſenſe of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of our <hi>ſin</hi>; to give us the <hi>joyful hopes of glory,</hi> in a <hi>troubled melancholy dejected</hi> State: all this is a work that requireth the ſpecial helpe of the Almighty, and exceeds the ſtrength of feeble worms. Let God give us never ſo full diſcoveries of his tendereſt Love and our own ſincerity, as if a voice from Heaven had witneſſed it unto us, we are queſtioning all if once we ſeem to <hi>feel</hi> the contrary, and are perplexed in the tumult of our thougths and paſſions, and bewildred and loſt in the errors of our own diſturbed minds. Though we have <hi>walkt</hi> with God, we are queſtioning whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ever knew him, as ſoon as he ſeemeth to hide his face. Though we have felt another life and ſpirit poſſeſs and actuate us than heretofore, and found that we love the things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which once we loved not, and that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59452:301"/>
we were quite falln out with that which was our former pleaſure, and that our ſouls broke off from their old delights, and hopes and ways, and reſolvedly did engage themſelves to God, and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly delivered up themſelves unto him; yet <hi>all is forgotten,</hi> or the convincing <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>all</hi> forgotten, if the lively influences of heaven be but once ſo far withdrawn, as that our preſent ſtate is clouded and afflicted, and our former vigour and aſſurance is abated. And thus unthankfully we deny God the praiſe and acknowledgement of his mercies, longer than we are <hi>taſting</hi> them, or they are <hi>ſtill before us</hi>; All that he hath <hi>done for</hi> us is as <hi>nothing,</hi> and all the <hi>Love</hi> which he hath manifeſted to us is called <hi>hatred</hi>; and all the <hi>witneſſes</hi> that have put their hands to his Acts of Grace, are <hi>queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>; and his very <hi>ſeals denyed,</hi> and his <hi>earneſt miſinterpreted,</hi> as long as our <hi>darkened diſtempered</hi> ſouls are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>unfit</hi> for the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and uſually when a <hi>diſeaſed</hi> or <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted body</hi> doth draw the <hi>mind</hi> into too great a participation of the affliction. And thus as we are <hi>diſpoſed our ſelves,</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:59452:301"/>
ſo we judge of <hi>our ſelves</hi> and of all our <hi>receivings,</hi> and al! <hi>Gods dealings</hi> with us: A ſoul in a <hi>cheerful lively frame,</hi> thinks well of all that God doth to him; and hath thoughts of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi>; as <hi>Health</hi> diſpoſeth the body to <hi>alacrity,</hi> and can make a man <hi>merry,</hi> that hath little elſe: Whereas a ſoul <hi>overwhelmed</hi> with <hi>cares,</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>griefs,</hi> and <hi>muddyed</hi> with ſinfull exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>thoughtfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>habituated</hi> in a <hi>diſeaſed ſickly frame,</hi> is <hi>afraid</hi> of every thing, and turneth matter of <hi>comfort</hi> into <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and is in <hi>daily pain</hi> by its <hi>own imaginations</hi>; like a man that hath a <hi>ſore,</hi> and is hurt with the <hi>thought</hi> that <hi>ſome body toucht</hi> it. When we <hi>feel our ſelves well,</hi> all goes well with us, and we put a good interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all things: And when <hi>we are out of order,</hi> we complain of every thing, and take pleaſure in nothing, and no one can content us, and all is taken in the worſer part; As the Poet ſaid,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>You ſhall have a merry ſong from a merry heart, and a ſad ditty from a troubled grieved mind.</p>
               <p>And thus while the diſcoveries both of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> are at <hi>preſent overlookt,</hi> or <hi>afterwards forgotten,</hi> and almoſt all men judge of themſelves by <hi>preſent feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> no wonder if few are well <hi>acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>works</hi> of God muſt be taken <hi>together,</hi> if they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and not a ſentence, part or parcel taken ſeparated from the reſt which muſt make up the ſenſe: ſo alſo the <hi>workings</hi> of God <hi>upon your ſouls</hi> muſt be taken <hi>altogether</hi>: and you muſt read them over from <hi>the firſt till now,</hi> and ſet all together, and not forget the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the part that went before, or elſe you will make no ſenſe of that which followeth. And I beſeech all weak and troubled Chriſtians to remember alſo that they are but children and Schollars in the ſchool of Chriſt: and therefore when they cannot ſet the ſeveral parts
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:59452:302"/>
together, let them not overvalue their unexperienced underſtandings, but by the help of their skilful faithful Teachers, do that which of themſelves they cannot do: Enquire what your <hi>former mercies ſignifie:</hi> Open them to your guides, and tell them how God hath dealt with you from the <hi>beginning,</hi> and tell them how it is with you <hi>now:</hi> and deſire them to help you to perceive how <hi>one</hi> conduceth to the right underſtanding of the <hi>other.</hi> And be not of <hi>froward</hi> but of <hi>tractable ſubmiſſive minds</hi>; and thus your <hi>ſelf-acquaintance</hi> may be maintained, at leaſt to <hi>ſafety,</hi> and to <hi>ſome degree of peace,</hi> if not to the <hi>Joys,</hi> which you deſire, which God reſerveth for their proper ſeaſon.</p>
