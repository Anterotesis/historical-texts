         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>he blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in the

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23926:3"/>
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, being a man that
had the Tongue of the Learned
to speak a word in season to the
wearie: whereupon (as having
in his eye greater matters than
particularities) as his use is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in every Epistle, he calls
them from particular Cases,
that they should not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
trouble themselves about
them, but the maine, <hi>The time
is short, Let those that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
be as if they were not,</hi>
&amp;c. But</p>
            <p>First he gives satisfaction to
the particular Cases,<note place="margin">We must know par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to heaven.</note> for as it
is in travelling, it is not enough
to know that a mans way
lies <hi>East,</hi> or <hi>West,</hi> or <hi>North,</hi> or
<hi>South,</hi> but he must know the
turnings and windings, the
particularities of the way: So
in Religion it is not enough to
know that we must serve God
above all, and love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as our selfe, &amp;c. Those
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23926:3"/>
generalities that <hi>Atheists</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to shake-off all studie of
Religion by, if they know a
few generalls. Our knowledge
stands in clearing particular
Cases, which being cleared
the way is smother to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yet notwithstanding
we must not dwell too much
upon particulars, for here you
see the Apostle calls them off,
<hi>Finally my Brethren, the time
is short,</hi> it remaines that we
looke to the maine, &amp;c. <hi>For
the fashion of this World pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away;</hi> wherein we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
two points in generall,
which I will name, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to that: inlarging of that
that I thinke sitting for this
time.</p>
            <p>The first was this, that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A very good way to satisfie
Cases of Conscience in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
is to have in our minde the
maine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct 1. Looking to the maine helps par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:23926:4"/>
For there be many that puzzle
themselves all their life, about
this and that particular, and
forget the maine in the mean
time, let a man looke to the
maine, and he will soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
whether it be good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
time to heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
now and then: he will
doe it, and not make a Case of
it, for it helpes the maine, I
came into the world to save
my soule, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And so for sanctifying the
<hi>Lords-Day</hi> entirely, many have
scruples and keepe adoe, but if
they had the love of God in
their soules, and did looke to
the maine, they would cut off
that idle question: why doe I
trifle about this and that idle
question, how stands it with
the maine?</p>
            <p>And so for conversing with
company, are they such as are
comfortable and cheerefull?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23926:4"/>
are they such as may helpe to
the main? no: why do I intangle
my selfe in that which hinders
the maine? So we see <hi>Paul</hi>
when he had resolved the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
he calls them to the
maine, <hi>Brethren the time is
short;</hi> and therefore be in these
things as if yee were not, (as
we shall see anone in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars)
<hi>For the fashion of this
World passeth away.</hi> To adde a
little in this point, This is the
reason why none but a true
Christian can carry himselfe
moderately in the things of
this world, why? because none
but a sound Christian hath a
maine, and a chiefe end that
swaies the sterne of his whole
life, hee lookes to heaven and
happines, and how it shall be
with him afterwards, and he
considers particulars thereafter,
when another man of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
must erre in particulars,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23926:5"/>
because he hath not a gracious
ayme: you have no man but a
Christian, but he looseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the things of this world.</p>
            <p>Well, the second thing is this,
you see that</p>
            <p>Religion meddles with all matters<note place="margin">Doct. 2. Religion reacheth to other callings.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With the World, with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
with buying and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing,
as we shall see after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Saith an Athiest (that sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes
it, that his waies should
be hindred from that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
skill of Religion which
hath to doe in all things) <hi>What
hath the Minister to doe with
our Callings, with Lawyers,
with Trades-men, or States-men?
What hath the Minister to doe
with these things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true not with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
with the particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of those, that is left to those
that are Artists, that have skill
in the particulars; but a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and a Christian, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in any man hath to deale
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23926:5"/>
with these things, as they helpe
to further the maine; for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is a skill that fits a man for
a further end, for his last end,
that fits him for heaven.<note place="margin">Religion guides all to the maine.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now being such a skil it must
direct every thing so farre
as it helps or hinders that, The
heathen Philosopher could say,
<hi>State knowledge is a commanding
knowledge,</hi> why? because it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with all trades. How? hath
a States-man skil in this or that
trade? No, not in the particular
mystery, but he hath skill so far
as he sees what may serve for
the publicke good. <hi>Let the safety
of the Common-wealth be the law
of all trades.</hi> The State know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is the supream knowledg
which is for the good of the
whole, therefore he cuts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
if they be mischievous
to the whole: so all trades wee
must tell them of their faults, as
they are blemishes to Religion,
for wee must not bee so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23926:6"/>
in this or that trade, as that we
forget we are Christians, and
therefore we must heare meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the word of God, when it
meets with our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
we see <hi>Paul</hi> medleth
with buying and selling, with
marriage, &amp;c. How? As farre
as they might hinder the main.
<hi>Finally my brethren, the time is
short, and the fashion of this
World passeth away.</hi> Therefore
be not over-much in these
things.</p>
            <p>It is an antient rule, <hi>(sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
ratio, &amp;c.)</hi> it is the maine
reason that makes for Religion,
as I said before of State-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
it is (<hi>summa Lex</hi>)
though that be the Supreame
in regard of inferiours, yet
there is one above that, that
is the chiefe Law of all that
makes for Religion: that is
the chiefe reason of all that
makes for Religion, there be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23926:6"/>
many particular reasons that
make for this and that, I, but
Religion faith the contrary,
and that must rule, that is the
(<hi>summa ratio.</hi>) Now I come
to unfold the particulars, but
to hasten to the maine. The
Apostle heere stands upon five
directions and bounds; those five
directions with three reasons.<note place="margin">The five particular directions</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let those that are married,
be as if they were not.</p>
            <p>Those that weepe, as if they
wept not.</p>
            <p>Those that reioyce, as if they
reioyced not.</p>
            <p>And they that buy, as though
they possessed not.</p>
            <p>And they that use this
world, as not abusing it.</p>
            <p>How are these five directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inforced?</p>
            <p>They are inforced from three
reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:23926:7"/>
The first is in the front of the
Text. <hi>The time is short.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be moderate in all things
here.</p>
            <p>The second is in the shutting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
of the Text, <hi>For the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this World passeth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>The third reason is a maine
reason too: that is from their
state and condition in Christ:
why <hi>Brethren,</hi> faith hee, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the heavenly Calling,</hi>
as he saith in another place,
<hi>Partakers of better things,</hi> and by
being <hi>Brethren, Brethren in
Christ, members of Christ;</hi> he
is the knot of the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
being Borne againe
Sonnes of God, <hi>Brethren of
Christ, Brethren partakers of
the heavenly Calling,</hi> not Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
onely among your selves,
but <hi>Brethren in Christ,</hi> and
so Sonnes of God and Heires
of heaven. What, for you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23926:7"/>
to be immoderate in the things
of the World; <hi>Paul</hi> wraps up
a moving reason, not onely to
insinuate into them to gain their
affection, <hi>Oh! my Brethren:</hi> but
to adde a force of reason like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<hi>Brethren, The time is
short.</hi> And <hi>Brethren, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of this world passeth
away.</hi> So adde these three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the five directions, and
wee see how strougly <hi>Paul</hi>
backes his directions. Indeed it
was needfull for <hi>Paul</hi> so to do;
we are so desperatly set on the
things of this world, we are so
hardly taken off, that there
must be reason upon reason; for
the Holy-Ghost, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, loves not wast of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to spend them where there
is no use. And therefore wee
must thinke it is a weightie
point &amp; of great equity, that we
give eare to these directions that
have so strong reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23926:8"/>
But to come to say somewhat
of the particulars.</p>
            <p>We must remember (to make
way to what is to bee spoken of
these things) that every one of
these reasons have a force in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
direction: you that have
Wives, be as if you had none,
for the <hi>Time is short,</hi> and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of the world passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
And so you that weep, as
if you wept not, <hi>for the time is
short, and the fashion of the world
passeth away.</hi> And you are <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
you that use the world as
not abusing it, for <hi>The time is
short, and the fashion of the world
passeth away.</hi> So that all these
reasons must bee thought on in
every particular direction, that
I speake of, only in generall; J
will speake a little of the first
reason, <hi>The time is short.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What time?<note place="margin">The time is short.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The time of the world;<note place="margin">1. Of the World.</note> there
is but a little time before the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23926:8"/>
day of iudgment; Christ is at
hand to iudge the quicke and
the dead. The time betweene
this and that is short, it
was short then, it is shorter
now, <hi>The time is short,</hi> wee are
fallen into the latter end of the
world: but that is not all.</p>
            <p>Our time is short of our little
world,<note place="margin">2 Of our life</note> our particular iudgment
is neere at hand: it shall bee
with us at the latter day, as it
is when we dye, our time is
short, the time of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
life is short, and that is more
forcible to perswade us, <hi>The
time is short.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The season of the time,<note place="margin">2. Of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</note>
which is the prime time: The
season and opportunity of time
is shorter then the time of life:
for we have not opportunity of
time all our life. <hi>The time is
short:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Time is short.</note> that is, the advantage of
doing good, and of taking good
is short. All the yeare is not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23926:9"/>
harvest or seed-time, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Tyde, it is not alwayes
sun-shine, and as it is in nature,
so it is in the spirituall state of
thinges: we have not alwayes
advantages and opportunities,
wee have not alwayes gales.
Opportunitie therefore is shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then time, as our time is shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the time of the world.
<hi>The time is short.</hi> The opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and season of time is shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
well I will not dwell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this poynt, though it bee a
great inforcement, <hi>It is short,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Time is uncertain.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I, and vncertaine, we cannot
tell how short. If it were told
any of us heere, that within
two dayes you shall dye, it
would startle vs, the best of vs
all; it would make vs looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vs: but who of us all,
knowes certainly that we shall
live two houres. The time as it
is short, so it is vncertaine, and
heere is the wondrous folly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23926:9"/>
of our nature, that we will take
so much time to come, in trust,
as though we should live so long
and make a covenant with
death, but one party cannot
make a covenant, God and the
time to come make no covenant
with us. Therefore it is extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Folly to say, I shall live so
long, &amp; so long. <hi>Thou foole,</hi> faith
God, when he proiected for a
long time, and had treasure laid
up for many yeares, <hi>Thou foole,
this night they shall take thy soule.</hi>
A man is a foole when he makes
account of continuing of that
he hath no promise of. And
therefore the time being short,
and uncertaine too, Take it
while wee may catch hold of
it, especially the opportunity
of time.</p>
            <p>And then in the third place
it is irrecoverable,<note place="margin">3. It is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> when it is
gon, there is no recalling back of
time when it is past. In all these
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23926:10"/>
respects we must be good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
of time, wee must be
thrifty of our time, and not
take care how to drive away
that, that flyes away of it selfe
to fast: it is a precious thing,
precious for great purpose.</p>
            <p>What is this little time given
us for? To provide for eternitie
world without end: and wee
trifle it a way about this thing
and that thing to no purpose,
we fill it up with vanity, and
with sinne, which is worse. In
this little time we do that, that
in a long time after, we cannot
undoe againe, that is our mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and folly, therefore <hi>The
time being short,</hi> let us take heed
what we doe in it, we may do
that in a little time, that wee
may rue for eternity, we may do
that good, and get that good in a
little time, that may stand by us
world without end; those that
have but a little plot of ground,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23926:10"/>
oh! they will husband it so,
that they will not lose a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of it, so those that have
but a little time, oh! let them
husband it well, sow that
little time well, sow that seed
that may breed a harvest, that
may benefit us after that wee
may say, Oh! it was a great
blessing, that God gave me a
little time to get into Christ,
to repent of my sins. &amp;c. <hi>Beloved</hi>
there are three maine parts of
this little time.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Past,</item>
               <item>Present,</item>
               <item>To come.<note place="margin">1: Repent the time past in ill.</note>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Time that is gone, let us
repent of it, if it have not bin
spent well, that is the best use
we can make of the time past;
for there is nothing to be done
in the time that is past. But if
things have been done ill, repent<note place="margin">2. For time present do good.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Time present is to doe
good in, and for the Time to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23926:11"/>
come, it is out of our power;
and therefore even for the
present we must worke. The
Time past, the best use we can
make of it, is to comfort our
selves, as <hi>Hezekias,</hi> in our since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
or to repent if any thing
have been done amisse; but
looke to the present, put not
off, do the worke, for which we
came into the World, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>The time is short,</hi> the busines
is great, the iourney is long,
it is a great iourney from earth
to heaven, it is a great matter
to get from earth to heaven.</p>
            <p>Now having such businesse
to heaven, let us, I beseech you,
consider the weight of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and give our eyes no
sleepe,<note place="margin">3. For time to come get into such a state as is not lyable to time.</note> nor our eye-lids slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
till we are gotten into such
a state and condition, as
is not lyable to time, let us
make this speciall use of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time. Those that are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23926:11"/>
young let them bee advised
to take Time along with
them,<note place="margin">Advice to youth</note> (which is to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
farre above Gold) and
consecrate the prime and the
flower of their time to God,
and to the best things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering, that wee
have no assurance of this
Time.<note place="margin">A memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum to old age.</note> And those that are
old, that through age are going
into the grave, let them not
neglect their Time. A young
man (as wee say) may die
soone, an old man cannot
live long. And therefore let
those that are stricken in yeares
be put in minde to thinke
that their time is shorter then
others. All mens times are
short, old mens shortest. Let
those therefore that are in years
thinke of this, <hi>The Time is
short.</hi> Our folly is this, we make
it shorter then it is, by our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23926:12"/>
               <hi>Vanity Vanity.</hi> it were well if
it were onely vanity, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinnefull actions many shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
their dayes by intemperate
courses, and so are fellons upon
themselues, or by their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they give God occasion to
shorten their dayes. <hi>A blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirstie
and crvell man shall not
live out halfe his dayes.</hi> God
meets with him, so <hi>The time is
short,</hi> and we make it shorter,
we are guiltie of the shortnes
of our time our selues, let us
take heed of that. But I have
bin over long in this point, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because it is the prime reason,
set before all the particulars, I
beseech you consider. <hi>The time
is short.</hi> If we doe not make
use of it, we are worse then the
Divell himselfe,<note place="margin">Our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of time makes us worse than the Divel</note> he makes use
of the shortnes of his time,
what doth hee? Because the
time is short, he doth all the
mischiefe he can. Hee fills up
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23926:12"/>
his time to increase his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he doth all the mischiefe
he can, for this reason; because
his time is short: let us learne
some what of the worst of
spirits, but that which it serves
for in particular heere, let us
thinke of it in that respect, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many things to doe, and
the time being short; let us bee
sure wee doe the maine thing
that we come for, and other
things as they help the maine,
and not hinder it. The time is
short, and we have many busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to doe, let us be sure that
we doe all our busines, so as
that wee leave not the maine
undone, that is the maine hee
aimes at here; <hi>The time is short.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains that those that
have wives, bee as if they had
none.</p>
            <p>That is the first particular;<note place="margin">Marriage lawfull.</note>
for before they had asked him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23926:13"/>
Cases of Conscience about mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and that makes him speak
of it. All the particulars have
dependance one upon another.
Those that mary wil have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to weep, that is next, for
there will be cause: There will
be losse of Husband, or wife,
or childe, and there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
alwaies family-crosses at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon Marriage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee addes weeping after
Marriage.</p>
            <p>And then ioy, because there is
ioy. <hi>A woman brings forth in
sorrow, but shee Joyes when a
man childe is borne,</hi> as Christ
speakes. There is ioy in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and there is mutuall ioy in
that sweet coniugall friendship,
there is much ioy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as there is weeping, so
there is ioy in Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And those that buy, as if they
possessed not.</hi> There must be buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where there is wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23926:13"/>
there must be looking to
posteritie: and then all this
enforceth, <hi>Vsing of the World.</hi>
And men when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to that estate, they enter into
the world, as wee use to say,
they beginne the world anew,
they enter into the world:
for there are many things
necessarie to maintaine that
societie. Therefore wee see
one thing depends upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
hee ioynes all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ayming especially at one
thing, at that kinde of life espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p>Now in every one of these
particulars, hee gives a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to doe the thing, you may
Marry, you may Weepe, you
may joy, you may buy, you
may use the World; but as
there is a libertie, so there is
a danger, you may, but you may
goe too farre. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with a liberty, hee gives a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23926:14"/>
restraint. There is a danger, and
a restraint upon the danger; doe
them, but take heed you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
them not. And this restraint
is backed with reason, he hath
reason for his restraint. <hi>The
time is short:</hi> and therefore there
is danger, lest you shoot your
selves too farre, lest you passe
too deepe into these things,
<hi>And the fashion of this world
passeth away,</hi> all things here
passe away. Therefore it is in
vaine for you to be overmuch
in those things, that are passing
things.</p>
            <p>And then you are Brethren,
called to greater matters, so
there is a libertie, a danger,
and a restraint upon the danger,
and likewise a reason to back it
in every particular.</p>
            <p>The libertie.<note place="margin">1 A liberty to marry.</note> We may Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I will not stand upon that:
I had occasion heretofore to
speake of it, it is not questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23926:14"/>
this liberty. There is not
onely a liberty, but it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
estate, and necessary;
honoured in Paradice, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Christs presence. There
is no question of the liberty of
that by which the Church is
maintayned, by which the
Church is brought into the
world, for heaven. There is no
question of that, and it was
the Divell that brought in a
base esteeme of that honourable
Condition in Popery, wherein
they would bee rather the
members of an Harlot, then
the head of a wife. It was the
Divell that brought in those
abhominable opinions and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to disparage that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Condition, and so it must
be thought.</p>
            <p>But there is a danger, and that
is the maine thing.<note place="margin">2. Danger.</note> You that
<hi>have wives be as if you had none.</hi>
There is a great danger in adou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23926:15"/>
respect. A danger in the
things, and a perill if wee goe
too farre in them. That is, there
is a great hazzard, that we shall
goe over-farre in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a danger that it tends to.</p>
            <p>For instance, Those that have
wives, have they not beene
drawne away by their wives,
as <hi>Solomon</hi> was to Idolatrie?
Is there not a danger of being
drawne away? And is there not
a danger in being drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to hazzard our Soules?
There is a danger to be hurt, and
a danger in being hurt, did not
sinne come in that way? Was
not <hi>Adam</hi> led away by his wife?
and how many men perish by
being too <hi>Vxorious,</hi> by being
too flexible in that kinde? If
they had remembred the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
precept to marry, as if they
had not, they would not have
been so drawne away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a danger, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23926:15"/>
upon that danger, <hi>Let
those that have wives, be as
though they had none.</hi> What
to use them as if they had none?
to care for them, as if they had
none? No,<note place="margin">Those that have wives to be as if they had none how to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</note> that is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<hi>but to be as if they had none.</hi>
That is, Let them be as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
for Gods Truth, as if they
had no wives to hinder them;
Let them bee as willing to
suffer crosses, if God call them,
as if they had none. Let
them bee as readie to good
Duties if it fall within their
Calling, as if they had none.
Let them avoyde distracting
Cares, and worldly Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances;
as if they had none.
Let them not pretend their
Marriage to their basenesse,
and worldlinesse, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
of Crosses and afli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
when God is pleased to
call them unto them. Let them
not pretend Marriage for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23926:16"/>
their doubling in Religion and
dissembling, I shall undoe my
wife and children, <hi>Let them bee
as if they had none:</hi> for Christ
hath given us direction to hate
all in respect of Christ. A man
is not worthy of Christ and of
Religion, that undervalues not
wife and children, and all for
the Gospell. If things stand in
question: whether he shall stick
to them, or to Christ, his chiefe
husband: then we must sticke
to him. The reason is, the bond
of Religion is above all bonds.<note place="margin">Bonds in Religion, above all other.</note>
And the bond that bindes us to
Christ, it abides when all
bonds cease; for all bonds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
husband and wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
father and children,
they end in death: but the
bond of Christ is eternall. And
therefore every bond must serve
the maine bond: and therefore
we must not pretend this and
that to wrong Christ and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23926:16"/>
which is the maine
bond: Wee must so labour to
please others, that we displease
not our chiefe husband. For
the time will bee, when wee
shall neither marry nor give in
Marriage: but we shall bee as
the Angells: and that time
shall be without bounds and
limites, for Eternitie, and
wee must looke to that. And
therefore those that marrie, <hi>Let
them be as if they were not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi>
You know how it fared
with him in the Gospell, that
pretended this, for his not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Christ: hee that was
married, saith, <hi>I cannot come,</hi>
he could not, his excuse was
more peremptory then the rest;
<hi>he couldnot.</hi> Could this excuse
him? And will pretending
this excuse men when they are
called to duties? There is that
disproportion, so much between
Christ our chiefe Husband and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23926:17"/>
any other, though it be the
wife of our bosome, or the
children of our loines (the one
having redeemed us, and is our
best husband, a husband for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie
in heaven) that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
will serve the turne for a
man to wrong the bond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for any bond whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
And therefore you know
the peremptorie answer to him
that pretended that excuse,
<hi>You shall never taste of my feast.</hi>
But I have beene too long in
this point, intending other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tters.</p>
            <p>And those that weepe, as
though they wept not.</p>
            <p>It is lawfull to weepe,<note place="margin">Weeping lawfull</note> not
onely for sinne (that should be
the main) but likewise to weep
for the miseries of the time and
state we live in. There is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
here, <hi>Oh! that my head
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23926:17"/>
were a fountaine of teares,</hi> saith
<hi>Ieremiah;</hi> he thought he could
not weepe enough: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he wisheth that his head
were a <hi>Fountaine,</hi> hee thought
his teares would soone be dry,
<hi>Oh! that my head were a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
so that there is a liberty
to weepe. Nay men are bound
to weepe. There are teares of
sympathy, for the miserie of
the State and time we live in.
And so for familie-losses and
crosses, wee are flesh, and not
spirit, and God hath made us
men, and hath given us sensible
apprehensions of griefe; and
it is a cursed temper to bee
without Naturall affection.
Wee may weep, and we may
grieve, nay, we ought to grieve.</p>
            <p>Now griefe is as it were
the cloud from whence the
showre of teares comes, and
weeping is but a distillation of
that vapour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:23926:18"/>
Now if wee may grieve and
ought to grieve for the times,
and it is a stupid temper, not
to apprehend the miseries of
the state, &amp; times we live in, if
we may grieve, we may weep,
that is put for the Spring
whence weeping comes. For
griefe it selfe, there is a liberty no
question of that, wee may
weepe, but we must weepe, as
if wee wept not. For there is
a danger in weeping over much
for any crosses.<note place="margin">Weeping excessive dangerous</note> Here is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for wee may flatter our
griefe too much, for wives,
or children. God takes it ill, he
takes it unkindely, that when
Christ himselfe is a perpetuall
husband, and God is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Father, that we should
weepe and grieve too much;
for the losse of father, or of
wife, or of childe. For is not
God worth all? So there is a
danger, that naturally we are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23926:18"/>
prone to over grieve, when
wee doe grieve, as we are to
over-joy when we doe joy, for
our Nature can hardly keepe
bounds; and God takes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindely
when we doe so, when
wee over-grieve,<note place="margin">Excessive griefe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues want of trust in God.</note> for it is a
signe wee fetch not that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from him that is the Spring
and Fountaine, that wee should
doe. And therefore let those that
weepe, be as if they wept not.
That is, not over-much. <hi>For
the time is short,</hi> doest thou loose
any friend, or any thing, <hi>The
time is short,</hi> we shall meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
There is but a little time
betweene this and the latter
Judgement, <hi>And the fashion of
this world passeth away.</hi> There
will be a new World, a new
heaven, and a new earth. And
then wee shall live for ever
with the Lord.</p>
            <p>And then my <hi>Brethren.</hi> Why?
<hi>Brethren</hi> should not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23926:19"/>
hope of the Resurrection,
as the Gentiles are. They may
weepe that never thinke to
see one another againe. But a
Christian, a brother, that hath
hope of meeting againe, let
not him weepe as without
hope, so <hi>let us weepe, as if wee
wept not:</hi> So hee layes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon that, nay though
our weeping bee for sinne,
there must be a moderation
in that,<note place="margin">Moderation in griefe for sin.</note> for wee may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieve,
for wee are bound
to Ioy in the Lord, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to reioyce. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must weepe for sinne,
so as wee must remember
to Ioy. Wee must with one
eye looke upon our sinnes
to humble us, and to worke
upon our hearts to grieve;
but with the other Eye, wee
must looke upon Gods mercie
in Christ to comfort us againe.
The best griefe of all must bee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23926:19"/>
moderate, much more griefe
for any earthly thing.</p>
            <p>Now when we are tempted
to over-grieve, for any earthly
thing, the best way is diversion.
Doe I grieve for these? I, but is
my soule as it should be? Let
me weepe over my dead soule,
as Christ wept over <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
when he was dead Let mee
weepe over my dull soule, let
me weepe over that.</p>
            <p>As Physitians, when the
bloud runnes too much one
way, they give an issue another
way: so let us turne our griefe
the right way, if wee weepe
for other things, How is it
with us, is the life of Grace
there? Is reckonings eaven
betweene God and my soule?
Am I fit to end my dayes?
Am I in a state fit for heaven?
then we shall weepe for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
It is pitty such pearles as
tears should be lost; God hath no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23926:20"/>
bottles for teares that are shed
over-much for the things of the
world. But if they be for our
sinnes, and the sinnes of the
time wee live in, and for the ils
and miseries of the State that
are on us, and hang over our
heads, then let us weepe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
turne our griefe the right
way, and then let us grieve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
if we will, so our griefe
runne in that channell.</p>
            <p>Those that Ioy as if they did
not.</p>
            <p>Ioy we may, and we ought,
for God envies not our Ioy,<note place="margin">Ioy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> hee
hath given us wherewith in
this life to Ioy, abundance of
comforts of all sorts, for all our
senses Flowers, and Colors, &amp;c.
Wee have nothing in soule or
body, but it hath obiects to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in, God hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23926:20"/>
for the soule to delight in,
and there is somewhat to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
us in every Creature, so
sweet is God; wee may, and
ought to reioyce. God gives us
wife and children to reioyce
in, <hi>Reioyce in the wife of thy
youth.</hi> There is no question of
a libertie in these things.</p>
            <p>But then there is a danger:<note place="margin">Danger in Ioy.</note>
especially in the sweet affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
There is danger, because
wee are like to over-ioy. And
poyson is the subtillest, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in sweet things. Wee are
proane to over-Joy. There is
a danger, therefore, there must
bee a restraint. <hi>We must Ioy as
if we reioyced not:</hi> that is, so ioy,
in any thing here, as considering
that the <hi>time is short,</hi> I cannot
enioy it long. Shall I ioy in that
that I cannot inioy? <hi>The time is
short,</hi> I cannot enioy them. If a
man cannot enioy a thing long,
he cannot joy. <hi>The time is short</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:23926:21"/>
you must goe. The things must
goe, and both must goe: <hi>And
the fashion of this world passeth
away.</hi> All the frame of things
passe away; Marriage passeth
away; and Callings passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and friendes passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and all passe away.
And therefore Ioy, as if you
ioyed not. I beseech you let
us leame to Ioy, as if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced
not. The Prophet
calls <hi>Nineveh</hi> a reioycing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And wee live in a Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
age. Men eate and drinke
as they did in the dayes of
the Old World, In <hi>Noahs</hi>
time, they marry, and give
in Marriage. Wee live in
Joviall times; and therefore
wee had need to lay some
restraint upon our ioy: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when God calls us to
mourning as well as Ioy, as
hee doth if wee looke round
about us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If wee looke upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23926:21"/>
the time, we should see cause to
Ioy as if wee did not. Wee
must not alway bee on the
merry pinne, as wee say, but
wee must temper and qualifie
our Ioy.</p>
            <p>Now considering that the
Apostle addes, <hi>weeping, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
and <hi>Ioy,</hi> you see that</p>
            <p>Religion is especially in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the affections.</p>
            <p>Religion is in purging the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from the evill that is
in them,<note place="margin">Religion in the affections chiefely</note> and moderating
them, if they bee lawfull and
good. And therefore thinke
not that you are Religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
if you know a great
deale, as many Christians
are verie greedie of knowing.
And yet if you looke to their
lives, their griefe, and their
Ioy is intemperate, they have
not learned to bridle and to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23926:22"/>
schoole their affections. You see
that Religion is in moderating
of griefe and Ioy in earthly
things: Let us see men shew
the power of Religionin bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of crosses, so that <hi>they weepe
as if they wept not:</hi> and in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
prosperitie so as they
can learne to abound, to Ioy,
as if not. That man hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Religion to purpose: for
Religion is especially about the
affections: for wee are good
if wee Joy well, and grieve
well, but not, if wee know
much. The Divell doth that
better than wee: Therefore
especially labour, that God
would vouchsafe Grace to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
the affections, that wee
may know how to Grieve and
how to Ioy, as naturally indeed
we doe not.</p>
            <p>And then wee see here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
point (which now I adde)
that</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:23926:22"/>
The Affections of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are mixed.</p>
            <p>They so weepe as that it is
mingled with Ioy,<note place="margin">Affections of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans mixed.</note> and their
Ioy is mingled with Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
<hi>They weepe as if they wept
not, They Ioy as if they Ioyed
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A carnall man is in simples
altogether; If he Ioy he thrusts
the house out of the window,
(as wee say) If hee be merry
hee is mad, he hath no bounds.
If he be sorrowfull, if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
restraine him not, hee
sinkes like a beast under his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
as <hi>Nabal</hi> did, for he hath
no grace to temper his sorrow,
and to temper his Ioy. And
therefore hee is over sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or over Iocund. Ah! but
Grace (considering that wee
have obiects of both) doth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the affections. A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
when hee Ioyes, he doth not
over-Ioy, for hee hath cause at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23926:23"/>
that time to mourne for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what:
and when he grieves, he
doth not over-grieve: for
hee hath somewhat then to
Ioy in; for Christ is his, and
heaven is his, and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God to direct all for
good, is his still, hee hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to Ioy in at the worst.
And therefore all his affections
are tempered and qualified. So
much for that point.</p>
            <p>And they that buy, as if
they possessed not.</p>
            <p>It is lawfull to buy,<note place="margin">Buying lawfull.</note> because
it is lawfull to make contracts;
and proprietie is lawfull: every
man ought to have his owne,
or else there were no thest, if
there were no propriety; nor
there could be no workes of
mercie. Now if proprietie and
dominion of things be lawfull,
<hi>that we may possesse things as our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23926:23"/>
owne,</hi> then buying is lawfull, that
is one way of contract, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
things our owne, there is
no danger in that.<note place="margin">Danger in buying.</note> But there is
a danger in the manner of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Men buy to perpetuat them
selves, <hi>They call their lands after
their names,</hi> such a house of such
a one, <hi>Enoch</hi> of <hi>Enochs,</hi> and they
thinke to continue for ever. God
makes fooles of them, for how
few have you that goe beyond
the third generation? how few
houses have you, that the childe,
or the Grand-childe can say, <hi>this
was my Grand-fathers, and my
Great Grand-fathers?</hi> How few
houses have you, that are now
in them can say, <hi>My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestour
dwelt here, and these
were his Lands?</hi> Goe over a
whole Countrey it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so.</p>
            <p>Men when they build toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with building in the
earth, they build Castles in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23926:24"/>
aire, they have conceits: Now
I build for my childe, and for
my childes childe. God cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
them, either they have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
or by a thousand things
that fall out in the world, that
it falls out otherwise. <hi>The time
is short, And the fashion of this
world passeth away.</hi> That is,
The buildings passe away, the
owning passeth away, al things
here passe away: and therefore
buy as if you possessed not, buy
so as wee neglect not the best
possession in heaven, and so pos.
sesse these things, as being not
possessed and commanded of
them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. There you see
the yeare of <hi>Iubile</hi> in the 50
yeare war, that all possessions
might returne againe, if men
would. God trained them up
by this, to teach them that they
should not thinke of inheriting
things long, that they bought;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23926:24"/>
for it returned in the yeare of
<hi>Iubile,</hi> in the fiftieth yeare: so
wee must learne that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possesse things long.
Though we possesse them our
selves, wee may bee thrust out
by fraud or tyranny. Therefore
<hi>Let those that buy, be as though
they did not possesse. Ier.</hi> 22. 23. he
saith, <hi>Thou makest thy nest in the
Cedars,</hi> and thinkest it shall be
thus and thus with thee. Oh!
Beloved, let not us build and
dwell in our hopes and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
upon that which will
yeeld no certaine hope and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
in this world, <hi>For the
fashion of this world</hi> (as we shal
see after) <hi>passeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then for <hi>Brethren,</hi> that
have an inheritance in heaven,
for them to buy as if they should
live here for ever. <hi>Brethren,</hi> that
is a reason to take them off, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
buy as if you possessed not.</hi>
Thus you see, I have gone over
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23926:25"/>
the foure Directions.</p>
            <p>They that use the world, as
not abusing it.</p>
            <p>Wee may use the world,
while wee are here in it, for
we cannot want the things of
this life. We are members of
two worlds, while we are here.
Wee are Members of this
world, and wee are heires
of a better, wee have relation to
two worlds.</p>
            <p>Now while wee live in this
world,<note place="margin">Vsing the world law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> wee must use the things
of this world. How many
things doth this poore life need
while wee are in this world?
While we are passengers, wee
must have things to helpe us in
the way to heaven. Passengers
must have recessaries, there is
no question of that. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must use the world ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies, it is a point of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23926:25"/>
and therefore I will not
spend time in that. But then,
<hi>Vse the world,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As not abusing it.</p>
            <p>There is danger in using the
world,<note place="margin">Danger in vsing the world.</note> there is a danger of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in our affections to the
things of this world, so much
as that wee forget a better
world: and therefore wee
should use it as not abusing it.</p>
            <p>How should we use it?</p>
            <p>VVhy use this world as
laying a foundation for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
World. VVhile wee live
here, use the world as wee
may further our recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
for a better. Vse the
things of the world as wee
may expresse some grace in the
using of it. Vse the world as that
the using of it may comfort us
when the thing passeth. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23926:26"/>
               <hi>world passeth.</hi> But let us use the
world, as that the grace that
wee expresse in the use of it
may continue. Use the world
to the honour of God, to the
good of others, to the increase
of our reckoning: abuse it not
to the dishonour of God: fight
not against God with his own
blessings, that is to abuse the
world: Forget not God the
Giver. Were it not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
thing if a man should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
strangers, if they should
turne their kinde friend that
had invited them, out of dores?
And so it is to use the things
of the world so, as to turne
God out of our hearts that gives
all. Turne not the things of
this world against God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
others, to make them
weapons of iniustice, to be great
to ruine others. Abuse them
not to wrong, and to pierce
our owne soules (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23926:26"/>
saith) <hi>with Cares and the
like:</hi> This is to abuse the world
when wee dishonour God
and wrong others, or to pierce
our owne soules: God hath
not given us the things of this
world for this end, to hurt our
selves with them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
together with the things
let us desire a gracious use of
all things; for a gracious use of
them, is better than the thing
it selfe. Labour to use them as
not abusing them (as we shall)
if wee have not grace to use
them well, (as one saith) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men have the gifts of God
without God; because they have
not his grace.</hi> When we have
the gifts of God, desire Grace
to mannage them well. To
his children God gives this
with the other: hee never
gives them any thing, but hee
gives them Grace to make a
sanctified use of it. They are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23926:27"/>
sanctified to all thinges,
and all things are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
unto them, <hi>Vse the world
as not abusing of it.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is strong, <hi>The time is short,</hi>
why should wee bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
in using the things of
this world (for that is one way
of abusing of the things of this
world) <hi>The time is short,</hi> wee
must bee pulled from them
whether wee will or no. And
therefore let us weane our
selves, <hi>For the time is short.</hi>
And then <hi>The fashion of this
world passeth away.</hi> Why
should wee dote upon a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
fashion? All things
here passe away, the things of
the world passe away, and a
new fashion comes after And
then you, <hi>Brethren,</hi> that are
heires of a better world, use
this <hi>World, as not abusing it;
Brethren,</hi> hee puts them in
minde of a higher calling. And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23926:27"/>
so I come to the last.</p>
            <p>For the fashion of this world
passeth away.</p>
            <p>That is the second reason,<note place="margin">The world a shew.</note>
The <hi>Schema,</hi> that is, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of this world, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fashion, the outward
view and hew of the things of
this world passe away. It is
a notable diminishing word in
the Originall, as if the world
were not a substance, but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
<hi>Schema.</hi> As wee say in
Philosophy, in the Aire there
are Apparitions and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as there are flying-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
sometimes, and fighting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the aire: These are
not substances, but Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things; it is but
<hi>Phasis,</hi> but an Apparition,
or Shape. The substance and
true Realtie of these things
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23926:28"/>
is another matter: so whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in the world, it is but
an apparition: When the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
shewed Christ all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world, hee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him but an apparition, but a
shew of things.</p>
            <p>There is a diminishing in the
word, <hi>Shew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then in the word, <hi>fadeth
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fashion of this world pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away;</hi> or as some translate
it, <hi>Deceives, and turnes us aside:</hi>
And so it doth indeed from
better things. <hi>The fashion of
this world passeth away.</hi> That
Translation is fit enough. <hi>It pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away.</hi> Now shall wee be
immoderate in any thing that
passeth away? It is but an
Apparition, but a shew,
but a Pageant. The word is
partly taken from a Pageant,
or a shew that hath a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of this and that. But
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23926:28"/>
there is no realtie or substance
in a Pageant. From this, <hi>That
the thinges of this world are
but an Apparition</hi> or Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</p>
            <p>Learne to conceive aright of
the things of this life,<note place="margin">Vse Things of this life shewes.</note> that
there is no realtie in them to
speake of. They have a kinde
of realtie: Riches are in some
sort riches: and Beautie is in
some sort Beautie: and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
is in some sort Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and so Possessions are in
some sort Possessions. But all
this is but a Pageant as it were,
as a man that acts in a Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
or in a Play, hee is in
some sort a King, or a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
for the time: But wee
value him not as hee is then,
but as hee is when he is off the
Stage. And while wee live
here, wee act the part, some of
a Rich-man, some of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
some of a Beggar or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23926:29"/>
poore man, all is but an acting
of a part. And there is a lesse
proportion betweene the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of a part in this life,
than there is betweene our
life and eternitie. All is but
the acting of a part. VVee
are not rich in the grave more
than others. The King is
as poore in the Grave, as
the base Peasant, his Riches
follow him not. The worme
and the grave know no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
when wee goe to
that house there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
all acting, and all
differences end in the Grave.
And therefore considering,
that this world is but an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition,
but the acting of a
part, why should wee thinke
our selves the better for any
thing here? Doth hee that
acts the part of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
upon the Stage think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
better than another, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23926:29"/>
acts the part of a Poore man?
No. Hee knowes hee shall
goe off in short time, and
then hee shall bee as hee was
before: why are wee not thus
wise in better things: It is not
hee that acts; the greatest part,
but hee that acts well, he that
acts the part of a poore man
may bee better than hee that
acts the part of a rich man: it
is not the greatnesse of the
part, but the well acting of
it: all is but an Apparition. If
a meane man honour God in
his condition, and bee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in a meane estate, hee is a
thousand times better then a
great man that makes his
greatnesse an instrument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice,
as if all the world were
to serve his turne, and to make
men <hi>Idolize</hi> him, such a man is a
wretched man, and will bee
when hee is turned off, the
Stage. It is no matter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23926:30"/>
how long hee hath lived, or
how great a part hee hath A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but how well. VVee
value not men as they are
when they are acting, but as
they are after. If they were
bad before, they are bad after:
and they are praised after, if
they doe it well. So it is no
matter what a man acts, if hee
doe it well, hee is for ever
happie. If hee doe it ill, hee
is forever miserable: all here
is but a Pageant. If you talke
of realtie,<note place="margin">Things in religion, reall.</note> it is in the things
of Religion. If you talke of
true Nobilitie, it is to bee the
Childe of God. If you talke
of true Riches, they are those
that wee carrie to our death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
those that wee carrie to
Heaven; those that comfort
the soule; those that inrich
the soule with Grace, and
Comfort, and Peace, that is
true Riches. If you talke of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23926:30"/>
true Beautie, it is to have the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God stamped upon
our soules, to bee like Christ,
to be new Creatures. If wee
talke of true Strength, it is to
stand against Temptations, to be
able to serve God, and to goe
through the world without
polluting our soules, to beare
Crosses as wee should,
that is the true realtie. <hi>The
things of this life are all but Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi>
and Pageants. The
greatest man in the world will
say so when he lyes a dying, as
that great Emperour said, <hi>I
have runne through all things,
and now nothing doth mee good.</hi>
The realtie was gone that hee
thought of, and now there
was nothing but a shew and
Apparition; when the realtie
was gone, nothing doth mee
good. Come to a man that is
gasping out his life, and aske
him, what doth honours doe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23926:31"/>
you good? What doth riches
doe you good? what doth
possessions doe you good? <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
a wise man, wise by the
Spirit of God, wise by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
because hee was a King:
wise by a speciall gift of God,
and the spirit of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
together with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God and a gift of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee had all to inable
him to give a true sentence;
hee that had runne through the
varietie of all good things,
what doth hee pronounce, but
<hi>Vanity of Vanities?</hi> he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himselfe, <hi>Vanity of vanities</hi>
sayth Wise, Holy, experienced
<hi>Solomon,</hi> he that had all abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that no man was able to
say it so well as hee, yet
hee saith <hi>Vanitie of Vanities,</hi>
and that which is worse <hi>Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Spirit,</hi> if a man have
not especiall grace to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them a right. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beseech you <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:23926:31"/>
doe but represent the things of
this life, even under the notion
here, they are but <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
they are but <hi>Pageants.</hi> If
wee be to buy any thing in
this world: wee pull off the
trappings, wee pull off the
Masque, or else wee may bee
couzened in the thing: So if
we would iudge of the things
of this world as they are;
What is within Riches? is
there not a great deale of care?
What is within government?
What is within the things of
this life? There is a goodly
<hi>shew</hi> and <hi>Apparition:</hi> what is
within? Pull of the Masque,
and then you shal see the things
of this World: The more you
pierce into them, and the more
you know them, the worse you
will like them. Like a picture
that seemes goodly stuffe afar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off,
but neere-hand it seems baser
so if you come neer these things
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23926:32"/>
there is emptinesse, and not
onely so, but Vexation But in
the things of heaven, the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
you are, the more you
will love them, the more you
will admire them: the more
a man knowes God, the more
hee may know him: the more
a man knowes Christ and loves
Christ, the more hee may:
there is a height, and bredth,
and depth, there all dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the love of God in
Christ, and in the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they are beyond compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.
The things that wee
have in Christ, they are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the soule, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend them. There
is nothing here, but wee may
compasse it, it is inferiour to
our knowledge and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
our affections and our
knowledge are larger than any
thin here; the things of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life are beyond all. Shall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23926:32"/>
wee stand upon apparitions,
that the more wee know them,
the more wee shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valew
them?</p>
            <p>And the fashion of this
world passeth away.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>fashion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It passeth away.</note> it is but a <hi>fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and then it <hi>passeth away.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they doe passe away, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
sheweth that they
passe even like a river. As we
see the <hi>Thames,</hi> or any river,
the water passeth away, it goes
and goes along, but it never
comes: so the things of this
world, they passe away, but
they never come againe, they
vanish away, and wee passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with them too. Even as
men in a ship, whether they
eat or drinke, or sleepe, or
walke, the ship goeth, and
they goe in it. So it is in this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23926:33"/>
world, whether wee eate or
drinke, or sleepe, wee passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to death. Every day takes
a part of our life away: and
every day wee live, wee live
a day lesse, it is gone and past,
and never returnes againe, as
water, which it is gone: and
whether wee walke or doe
any thing, the <hi>time passeth.</hi>
While you heare, and while I
speake, <hi>the time passeth,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
returnes againe: so <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of this world passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
All thinges are passing
here.</p>
            <p>VVhat is the ground of
this, that all things are thus
passing? Goods that are not
stable, we say they are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
and indeed those things
that wee call immoveables
are moveables: All passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
heaven and earth will
passe away ere long. And
there will bee a new heaven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23926:33"/>
and a new earth. Kingdomes
passe away, and Kings passe
away, and States passe away.
VVhat is become of Rome?
VVhat is become of <hi>Ierusalem?</hi>
VVhat is become of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and all those goodly Cities?
All are <hi>passed away,</hi> they
are all gone. This experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
speakes as well as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie.</p>
            <p>Now the ground of all
this is,<note place="margin">1 Reason, because they were made of nothing.</note> not onely the Nature of
things, taken from the Nature
of all things that are made of
nothing; and therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to fall to their first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
againe. That is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
reason, why things may
bee moove-able <hi>and passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
But that they are so,
it is not a sufficient reason,
for GOD might have sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the mutabilitie of
things, if hee would, as the
heavenly Angels are mutable,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23926:34"/>
because they are Created, but
God hath suspended there mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
world without end;
And therfore it is not sufficient
that all things are of nothing, it
shewes that of themselves,
they may turne to nothing
indeed.</p>
            <p>But there is another reason
behinde,<note place="margin">2. They are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> that now since the fall
of man, there is a curse upon
all things. There is a sentence
of mutability and change, and
a sentence of <hi>passing</hi> is passed
upon all this, that all things
that have a beginning, shal have
an end, and that this world shal
be a Stage of changes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration:
There is a sentence
of Vanitie upon the Creature,
(as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<hi>The Creature is subject to
Vanitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>not of his owne will,
but because God hath subdued it
to Vanitie. Rom.</hi> 8. Man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Treason, and therefore the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23926:34"/>
Creatures which are mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
all mourne for their
masters fall; they all mourne
in blacke, as it were. All the
Creatures are subiect to Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
all the Creatures under
the Sunne, are subiect to mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and change: but we may
thanke our selves, wee are
the grand-traitors that brought
this miserie upon the Creature;
that is the true reason why all
things <hi>passe away,</hi> and so why
our selves have the sentence of
death upon us, <hi>wee passe away,</hi>
and the things <hi>passe away,</hi> and
wee in the use of them. Thus
you see the ground of this, why
things passe away in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of mutabilitie and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that God hath passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
            <p>If this be so,<note place="margin">Vse. Not to grieve for the losse of them.</note> beloved, let us
learne not to passe much for
things that will <hi>passe away,</hi> not
to passe for them: learne all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23926:35"/>
the former directions. <hi>The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of this world passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
Shall wee grieve much
for the losse of that that wee
cannot hold? Wee say if a
glasse be broke, is a man much
angrie? a frayle thing is
broken. If a friend bee dead,
shall a man bee therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?
<hi>The fashion of this world
passeth away.</hi> A sentence is
passed upon them. Shall I
be moved at that that God hath
set downe a Law for, that one
generation shall goe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall follow after: and
there is a succession as in the
streames of water? Shall I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Cods sentence? God hath
made all things fraile, and it is
but the common condition of
all since the fall.</p>
            <p>So it should be a use of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and contentment with any
thing in this world,<note place="margin">2. Vse. To be content with little.</note> place, or
Riches, or honour, I must
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23926:35"/>
leave them, I know not how
soone: and this will breed a
disposition of contentment. It
is enough for him that must
leave all, I know not how
soone, have I little or much, I
must leave all: here is enough
for him that must leave all:
and therefore leave worldly
things to worldly men: leave
all these vaine things to vaine
men: shall I build a fixed hope
on vaine things? Oh! no, that
should not be so.</p>
            <p>As we must learne content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">3. To be moderate in desires.</note>
so it should take us off
from the hopes of this world,
and from promising our selves
that which we have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in the world for, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
VVho promised
thee thou shouldest enioy thy
wise long, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
enjoy thy children long,
thy place long: haste thou
a promise for this? The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23926:36"/>
of things fight against
thee. The things of the world
are variable. Have wee not
experience of former times?
And have wee not Scriptures
to shew that all is <hi>Vanitie?</hi>
Why should wee promise our
selves that which the Word
doth not promise us, or that
wee cannot see experience of
in the world? Why would
wee have a condition severed
from all men? The seeing of
things in a condition of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as it should teach us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in the use of all
things, so it should teach us
moderation and wisedome, that
Wee should not promise our
selves any thing in this
world.</p>
            <p>And it should teach us to
provide for stable,<note place="margin">4. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things</note> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
things in changes and
alterations: Looke to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that may stand by us,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23926:36"/>
when all these things are gone:
will all these things leave me,
and must I leave them? How
is it with me for world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end? Shall I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looke for those comforts
and those graces, and for that
condition, that will abide
when I am gone hence? what
desperate folly were it? Let
us labour for a sanctifyed use
of the <hi>passing away</hi> of these
things, that wee may provide
for that which is not subiect to
alteration and change. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God. in Christ is for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.
The Graces of
Gods Spirit are for Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
The condition of Gods
Children is for everlasting.
And therefore why should we
looke after perishing things,
and neglect better? For a
Christian hath the realtie of
things, hee hath a Husband for
ever. Hee hath matter of ioy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23926:37"/>
for ever, he hath a possession for
ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; then there will be a new
world. All these things are but
<hi>Shews:</hi> the Christian hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of al, that never <hi>passes away:</hi>
and therefore considering that
all things else <hi>passe away,</hi> but
the things that belong to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
as a Christian; let Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
learne to make most of their
best calling, and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as they are Christians, and
value others as they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not as they are rich, or as they
are poore as they are noble, or as
they are great. <hi>The fashion of
this world passeth away;</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them by that they have of
eternitie, what of the Spirit is
in them? what of the Image of
God is in them? What Grace
is in them? are they new
borne? are they truely noble?
are they new Creatures? va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them by that, and labour to
get that stamped upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23926:37"/>
and upon our friends. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have Communion so
with those that wee love, that
wee may have eternall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in heaven with them.
Labour so to enioy our friends,
that our friendship may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in heaven, considering,
that <hi>The fashion of this world
passeth away.</hi> All friendship,
all Bonds, all Possessions and all
that we dote of, and are despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly
mad on, all passeth away.
<hi>The fashion of this world passeth
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a strange thing (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved)
That a man capea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of high thoughts,<note place="margin">The world too low for a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians thoughte.</note> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thoughts, should spend
the marrow of his soule, and
the strength of his spirits, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these things, that he should
tyre his spirits, that hee should
cracke his Conscience, that
hee should weare out his
Life about thinges vvhich
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23926:38"/>
he cannot tell how long he shal
inioy them, and neglect these
things that abide for ever: for
a man this is ill, but for <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
as he saith, for <hi>Brethren</hi>
to doe so, that have an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
immortall, for them to
bee cast off the hookes for
everie Crosse, for everie
losse,<note place="margin">Why Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stians are excessive in outward things.</note> that are the children of
God, and heires of heaven.
What a shame is this, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are so much in ioy, and so
much in sorrow for these things.
It comes from 2 or 3 grounds.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1. They looke not upon them as past.</note> they doe not consider
and looke upon things as past:
they looke not with the eye of
Faith upon things, these things
will passe: but they looke upon
things in passing, and they see
no alteration for the present:
they should consider, I,
but what sentence is upon
them? These are as good as past,
they will bee gone ere long,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23926:38"/>
looke upon things in the world,
see all things are passed. We
are dead, our friends are dead,
and the world is gone. Faith
saith this, wee consider not this
Eye, and so we are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with them: wee looke
upon things passing, and there
wee see little alteration. A
man that lookes upon the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
passing, hee cannot see it:
but if hee come two or three
houres after, hee shall see it past.
Let us looke upon things as
gone, though they bee not for
the present gone, see them in the
Eye of Faith, and that will
make us consider them as <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. We compare not with eternitie.</note> wee are deceived
hence in the passing of the
things of this life, that wee
compare them not with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
VVee thinke it a great
matter to enioy things twenty
or fortie yeares. VVhat is this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23926:39"/>
point of time to eternitie?
Compare this short time here,
of health and strength, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and place, and friends,
what is this to Eternitie? what
desperate follie is it to venture
the losse of Eternitie, for the
enioying of these things?
Compare these things with
world without end, and that
will keepe us from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
with these passing
things: we are deceived, because
wee laie them not in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with things that are for
ever.</p>
            <p>And then the third ground
is wee are forgetfull,<note place="margin">3. We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our better condition.</note> wee are
not mindefull of our best
condition, wee make not
that use of our knowledge
that wee might.</p>
            <p>When a Christian is all in
passion, all in Ioy, all in feares,
or in griefe: why, what is the
matter at that time? What
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23926:39"/>
thoughts hath hee of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
estate, of the fading con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of these things? he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
and mindelesse. And
therefore let us labour oft to
keepe our soules in a heavenly
frame. And to draw to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
let us leame to value our
selves above all things below:
if we be Christians, as we al pro
felse our selues to be, value our
selves above all things below.
It is a poorenesse of spirit for a
Christian, for to over-ioy or to
over-grieve for any thing that
is worse than himselfe. Are not
all things so that are here, if we
be Christians indeed? if were
not Christians the very toads
and serpents are better then
blaspheming and filthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that are opposers of
Gods Ordinances, they are
better than such wretches,
as many among us, the Divell is
almost as good as they such are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23926:40"/>
next the Divell. The earth they
treade on is better than they:
but if a man have grace in him,
all the world is inferiour to
him. What weakenesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is it therefore, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to bee put off with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
cause of griefe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for any thing below, that
is meaner than our selves, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is fading, when
wee have a condition that is
not subject to fade? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oft thinke of our dignitie
in Christ; thinke of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
here (<hi>Brethren</hi>) thinke of
that as well as of the fading
condition here. If wee would
weane our selves from these
things, oft thinke of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
estate of a Christian, that
our thoughts may runne upon
that much: and then upon the
fraile condition of all things
below, that wee may be taken
off from them; for two things
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23926:40"/>
mortifie a man.</p>
            <p>The taking off of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from that they are set on,</p>
            <p>And to set them upon that
that will fill them, and satisfie
them to the full. If a man doe
that, hee doth that that a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
man should doe, that is in
this world, passing to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>To conclude all with this.</p>
            <p>All things here in this
world are subordinate to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end. And let us consider
therefore that wee use them,
as that wee loose not the
maine,</p>
            <p>All the contentments of a
Traveller,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> are subordinate to
helpe him to his iourneyes end.
If things come amisse in his
<hi>Inne,</hi> will hee quarrell with
Host, that hee hath not a soft
bed? Hee will thinke, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I shall have better at
home; and these lead me home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23926:41"/>
so all things below are
subordinate helpes to better:
Shall wee make them the
maine? Shall wee make all
things subordinate to them,
as worldlings doe, subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Religion to worldly
things, and make all things
contrary? They do not <hi>grieve
as though they grieved not;</hi>
but they heare, as if they
heard not. They receive the
Sacrament, as if they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it not. They pray, as
if they prayed not. They
speake of Holy things, and do
them, as if they did them
not. All things in Religion,
as if not, but for other things,
they are drowned in them:
This is the policie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
that labours to bring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to bee subordinate. So
that if men can bee religious,
and have the favour of such
a one: If hee can be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23926:41"/>
and bee great in the
world, hee will: but if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it selfe, and the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for it hinder their aimes
away with it, they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee hollow, then stand
for a good cause, because they
have not learned to subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
things to the maine end;
and the reason is,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why men aime not at the maine.</note> because
they have not Grace and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
VVisedome to teach
them in what place things
should bee valued; what is
the maine, and what attends
upon the maine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they take by-things for
the maine, and the maine
for the by. Indeed no man
is wise, but a sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and hee is wise for his
soule, and hee is wise for
Eternitie.<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament</note> But what is this
for the Sacrament? To cut off
other things, it is this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:23926:42"/>
Are all things perishing
food, such as we must leave,
vaine and emptie things? Will
not this therefore make us seek
the maine, the food that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
to everlasting life, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to bee in Christ more and
more, labour to cherish
Communion with Christ, that
Everlasting Bond? VVhat is
the Sacrament, but the Food of
our Soules, our Everlasting
<hi>Manna,</hi> that will continue
for ever, and make us continue
for ever? Christ, if we have
him hee continues for ever,
and hee makes us continue
for ever too. And therefore
considering that all things else
are vaine. I beseech you let
the consideration of that that
hath beene spoken, bee as
sowre herbes to make the
<hi>Passeover,</hi> to make Christ
relish the better. Oh! Are
all things vaine, and shall I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23926:42"/>
not labour to have my part in
that that shall never die in him
that is my Husband for ever,
and my Lord for ever? Shall
I not labour to strengthen mine
Interest in him that hath all
good things in him? What if
all the earth should fayle? If
I have Communion with Christ
I have all. If I marry Christ,
I have all with him. All is
my Ioynture, if I have Christ
once, <hi>All things are yours, if
you are Christs.</hi> If I have Christ
what can I want, when I
receive the Sacrament, having
Communion with Christ? Let
this strengthen my desire to
come to the Sacrament, in this
that I have spoken: that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things fayle, our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ is Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
Therefore looke to
that. Christ is the food of the

quarter of an houre: The
sweetnesse is gone presently,
and the strength within a day
or two, of all other food
that wee take: but this food
Christ, the food of the Soule.
Christ offering himselfe unto
death, and shedding out his
bloud, and giving his bodie
to bee crucified for us: This
food feedes our soules to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life. VVee cherish our
Faith in the assurance of the
favour of God to everlasting:
the sweetnesse, the strength,
and the comfort of this food
indures for ever. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
considering that all other
things are food that perisheth;
labour for that that will feed
us to everlasting life. And then
wee shall make a right use of
the alteration and change of all
things.</p>
            <p>A heathen man can say this
Text, all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I have, set
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23926:43"/>
(<hi>Brethren</hi>) aside: a heathen
man could tell you, <hi>The time
is short, And the fashion of
things passe away.</hi> Hee sees
them, and thereupon could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Negative part: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee should not be world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Negative part: by
the light of Nature, a man
that hath no Religion may bee
sound in that, and therefore
not to care much for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, considering that
wee must bee gone.</p>
            <p>A Heathen man could speake
very sweetly this way, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the rest:
what fine speeches had they
this way. Oh! but the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
part, that is, when we
see all things here are vaine
and fading, to know what wee
must cleave too, that is proper
to religion to know Christ, &amp; the
good we have by Christ, when
we have him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have al, he is the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23926:44"/>
of our soules: these things are
proper to Religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us arise from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Vanitie of all
things to the positive part, to
interest our selves in that that is
better then all things. Which
if we have, we have all; and
then we shall make a
right use of
this.</p>
