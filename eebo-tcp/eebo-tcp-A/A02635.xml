            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Iewel, that in your bookes you corrupte and falsifie the holy Scriptures by priuate interpretation, that you denye certaine General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, as for lacke of age and yeres, that you misconstrue other most Auncient Councels, and Fathers, partly by figuratiue Phrases, lightly applied in very weighty maters, partly by paring away their wordes, yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by lopping of certaine their whole workes (which and such other the like, haue ben hitherto, as it is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your ordinary and shameles shiftes): I thought good at this time writing particularly vnto you, to touche briefly some other mater, that might more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, if not to cal you home againe vnto the Churche wherein you were baptized, who seme to stande obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue once attempted, yet to stay some, and to reuoke others, to the felowship of that Citie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </note> and can by no meanes be at any time hidde, as Christe him selfe hath warranted vs, the Prophetes haue fortolde vs, and the Psalmes haue sounded vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15584:3"/>And thus to do I am the rather moued, for that some of your Ministers, and many of your deceiued fauourers, as we heare say, seing now your forgeries espied, your corruptions detected, your lies manifested, your insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie brought to light, beginne to take an other way, how to abuse the people, kepe some credite, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the course of your pleasant Gospel. Yea for sooth they say now, that these controuersed points be no maters of the Faith, no Articles of the Crede, but Schole points of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, and that it sufficeth to beleeue in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Sonne, in the holy Ghost, and to beleeue the birth, passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest at libertie.</p>
            <p>They, that teache this dangerous peece of dostrine, seme to skimme of the froth of that olde Nouatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, not calling to remembrance Chore, Dathan, and Abiron, who, as S. Cyprian saith,<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. <hi>1.</hi> epist. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> beleued in one God, worshipped one God, called vpon him, and lyued in like Law and Religion, as Moyses and Aaron did. Yet bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they diuided them selues by schisme from the rest, and resisted their Priestes and Gouernous, Gods heauy hande lighted on them.</p>
            <p>And touching this mater, who seeth not that there be expressed in the Crede other Articles to be beleeued of them, which wilbe saued, as to beleeue the Churche, Remission of sinnes, euerlasting life, and that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in the Trinitie excludeth not these, and that in
<pb facs="tcp:15584:3"/>
these there is not one meaning among Heretiques, and Catholikes, <hi>not one and the same Lavve of the Crede,</hi> as S. Cyprian calleth it? For when they be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, beleeue you Remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes, and life euerlasting through the Churche, they answer not truly. For they haue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, without the which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and then can it not auaile them to beleeue in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoste, as Chore, Dathan, and Abiron had a right beleefe of God, which neuerthelesse were damned. As, touching Faith, it is necessary besides the Article of the Trinitie, to beleeue the other Articles, that the Church holdeth: so touching Vnitie, it behoueth a man to ioyne him selfe vnto the whole body of Christ the Catholik Church, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of whose Head, that is the ministerial Head, and gouerneth ouer al vnder Christe, who so euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth, he entreth Schisme, and vntil he returne, and be duly reconciled, he remaineth a dead member, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut of from the body. The Nouatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Pelagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Donatists, erred not in the Article of the Trinitie, yet are they reputed Heretikes of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned memorie. S. Augustine auouched that the beleefe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pelagians was not sufficient, although they touched not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees maladies. For (saith he) there is mo then one kind of infection, as of bodies, so of mindes.</p>

Be the pointes wherein ye dissent from vs, I meane from the Catholique Church, neuer so fewe, and neuer so smal, as they be many, and great in dede: if ye ioine not in charitie and vnitie with the Churche, ye are not annumbred with the Church, ye are not of the Church.

            <p>Gather then therevpon, if Luther him selfe be in any credite with you, that it sufficeth not to confesse the groundes of the Faith in general, as Heretiques do commomly, if there be contempte, or breache in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mater implyed in the general: and that to beleeue in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Goste, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the storie of Christes doinges in flesh, is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, excepte the faith be kepte orderly, and wholly without wicked breache made in any one point.</p>

not the blessed Sacrament of the Aulter, as the Caluinistes of our time: yet could you not say, that your onely beleefe in the Trinitie, and of Christes chiefe doinges, is a sauing beleefe. For infidelitie or vnbeleefe about any one pointe of those thinges that are to be beleeued,<note place="margin">Basil. lib. de Spiritu sancto.</note> is an vtter denial of the whole Godhead, saith S.

            <p>What vntruth you mainteine in many and great pointes of the Faith, I may let passe in silence, sith your selfe haue in publique audience professed it, by open writinges confirmed it, and doo stil defend it.

            <p>We may beleeue Christe, who is our Lorde and God, and we may beleeue in Christe. To beleeue Christe, is to beleeue that Christe is.

            <p>Christe is true God, equal with God the Father, and therefore as he is God, he is not a Priest no more then his Father is, nor, as God, euer made he any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. You teache in the <hi>.14.</hi>

Which wordes are cleane contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Faith, which the holy Scriptures do teache, and which hath bene beleued in the Churche euermore. And by the same you seme to haue an other Christe, then we haue. For our Christe in one person hath two natures: to wit, the Nature of God, and the Nature of Man. Touching the Godhead, or the nature of God, he is in no point at al, in any one iote, lesse then his Father. For the Godhead receiueth no degrees. Neither can any thing be said, deuised, or imagined, touching the
<pb facs="tcp:15584:6"/>

               </note> 
               <hi>Being in the forme of God, he thought it no robberie to be equal vvith God.</hi> Yet say you, Christe, <hi>touching his Godhead vvas the Priest and made the Sacrifice:</hi> Of which, these absurdities and most horrible blasphemies do folowe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that, whereas to do Sacrifice, is <hi>cultus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi> a seruice of worship, and a recognizing of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie in him to whom the Sacrifice is made: Christe, making Sacrifice to his Father, <hi>touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as you say, is inferiour to his Father, and doth seruice to his Father, touching his Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, seing that Priesthood is a dignitie, and an excellencie, such as in this worlde none is greater, or at the lest a Qualitie: if Christ be a Priest touching his Godhead, as you M. Iewel do say he is: vndoubtedly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God the Father also was a Prieste, and had the same Qualitie, or els God the Father wanted one dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or Qualitie, which God the Sonne had touching his Godhead. But God the Father neuer was Priest: Ergo, as before you made Christe inferiour to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching his Godhead, for makinge Sacrifice to his Father as beinge God: so nowe you make
<pb facs="tcp:15584:6"/>
Christe Superiour to his Father, for hauing an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, Dignitie, or Qualitie touching his Godhead, which God the Father had neuer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you make by this meanes twoo seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and distincte Godheades of God the Father, and God the Sonne. For if to be a Prieste belongeth to the Godhead of Christe, the same also belongeth to the Godhead of the Father. But Priesthood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth in no wise to God the Father: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Godhead of the Father, and the Godhead of the Sonne, are twoo manner of Godheades of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and distincte powers, not equal, and one, the one Godheade hauing Priesthoode, the other hauing not, or, whiche is al one, the one God beinge a Prieste, and the other being no Prieste: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wil folowe, there are twoo Goddes, not One one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God.</p>
            <p>O horrible blasphemie. After these longe Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and multiplying of Heresies, our Protestants are nowe come to be right Arians, and professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the most blessed Trinitie.</p>
            <p>If to auoide this most haynous and detestable Heresie, you wil say, that God the Father also touching his Godhead is a Prieste, then tel vs, what hath he to sacrifice? To whom shal he do that humble seruice and worship? Or is he a man also as Christe is,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:7"/>
and did he suffer death, as the olde Heretikes taught, called thereof, <hi>Patropassiani</hi>?<note place="margin">Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passiani.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is. Christ touching his Godhead is not a Priest, ne made not the Sacrifice touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (as very blasphemously you haue written): but only touching his manhood.</p>
            <p>Marke the point good Reader, as being of most weighty importance. Christe is both God, and Man. But what he doth touching the manhoode, that doth not the Father, nor the Holy Ghoste in the same sorte. Marie, what he doth touching his Godhead, that in al pointes God the Father, and God the holy Ghost, doth equally with him. Which is the cause that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs to beleeue, that not the Godhead, or whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie tooke fleshe, but only the second person in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Least if the Godhead had done it, or if it had bene done touching the Godhead, we should be constrained to say, the whole Trinitie was incarnate, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Faith. Now if Christe touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head coulde do that, which the Father and the Holy Ghoste should not do: the Godhead were diuided, and peaces, or partes were made thereof (it being immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, indiuisible, one, and most excellently perfect) so that touching that parte of the Godhead, whiche were in Christe, Sacrifice might be made, but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that, which were in the Father, and the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:15584:7"/>
Ghoste, sacrifice might not be made.</p>
            <p>Here we shal trie how this nowe broched Arian, wil purge him selfe. Here shal we see, whether this Heresie shal also be soothed, bolstered, and shoulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, as your other Heresies are, or no. Last of al here shal we see, whether you wil recant, and retract this abominable Heresie, as in your Sermon of the <hi>.15.</hi> of Iune last at Paules Crosse, you promised and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to doo, if you could be conuinced of any. Of this I say no more. But if this blasphemie may be mainteined in this newe English Churche, vndoubtedly this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Churche (ô pitiful case) wil proue a professour of Arianisme, yea I feare, at length of worse, if worse may be. Certainely our Christe neuer taught this doctrine, neither was euer any such thing attributed vnto Christe by Gods worde, nor by the Catholike Churche: wherefore you seme not to beleeue in our Christe.</p>

For when men were once One, and in one Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient felowship or Communion (as ye and we were in One Auncient Church, before Luther brake the knot) he diuideth Vnitie, which departeth from his felowes and former godly companie, to ioyne him selfe with a newe companie, not he who abydeth stil in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Auncient companie. Say therefore what ye wil, S. Augustine plainely prooueth, that ye are they, which haue broken the Vnitie. For this can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, which by him is spoken, as it were to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: <hi>Tollis te ab vnitate Orbis terrarum &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Wil ye haue it appeare euidently, howe ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide yourselues from the Vnitie of the worlde?

            <p>Thus it is cleare to the simplest wittes that are, forasmuche as ye condemne the vniuersal Churche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed ouer the whole worlde, departe from it, and ioyne your selues to Luther, Zuinglius and Caluine, that ye make breache of the Vnitie.

            <p>How be it this muche at the beginning I confesse, that, what is, and euer hath ben in the Churche agreed vpon, as a thing certaine and cleare, thereof reason is, we should not dispute, least by disputing, we make the thing doubteful, that is most certaine.

               <hi>To whom offering is made, by whom it is made, what is offered, and for whom any thing is offered</hi>: I wil shewe in what sorte these be in the Sacrifice of the Masse: 7 After this, by what waie this Sacrifice is auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: 8 for what causes, and persons it is auaileable: 9 what effectes it worketh: 10 Lastly, that the Prayers, and the Ceremonies of the Masse, be good and godly, and voide of al superstition. Of these pointes some I wil but briefly touche, of some I wil speake more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the mater requireth.</p>
            <p>Whereas then M. Iewel, and his felowes do so much abhorre and deteste the name of Sacrifice, specially of the Sacrifice of the Masse, as a thing iniurious to the Crosse of Christe, whiche neuerthelesse so much set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the merite and benefite of the Crosse, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more: I would faine they had once plainely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the worlde, that they them selues do rightly vnderstand, what a Sacrifice is.</p>

Let vs see, what the Scriptures teache vs. The blessed Apostle S.

For elles, if we speake of Sacrifice, as it betokeneth the action of sacrificing, for the worde is common to both: then we vnderstand a true Sacrifice, and such as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for our nature, to be made and offered, when we doo consecrate any gifte to our Lorde God, by which, some rite and ceremonie according to publique ordinance about the gifte obserued, we professe him to be supreme and chiefe of al, the beginning and ende of our health and saluation, so as by that we submit our selues, and al that is ours vnto his diuine Maiestie.

For either they were slaine, as the Beastes, or burnt, as the Incense, or sprinkled ouer with oile, as bread, meale, and the first fruites, and baked in an Ouen, or fryed in a panne, or rosted on a gredyern,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>A rite and ceremonie of changing we do obserue in our Sacrifice also now, the bread (beside breaking and eating) by vertue of the woordes of consecration, being changed into the body, and the wine, into the bloude of Christe. By which rite and ceremonie we confesse, that, for so much as we are by nature the children of wrath, we haue nede of a great chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, to be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, that we haue neede to put on the new man, that we protest al that is ours, to be ready for his sake to be changed to be consumed, to be spent and lost, right so as it shal be his pleasure. For <hi>who so euer doth lose his soule for my sake</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>he shal finde his soule.</hi>

            <p>Now let vs come vnto the fourth point, and declare that God hath both engraffed in the mindes of men the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15584:17"/>
rite of sacrificing, and also by Lawe commaunded it, and for what cause. This is soone done. The consideration of nature, and general view of the worlde, layeth the one before our eyes, and the bookes of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other.</p>
            <p>Natural reason telleth man, that he is vnder some Superiour, for the defectes, which he feeleth in him selfe. In whiche defectes he hath neede to be holpen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of some Superiour. And what so euer that is, it is that, as S. Thomas saith, whiche among al is called God. And as in natural thinges, naturally the inferiour thinges are vnder the superiour thinges, euen so natural reason telleth man according vnto natural inclination, that he exhibite to that whiche is aboue man, subiection and honour according to his manner. And the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner for man is, to vse sensible signes to expresse some thinges, bicause he taketh his knowledge of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thinges. And therefore it procedeth of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that man vse certaine sensible thinges, offering them to God in signe of due subiection and honour, in like sorte as they doo, who offer vnto their Lordes certaine thinges, in recognition of their Lordship or Dominion. This perteineth to the nature of Sacrifice, and therefore the offering of Sacrifice perteineth to the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Sacrifice hath euer ben gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to al peoples. <hi>Cyprian.

            <p>Wherefore there lyueth no Nation in the worlde altogether without Religion, as we may see, and heare, nor is Religion mainteined without Ceremonies. And among Ceremonies, the Nations of al ages haue vsed outward Oblation, as the chiefe. Although for the more parte (as S. Cyprian saith) they abhorred Circumcision,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:18"/>
as a thing cruel, and vnfrendly to nature, yet the other Sacrifices they did not likewise abhorre: but <hi>folowing, the lawe of Nature in many thinges</hi> (saith he) they reteined the custome of making Sacrifices. And this was fastened in their myndes by common consent in general, that God onely ought to be wourshipped with outward Sacrifice.

            <p>And hereof Reader thou maist conceiue, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is to be made vnto them, that moue this question, which to some, though without iust cause, semeth to be of great difficultie: whether the Sacrifices of the olde Testament, the Sacrifice that our Lorde offered at his Supper, the Sacrifice of the Crosse, and that Sacrifice, which is daily made in the Churche, whether al these
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15584:29"/>
haue a like and the selfe same consideration and being of a Sacrifice (to vtter it more plainely in Latine to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in whiche tongue this mater would more aptly be treated) <hi>an vniuocè Sacrificia dicantur.</hi> For although al these doo commonly agree in this, that they professe a supreme excellencie of the Diuine Maiestie, in deede it selfe, and sensibly: yet bicause, it perteineth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and nature of a Sacrifice, that after some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it be satisfactorie, as with whiche satisfaction may in some sorte be made to our Lorde God, partly for sinnes, and for paines due to sinnes, partly for benefites, whiche we haue receiued, or be desirous to receiue: onely the Sacrifice of the Crosse hath the most perfite, and most propre nature, of a Sacrifice, as being that, by which only al the price of Satisfaction is purchased and paid, and out of whiche al Sacrifices, as also al Sacramentes, as out of their first founteine doo draw, and take their whole force and vertue, and by whiche also onely, it hath ben shewed most fully, as muche as can be done, how great is the excellencie of the Diuine Maiestie, and how great thinges it is conuenient that we doo for the same.</p>
            <p>But the Sacrifice of the Aulter, and the Sacrifice of our Lordes Supper, forasmuche as they offer vp the same thing, reteine the propre, true, and after their sort perfit, though very different consideration and nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, bicause the hoste is the same that was offred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse. But the Sacrifices of the lawe, be Sacrifices after a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and vnperfite respect: partly bicause there was litle in them, that was worthy of the Diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, partly bicause, as S.

This much we finde taught by S. Augustine, <hi>Epist.</hi> 59. By S. Chrysostom also,<note place="margin">

            <p>But whereas a thing, that is good and profitable, is said to profite others by moe waies then one, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, either <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as the Shcolastical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours speake,<note place="margin">After what way is this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable.</note> (asmuche to say, of the force, power, and strength of the thing or worke it selfe, which is done or wrought, without respect had vnto the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or merite of the partie that doth or worketh, as the Sacramentes are said to worke <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and to doo that thing, for whiche they be adhibited vnto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son accordingly disposed, by force and vertue of the worke that is wrought, euen as a man that putteth fier

            <p>To this question hauing consulted the writinges of learned and graue men, thus I answere: that bicause in the Masse many thinges doo concurre and meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is auaileable by al meanes and waies, by whiche a good worke may be auaileable: but yet that for the diuersitie of causes, and persons, for whiche the Sacrifice is offered, it hath diuers working. And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, albeit of it selfe, or <hi>(ex opere operato)</hi> by vertue of the thing offered and sacrificed, it be auaileable: yet not altogether after the same manner,<note place="margin">Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For as touching the Sacramentes, they be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes that God vseth in them to whom they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and if they be disposed as they ought to be, and through faith and charitie be capable, they worke health and saluation, and conferre grace. But the Sacrifice of the Masse (as the nature of a Sacrifice requireth)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15584:32"/>
doth worke after a manner, whiche, though it be of more efficacie, yet is like vnto prayer. Of more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, I say, forasmuche as it is made in the person of Christe, a most acceptable, and most sufficient gifte being geuen and offered vp, for whose sake God being appeased and pleased, is moued to heare them, that so to him doo sue and pray. Neither is it to be doubted, but that thinstitution of Christe is muche auaileable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the power, which this sacrifice hath to obteine thinges behooful for mans health. For he woulde neuer haue deliuered him selfe vnto vs, to thintent we should offer him with our owne handes vnto his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father: except he had forseene and willed, that great commoditie should redounde too men by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>In consideration whereof,<note place="margin">Sacrifice compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder the name of prayer.</note> bicause it worketh an effecte like vnto prayer, the Scripture vnder the name of prayer, oftentimes comprehendeth both Sacrifice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and also this Sacrifice specially succeding in place of al the olde Sacrifices, as though Sacrifice it selfe also were a certaine prayer, but a singular prayer. So the writer of the storie of the Machabees hauing made a rehersal of the Sacrifice of Iudas, that he commaunded to be offred for them that were dead, bringeth in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sentence,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> 12.</note> saying, <hi>It is therefore a holy and a holesom thought, to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from their sinnes,</hi> signifying sacrifice to be conteined vnder prayer, as the Special is conteined vnder the General.</p>
            <p>And S. Paule expounding the definition of Christe as he is a Priest whose duetie is to offer vp giftes, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note>

For the Temple was not appointed vnto prayer special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and properly, but vnto Oblation and Sacrifice. For prayer might be made in euery place, but Sacrifice could be made no where but in the Temple. In deede prayer was euermore added vnto the Sacrifices, wherwith they asked that of God, for which they offered. Yet say we not that sacrifice is prayer, as the name of prayer is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly, but that oftentimes it is vnderstanded by the name of prayer, bicause in this it is like vnto it, for that it offereth a gifte vnto God, to thintent to receiue some thing of him, wherein it appeareth to be a prayer, not in worde, but in deede. And bicause it geueth to receiue, it hath also the nature of a certaine satisfaction,

Whiche oblation it selfe for the worthines, and reuerence of Christe, as a Prayer of greatest efficacie, and moste worthy to be heard, the Father beholdeth, and in regard of it, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that, for whiche the body and bloude of his Sonne are so offred, according to the order of his Diuine dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and as it shal seme conuenient to him selfe, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as al iudgement is geuen vnto him.<note place="margin">

            <p>By the same consideration it hath very great force and strength to satisfie for temporal paines that be due vnto sinnes,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth for paines</note> whiche paines oftetimes in Scripture be called by the name of sinnes.

If paines were loosed by the sacrifices of the olde Lawe, shal they not muche more be loosed by the Sacrifice of the newe Lawe? For els, what shal we say, that the bloude of Christe is of lesse price in the sight of God, then the bloude of a calfe? Although Sacrifices haue their valour by way of Prayer, yet when they bring a present that is worthy of Gods fauour to remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of paines, and of his giftes, they leane to a certaine right and equitie, as the Price being exhibited, and so

               </note> as he is, that commeth to offer.</p>
            <p>Whereas then the wel disposed people doth offer vp that same very Sacrifice by deuoute affection, whiche the Priest offereth by outward Ministerie: the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Minister bereueth not any deuoute person of the benefite of the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Neither is this so to be taken, as though in this case nothing were to be looked for aboue the merite of our deuotion, for then to what purpose were the Sacrifice?
<pb facs="tcp:15584:35"/>
But what so euer benefite redoundeth of the vertue of the Sacrifice, ouer and aboue the merite of deuotion: the same is so muche the more abundantly of euery one enioyed, with how muche more deuotion towardes Christe and his Death he offereth.</p>
            <p>This deuoute disposition of the offerers our Lorde prescribed, when consecrating and making his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Priestes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> he said, <hi>Doo ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> In whiche commaundement,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> whereas there be two thinges conteined, dooing, and remembring, or comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration: this muche our Lorde therein signified,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice profiteth in diuers degrees.</note> that with how muche the more grateful and deuoute memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie they did it, so muche the more by this Sacrifice they should obteine: and againe how muche the nearer any man came vnto that dooing, and action of offering, the more benefite thereof he should receiue. For though al they that be iuste may be said to offer this Sacrifice by a certaine generalitie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>August.

            <p>Wherefore as a prayer profiteth them that pray them selues more, then an other, for whom it is made: so this Sacrifice profiteth more them, that offer it them selues, then it doth them, for whom only it is offered.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15584:35"/>
clearely by the effectes, whiche we looke for to enioye, by the Sacrifice of the Masse through the vertue of Christes passion, if we reherse them particularly.</p>
            <p>The first effecte by consent of al men is the remission <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of Venial sinnes,<note place="margin">The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse.</note> which the very iuste doo daily commit, and also of temporal paines, vnto whiche they remaine thral and bounde, though damnation euerlasting be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen.</p>
            <p>An other effecte is, the increase of righteousnes, and the continuance in good life. These are expressely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Institution of this Sacrifice by the Institutor him selfe, who first offered it. <hi>This is my bloude</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the new Testament,</hi>

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note>
               <hi>for many is shed in remission of sinnes.</hi> That the Apostles vnderstood the very same also in the Consecration of the Body, the Masse of S. Iames doth shewe. Where after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of those wordes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Liturgia Iacobi.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>this is my body which for you is geuen, and broken</hi>: the Deacon forthwith addeth, <hi>in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem peccatorum, in remission of sinnes.</hi> By whiche wordes, for so muche as with them Christ to this effecte offered him selfe, (albe it peraduenture they might be more generally vnderstanded) that at least may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which now we haue said of the remission of Venial sinnes, and temporal paines, vnto whiche the Apostles them selues were thral.</p>
            <p>Touching the other, there is a manifest place in S. Iohn. Christe speaking of the Apostles, and of them that should through their preaching beleue in him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohan.</hi> 17.</note> saith: <hi>For them I sanctifie my selfe, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</hi> Whiche saying is truly vnderstanded of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of holynesse, and of continuance, in asmuche as
<pb facs="tcp:15584:36"/>
the Apostles were now cleansed, and sanctified.</p>
            <p>And vnto these effectes the Sacrifice of the Masse is auaileable for al the faithful that pertaine to the body of Christe, that is to say, for the iuste, not only by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and merite of men that offer it, but by the vertue of the Sacrifice it selfe: neither onely by meane of a certaine common Prayer, whiche standeth vpon libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but of suche prayer, as satisfieth the requestes of Gods iustice with presenting vnto him the price paid for sinnes, and with a gifte geuen worthy to obteine that is asked, whiche is the proper nature of a Sacrifice, which is to be satisfactorie, and to be offered by way of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And therefore S. Paule specially considering the worthines of this true Sacrifice, said in general, that <hi>euery Bishop or Priest is ordeined to offer giftes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this it is learnedly by the Diuines gathered, that, for so muche as Infidels, and suche wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as be not yet reconciled vnto the Churche, or vnto God, nor so disposed, that for them satisfaction may effectually be made: Sacrifice for them is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly offered. For whether they them selues, or others for them doo offer, God doth not accepte giftes for the wicked, to this ende for whiche properly they be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it appeared in Cain.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</note> This is witnessed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in sundry other places.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Therefore S. Augustine saith writing to Renatus, <hi>Quis offerat Corpus Christi,</hi>

                  <hi>August, de origine animae. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>nisi pro eis, qui membra sunt Christi</hi>? Who may offer the body of Christe, but for them, whiche are the members of Christe? The late holy general Councel of Trent approuing this sentence

of S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Masses common not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and wherfore <hi>Concil. Trident.

            </p>
            <p>When therefore <hi>Petrus à Soto</hi> that learned man was demaunded in that Councel, whether Chaunte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might be erected, and Masses appointed to be said for Infidels: he answered, that it was vnlawful, bicause to ordeine Masse for any, is to ordeine, that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them be offered, and that to them thereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be applied, whiche ought not to be done, bicause satisfaction requireth before a remission of the deadly faulte. Yet wel may it be, (said he) that Prayer in the Masse for their Conuersion be made.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour him selfe semeth to haue insinuated this propertie of the Oblation, when offering vp his body and bloude at the Supper after the fourme and rite of Melchisedek, not without cause he said, of the one,<note place="margin">

            <p>Yet as it is here before said, and as it is cleare by <hi>S.</hi> Paul,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> in a certaine general and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon respecte we offer for al, forasmuche as we present the body and bloude of Christe vnto the Father in his person, and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and beseche his goodnes, that in regarde of his body and bloude he wil haue mercie vppon them. But we doo not presente these giftes for al, as a Price that is exhibited for them (whiche thing the propre nature of this oblation comprehendeth in respecte of release of the paines) bicause al be not capable, that is to say, not apte vessels to receiue suche benefite.</p>
            <p>As touching other thinges, whiche profitably be asked in the Masse,<note place="margin">Benifites redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs by the Masse.</note> as victorie, peace, health, ceasonable wether, and such other the like, wherewith mannes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie is releeued and holpen, the Sacrifice of the Masse is auaileable for them, according to the order of Gods eternal disposition, not onely by reason of the merite of the Priest, and of the Churche that offereth: but also, and that more amply, by reason of the qualitie, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrifice, whiche is consecrated in the person of Christe, and by his commission.</p>
            <p>But this is by way of Prayer: whiche Prayer, bicause it

is not sitting the wordes of Christe to be frustrate, by whiche he committed this Sacrifice vnto vs: the Father very oftentimes heareth. And whereas he heareth it not, the iudgementes of God be secrete. For great is the vertue of the signes, and Sacramentes of the name of Iesus Christe, vnto whose honour the very powers of the Aier are commaunded to yelde and geue place, though it be called vppon by euil, and for euil persons, as S.

it may please thee to returne backe vnto the Answere, and vewing the place diligently, to consider, whether thou finde, as he reporteth. If this be done, I doubte not but the chiefe aduantage he seemeth to take against me, shal in thy iudgement appeare to stand altogether vpon manifest vntruthes.</p>
            <p>Yea if thou wilt not be deceiued by M. Iewel,<note place="margin">How M. levvels vvritings are to be read.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not at the firste, what in proufe, or disproufe of any thing, he reporteth, as out of others. Examine the places from whence he bringeth his testimonies. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not his shewes, beleeue thine owne eyes. Compare the authours texte,<note place="margin">The sleightes he vseth in vvriting against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</note> and his reportes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And doubtelesse wheresoeuer he allegeth ought that disagreeth with the doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche, thou maist be assured by diligent searche to finde, that he hath corrupted and falsified the Doctor, either by taking away, or by adding vnto, by exchange of wordes, or by peruerting the order of the sentence, by conceeling the Circumstance of the place, or by applying it to a sense contrary to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meaning, briefly by one false meane or other, as al merchantes of such false wares, lacke not craftes and sleightes to helpe their vtterance.</p>
            <p>And as his sleightes of corrupting the Doctours be sundry and many,<note place="margin">The sleightes he vseth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvering to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</note> so be the meanes also many, and of no lesse crafte, whiche he vseth in answering to certaine their most plaine testimonies, with which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he is pressed. Some Doctours with him be vtterly refused, some be of doubteful authoritie, some be disliked for their age, some be auoided by a crafty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, some that speake plainely, be tolde, they
<pb facs="tcp:15584:44"/>
speake violently. Whiche is a very poore shifte, and seemeth to haue least weight of Learning, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>When al other sleightes be spent, yet this serueth him for the last refuge. He draweth this mater of the Sacrifice, to Phrases of speache, Tropes, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phores, and alleging some Tropical speache, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth a reasonable vnderstanding somewhat diuers from the literal sownde of the naked woordes, he requireth the place that maketh for the truth of the Sacrifice, to be in like sorte vnderstanded. This is a way whereby one may seme to say somewhat, when in deede he saith nothing. By suche meane the truthe in any controuersie is darkened, it is not discussed, and in the iudgement of the vnlearned, confusion is wrought.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">M. Iewels common Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note>What shal I speake of the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Certainely they be suche, as very Boyes that learne their Sophistrie, may be a shamed to make. In manner he neuer maketh Argument against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but wherein with one truth he excludeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, whiche kinde of reason, of al other is the most childish and fondest. As for example, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Fathers sometimes cal the Euchariste an Image, a Figure, a memorie, a sampler of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that was made vpon the Crosse, thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies he concludeth, that it is not a true Sacrifice. As thoughe one might not by suche Logique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Sacrifices of the olde Lawe were not truely, and properly Sacrifices, bicause they were al a Figure of that great Sacrifice, whiche Christe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15584:44"/>
when he died. Both Sacrifices are a signe of that one and the selfe same hoste, that of the Lawe, was a signe of the hoste to come, ours of that is paste. Yet either is a true Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Likewise of the affirmation of the Sacrifice of Praise, and Thankesgeuing, he induceth the denial of the true and real Sacrifice of Christes Body and Bloude in the Euchariste, as thoughe it were not bothe. But what neede I here Reader, to tel thee of M. Iewels manyfold shiftes and sleightes,<note place="margin">See the Preface before my first Reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</note> sith I haue spoken thereof otherwheres, and other men haue detected them at large? And in deede what elles is conteined in our bookes, but a discouering of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gierdemaine? For how could the truthe haue bene set forth, excepte his lies had ben discried, and his falshoode confuted?</p>
            <p>As for the Vntruthes, that be in his Replie to this parte of my Answere, I haue not curiously no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the number of them, for so muche as that hath bene once doone by D. Sander, and me in parte, and by M. Stapleton more copiously. whereas the number of his Vntruthes founde in foure Articles onely of six and twenty, amount to a Thousand and odde, and the same are not yet discharged of M. Iewels parte: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to bestow muche time about such a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some worke. It is more meete for Pinners, Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Nailesellers, to spende their tyme about telling, and making such accomptes.</p>
            <p>And though I had liked to haue kepte tale of them, yet the Margent of my booke would not haue sufficed to conteine them, the number is so great. Yet
<pb facs="tcp:15584:45"/>
that his lyes, falsifyinges, corruptions, and vntruthes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be of smal number, and that the shame, whiche would growe in respecte of the multitude, if al were seuerally tolde, be not to the hinderance of his estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion discoouered: I am content, his whole Replie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this article, be taken (as it is in deede fewe thinges excepted, wherein gladly I agree with him) but for one Vntruth.</p>
            <p>Touching this Reioindre, I haue here defended and confirmed my Answere to his 17. Article, whiche is of the Sacrifice, and al that he hath replied against it, I haue fully refelled. God geue thee iudgement good Reader, to discerne truth from vntruth. If perhaps I shal seme in some places ouer obscure, and tedious, and not to haue framed my writing meete for al mennes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities: thou maist thinke, that either learning failed, or that the mater would not suffer, verely good wil wanted not. To make harde thinges easy to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, and to geue light to thinges, that of them selfe be darke, and not to swarue from the exact rule of truth, it is a point of great witte and cunning: neither is it lightly perfourmed, but of suche as God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with special giftes. And as excellencie of witte is required to vtter them plainely: so it behoueth the Readers senses be wel exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cised, to vnderstand them fully.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of this Sacrifice in some parte is harde, and obscure, such, as commonly hath rather ben right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued, then by many clearely declared. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of holy Mysteries is better saued with reuerent si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then with bolde opening. Experience teacheth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15584:45"/>
into what danger of contempte they come, when they are openly reueled to populare vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>Although bothe in the Scriptures, and in the Fathers, we haue most sufficient proufes, and testimonies for the real presence, and for the real Sacrifice: yet they, that liued within the first six hundred yeres after Christe, wrote hereof more secretly, then of other pointes of our Religion.<note place="margin">The cause vvhy the olde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly of these my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steries.</note> For reuerence of the Mysterie, they thought it more conuenient, to teache it by mowthe, and by tradition, then by euident, and open declararion to commit muche to publique writing, least so to the Infidels, occasion should be ministred of despite and villanie. As for example, notwithstanding that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious warenesse, we read in S. Augustine, how the Painimes charged the Christians with the wourship of Ceres,<note place="margin">

            <p>By this it appeareth, what secretnesse and silence was vsed in the Primitiue Churche touching these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and how feareful the holy Fathers were to say, write, or doo any thing, whereby the Miscreantes might come by knowledge of them. For which cause it is not to be marueled, if they spake not so plainely, and so euidently of euery point touching the Sacrifice, as the sawcinesse of heretikes requireth in these daies to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and satisfied withal. Yet they may seme to haue spoken plainly ynough to right beleuers, and for the same we haue no smal number of good and cleare testimonies, as by this Reioindre it shal appeare to them, that be not wilfully bent, either to shutte their eyes, bicause they would not see, or to wrangle contentiously, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But after that the Faith was once generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of al where it was preached and professed, and no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15584:46"/>
Infidels remained among the Christians, that durst open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worke despite against the holy Mysteries, whiche in sundry Prouinces came to passe before the first six hundredth yere was determined, and thenceforth: the learned Fathers that in those times wrote, as occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, spake of the real Presence of the body an bloud of Christe in the blessed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and of the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same, no lesse plainly, and clearely, then the Churche now teacheth. Whiche thing they finde to be true, that be conuersant in the workes of Cassiodorus, S. Gregorie the Romaine, Isidorus, Gregorius Turonensis, Beda, Haimo, Rabanus, and other about that age.</p>
            <p>If then for this Sacrifice we haue (as in this Reioindre thou shalt finde) the Scriptures, the testimonies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the first six hundred yeres of sufficient cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the most manifest testimonies of the writers that immediatly folowed that age, besides the authoritie of Councels, that were within, and soone after that age, and so continually vntil the late Councel of Trent: the fauourers of M. Iewels side may see, his Chalenge fully answered, touching this Article. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to consider, how safe it is for them to contemne so great authoritie, and to be persuaded with suche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ô light, and miserable soules, that sithens with the winde of that lewd Friers doctrine haue ben carried away.

               <p>S. Paule declareth in the Epistle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> that Christ was but once onely offered, and that he offereth not him selfe oftentimes.<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> Ergo, to what purpose is it, that Christe is thus daily offred vp vnto God in the Masse?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Solution.</head>
               <p>This Argument is soone solued, if a man consider the scope, marke, and purpose, wherevnto S. Paule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth him selfe in that Epistle. This muche therefore is to be weighed. There were many of the Hebrewes, that although through the preaching, and miracles of the Apostles, were persuaded to beleue in Christe, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in great estimation, and zeale of the Law, stickte vnto their olde customes, and ordinances of Moyses, and specially vnto their Sacrifices, whiche they were desirous to retaine for their sinnes. And therefore they founde them selues agreeued with the Apostle, for that, whereas he tooke away their olde Sacrifices, they thought them selues to be destitute of the benefites of the Lawe, and remedies for sinne.</p>
               <p>Herevnto the Apostle maketh answere, and in effect teacheth: That of such Sacrifices as the Lawe ordeined, now we haue no neede, for so much as the Priesthood of Christ, who hath once offred him selfe with sheadding of
<pb facs="tcp:15584:52"/>
his bloude vpon the Aulter of the Crosse hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fulfilled them, remaineth and continueth stil with vs, whiche is sufficient. <hi>We haue</hi> (saith he to them) <hi>an Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof it is not lawful for them to eate, whiche doo serue the Tabernacle.</hi>

                  </gap> killed, and the bloude of Calues to be shed of vs, the cause is, for that the onely blouddy hoste of Christe hath sufficed, that now we haue neede of no other, but of that. That hoste is the founteine, and endlesse trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whiche conteineth the sufficient price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. onely it is neede, that wee be made partakers of it. Neither were those Sacrifices of Moyses lawe suche, that by vertue and power of them being but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes and figures of Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> synnes were remitted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: but by them synnes were brought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and signification was geuen out, that there was neede of an other blouddy Sacrifice, by whose vertue men in conscience should be made perfite.</p>
               <p>And so the Apostle treateth of the thing it selfe, that was shadowed in al the Sacrifices of the Law, and is so acceptable vnto the Father, that by his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre vertue and merite it sanctifieth men, and remitteth sinnes, whereunto by the ordinance of Gods iustice the Bloude of the Sonne of God was Requisite. Suche is the Hoste or Sacrifice of the Crosse onely, by whose vertue and merite they be sanctified, whosoeuer from the beginning either by the Sacrifices of the former times, or by the daily Sacrifice of the Churche, are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.

For suche a Sacrifice, whiche by his owne proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite geteth sufficient price for sinnes, ought to be great in deede (soothly by the Death of the Sonne of God) but one onely sufficeth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> Wherefore of a blouddy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice there is no more neede, but of suche a one, as by which we may be made partakers of that great and most worthy Sacrifice. Of whiche sorte the Sacrifice of the Masse is, where, in the person of Christe, that Death is presented for vs vnto the Father.</p>
               <p>And what Hoste, or thing mystically offered, could either better set Christes Death before his Fathers sight, or more effectually deriue the merites of his Death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then that very body, wherein he suffered? For which cause, when he deliuered the Sacrament of his Possion vnto vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lucae</hi> 22.</note> he said, <hi>Doo ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> So that this Sacrifice of the Masse, although it be in his kinde a true Sacrifice, as it shalbe proued here after in this Reioindre: yet it taketh his whole vertue, and power, of the Sacrifice of the Crosse, which is of it selfe the whole price of our Redemption. Now <hi>S.</hi> Paul disputeth with the Hebrewes of that whiche with bloudshed redemed vs, and not of that whiche without bloudshed applieh the Redemption vnto vs. That was but once offered, this is, and must be ofte repeated.</p>

made gouernours of the Church by the holy Ghost, may we not boldly say, they haue ben taught the truth by the holy Ghost, wherewith they might instruct the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Either the Fathers vvere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, or the holy Ghost dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him selfe, by M.

That either al the olde learned Fathers were deceiued, and taught false doctrine, or that the holy Ghost, who ruled the penne of them that endited the Scriptures, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from himselfe speaking in their Successours the learned Fathers. For that the Fathers either of their own heads, or of priuat inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without al warrant of Gods worde instituted this Sacrifice: neither M. Iewel saith it, nor is it so much as to be suspected. The second, that is, that any dissension or contrarietie be ascribed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoste, is hainous blasphemie. The first, that al the learned Fathers should be deceiued, and also deceiue the Churche, is not to be graunted. For in asmuch as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the spirite of truth which Christe promised to the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14.</note> and were gouerned by the spirite of God, and by the same were lead into al truth: it ought not to be thought of them in general, that they haue inclined vnto falshod, specially in so weighty a mater.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it standeth M. Iewel vpon, either to deny, that the olde learned Fathers haue by their ofte mention of Priestes, Aultars, and Sacrifice, acknowleged the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler Sacrifice of the Churche, or recant what he said of the Scriptures, that by any clause, or sentence of them it cannot appeare, where God appointed any such Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be made at al.</p>
               <p>If he wil say, as he semeth to say: The Fathers confesse not, ne acknowledge not in dede the Sacrifice it selfe, but yet ofte tymes they vse the woorde of Sacrifice,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15584:60"/>
that is to say, they speake of it, as also of the Priestes, and Aulters: to that may be answered, that by their woordes we vnderstande their meaning. Forasmuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it with words, and that very oft, how can we iudge otherwise of them, but that they beleued it also in harte? What, maketh he the auncient holy Fathers, Gods dere frendes, placed in authoritie by the holy Ghost to gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Church of God, to be double men, such as say one thing, and thinke an other? Why taught they so, but that the Churche should beleue so? If they would al men to beleue it, shal we say, they beleued it not them selues?</p>

signified were quite abolished, whereas wordes and termes serue to thende the hearers and readers by them be taught, and the Fathers in al their writings intended to teache Christe and his Lawe: what could the Iewes or Gentils learne touching the faith of Christe, hearing and reading these termes, not signifying to them the thinges which they did before their conuersion? The more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their eares wer with them before, the more by hearing the same nowe were they put in minde of that they once signified. And so were they by the Fathers inuited either to returne againe to their olde Iewishnes and Paganisme, or at least to conceiue of their manner of speache, they knewe not what, those termes signifying nothing properly, that is extant, or put in practise.</p>
               <p>This being supposed, whiche M.

I say properly, For if any will replye, saying, that euery Christian man and woman is a Priest, and that contrition of harte, thankes geuing, praises, and such other the like be sacrifices, and our hartes be Aulters to offer these sacrifices vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may be answered, that these termes applied to such thinges, be not taken in their first and proper signification, but in a second and improper, or rather metaphorical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15584:64"/>
or as M. Iewel commonly for spite translateth, <hi>Sacrificers.</hi> Whereby it foloweth clearely, that the terme Priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to al men and wemen, who be not by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne sacrament ordered, not specially called and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to the office of a Bishop, or Priest, is taken in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or mystical signification. In that S. Augustin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegeth the order of those to remaine nowe in the Churche, which be called <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> Priestes, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: he excludeth al metophorical, metonymical, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical signification of the woorde. So then folowing the doctrine of S. Augustine, a very sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the saith of Christes Church, of, and before his tyme, we may boldly say: that in the Churche we haue Priestes, and Priesthood, speaking properly, that is to say, a real Priesthoode, and therefore a real Sacrifice, which M. Iewel denieth.</p>
               <p>This then being proued, that in the state of the newe Testamente there be Priestes in the proper signification of the terme beside that mystical signification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by al Christians be termed Priestes: this also is clearely prooued withal, that the other two termes, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Aulter,</hi> properlye taken, muste remaine in the Churche of Christe, and not be construed, where so euer the Fathers make mention of them, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical or mystical vnderstanding, as though there were neither real Sacrifice, nor material Aulter. For a Priest properly taken, requireth a Sacrifice properly taken, whiche he may offer: and an Aulter properly taken, wherevppon he maye make his Sacrifice. Like as a Prieste metaphorically taken, requireth onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Aulter of like signification.</p>

Peter forementioned by S. Augustine, wherein al faithful bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue the name and title of Priestes ascribed vnto them: in the same sentence shalt thou finde them called Kinges, no lesse then Priestes. But how are they called Kinges? By a proper kinde of speache? Not so, but by a similitude, or Metaphore. And by the same kinde of speache euery Christian persons owne body and soule, may be called his kingdom appointed him of God king of kinges to gouerne. The iurisdiction and dominion of infinite such kinges, we conceiue to be bordered and inclosed within the narrow limites of eche one person, and the subiectes to be fewer then may make a perfite number. Shal we hereof inferre, that there is nothing els in the worlde, that these termes <hi>kinge</hi> and <hi>kingdom,</hi> may and do properly signifie? Shal we hereupon dissolue Monarchies, and plainely tell such whom the worlde calleth kinges, that they haue but the Metaphoricall name of kinges, and be no kinges in deede, bereuing them of all auctoritie to rule their Subiectes, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to be content, as other meaner persons are, with their Metaphorical kingdom?</p>
               <p>In dede this were the rediest way to bring al to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and beastly enormitie, in whiche state this new Gospel might sone be set vp, or any other religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the holy Ghost hath pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the Church hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. And this is that state, that Luthers holy sprite would haue brought Germany vnto, and had preuailed, had not the Nobilitie resisted with al their force, the rash and wiked stourdinesse of the vulgare people. We might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15584:65"/>
say, and easy it were to proue, that the like confusion must ensue in the Church, if this opinion be once plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rooted in the hartes of the Laitie, that ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as truly, and as properly a Priest, as is his Curate, his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, his Person, or his Bishop. But bicause this perteineth not chiefly to the present purpose, I wil not stand about it. This which is now made euident by that is already saied, may boldly be auouched: That, as there be special kings bearing rule not only ouer them selues, yea though perhaps not ouer them selues sometimes (which may be said for some parte of them) but at the least ouer their Subiectes: notwithstandinge that al the faithful people through Christ, whose members thei are, be made by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme kinges ouer their own soules and bodies: So there be special Priestes in the newe Testament, called and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to that function, albeit al Christians be spiritual Priestes, as being the membres of the highest Priest Iesus Christe.</p>
               <p>Here I thinke good to fore warne the Reader, that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am constrained by the Replie to make a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwen these two termes <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi>

                  </note> by which the persons of the highest order in the Church be called, and in our English tongue there want two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct termes correspondent to them, the name of Priest seruing to both, as the common vse hath receiued: I wil for a fewe leaues, that my talke may be more distincte, and better perceiued, vse the terme Sacrificer, for the Latine worde <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> and the terme Priest, for the worde, <hi>Presbyter.</hi> When therfore I shal name a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> that is to be vnderstanded, which this worde, <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> signifieth, and likewise <hi>Priest</hi> shal be that, which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:15584:66"/>

Iewel is, in that he bindeth other men to Doctours, and Councels of the first six hundred yeres after Christe only, and here vseth him selfe the auctoritie of so late a writer, as Pachymeres is. And therefore sith that he hath first broken his owne Lawe, and the bonde of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: we thinke it right he beare with vs, if sometime we allege Doctours, and Councels, though some deale beneath the first sixe hundred yeres, yet auncienter, and of farre better auctoritie, then Pachymeres a writer of Notes vpon S. Dionyse hath euer ben accompted of.</p>
               <p>Next how proueth Pachymeres the purpose, for which he is brought in? Be it graunted, that S. Dionyse wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Sopater being a <hi>Priest,</hi> calleth him a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> and that custome hath now obteined, a <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Elder,</hi> to be named a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> as Pachymeres saith. what can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of al this? Wil it folow hereof, that Sopater was no true <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> but onely a figuratiue <hi>Sacrificer</hi>? And that the name of a Priest, doth more aptlye expresse the office of the stewardes of Gods Mysteries in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, then doth the terme <hi>Sacrificer</hi>? Nothing lesse. This is it only that wil folow, that the dispensatours of those spiritual treasures were called by both the names of a <hi>Priest,</hi> and of a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> euen from the beginning of the Churche, a shorte time only excepted, vntil the Iewish Synagogue was buried, and almost forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15584:67"/>
time, the Ecclesiastical writers were accustomed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto the chiefe ministers of Gods mysteries as oft (or oftener) the title of <hi>Sacrificers,</hi> as of <hi>Priests,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> as it may be tried by vewe of the workes written by S.

So that the custome, which Pachymeres speaketh of, to cal a <hi>Priest</hi> a <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> is now toward the ende of the worlde, when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shal come, by the worst sort of men his foreron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, interrupted and broken.</p>

knowledge, and in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the learned Fathers of that time the Apostles scholers, don true Sacrifice in dede by offering vp the body and bloud of Christe vnto God, he wold not haue called Sopater the <hi>Priest</hi> a <hi>Sacrificer.</hi> But bicause they had the same faith concerning this Sacrifice, that the Churche euer sithens had, and we nowe haue: he doubted not to cal a <hi>Priest</hi> a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> as now he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly called. Neither vsed he that terme only in his Epistle to Sopater, but also in his Ecclesiastical Hierarchie, where he declared the maner how the Sacrifice was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. <hi>And the custome hath now so preuailed,</hi> saith Pachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meres. Which custome should neuer so haue preuailed in the vniuersal Churche of Christe, had not the terme in so weighty a mater bene agreable vnto the truth. Thus S. Dionyse, whom M. Iewel allegeth for him selfe, maketh clearely against M. Iewel.</p>
               <p>Vnto Pachymeres M. Iewel adioineth S. Paule, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, S. Chrysostome, to proue that preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called a Sacrifice, being none in dede, and also S. Gregorie Nazianzene, calling the people, his Sacrifice. These authorities might as wel haue ben brought in to proue, that Christe offered no true and real Sacrifice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse, as that there is no external Sacrifice in the Churche, but only a reported Sacrifice by a metaphore. For if any man allege to the contrarie, the testimonies of the Scripture and Doctors, wher they cal Christes death a Sacrifice, folowing M. Iewel one may easily answere, that both the Scripture and Doctours vsed the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, alluding for their delite vnto the Sacrifices of the old Law. For behold, saith he, this is not stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. S. Paul, S. Chrysostome, and Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe cal preaching a Sacrifice,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15584:68"/>
whereas in dede preaching is no Sacrifice. And so by a phrase of speache the Sacrifice of Christes death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our faith and hope, as the ground of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, were like to be remoued and displaced.</p>
               <p>What a fond kind of arguing is this?<note place="margin">The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of M.

And therefore it is a kinde of Argument at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto the Rhetorician, to explicate and make plaine a mater, and not to the Logician, strongly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and piththily to proue a veritie. Yet M. Iewel
<pb facs="tcp:15584:69"/>
notwithstanding is so in loue with this kinde of prouing in his whole booke of Replie, that if his comparisons of one phrase with an other were cut of, which he woulde haue seme to be like: the rest of his booke should appeare of smal quantitie.</p>
               <p>How be it, though it be the slipperest way in reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet if M.

But most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly he maketh his comparisons betwixt those phrases, that haue litle, or none affinitie at al, either for that the one is spoken by a Metaphore, and the other properly: or the one of one mater, and the other of an other: or the one in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, the other in an other.

As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In our present case, bicause S. Paule, and certaine Doctours by a Figure do take Preaching for a Sacrifice, which is a truth denyed by no man, for it is in deede a kinde of spiritual Sacrifice: therefore he woulde haue it seme, that the same Doctours neuer speake of any real Sacrifice of Christes body and bloude, whereas it is most manifest (as it shal hereafter be proued) that they speake of both kindes of these Sacrifices, and both may wel stand together.</p>

               <p>Now then that after your Preface you come to my woordes M. Iewell, what haue you to replye against them, that to any learned man may seeme to be to the purpose? I said, Christe is offered after three manners, figuratiuely, truely with bloudshedding, and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, or in Mysterie. With which parte of this threefold Diuision finde you fault? As for the two first partes, they be clearely proued by the Scriptures. The third is that ye call in question, and whiche you impugne. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you had nothing to say against the two first, least your mater should seeme to haue a foile, if you yelded to any thing that were by me saied, were it neuer so true: you goe from the purpose, and enter into other talke.<note place="margin">M. Ievvel diuerteth from the purpose to imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mater.</note> Whereof as parte is false, so the whole is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. What nede was there to tel vs, that the bloudy Oblation of Christe vpon the Crosse, is the Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Sacrifice for the sinnes of the worlde? As thereof no man doubted, so no man spake of it.</p>
               <p>The point now treated, is not, whether the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15584:72"/>
of the Crosse be Propitiatorie, for it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous thereof to dispute: but whether Christe be now offered vp in Mysterie. Graunt that first, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward we may procede further, to discusse whether the Sacrifice of the Aulter be Propitiatorie, and in what sense it be Propitiatorie.</p>
               <p>Of what effecte and substance so euer the Sacrifices of both Lawes be, how so euer the Death of Christe to come, or past, be expressed in the olde and newe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, that they of the olde Testament, as wel as we, had Mysteries, of the equalitie, and likenesse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and of like slaiyng of the Lambe of God on their parte, and ours: of all these thinges so particularly to speake, the Diuision by me declared ministred you no iuste occasion. And al this might wel be suffred to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered, as impertinent, had you not by the way as it were spitten forth some poison of erroneous doctrine, to the infection of the vnlearned and vnware Readers.</p>
               <p>For by calling the bloudy Oblation of Christe vpon the Crosse the very, true, and onely Sacrifice Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for the synnes of the worlde (which no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth) your meaning is to insinuate, that the vnbloudy Sacrifice, which Christe instituted at his last Supper of his body and bloude, were not in dede a Sacrifice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sense or respecte Propitiatorie. Whereas if that of the Crosse was Propitiatorie, the other must nedes be Propitiatorie, though in a diuers degree of Propitiation, bicause in substance of the thing offered it is one with the other, but diuers in the manner of offering, as being vnbloudy, and done in a mysterie, and the other bloudy, and don in the forme of a visible body. And the force and
<pb facs="tcp:15584:73"/>
vertue of Propitiation of the one, issueth not from the Priest, but from the Propitiation of the other, in whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration it is offered.<note place="margin">

But who so euer sought onely to fil their bellies by eating Manna, being the Fathers of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, they did eate, and dyed. So likewise they dranke the same drinke. For the Rocke was Christe. And therefore the same drinke which we drinke, they dranke, but spiritual, that is to say, whiche was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by faith, not that whiche was taken in by the body.</p>
               <p>Now what though Christe, whome both the Iewes and we do eate spiritually, be one spiritual meate, one Christe, and likewise one spiritual drinke, as he is eaten and dronken with spiritual eating and drinking? Shal that therefore whiche, we receiue in our Sacrament by sacramental eating and drinking vnder the formes of bread and wine, be no better, then that which they did eate and drinke in the ceremonie of their Sacramentes? Christe that was to come, and Christ that now is come, is one Christe, thereof who doubteth? And though the wordes <hi>shal come,</hi> and <hi>is come,</hi> be sundry, yet Christe is one, Christe is not sundred with diuision of times.</p>

They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him only spiritually, bicause in Manna they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode Christ. The like is to be sayd of the water, that flowed out of the Rocke which they dranke, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the very bloude of Christe, which we drinke, not onely spiritually, but also sacramentally, and in deede vnder the forme of wine mingled with water, which bloude is the true water of life, the same that issued out of our Lordes body the true Rocke, after it was striken with the Rodde,<note place="margin">

The sentence that foloweth belongeth to an other mater, whereby is declared (which no catholike man euer denied) that the Sacrifice of the newe Testament is a thankes geuing, and a commemoration of Christes flesh and bloude, which he hath offered for vs. But that member of the diuision, which I went about to establish by S. Augustines autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, speaketh onely of the Sacrifices of the olde Lawe, that they prefigured the flesh of Christ, which he would afterward offer, and the bloude, that he would shed for remission of sinnes. If I had rehersed al that you blame me for leauing it out, I had but made the booke bigger, and wearied the reader with a long superfluous saying, superfluous I say, bicause the same was in effect vttered in the next sentence before, taken out also of the same S. Augustine. For al that you force out of the longe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse there folowing, is only the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh and bloud offred and shed, which (though in fewer wordes) was expressed in the former sentence out of the bookes against Faustus the Manichey, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by conference may sone perceiue.</p>
               <p>The place of S.

For there he saith, not what is the substance of our Sacrifice, wherein lyeth the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but what thing is done in our Sacrifice, to wit, geuing of thankes, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of our Lordes flesh and bloude, which he offred and shed for vs, and likewise what thing is shewed and declared in the same, that is to say, his death and passion. Al which we denye not. But that S. Augustine ascribing vnto the Sacrifice of the Church thankes geuing, and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the flesh and bloude of Christ, doth exclude the real Sacrifice of his fleshe and bloude, by vertue of his woorde through the holy Ghost made substantially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: that we denie vtterly.

               <p>This Sacrifice was in al times to be recommended vnto the mynde of man, bicause thereof onely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the saluation of man.

<pb facs="tcp:15584:93"/>
the spiritual sacrifices before the other, he sheweth how the outward sacrifices made by the Fathers of the olde Testament with slaughter of beastes, were signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of our spiritual sacrifices, that is to say, of those thinges which be done by vs to this ende, that we cleaue vnto God, and that vnto the same ende we helpe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our neighbour.

               <p>By due conference and consideration of this whole place, and of the discourse there treated, thou maist eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently see good Reader, how litle M.

He would thee to beleue, that S. Augustine spake of the special and singular Sacrifice of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whereof we treate, which Sacrifice in dede is of al men called a sacrifice: and worthily, for so it is. But that by verdite of S. Augustine it is a signe of the true Sacrifice, as though thereby were meant, the same not to be the true Sacrifice, and therefore no true and real Sacrifice at al: therein lyeth much falshoode. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaketh Saint Augustine there of the Sacrifice of the Churche, neither vnderstandeth he by a true sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the chiefe and most true Sacrifice, which is that of the Crosse, but any spiritual sacrifice in general, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the effect of loue toward God, or our neighbour is performed. And therefore he much abuseth the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the vnlearned Reader by his futtel and false translation, turning, <hi>illud quod ab hominibus appellatur Sacrificium,</hi> that which of men is called a sacrifice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by S.

The thing, that of al men is called a sacrifice, is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or a signe of the true Sacrifice</hi>: whereby he induceth the Reader to conceiue the Sacrifice of the Churche, and to
<pb facs="tcp:15584:94"/>
beleue the same not to be a true and real Sacrifice, but only a signe of the true Sacrifice. And in that he turneth <hi>signum veri Sacrificij, a signe or token of the true Sacrifice,</hi> he meaneth Christe offered vpon the Crosse, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then S. Augustine did: whereas he should haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated it thus, A signe of a true sacrifice. And what is there meant by a true sacrifice, he could not be ignorant. For it foloweth immediatly, <hi>Porrò autem misericordia ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sacrificium est,</hi> mercie is a true sacrifice.</p>

Here it is not so offred, nor shed, but that offering and bloud shedding, that is to say, the death of Christ, is represented and recorded. The Sacrifice of the Crosse is the True Sacrifice in respect both of the thing offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of the common manner of offering, for there Christ was killed: the Sacrifice of the Aulter, which is the Sacrifice of the Churche, is also the True Sacrifice in respect of the thing offered which is the body and

bloude of Christe, as truly present in the Sacrament, though inuisibly, as vpon the Crosse, where it was visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, albe it in respect of the olde common manner of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, it is not a Sacrifice after that manner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it called <hi>sacrificium incruentum,</hi> the vnbloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p>An other manner there is, singuler, special, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this mystical Sacrifice, after whiche it is made, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and offered, so as the Mysterie that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, requireth: which they knowe, that haue grace rightly to beleue.

How this maketh any proufe for your doctrine, I see not. For though the Sacrifice be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sometimes by the name of the Passion, the Death, and

crucifying of Christe (as S. Cyprian saith,<note place="margin">

Such a great Logician, as you would seme to be, wil not make this childish Argument, I dare say: That whiche the Priest maketh, signifieth the Passion and Death of Christe, and is not the Passion and Death in deede: Ergo, it is not a Sacrifice. That it be a true and real Sacrifice, it is not necessary, that Christe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer againe, and be slaine: it is yenough the body of Christe that once suffred, and was slaine, be truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and offered vnto God. Which is done in our Mysterie by them, who haue commaundement to doo, that Christe did, when he said, <hi>Doo this in my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ende of this your first Diuision you say, that <hi>Neither would the Real presence being graunted, importe the Sacrifice, nor that I haue hitherto any waie prooued the Real presence,</hi> which after your scoffing custome you cal my <hi>Real presence,</hi> as though it had not ben taught by the cleare scriptures, by al the olde learned Fathers, and vniuersally beleued of Christen people, til the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked generation of the Sacramentaries came.

that there want not learned men, who holde, that Christes body from the time it was first fourmed in, and of the body of the blessed virgin his mother, neuer ceassed, nor shal ceasse to be a sacrifice, according as S.

                  <p>Consider Reader, when Saint Cyprian had said, that Christe offered the same sacrifice that Melchisedech had offered, which was, bread and wine: least any man shoulde mistake his meaning, and thinke, that Christe offered none other, nor better thing, then breade and wine, and in so doing should not excel Melchisedech: he addeth an interpretation of his owne woordes, to wit, that although Christes offering appeared to be bread and wine, yet in deede it was his body and bloud.

                  <p>Nowe let vs descende one steppe lower, and we shal come vnto the very point, at whiche M.

The first proposition is proued by S. Paule. The second is manifest, bicause the Apostles, to whom the commaundement was geuen, were not to continue a liue in the Church vntil Christes second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. That commaundement therfore was geuen as wel vnto them who should succeede, as vnto the Apostles them selues: For that any should take vpon them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute so high an office, who haue no commaundement thereto, or that the commaundement was geuen to al in general, it is to absurde to thinke.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15584:103"/>
them to succede the Apostles in that degree.</p>
                  <p>To the like effecte we finde in S. Cyprian a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie worthy of note.<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him: then that Priest doth truely supply the stede of Christ, which foloweth that which Christ did.</p>
                  <p>This saying of S. Cyprian goeth somwhat hygher, then the former of S. Hierome. There it was said, that Priestes succeded in Apostolike degree. Here a Priest folowing the acte of Christ in offering the Sacrifice, is said to be the substitute of Christ him selfe. By S. Hieromes verdit they may consecrate the body of Christ, as the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles: by S. Cyprians doctrine they may offer the Sacrifice, as the Vicars of Christ. What thinke we then? May any Christian man sauing his profession, imagine, yea beleue, and openly by preaching, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting publish vnto the worlde, that the Apostles succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, and Christes substitutes want auctoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to doo that, vnto thoffice whereof they succede, and be substitutes?</p>
                  <p>Now let these circumstances be gathered, and set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in fewer wordes, so shal the necessary sequele the better be perceiued. Melchisedech was a priest, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christ by offering bread and wine. Christ ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this figure at his Maundie by consecrating, and offering his bodie and bloude vnder the formes of Breade and Wine vnto his Father, him selfe being
<pb facs="tcp:15584:104"/>
the true bread of life, that came downe from heauen: and gaue commaundement and auctoritie to his Apostles, and to their successours, to do the same in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of him: The successours of the Apostles in this behalfe be the Priestes of the newe Testament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priestes haue a commaundement, and thereby sufficient auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to doo that Christe did at his Maundie, that is, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and offer the body and bloud of Christ vnto his Father. And so to conclude, these circumstances thus considered, doo clearely prooue to the detection of M.

               <p>Nexte, you swarue very much from the meaning and purpose of Tertullian. For he saith not, that the Preaching of the Ghospel is that cleane Sacrifice, which Malachie prophecied of, but farre otherwise. Tertullian hauing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the two kindes of Sacrifices of the two peoples, the Iewes and the Gentiles, foreshewed at the beginning in th' oblations of Cain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Genes.</hi> 4.</note> and Abel: demaundeth, whereas Gods law geuen by Moyses required the carnal sacrifices to be made by the people of Israel in the land of promise, and nowher els: why the holy Ghost afterward notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by Malachie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.</note> and also by Dauid fortelleth, that the Iewes earthly and fleshly sacrifices should ceasse, and that spiritual Sacrifices should be offered vp to God ouer the whole world. Vnto this question he answereth him selfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertulliae. contra Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This assuredly is the true abbrigement and meaning of Tertullians woordes there.<note place="margin">Tertulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s place tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> And cleare it is, he saith not, that the Preaching of the Ghospell is the pure

Sacrifice, that Malachie speaketh of, as you vntruly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of him: but onely that the holy Ghoste foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Malachie, and by Dauid, that the Iewes sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being abolished, pure sacrifices should be offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong al Nations of the earth, bicause it should come to passe, that the Apostles should preach ouer the whole worlde. So that by Tertullians verdite, the preaching of the Gospel was not that pure Sacrifice it selfe spoken of by Malachie, but the Apostles preaching that then was to come, was the cause, why Malachie and Dauid enspired of the holy Ghoste, fortolde the ceassing of the Iewes carnal sacrifices, and the setting vp, or vse of the Gentiles spiritual Sacrifices. More then this, which is nothing at al, Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that place maketh not for you.</p>
               <p>Leaue, leaue M. Iewel for your credites sake (if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els can moue you) to deceiue vnlearned soules, whom Christe hath so derely bought, with sayinges of your owne forging, fathering them vpon the auncient Doctours.

                  <hi>who neuer did synne, nor was guile found in his mouth</hi>: is both in that respect pure and cleane, and also for that it is pronounced by the Priest, as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like minister of the Churche, whose priuate vncleannes what so euer it be, in that behalfe impaireth not the worthinesse of the sacrifice, nor of the prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

an Oblation, not an vncleane one, as was offered of the people of Israel, but a cleane one, as is offred vp in the Ceremonies of the Christians. For from the rising of the sunne to the setting, the name of our Lorde is greate among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>This Prophet speaketh of two things,<note place="margin">Tvvo thinges spoken of by Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</note> the one don amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, and now to be leafte of, the other to be done among the Gentils.

Which Ceremonies be the chiefe, the most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the most reuerent, the most mystical, and most holy Ceremonies, that Christians haue.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, whereas Malachie, and likewise S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome expounding his wordes, speake of two thinges, of prayer, and of the pure Oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the same being that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is offred euery where from the East to the west in the Ceremonies of the Christians by his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: now it appeareth how falsly M.

Hierome so to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the place of Praier, as though he vnderstode the whole saying of Prayer only, and not one parte of it of Prayer, and an other parte also of the Sacrifice of the Church, whereas in deede he vnderstandeth it of both, and most expressely speaketh of both, as I haue now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Thus he neuer leaueth to iustle away one truth, with an other truth.</p>
                  <p>NOw to come to Eusebius, let vs see, whether you entreate him with more truth, then you haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Tertullian, and S. Hierom. <hi>He knoweth</hi> (say
<pb facs="tcp:15584:113"/>
you likewise of me) <hi>that Eusebius calleth the same sacrifice of Malachie, the sacrifice and the Incence of prayer.</hi> And for some shewe of proufe for that you say, you put in the margent of your booke, this peece of a Greke sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of Eusebius,<note place="margin">

For immediatly to shew what he vnderstode by the Pure Sacrifice, he bringeth forth a prophecie of Esay foreshewing the same. <hi>There shal be an Aulter</hi> (saith the Prophet Esay as Eusebius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth) <hi>to our Lorde in the countrie of Egypte,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the better vnderstanding of this place, by the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians Esay meaneth, as Eusebius there afterward expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, al kind of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ were Idolatours, as the Egyptians were. Now if Eusebius had vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Pure Sacrifice me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned by Malachie of prayer, or only of mere spiritual and internal sacrifices, he wold not haue alleged for further prouf and declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, that place of Esay, wher he maketh expres mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an Aulter to be set vp among the Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that is, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al
<pb facs="tcp:15584:114"/>
the Gentiles, who were before geuen to Idolatrie. The external Aulter argueth and presupposeth an external sacrifice. For els if the Sacrifice be inward onely and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, to the doing of it, the building of an Aulter is void and to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>If M. Iewel to auoide the force of this place alleged by Eusebius, wil bring phrases, as his manner is, whereby to declare, that Aulters oftentimes be vnderstanded to be spiritual (which I acknowledge and confesse that the Aulters of our hartes be of the Fathers not seldom spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of) and therfore wil say, that Eusebius vnderstode this prophecie of Esay of such a spiritual Aulter: to this I answer: Eusebius vnderstandeth Esay to meane such an Aulter, as Moses lawe forbad any where els to be set vp, then in Iewrie, and that only in one citie of Iewrie. But it was neuer forbidden by Moses Lawe, but that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Aulters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes hartes might be prepared in moe places then in one onely Citie of Iewrie, for Ieremie, Ezechiel, Daniel, Ezdras, Tobias, and many other holy Iewes, and Israelites had such spiritual Aulters, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered acceptable spiritual sacrifices vnto God in other Countries besides Iewrie, and in Cities farre dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from Ierusalem: wherefore he meant of such Aulters, as Christians haue euer had in their Churches, which be made after the manner of the Aulter appointed by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though the Sacrifice be of a farre diners manner.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>etc. Moses ordeined Aulter and sacrifices to be made in no Land elswhere, but in Iewrie only, and that in one only, Citie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> But this prophecie of Esay saith, <hi>that an Aulter shal be set vp vnto our Lorde in the Land of Egypte, and that the

                  </p>
                  <p>After that he hath spoken what he thought good of this new manner of Aulter, and Sacrifice, of the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aulter, and priesthod appointed by Moses, and therefore consequently of the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Law it selfe: in conclusion thus he saith. <gap reason="foreign">

As much to say, <hi>Now then is the time come, that there is neede of a new lawe to be made, that the foresaid thinges may take place.</hi> But as for the spiritual Aulter of mennes hartes, and the mere spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and inward sacrifices, as the sacrifices of prayer, of laude and praise, of thankes geuing, and such other: who vnderstandeth not, that they might wel take place, and be frequented without necessitie of any newe Lawe to be made, and that other wheres, then onely in one Citie of Iewrie? Verely the vse of such Aulters requireth not a change of Moses lawe, and priesthode. For such Aulters, and such sacrifices were in Egypte, and Chaldaea, among many thousandes of Iewes, who lyued in those Landes, long before Moses law was dissolued. The Aulter therfor and Sacrifice that Eusebius meaneth in that place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Malachies Prophecie, is the Aulter and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, wherevpon and which, the faithful people by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Priestes of the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doth continually offer vnto God, to wit the body and bloude of Christ, in remembrance of his death, after the new Decrees and ordinances of the new Testament, as he saith in <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>I am Messias or Christe, euen I that speake with thee:</hi> that should we expounde of the time to come, that he shal be Messias. Which doctrine maketh a right way for Antichrist, who is to come.</p>
               <p>If he sooth his saying of some parte of the Scriptures, the same I graunt also, specially of the olde Testament, where prophecies are vttered of thinges to come in the new Testament. But it had ben his parte to prooue (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse his profession be to prooue nothing, and to stand only in denials) that in the Institution of the Sacrament the Present Tense standeth for the future, and that so, as the thing signified may not by any conuenient sense be verified in the Present Tense. For els if it might, how much better were it to expounde it of both Tenses, then of one onely, that Christes saying might thoroughly, and on euery side appeare true?

               </p>
               <p>Christ after a manner of sacrifice, that is vnspeakeable, secret, and such as can not be sene of men, by his owne disposition and administration preuenteth the violent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault (that afterward was made) and offereth him selfe an Oblation and Sacrifice for vs,<note place="margin">Christ at the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, both Priest, and La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be.</note> being the Priest, and also the Lambe of God, that taketh away the synne of the worlde. When was this done? At what time he gaue vnto them of his householde his body to be eaten, and his bloude to be droonke. For to euery one this is a cleare mater, that a man may not eate of the Lambe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept killing go before the eating. Whereas then he gaue vnto his disciples his body to eate, he sheweth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a perfite and absolute immolation (or Sacrifice) was now made.</p>
               <p>What can M. Iewel require more? This learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, that Christ <hi>preuented the violence and furie of the Iewes,</hi> meaning that he did vnto him selfe that at the Supper, which was done on the morow with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of them that crucified him. Wherby neuerthelesse he vnderstandeth the mystical Oblation of him selfe, not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15584:127"/>
the manner of his blouddy Oblation. For he confesseth it to be secret, inuisible, and vnspeakeable. And that no man should doubte of this Sacrifice, he ascribeth vnto him both the office of a Priest, and also of the Lambe. As a Priest, he sacrificed, as the Lambe, he was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding of this point, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the Supper, and that on the morow vppon the Crosse,<note place="margin">The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Crosse, one, and diuers, in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes.</note> may truly be accompted and named one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and also diuers Sacrifices. Neither is this Sophistrie good Reader, as these newe Gospellers wil beare thee in hande: by this true distinction, sophistical obiections and wranglings of the Gospellers may reasonably be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. How then is it one, how be they diuers? Learne it once, and be no more contentious, as they be, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard it so oftentimes by the Catholikes tolde them, wil yet seme not to vnderstand it.</p>
               <p>Before I answer to this question,<note place="margin">Sacrifice, taken tvvo vvaies.</note> this much is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to be declared, that the name of Sacrifice, is wont to be taken sometime for the thing that is offred vnto God, sometime for the action it selfe of sacrificing. Now then it is one Sacrifice in respect of the thing offred and sacrificed, which is the body and bloude of Christ. For that is one and the selfe same in both, in the Supper, and vpon the Crosse. The Action is of two manners, bloudy, and vnbloudy. These Sacrifices be diuers in respect of the manner of the Action and of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. For in the Supper it was vnbloudy, and vpon the Crosse, it was bloudy.</p>

His wordes be these, according to the Greke. <hi>Quinta feria fecit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus coenam, &amp; Discipulis dixit, Accipite, &amp; comedite Corpus meum. Itaque quia potestatem ex se habebat ponendi anima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suam, manifestum est, quòd ex eo tempore immolauerit seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, quando tradidit discipulissuis corpus suum. Nemo enim comedit aliquid, nisi prius fuerit immolatum.</hi> Vpon the fifth day our Lorde made his Supper, and said vnto his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, take ye, and eate my body. So that bicause he had power of him selfe to put of his soule, it is manifest that from that time he sacrificed him selfe, when he delyuered his body vnto his Disciples. For no man doth eate any thing (at the sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nitie of a sacrifice, so he meaneth) which is not sacrificed before.</p>
               <p>What can be vttered in plainer termes, then that we find in these two Fathers? The one saith, that Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him selfe, when he gaue his body and bloude vnto his Disciples. The other, that he preuented the violence that was done vnto him on the morow, and offered vp
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15584:128"/>
him selfe an Oblation and Sacrifice, performing the parte bothe of a Prieste, and of the Lambe. And least any man should myssetake them, vnderstanding it to haue ben done vpon the Crosse onely: with most expresse wordes they referre it vnto the Supper. And so by their doctrine be the verbes, <hi>Datur, fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gitur, effunditur, is geuen, is broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is shed,</hi> verefied in the present Tense, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the future Tense.</p>
               <p>In these testimonies the cause, that both Nyssen, and Theophylacte geueth, why Christe offered his body, which he deliuered vnto his Disciples, is specially to be noted: which is, bicause in the solemnitie of Sacrifices, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eateth that which is not before sacrificed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they allude vnto the olde manner of Sacrifices, which alwaies were offered vp, before they were eaten. And so the body and bloude of our Sauiour Christe our true Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lambe, was at his Maundie, and now ought to be offered vp, before it was then, or now is to be eaten and dronke in the blessed Sacrament.<note place="margin">

               <p>But here M. Iewel replieth, and would faine prooue a contradiction to be implyed in this doctrine. I omit his falsifying of my Answer, affirming me to say, that Christe did shed his bloud at his last Supper <hi>verily, really, and in dede</hi> (which I said not, though it may be so said in a right sense): and much lesse meant I, as thereby his intent is to report vnto the simple, to wit, an external, and sensible shedding, which was done only at the tyme of his Passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That the mater might seme the more absurde and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christes Sacrifice made at the Supper were vnbloudy, how then did he there shed his bloud?

               </p>
               <p>Why Sir, wil you nedes haue the Mysteries of this Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peerlesse Sacrifice to be discussed by reason, and not to be conceiued only by faith? Wil you require
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15584:129"/>
the meane of this Sacrifice to be set forth euidently vnto you, which is secret as Nyssen before mentioned saith, inuisible, and vnspeakeable? S. Paule him selfe where he speaketh of the Priesthoode of Christe after the order of Melchisedek,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note> saith he not, that <hi>thereof he hath much to say, and that the things be hard to expound?</hi> These howes and questions M. Iewel become Iewes, Infidels, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, much better then a true Christian man. Christes bloud was shed at his Supper, so as it is now shed in the daily Sacrifice of the Aulter: that is to say, in a mysterie, and in a Sacrament, by a meane to man inuisible, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable.</p>
               <p>Bicause his bloud is beneficial vnto vs to redemption, in that it was once actually, externally, and with death drawen forth of his body: In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration thereof, where so euer that bloud is by the almighty power of our Lords worde in the Sacrifice made and exhibited, we thinke it no absurditie, nor inconuenience, to say, that his bloude is shed in a mysterie, and vnbloudily. Whereby we meane, that not only his memorie is celebrated, but also that the effecte of the bloudy shedding of his bloude, that is to say, the effect of his death, is thereby applied vnto vs hauing faith, and being disposed, as we ought to be, as if he were now hanging on the Crosse, and presently bleeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. For to shew this and that of the Crosse, to be one and the selfe Sacrifice, we offer him, saith Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact, <hi>perinde ac si esset hoc tempore immolatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact. in cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ad Heb.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:15584:130"/>
And therefore it may truly be termed an vnbloudy shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloude, the terme of shedding being referred to the bloude by the power of the worde of consecration made present, offered, presented, and verily exhibited, the terme vnbloudy, referred to the manner of offering and exhibiting it without any such violence, as was done vnto the person of Christe by the Souldiers, who with thornes, nailes, and speare, drew bloud of him, when he hong on the Crosse.</p>
               <p>That no doubte remaine, to speake so plainely as I can of this high Mysterie, thus it is. The bloude of Christe (we confesse) is the price of our Redemption, in that it was once shed vpon the Crosse. That bloude, and body whereof it issued out, is the Hoste of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. That very bloude is here made present in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Aulter by vertue of Christes worde, and is said presently to be shed (whiche neuer the lesse we vnderstand to be done in mysterie and in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of that which was shed vpon the Crosse) bicause the effecte of that external shedding by this is applied vnto vs, as if it were now in our sight offered and shed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy shedding of bloud.</note>This shedding may be, and is called vnbloudy, as the offering and the Sacrificing of Christ, and as the death is called vnbloudy. For like as is the Sacrifice, such is the Death. Where is bloudy Sacrifice, there is bloudy Death. Where is the vnbloudy Sacrifice, there is the vnbloudy Death, and consequently the mystical and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sheddding of bloude.</p>
               <p>But for better credite, and that it seme not strange, let vs confirme this pointe with some testimonies of Ancient Faters, where the like speaches are vttered.

               <p>In these former and the like sayinges, the Fathers doo set forth the way and meane of this Sacrifice, of this Death, and consequently of this shedding of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bloude: as they may seeme to signifie not obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their vnablenesse to expresse the same, terming it <hi>Sacrifice in a Sacrament, Death in a Mysterie, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing mystical.</hi> The whiche wordes, Sacrament, and Mysterie, doo not importe a signification of absence of the thing reported to be sacrificed, to be shed, and

Thus the learned Fathers being persuaded, that through the almighty power of Christes woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, his flesh and bloude are really exhibited, and made present in the Sacrament: thought it no absurditie in this singular Sacrifice, to ioyne those termes together, which in no truth could stand together in the order and manner of offering the olde sacrifices, or Christes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vpon the Crosse.</p>
               <p>If M.

               <p>And wilt thou vnderstand Christian Reader, how the olde Fathers of the Churche meane, where they

               <p>I do not bring him in dumme. To referre the Reader vnto a special place of a writer, is not to bring him in dumme. So I in my Answer referred the Reader to the eight booke and last chapter of S. Clements Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                  <hi>who for our sake being made man, and offering a spiritual Sacrifice vnto God and his Father, before his passion commaunded vs</hi> (his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) <hi>alone to do the same: albeit there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers present with vs, that beleued in him, but euery one that beleueth, is not forth with a priest, nor hath Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopply honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here haue we expresse, and plaine mention of the Sacrifice, which Christe, as high Bishop offered vp vnto God his Father, and commaunded his Apostles to offer the same, before his passion. This Sacrifice he calleth Spiritual,<note place="margin">Spiritual.</note> in respecte of the sacrifices of Moyses lawe, which were grosse and bodily of brute beastes,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15584:133"/>
meaning the sacrifice of his body and bloude, spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is to say, with spiritual manner, and not with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible shedding of bloude offred, and that before his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereby he signifieth the Sacrifice made at the Supper. And that it be not vnderstanded of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Praise, or prayer onely, S. Clement saith it was such, as the Apostles only were commaunded to offer, for that they were Priestes.<note place="margin">A testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Of what other sacrifice can M.

               <p>Of this Sacrifice he is to be expounded, where spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of S. Steuen in the same chapter, he saith thus. <hi>Whereas he was such, and so great a man, feruent in spirite, and saw Christe on the right hande of God, and the gates of heauen open: yet it appeareth no where, that he exercised those offices, which be not conuenient for the degree of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conship, as that either he offered the Sacrifice, or laid handes vpon any, but kept the order of a Deacon vnto his ende.</hi> As for the inward spiritual Sacrifices, as praise, thankes, a contrite harte, prayer and such the like: I trow M.

               <p>For answer to this and the like cauilles made by the Sacramentaries against the veritie of Christes body and bloude in the blessed Sacrament, it shal be necessary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15584:134"/>
to informe the Reader of the doctrine of S. Augustine touching this very point.<note place="margin">

That the Sacrifice of the Church is made of two thinges, and consisteth of two thinges, the visible forme of the elementes, and the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible flesh and bloud of our Lorde Iesus Christe, both the Sacrament, and the thing of the Sacrament, that is to say, the body of Christe.</p>
               <p>Now where as the Sacrifice consisteth of two things, the visible forme of the elementes,<note place="margin">For what, <hi>antitypon</hi> is taken in S.

Also, bicause we haue not yet the fruition of Christes body after such wise, as we shal haue in the life to come. Here we haue Christe verily, in deede, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:135"/>
but as yet couered in a mysterie, and hidden vnder the outward formes.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> But in the life to come we shal see him face to face, not as through a glasse, or darke contemplation: but euen so as he is in truth of his owne Maiestie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the terme <hi>antitypon,</hi> maketh nothing for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</note>Bicause the Sacramentaries, where, with al their witte and cunning they impugne the Sacrifice of the Aulter, pretend to haue great aduauntage against the Catholikes, for that S.

               <p>First it is acknowledged and confessed of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, that the Sacrament of the Aulter is <hi>antitypon,</hi> that is to say, a sampler, or signe of Christes roial body: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could not be a Sacrament, which is a visible signe of inuisible grace.

               <p>We say, that onlesse the flesh and bloude of Christe be the substance of this sampler or signe, it can not be a Sacrament meete for the dignitie of the new Testament: bicause it must be the truth of al the figuratiue Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the olde Lawe, according to that S.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15584:135"/>
that Sacrifice (saith he) hath succeded al those Sacrifices of the old Testament, which were offered in the shadow of that to come.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this Sacrifice being the body of those shadowes, must excel in substance the Sacrifices, that were the shadowes. But how can that be, if the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread be the substance of our Sacrifice, for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the substance of bread is no better (if it be so good being an artificial and dead thing) then is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a lambe, an Oxe, or a goat, which are natural, and lyuing creatures, whose substances were substances of the olde Sacrifices, that were shadowes.</p>
               <p>S. Alexander therefore the fourth Bisshop of Rome after S. Peter, considering the excellency of our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aboue the olde Sacrifices,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alexand. epist.</hi> 1. <hi>De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sec. dist.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil in.</hi>
                  </note> saith, <hi>Nihil in Sacrificiis maius esse potest, quàm corpus &amp; sanguis Christi, nec vlla oblatio hac potior est, sed omnes haec praecellit, &amp;c.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be greater in Sacrifices, then the body and bloude Christe, neither is there any oblation better then this, but this doth farre excel al others, the which ought to be offered vp vnto God with a cleane conscience, and to be receiued with a pure mynde, and of men to be wourshipped.</p>
               <p>Thus our Sacrifice conteyning really the pretious body and bloude of Christe, is a Sacrifice worthy of the newe Testamente, most meete and hable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto vs, and preserue in perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce the same body and bloude rent and shed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Crosse, and most effectual to deriue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto vs, the merites and fruites of that bloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>

                  </gap>, asmuch to say, equal to God, who for some excellent qualitie semed to be nothing inferiour (at least in that point) to them whom he feined to be Gods. And in consideration hereof, learned men haue translated the Greke worde <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now what thing is there any where, that is worthy to be, or may be a true patern or sampler of like forme to the body and bloud of Christe crucified and shed, and now remaining visibly in heauen, but the body and bloud of Christe him selfe, which by vertue of his almighty woorde, he of his singular mercie so maketh and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth for vs in the most holy mysteries, geuing them vs vnder the formes of our common foode breade and wine, that neither the Maiestie of them should deterre and fray vs from offering them, nor any lothsomnes,

or sight of fleshe and bloude, shoulde cause vs to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to eate and drinke them. And thus the body of Christ in the Eucharist, is, <hi>antitypon,</hi> that is to say, a signe, a sacrament, a patern, a sampler of his body that hoong vpon the Crosse, and of his body that is now in Maiestie at the right hande of God the Father.</p>
               <p>Neither is this a new doctrine of our deuise, it was taught in Christes Churche aboue eleuen hundred yeres past. Let these woordes of S. Augustine serue to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the same.<note place="margin">

               <p>Consider this doctrine wel Christian Reader. First, that whiche we receiue in the Sacrament vnder the formes of bread and wine (S. Augustine telleth thee) is the flesh and bloude of Christe. Next, he saith, not that the outward formes of bread and wine, but that the very flesh and bloude, be sacramentes of flesh and bloude. Lastly, to put al doubte away, and to make the mater cleare, he sheweth how this is true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and saith, that
<pb facs="tcp:15584:137"/>
by both flesh and bloude inuisible, and intelligible, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and palpable body of Christe is pointed to, notified, and signified. Which is as much to say briefly, as that the body of Christe in the Sacrament inuisible, is a signe or sampler of Christes body visible. Al this yf thou consider diligently and aduisedly, thou maist easily vnderstande, what both S. Clement in the place by M. Iewel alleged, and other learned Fathers meane by this worde, <hi>antity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,</hi> in the mater of the blessed Sacrament: soothly not to exclude the real presence of Christes body, but to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the secret meane of the presence.</p>
               <p>We graunt therefore the Sacrament of the Aulter to be a signe, as S. Clement calleth it, <hi>antitypo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But when by any Sacramentarie the denial of the thing it self is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the affirmation of the signe,<note place="margin">The kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Sig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, signi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficatiue only, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> we deny the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For there be two kindes of signes. One is significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue onely, the other exhibitiue, which doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token or signifie, but also exhibiteth, and geueth the thing signified. In the olde Lawe the vnleuened bread signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied onely, that the feast of Easter was to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with sinceritie of harte and life. The corporal purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions signified only the cleansing of myndes. But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in the newe Lawe doth not only signifie, but also exhibiteth, and worketh the Wasshing of synnes, and is the ablution it selfe, or wasshing away of sinnes. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the holy Euchariste doth not onely betoken or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, the body and bloud of Christe, but contineth, and exhibiteth it present,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, &amp; exhibitiuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>
                  </note> and is the very body and bloude of Christ, it is <hi>signu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> signatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; exhibitiuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Thus it appeareth, how the Sacramentaries Argument is naught, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a signe, <hi>ergo</hi> it is not the body. For it is both a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15584:137"/>

               <p>These two wordes with the sleight of falsifying nipte away by M.

               <p>But M. Iewel to put away wholly the Sacrifice, whereas Christe said, <hi>doo ye this in my remembrance,</hi> saith very strangely and boldly,<note place="margin">M. Ievvel vvold, al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be Ministers of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> that <hi>this doing perteineth not only vnto the Apostles, and their successours, but also vnto the whole people.</hi> And he beareth the worlde in hande, that this is the cleare meaning of Christe, bicause of these wordes, <hi>in my remembrance.</hi> As though bicause that heauenly Sacrifice is to be offered in remembrance of Christe, therefore the common people and euery one of them should haue the handling of the diuine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and be made the Ministers of them.</p>
               <p>If this be true, weemen haue much wrong, among whom in so many hundred yeres, as haue ben since Christ gaue this commaundement, none was yet euer admitted vnto that administration. And if it perteine vnto the whole people (as M. Iewel saith) why should weemen be excluded? In dede it were a great ease for these holy Ministers, that their good wiues ministred sometimes in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations for them, whiles they be playing with their children, or keeling the potre at home.</p>
               <p>He should haue done wel, to haue proued this strange point, more substantially, sith there by he should do great pleasure to his felow Ministers, to many other good felowes, and specially to many good sad dames of his owne Gospel, whose curiositie would be wel pleased, if they were admitted to minister, and to doo so much, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15584:142"/>
these wordes of Christe doo importe, <hi>doo ye this in my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance.</hi> The deuil hauing sowed hatred in M. Iewels breste against the priesthod, and Sacrifice of the newe Testament, hath brought him vnto this fowle absurditie.</p>
               <p>Peraduenture to auoide so great an inconuenience, he wil say that these wordes doo principally perteine vnto the Ministers, who haue succeded the Apostles in this ministerie, and secondarily vnto the faithful people. If he say so, let him withal consider, that being so vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they may wel serue for the Apostles to claime vnto them selues the auctoritie of Priesthod, to offer vp the Sacrifice, and also to ordeine priestes to succede them. For as touching the office of a Priest, it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed truth, that the Priest in offering the body and bloud of Christ, is the principal agent concerning outward ministerie, and as it were the instrument of the people, which by a certaine meane offereth also, geuing vnto the Priestes action their assent, and applying their deuotion. Much like to that we say of a multitude to make a supplication, when one man is the speaker and chiefe dooer, and the reste only geue their consent to that is said and done.</p>
               <p>And what though S. Paule say vnto the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>As often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this Cuppe, ye shal shewe forth our Lordes death, vntil he come</hi>? wil it folow thereof, that Christe speaking these wordes, <hi>doo ye this in my remembrance,</hi> woulde the whole people to doo that he at his supper did? That is to say, that euery lay person, boye, and woman (for they be of the number of the people) shal take bread, blesse and geue thankes, and vtter the wordes of consecration, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and likewise the cuppe, saying; this is my bloude, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15584:143"/>Doth he not vnderstand, there is great difference betwen this commaundement of Christ, and that saying of S. Paule? betwen, <hi>doo this in my remembrance,</hi> which Christe saith: and, <hi>when so euer ye eate this bread, and drinke this cuppe, ye shew forth our Lordes death,</hi> whiche <hi>S.</hi> Paule saith? Seeth he not the one to belong vnto the Priest, as he is the pronuncer of the Diuine wordes, whereby the holy Euchariste is consecrate and made: the other to be referred vnto them, that receiue it after it is consecrate? And though both tende to one ende, that is, to celebrate the memorie of Christes death, yet be not the actions diuers? and may they not be done by diuers persons, as it happeth when the people receiueth the body of Christe at the priestes handes?</p>
               <p>This much may serue also for answer to the autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie brought out of S. Chrysostome.

                     <item>Secondly, he adknowlegeth <hi>the Ministration of the holy Communion</hi> (for so he calleth it) of the olde learned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Fathers to be called a Sacrifice, bicause of thankes, and praises therein offered vnto God.</item>

                     <item>Fourthly, he pretendeth to shewe causes, why the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Sacrifice of the Communion is dredful, and causeth the

harte to tremble.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the first, what meane you M. Iewel by saying, that Eusebius neuer once named any suche obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sonne of God? Be you so addicted to the precise termes of your own Chalenge,<note place="margin">M. Ievvel is driuen from the mater, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to precise vvordes.</note> that other wordes of equal force may not be admitted? Verely this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the weaknesse of your cause, and openeth your poore shifte to the worlde, which is, that whereas you are conuicte by cleare truth of thinges, yet you runne for succour vnto the shadowe of wordes.</p>
               <p>You denye by the wordes of your Chalenge, that by witnesse of any doctor within the first six hundred yeres after Christe, we are hable to shewe, that a Priest hath auctoritie to offer vp Christe vnto his Father. Now this are we hable to proue as by diuers others, so in this place by testimonie of Eusebius, though expressely he name it not an oblation of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>And for asmuch as you stand vpon your owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise termes, you shalbe driuen from your holde by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Argument. Answer it, if you can. What so euer we that are Priestes haue ben taught by Christe to doo, to doo the same we haue auctoritie. But we haue ben taught by Christe to offer vp Christe vnto his Father: <hi>Ergo,</hi> to offer vp Christe vnto his Father we haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priest hath auctoritie, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But M. Iewel vnderstandeth by the Sacrifices of Christes table spoken of in Eusebius, the Sacrifice of thankes geuing. For whereas I say in my Answer, that the Body and bloude of Christe, are called of Eusebius the Sacrifices of Christes table, bicause at the table in his last Supper he sacrificed and offered the same: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolleth me for so saying, and skoreth it vp in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for his: 222. Vntruth, shewing this cause why. For (saith he) <hi>Eusebius calleth it the sacrifice of thankes geuing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Ievvel belyeth Eusebius.</note> wherein he deserueth an vntruth, or rather a manifest lie to be scored vp vpon him selfe. For neither nameth Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius a sacrifice in that place, which he would, if he had meant the sacrifice of thankes geuing, but sacrifices in the plural number, yea expressely the dreadful or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrifices of Christes table, neither nameth he there expressely, the sacrifice of thankes geuing at al: And neuer was it heard before, that any olde, or late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned catholike writer called thankes geuing indefinitely, the dreadful Sacrifices of Christes table. For to geue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15584:146"/>
thankes it is not dredful, neither is it peculiar to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical table, but common in respect of al times, places and seruices.</p>
               <p>Certaine it is, as it shal be euident to al that wil peruse that place of Eusebius, that by the dreadful Sacrifices of Christes table, he meant the body and bloud of Christe: How be it he speaketh so thereof, vsing the termes, of memorie, signes, and tokens, as it was most conuenient for that time, when the Christians lyued among the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes and Infidels, to whom those secretes were not to be reueled,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 7.</note> accordingly as Christe forebad <hi>a holy thing to be geuen to dogges, and precious stones to be caste before swyne.</hi> By which way of vtterance the olde learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intent was, not to exclude the true presence of the most holy thinges, but to coouer them from the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Painimes prophane vnderstanding, and to insinuate vnto the beleuers, the mystical and secret manner of their presense.</p>
               <p>To returne to Eusebius, In the later parte of his first booke, <hi>De demonstratione Euangelica,</hi> discoursing vpon the excellencie of the newe Testament in comparison of the olde, hauing declared the figuratiue sacrifices of Moyses lawe to be abolished,<note place="margin">Three kindes of Sacrifices of the nevv Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Eusebius. <hi>Euseb. li.</hi> 1 <hi>de demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which I confesse neuer the lesse alwaies to be offered not without the
<pb facs="tcp:15584:148"/>
Sacrifice of thankes, and praise: and with that Sacrifice we doo thanke, and praise God most principally.</p>
               <p>The saying of Dauid propheciyng of the Sacrifices of this table,<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Expressely and manifestly in these wordes</hi> (saith Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius) <hi>is signified the mystical Chrisme</hi> (or ointment) <hi>and the dreadful</hi> (or honorable) <hi>Sacrifices of Christes table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verely this soueraigne praise, that Dauid after the mynde of Eusebius geueth vnto the mystical Cuppe of our Lordes table, can not seme to be attributed vnto the Cuppe of the Sacramentarie Suppers, which conteineth in it no better thing, then common wine. It is the bloud of Christe, not a suppe of common wine, that doth moist and inebriate a man in that most strong wise, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Dauid prophecied. The Hebrew worde importing signification of great abundance, maketh muche for this sense, and quite contrary to the Sacramentarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>From Dauid he goeth to Esay the Prophete, alleging among other thinges a saying out of him, signifiyng, that <hi>the Lorde of bostes should do maruelous thinges in al nations.</hi> What those thinges are, the prophete decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. <hi>They shal haue pleasant drinke</hi> (saith he) <hi>they shal drinke wine. They shal be annointed with an ointment in this hil.</hi> Vpon these wordes of Esay thus saith Eusebius. <hi>These maruelous thinges that Esay speaketh of, did promise
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15584:148"/>
not to Israel, but to al nations, the annointing of a good sweete smelle, and of ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, by reason whereof bicause of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of the ointment, they obteined to be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> (that is to say the annointed). Then folow the wordes, which declare what he meant by the Sacrifices of Christes table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore</hi> (saith he) this prophete <hi>prophecieth vnto the Gentiles of the pleasantnes of wine, secretly signifying the Mysterie of the new Testament of Christe, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly celebrated at this time among al nations.</hi> Thus Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius in that place expounding the prophecies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and of Esay, promising the inebriating Cuppe, and gifte of wine vnto the Gentiles, of the blessed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christes table (which as it is called a table for that the heauenly foode is thence ministred vnto vs, so it is called also an Aulter in respect of the oblation and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice there made and solemnized) doth plainely signifie what he vnderstode by the Sacrifices of Christes table, soothly not the sacrifice of thankes geuing principally, which semeth to the vnlearned to consist onely in wordes, but the Sacrifices of the body and bloude of Christe, and consequently Christe him selfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that place of Eusebius is in my Answer to the Chalenge rightly and aptly to my purpose alleged, as the whiche, proueth against M. Iewel, that the Priest hath auctoritie to offer vp Christe vnto his Father.</p>
               <p>Yet if M. Iewel wil not ceasse to cal for his owne termes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>August. Epist.</hi> 174.</note> not being content with termes equiualent: I thinke good to answer him, as S. Augustine answered Pascentius the Arian crying importunatly for the terme <hi>Homusion</hi> to be shewed him in the Scriptures. <hi>Quid est
<pb facs="tcp:15584:149"/>
contentiosius, quàm vbi de re constat, certare de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?</hi> What is a more contentious parte, then to striue about the name, when the thing it selfe is certainely knowen.</p>
               <p>But now M. Iewel bringeth in S. Augustine, Eusebius, and S. Gregorie Nazianzen, to witnesse with him, that <hi>the ministration of the holy Communion</hi> is called a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, bicause therein thankes and Praises be offered vp vnto God for the Sacrifice made vpon the Crosse.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, that these Fathers can not be shewed so much as once to haue named <hi>the Sacrifice of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Communion,</hi> nor that this <hi>Ministration of the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> is in any of their workes expressely called a Sacrifice. He should haue done wel, if he had made it cleare, what he meaneth <hi>by this holy Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and what by the Ministration of the same. That the Ministration of the Communion is a Sacrifice, I trowe it is a speache neuer heard of in the Churche of God, before these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring prelates came to teache vs a new faith.</p>
               <p>If he vnderstand by the <hi>holy Communion,</hi> the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of the Caluinistes,<note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the nevv holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion made a nevv Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by M. Ievv.</note> which they haue set vp like an Idol in their defourmed churches in place of the blessed Masse, after a diuers manner in diuers Cities, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, according to the diuers fantasies of new Ministers, who daily please them selues with changing what so euer liketh others, in which sorte of Communion there is no substance of any better thing, then of bread and wine, no due consecration made, no oblation, no real Sacrifice, no participation of the true body and bloude of Christe: If this be his meaning, as doubtelesse it is: most certaine it is, those auncient learned Fathers, neuer
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15584:149"/>
spake of it, neuer knewe it: much lesse did they any where call the ministration of it, a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>S. Augustine saith not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Augustin. ad Petru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Diaconu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. cap.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>the ministration of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is a Sacrifice,</hi> which M. Iewel by his wordes taketh vpon him to proue: but, <hi>In this Sacrifice</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is a thankesgeuing, and a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of the flesh of Christe, which he offered for vs, and of the bloude, which the same God did shed for vs. In this Sacrifice,</hi> saith he, he saith not <hi>in the ministration of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion.</hi> What he meant by this Sacrifice, there he sheweth clearely. For hauing said in the beginning of the chapter, that beastes were sacrificed vnto Christe with the Father, and the holy Ghost, by the Patriarkes, Prophetes, and Priestes of the olde Law, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he addeth these wordes. <hi>Cui nunc, id est, tempore No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Patre &amp; Spiritu sancto, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quibus est illi vna Diuinitas, sacrificiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Panis &amp; vini in fide &amp; charitate sancta Ecclesia Catholica, per vniuersum orbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terrae offerre no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cessat.</hi> Vnto whom now, that is to say, in the time of the Newe Testament, with the Father, and the Holy Ghoste, with whom he hath one Godhed, the holy Catholike Church doth not ceasse to offer vp through the whole worlde, the Sacrifice of bread and wine in faith and charitie.</p>
               <p>M. Iewel thought to take aduantage of this place,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of bread and vvine.</note> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Sacrifice is here called the sacrifice of bread and wine, and would nedes this to be taken for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of his new Communion, as though bicause bread and wine is named (which is the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) the body and bloud of Christe were excluded. But this reason is very weake, besides that neither M. Iewel, nor any of the Caluinistes doo vse to cal this sacrifice, the Sacrifice of bread and wine. Neither do they bring
<pb facs="tcp:15584:150"/>
their bread and wine to church to make a sacrifice of it to God, but to distribute it vnto their Congregations. The sacrifice they pretende to make, is of thankes and praises: any outward thing they sacrifice not at al.</p>
               <p>True it is, this Sacrifice is sometimes called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of bread and wine, as in this place, <hi>De Fide ad Petrum Diaconum,</hi> either bicause it representeth in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde formes, bread and wine: or bicause bread and wine are the thinges, whereof of the change it selfe, which perteineth to the nature of a Sacrifice (for so much as it requireth, that the thing that is offered be sanctified by some change) taketh beginning. And as in the olde sacrifices of the Iewes, the Calfe both being yet aliue, was called a Sacrifice, bicause it was that thing, whiche by killing was to be sanctified, and also being killed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the Hoste now sanctified by sacrificing, whiche hoste so many as did eate of, were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the aulter: Euen so in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariste, the bread and wine may be called a Sacrifice, as being the thinges, that by change made of them with consecration are to be sanctified. Therefore in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Canon of the Masse it is said of them, <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices rogamus ac petimus, &amp;c. We humbly pray and beseche thee, that thou accepte, and blesse, these giftes, these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes, these holy Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The body it selfe also, and bloud of Christe conteined vnder the fourme of bread and wine, are called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as being the thinges, into which the holy change by vertue of the wordes of Consecration is made. of which it is said in the end of the Canon: <hi>We offer vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy most honorable Maiestie of thy giftes and benefites,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15584:150"/>
a pure Hoste, a holy Hoste, an vnspotted hoste.</hi> Thus we say, and so the Fathers speake both waies of this Sacrifice, that it is the Sacrifice of breade and wine, that is to say, made of bread and wine (bicause that which was breade and wine is now turned and changed into the body and bloude of Christe) and the Sacrifice of the body and bloude of our Lorde, that is to say, the very true hoste it selfe with a certaine diuine change consecrated and made.</p>
               <p>In other places most commonly it is named of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Oblation or Sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christe, in consideration of the inward substance of the Sacrifice vnder the formes of bread and wine conteined. As S. Augustine writing against <hi>Faustus</hi> the Heretique,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. cont. Faust. lib.</hi> 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ca.</hi> 18.</note> hauing spoken of the manifold Sacrifices of the olde law, and of the Sacrifice of the Crosse, consequently saith, whereby he signifieth, what he vnderstandeth by this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of bread and wine: <hi>I am Christiani peracti eiusdem Sacrificij memoriam celebrant, sacrosancta oblatione, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatione corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi.</hi> The Christians do nowe celebrate the memorie of the Sacrifice of the Crosse past and done, by the holy oblation, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the body and bloude of Christe. So in diuers considerations both these savinges be true, The holy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churche euery where offereth vp to God the sacrifice of bread and wine, and it offereth the Sacrifice of the flesh and bloud of Christe.</p>
               <p>And whereas our daily Sacrifice, which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doo now euery where offer, is the celebration of the memorie of that which was done vpon the Crosse, and therefore oftentimes of the Fathers is named a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
<pb facs="tcp:15584:151"/>
or commemoration, as we finde in Eusebius here also alleged by M. Iewel:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euseb. in Demonst. lib.</hi> 1.</note> the worde <hi>Memorie or comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration</hi> excludeth the truth of passion and death (for now Christe suffereth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> nor dieth no more) the truth, or real presence of the body, which on the Crosse suffered and dyed for vs, it excludeth not. For with and by the holy Oblation and participation of that flesh and bloude (saith S. Augustine) we celebrate the memorie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that was made vpon the Crosse. So that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sacrifice of the Crosse, and of that of the Aulter, is one and the same, the flesh and bloude of Christ: onely the manner of Oblation is diuers. Which if these Gospellers would once confesse, as S. Augustine here witnesseth, and Christes Church hath euer beleeued, and they them selues be not ignorant of: we should not haue neede to write so many bookes, and the worlde should sone drawe to a better quiet.</p>
               <p>As for the two other testimonies alleged out of Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, and S. Gregorie Nazianzen, they prooue not that for which they be alleged, which is, that the Ministration of the Communion is of them called a sacrifice, wherby M.

               <p>Of the falshode of the first point, though I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken somewhat already, yet because M. Iewel ceasseth not to sing one song, and eftsones repeateth the same tale, standing vppon his false Negatiue: some deale more semeth here necessary to be spoken: that it may appeare how cleare the truth is of our side, and how weake the stuffe is, that he bringeth against vs.</p>
               <p>Although he tel not his tale in most distincte, and plaine wise, as this doctrine of the vnbloudy Sacrifice of Christe ought to be vttered, vsing the termes of <hi>Figure,</hi> and Mysterie, confusely: yet his meaning is plaine ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, verely more plaine, then true: Which is, that Christe offered vp him selfe vnto his Father at his laste Supper in Figure onely, and that, concerning both the thing offered, and the manner of offering: For adding as it were an exposition of his owne wordes,<note place="margin">M. Iewels doctrine touching the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> 
                  <hi>In such sorte,</hi> saith he, <hi>as we say, Christe was offered in the Sacrifice of the olde Lawe.</hi> Now certaine it is, that in the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde Lawe Christe was offered in Figure one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether we consider the substance that was offered, or the manner of offering. The substance of those olde Sacrifices, was a brute beast, a sheepe, a calfe, a goat, an Oxe. Of which euery one was but a figure onely of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the manner of offering was slaughter with bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which slaughter was also a figure onely of Christes bloudy death to be suffered vppon the Crosse. So M. Iewels doctrine touching this point is figuratiue on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side, that is to say, that Christe offered vp him selfe at his supper in Figure onely.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Nowe that our disputation fal not into wrangling and cauilles, here he is to be demaunded, what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by this terme, <hi>onely in a Mysterie,</hi> in this Proposition, <hi>Christe was not sacrificed at the Table really, but onely in a Mysterie.</hi>

For at the Table we knowe, he was not stickte with a knife, as the brute beastes in the olde Lawe were, nor let bloude with thornes, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or speare, as he was on the nexte morow vppon the Crosse.</p>

               <p>But what neede we to demaunde of M. Iewel, what he meaneth by his clowdy wordes? No clowde can hyde his Sacramentarie heresie, it is euident, as wel by that he saith here, as by that he hath said and writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, according to the purport of the Caluinists do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (vnto which sect he hath adioyned him self) and by his open profession, that he standeth in his Negatiue, and holdeth opinion, that Christe offered not him selfe really at his last Supper. Now the affirmatiue part, which is, that
<pb facs="tcp:15584:158"/>
Christe offered him selfe at that Supper really, truly, and in dede, and made a real Sacrifice, though it be in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere already proued: yet here further for theire sake, who breake not out of the Churche by their own stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse, and wilful malice, but be lead a syde by simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and ignorance: thus we prooue.</p>
               <p>If Christe offered not vp him selfe really and in dede in a Sacrifice at his last Supper, he leaft his new Lawe in worse state then was the condition of them, who liued in the time of the Lawe of Nature, or in the time of the Lawe written. But in worse state he leafte it not: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he sacrificed him selfe at the Supper truly, really, and in dede.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> or second Proposition is such, as no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man (I iudge) wil deny, or doubte of.

                  </note> by the inspiration of God (as S.

So did Abel offer vp Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God of the best of his flocke.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.</note> So did Noe offer vp Sacrifice of the cleane beastes, that had ben with him in the Arke.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> So Abraham, after that he had (for so much as in him was) offered vp his onely sonne Isaac, did in stede of him sacrifice the Ramme, that was tyed by the hornes among the brambles. So did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iust and good men of that time, offer vp the like sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the same ende.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:15584:158"/>As for the time of the lawe written, who is so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that knoweth not, that real sacrifices of sundry beastes, beside other thinges were commaunded to be offred vp for diuers particular endes, yet al to one chiefe ende, to foresignifie and prefigurate the most perfite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christe to come? Al these sacrifices although offred in a figure, and signification of benefite that then was to come, yet were they real and true sacrifices not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as consisting of real and true substances. And thus we see, that by Gods prouidence in the time of both Lawes, of Nature, and of Moyses, real sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were offred vp vnto him in figure and token of the Redemption to come.</p>
               <p>Now then if Christe leafte to the newe lawe, which he ordeined, no real Sacrifice (a Sacrifice being the chiefest worship that man can do vnto God) but endued it with a sacrifice, that is offred onely in a figure: how did he not leaue it in worse case, then the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the lawe written? And certaine it is, that he leaft it without any such Sacrifice, onlesse he offering him selfe really at his Supper, did beginne and institute it after the order of Melchisedek. For in any time, or place els, instituted, and commaunded, it is not founde. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning inward, and mere spiritual sacrifices, they be common to al times and lawes, as it is before proued.</p>
               <p>If M. Iewel, and the mainteiners of this new Gospel, put vs in mynde of bread and wine, and tel vs, that the substance of bread and wine is our real Sacrifice, being the signes and figures of Christes body and bloud in the Lordes Supper: to that we answer, that bread and wine are not appointed, and ordeined by Christe, to be
<pb facs="tcp:15584:159"/>
the real Sacrifice of the Churche: and if they were, then were the state of the new Testament no better then that of the olde Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whereas the new farre passing the olde in euery degree of worthinesse, as <hi>S.</hi> Paule in sundry places declareth, the Sacrifice frequented in the newe lawe, ought to surmount the Sacrifices of the olde lawe. Then hath the Churche made a very meane exchange with the Iewish Synagog. For if we haue no better substance in our dayly Sacrifice, then a peece of bread and a smal portion of wine: how was not a goate, a lambe, an Oxe, as good, if not better, and more worth?</p>
               <p>Christe hath not so solenderly dealt with the heires of the newe Testament, as to leaue so base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a sacrifice vnto them (base and vnworthy I say, in comparison of the high dignitie, that God through his sonnes death hath called them vnto) but by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and according to his passing great mercy and loue, hath geuen no worse thing then him selfe, to be their true and real Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Some one wil say perhappes, I woulde beleue this doctrine the rather, if it were confirmed with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of an Auncient learned Father. Let vs heare then, what <hi>S.</hi> Chrysostome saith touching this point.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost. in.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Ho.</hi> 24 A cleare testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christe in the Churche.</note> His wordes be these. <hi>In veteri quidem Testamento, cùm imperfectiores essent, quem Idolis offerebant sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, cum ipse accipere volait, vt ab Idolis nos auerteret. Quod etiam inenarrabilis amoris signum erat. Hic autem multò admirabilius &amp; magnificentius facrificium praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, &amp; quum sacrificium commutaret, &amp; pro brutorum caede se ipsum offerendum praciperet.</hi> In the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15584:159"/>
when men were more vnperfecte, Christe him selfe would take that bloude, which they offered vp vnto Idols, to thende to turne them from Idolatrie. Which thing was a signe of an vnspeakeable loue. But here (in the newe Testament) he hath prepared a much more maruelous and honorable Sacrifice, both in that he changed the Sacrifice, and also for that in stede of the slaughter of brute beastes, he commaunded his owne selfe to be offered.</p>
               <p>Here we haue by testimony of this auncient Father, the abolishing of the worse sacrifice, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a better. That was made of brute beastes, this of Christe him selfe. Now consider good Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason wil beare it, that the worse and baser sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should be both real, and also in figure and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (for so were al the Iewes sacrifices) and the better be in figure or mysterie onely, and not real, as M. Iewel wil haue the Sacrifice of the Churche to be.</p>
               <p>But that our Sacrifice is real, and that it is Christe him selfe, and that he is really and in deede sacrificed: the woordes aboue rehersed, and others of the like force in that place of S. Chrysostome doo plainely auouche. For first let this be examined, that, as he saith, <hi>Christe commaunded for the slaughter of brute beastes, now in the new Testament, him selfe to be offered.</hi> Of what Sacrifice can this be meant, but of that which he both made, and instituted him selfe at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and gaue charge to be frequented and done, vntil he come? For as touching the Sacrifice of the Crosse, though he suffered him selfe to be taken, and to be
<pb facs="tcp:15584:160"/>
crucified, and to be offred vp with shedding of bloude vnto death, yet he commaunded not so muche to be done, for then had the wicked workers of his death ben giltlesse.</p>

               <p>If M. Iewel replye, and say, that Christe commaunded at the supper a memory onely to be celebrate of the true and real Sacrifice vpon the Crosse: to that we answer. That this Sacrifice, whereof we speake, is a memorie of that, we confesse: but that it is a memorie onely, so as the real presence of Christ be excluded, that we deny: and to the contrary S. Chrysostome saith, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, <hi>se ipsum, him selfe</hi> to be offred vp.</p>

Iewel shifte the mater from him by expounding this worde, <hi>him selfe,</hi> of the signe or figure of him selfe, meaning the bread and wine, as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries doo: For if that, which is now daily in the Churche offered vp at the Aulter, were but bread and wine, the signes of Christes body and bloude: S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome woulde not, ne could not iustly haue said, that <hi>Christe hath prepared for vs of the newe Testament, multò admirabilius, &amp; magnificentius Sacrificium, a much more maruelous, and honorable Sacrifice.</hi> For how can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a peece of bread, and a cuppe of wine, to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15584:160"/>
of sacrifice, a thing muche more maruelous, and magnificent, or honourable, then a shepe, a goate, and an Oxe, bothe these and those signifying al one thinge, that is, Christe him selfe? Nay thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thinges, are not the beastes of a farre more price?</p>
               <p>I trow M. Iewel wil not set a greater price vpon the bread and wine vsed in this Sacrifice, for that they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a more pretious thing, then the brute beastes did in the sacrifices of the olde lawe, to wit, Christe already come, whereas they signified Christe to come. For so he should diuide Christe, and imagine him to be better and worthier in the newe Testament, then he was in the olde. Verely though redemption perfourmed be to vs better, then redemption promised: yet Christe before and after the perfourmance, that is to say, Christe now come, and then to come, is one Christe, and of one worthinesse.</p>
               <p>It foloweth therefore by al meanes, that either S. Chrysostome said vntruly, affirming Christe to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the new Testament a farre more wonderful and magnificent Sacrifice, then were the sacrifices of the Iewes, whiche I suppose M. Iewel wil not be so shamelesse as to say, what so euer he thinke: or that we haue now in the Sacrifice of the Churche, Christe him selfe, truly, really, and in deede, and that he him selfe is really offred vp vnto his Father by Priestes of the new Testament,<note place="margin">VVitnes for the true and real bloud of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> according to the commaundement he gaue at his supper, saying, <hi>doo ye this in my remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it is the real and true bloude of Christe, which we haue in the Sacrifice of the Aulter, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:15584:161"/>
the real Sacrifice touching the thing sacrificed is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: it is most clearely affirmed by S. Chrysostome in the place before alleged. For thus he speaketh there. <hi>Quid hoc admirabilius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost. in prior. ad Cor. Hom.</hi> 24.</note>

Sed amantes quidem in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijs, vestibus, possessionibus, hanc ostendunt cupiditatem, in proprio sanguine nemo vnquam.</hi> What thing I pray thee, is more maruelous then this? What more louing? (He speaketh of the bloud that is in the chalice, which he saith to be the same that ranne out of Christes syde) This is a thing that louers doo, when they beholde them whom they loue, to be allured with the desire of other mens thinges, and to set litle by theirs: they geue them their owne thinges, and intreate them to absteine from others. But louers shewe this their desire in money, in garmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, in possessions, in his owne bloude no man euer shewed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Figure on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>To proue that Christe loueth vs more, then euer any man loued an other, he saith, that he geueth vs his owne bloude. Which in this place of S. Chrysostome, can in no wise be expounded of the Figure and token of his bloude. For worldly louers geue vnto their beloued as much, and as good a thing as that, namely money, garmentes, their possessions. As for a token or signe of their bloude, or of their persons, it were easy for them to geue. But Christ (saith he) sheweth his loue toward vs, by that whereby no man euer shewed his loue to an other. If the onely token of bloude, might at any time haue declared so certaine and assured loue, louers would
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15584:161"/>
oftentimes haue spared their money, their garmentes, and their possessions: and would haue geuen vnto their dere beloued, the figure of their bloude, or of their whole persons.</p>
               <p>Thus is the true and real presence of Christes bloud, and consequently of his flesh, prooued by witnesse of S. Chysostome. And by the same is that prooued, which we cal the real Sacrifice of the Church. For by that we say Christe to be really offered vp vnto his Father, we meane none other thing, but that the substance, which we offer and sacrifice, is the real body and bloude of Christe. This much therefore may stande for answer to M. Iewels Reply in this place: Christe in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the olde Lawe, was so offred in a Figure, as he was not the substance of them. In the Supper he was, and in the Masse he is so offered, as he is the substance present.</p>
               <p>And bicause this real Sacrifice of Christe, being the Sacrifice of the New Testament, and the worthinesse of it, is much impugned by the enemies of the Churche in our time, yea villanously mocked, skoffed, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at by Antichristes wicked broode:<note place="margin">Reasons, vvhereby the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likes may be armed agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries for defense of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> the godly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques may by these reasons be sufficiently armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
               <p>If it were necessary for the people of the olde Lawe to haue real sacrifices to protest, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their beleefe in Christes Death to come: why is it not as necessary, that the faithful people of the Newe Lawe, haue also a real Sacrifice, to protest and keepe in memorie their beleefe in Christes Death alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy past?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15584:162"/>Againe, as the newe Lawe is better, and excellenter then the olde, so is it necessary it haue a better and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter Sacrifice. But if we take away the Sacrifice of the Reall flesh and bloude of Christe, and leaue onely bread end wine to be offred vp in a figure, or mysterie: then haue we not a Sacrifice proper vnto the new Law, that in worthinesse passeth and excelleth the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde Lawe, as the which consisted of as good a substance, as the other, and signified as good a thing, as the other, and expressed it by slaughter, and shedding of pure and innocent beastes bloude more liuely, then the other.</p>
               <p>Contrarywise let the real body and bloude of Christe be the substanee of the Sacrifice of the new Law (as the truth teacheth saying,<note place="margin">

               <p>To be shorte, how can it be conceiued, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice should be but a figure, a signe, or a mysterie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and no true and real Sacrifice better then the olde sacrifices: sith that by the teaching of al the auncient learned Fathers, it is the truth, and perfourmance of al the olde sacrifices?</p>

let vs now examine M. Iewels argument.<note place="margin">Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of M. Iuels Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> 
                  <hi>As Christe was slaine at the Table</hi> (saith he) <hi>so was he sacrificed at the Table. But he was not slaine at the Table verely, and in dede, but onely in a Mysterie: Therefore he was not sacrificed at the Table, really, and in deede, but onely in a Mysterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christe was then, and is now also at the holy Table, both really sacrificed in respect of his real and true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloude by vertue of the Worde made present, and also in a Mysterie, in respect of the outward formes of bread and wine vnder which they are present, and of the mystical manner of sacrificing. This being true, as before we haue declared, and therefore the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being false: let vs see, which of the Premisses of M. Iewels Argument is false. It is the <hi>Maior,</hi> or first Proposition. If the same be resolued into the partes whereof it consisteth, the vntruth wil soone appeare. The first parte is this. <hi>Christe was slaine at the Table.</hi> That is false. The second is this. <hi>Christe was sacrificed at the Table.</hi> That is true. So that one parte is false, and the other true. And so by this trial, which is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way to trie such kinde of Propositions, the whole Proposition in it selfe is found false, and therefore the Conclusion foloweth not.</p>
               <p>For the better euidence of the thing it selfe, we most gladly acknowledge, and protest to the worlde, that Christe was really and in deede slaine, and put to death once for euer, and neuer shal againe suffer the paines of Death. Yet neuerthelesse he is, and shal to the worldes ende continue, the real and true Sacrifice of the newe Testament, according to his owne merciful Institution at his last Supper. As for the lacke of any

He did then, and we de now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the same body and bloude in consideration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that slaying, and shedding. He offered at the Supper his body, and bloud, that on the morow was to be slaine, and shed: we at the Aulter do stil offer that body, and bloude, that was slaine, and shed, euen the same selfe body, and bloude in number. For, as Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylacte folowing S. Chrysostome saith.<note place="margin">

               <p>In this point therefore this Sacrifice is clearely vnlike the sacrifices of the olde lawe, wherein although beastes of one kinde were offered daily, as for example, this day a lambe, and to morow likewise a lambe: yet it was not one lambe, but diuers lambes. And therfore a new killing and shedding of bloude was daily required. But we doo not offer this day one lambe, to morow an other, but alwaies the selfe same, as S. Chrysostome saith.</p>

the very same, that Melchisedech did, that is to say, bread and wine, as much to say, his owne body and bloude. By these places S. Cyprian declareth his minde plainely, what he meaneth by the bread and wine, that Christe either gaue at the Supper vnto his Disciples, or offered vnto his Father to render thankes for the great benefite of his passion, soothly none other bread and wine, then that which was made by the almighty power of the Woorde, his body and bloude. And behold Reader how vniforme his vtterance is, and how he agreeth with him selfe. In the Sermon <hi>De vnctione Chrismatis</hi> by M. Iewel with false leauing out that whiche made for the truth, alleged, he saith, that <hi>diuers, kindes are reduced into one substance,</hi> in his Sermon <hi>De coena Domini,</hi> he saith, <hi>the bread by the omnipotencie of the Woorde is made flesh,</hi> so bread and flesh being diuers kindes, are brought to one substance. There the <hi>thinges signifying, and the thinges signified,</hi> saith he, <hi>be called with the same names,</hi> as how, I haue before declared. In his Epistle to Cecilius, naming bread and wine, he expoundeth him selfe, thus, <hi>suum sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet corpus &amp; sanguinem,</hi> as much to say, <hi>his owne body and bloude.</hi> Where the body and bloude beare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of bread and wine. By this it is clearly seene, what an impudent and wicked glose is that, which M. Iewel incloseth in his <hi>parenthesis</hi> added by way of exposition vnto the maimed sentence of S. Cyprian, wherewith to exclude the body and bloude of Christe, the true bread and wine.</p>

               <p>Euen so standeth the case betwen that S. Paule saith, and that I say. S.

               <p>The substance of these two Sacrifices being Christe, is al one. The manner of offering, and ende is diuers. That vpon the Crosse,<note place="margin">

The ende of that was to deserue, and purchase the saluation of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15584:167"/>
worlde, by paying a raunsom superabundantly sufficient for the sinnes of mankinde. And that was done once for al. The ende of this, is to commemorate, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the death of Christe vnto his Father, and in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>To proue that Sacrifice made vpon the Crosse and the merites thereof, there neede none other testimonies, then those which haue ben already cited out of S. Paule. Of this, which was offred and instituted at the Supper, of the vnitie of it with the other, and of the effectes of the same, the learned Fathers haue made mention in sundry places. The oblation it selfe, and Institution, and one effecte, S. Cyprian comprehendeth in one sentence.<note place="margin">

               <p>An other effecte of this our Sacrifice, that is, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Christes Passion vnto vs, S. Gregorie doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse saying.<note place="margin">

Augustine, where there is expresse mention of two immolations or sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinges of Christe. S. Augustines wordes be plaine.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>August in. Epist.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne semel oblatus est Christus in semet ipso?

And yet notwithstanding in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament he is sacrificed for the people, (so it is to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, and not <hi>is offered vnto the people,</hi> as M. Iewel fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly translateth it) not only through al the solemne feastes of Easter, but also euery day.</p>
               <p>Why heard you not your selfe M. Iewel, reporting this plaine saying of S. Augustine, that Christe is twise offered? twise (I say) in respect of the manner of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, once openly, <hi>in him selfe,</hi> that is, vpon the Crosse: and againe <hi>in a Sacrament,</hi> after which manner he is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp euery day, whereby the Sacrifice of the Aulter is meant. Christ there, and Christe here is sacrificed, for the substance of both Sacrifices is Christe. Of that you

doubte not, of this you should not doubte, beleuing him, who said, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then we answer your scorneful absurditie. <hi>One and Two,</hi> and <hi>Once</hi> and <hi>Twise,</hi> may thus both be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be said of one thing in this singular Mysterie in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respectes. If <hi>Sacrifice</hi> signifie the thing sacrificed, and also the Acte of sacrificing: then whereas One body and One Christe, was sacrificed, yet the Sacrifices were Two. There haue we One, and Two. Againe Christ was vnbloudely sacrificed at the Supper, and but once bloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Crosse. So he was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of the thing offered or sacrificed, it was One Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, One offering, One Christe. Thus to a faithful man of the Catholike Church, who hath subdued his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding vnto faith, it appeareth sufficiently, how in a due consideration, One, and Two, and Once, and Twise, wherat M. Iewel skoffeth, may both be said of one thing. Thus he is ouertaken, and founde vnable to answer the place of Hesychius, the substance of this Diuision.</p>

Is it not a foolish thing to tel vs, as ye do, that we shed the bloud of Christe, and doo such violence vnto him at the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the Souldiours did at the Crosse?

owne wordes, whiche I make not, and replyeth against it, as if it were myne.

               <p>If I had swarued so farre from truth and reason, as to say, that I being a Priest do offer vp to God the same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which Christe offered vpon the Crosse, and that in the same manner, and to the same effecte and merite, which is to vsurpe the office that is proper to Christe onely: then with some reason he might haue replied, as he doth: that I were <hi>a Priest after the order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, and so the king of Iustice, the Prince of peace, and a Priest for euer without Successour.</hi> Which titles of right belong to Christe onely.</p>

with no simple and plaine dealing, for that I haue not shewed, when, and where, or by what woordes Christe gaue commaundement to make and continue this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

And if it had liked you to haue looked backe, or to haue remembred, what I had said in the: 5. Diuision, you would neuer so without cause haue reprehended me for not telling, when, and where, and by what wordes Christe gaue commaundement to make and continue this Sacrifice. For there euen in the beginning, the time when, the place where, and the woordes by which this Sacrifice was instituded, and commaunded, be plainely expressed. Now therefore that our Commission may so easily be shewed, twite vs no more of great boldenesse, as though we attempted to celebrate so high and so diuine Mysteries without Commission.</p>

For touching the forme, let it be graunted, that <hi>S.</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius had put such a difference, as you imagin, wil it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily folowe, that in the place alleged in my Answer, he maketh not mention of offering Christe vnto his Father? This kinde of reason in any mater is faulty, but in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is most faulty. For albeit the manner of the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Sacrifice made vpon the Crosse, be diuers from that which Christe made at his Supper, and is now continued by the Priestes in the Masse: yet the thing it selfe offred, and substance is al one in both Sacrifices,<note place="margin">

               <p>Touching the mater of the former Argument, it is euidently false. For S. Dionyse in that place treateth not of difference betwene this, and that Sacrifice, as you M.

The sacrifice of praise here I meane, as it is our owne spiritual worke, for otherwise I confesse, the blessed Sacrifice it selfe of the body and bloude of Christe, is also not seldom named the sacrifice of praise, as your selfe haue in this Diuision alleged a place out of <hi>S.</hi> Basils Masse, where it is so called.</p>
               <p>And that S. Dionyse meant not the Sacrifice of praise and thankes, it is cleare, in that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a Sacrifice to be offered, after that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Gods woorkes, and thankes for the same be geuen.</p>

But the praises being once finished, as sone as he commeth vnto the mystical Sacrifice, before he dare to aduenture it, he premitteth his humble sute for excuse to be obteined. What should the cause be, why the Bishop or Priest before the offering of the one Sacrifice maketh no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of his vnworthinesse, and here as he entreth vnto it maketh so humble an excuse: but bicause there is a great difference betwen the excellencie of the one, and the other? In both sacrifices Christes benefites be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, for how can that be praised, that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred? The difference must nedes be in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the thing offred.

Worde it selfe, and whereby Mankinde is redemed. The thirde is, that the Priesthoode after Melchisedeks order remaineth stil, doubtelesse bicause as Christe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth him selfe continually in heauen vnto the Father for vs: so by Priestes of the newe Testament, his Vicars, he offereth him selfe vnto the Father now also in earth vnder the formes of bread and wine, after the order of Melchisedek.

               </p>
               <p>By this it is cleare, that Christe offered vp his body and bloude, before he was betrayd, that is to say, at his last Supper, when he gaue the same to his Apostles, that he instituted, and commaunded the same Sacrifice to be celebrated of vs: That this is the true Sacrifice, whereof Melchisedech in his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice expressed the Image, figure, and type.

And except he had heard, that they had absteined from the wedlocke worcke from the time of yesterday and the day before: he would neuer haue graunted them the breades, which before he had denyed to them. Now so great difference there is betwen the Shewbreades, and the body of Christe, how much difference there is betwen the body, and the shadow, betwen the Image, and the truth, betwen the samplers of thinges to come, and the thinges them selues, which were figured by the samplers.</hi> Thus Isidorus.</p>
               <p>If the thing we haue in the Sacrament of the Aulter, were but a signe, figure, or token of Christes body, then would not this holy and learned Father, as sundry other Fathers haue done, so earnestly haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted maried persons to forebeare their wedlocke-worke before the receiuing of it: yea specially then would not he by comparing this with the Shewbread, so much haue preferred this before that. For that was also a figure of the body of Christe. And if that whiche we haue be no more but a figure, then was that as good as this. Now Isidorus preferreth this before that, as being the body it selfe, whereof that was the shadow, the truth, whereof that was the Image, the thing it selfe, whereof that was a sampler.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15584:189"/>
it foloweth, that they offer vp and sacrifice Christe the Sonne of God vnto his Father. The like, and plainer sayinges for the truth of this Sacrifice, if neede were, might in great number sone be recited out of the other Fathers, that wrote sithens the faith of Christ was generally receiued where it was preached, and al superstition of Gentilitie quite abolished<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which beleefe is, not onely that the pretious body and bloude of our Lorde are of a right beleeuer beholden, and conceiued in the Sacrament verely present, which the Lutherans do acknowledge: but also that the bread and wine are by the power of the holy Ghoste,<note place="margin">Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation</note> into the same conuerted and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

               <p>Here that you be so ful of your Argumentes (which vntruely you father vpon me) and so busy with your Logique, I answer you, as S. Augustine answered Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the Pelagian Heretique dealing with him, as you doo with me, not onely in this place, but in manner in your whole booke. <hi>Quantùm tibi places, tantùm graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Lectoribus displices,</hi>

               <p>If you would needes shewe your cunning in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique, and dispute after the rules of that arte, why rehersed you not the whole Antecedent? Though in this place I frame no Argume at al, but onely recite the saying of S. Dionyse applying it to my purpose:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15584:191"/>
yet if the whole should be disposed in fourme of an Argument, this is the Argument, that thereof might be concluded, the circumstance of the place consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>The Bishop or Priest (by reporte of S. Dionyse) stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the holy Aulter,<note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of S. Dionyse for the Sacrifice.</note> after he hath geuen praises to God for his Diuine workes, commeth vnto the mystical Sacrifice, excusing him selfe for that he taketh vpon him to offer vp the healthful hoste or Sacrifice that is farre aboue his worthinesse, whereof Christe at his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hauing consecrated his body and bloude, said, by way of commaundement and commission,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Doo ye this in my Remembrance</hi>: But this healthful Sacrifice whereof Christ so said, and which he required to be offered, is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his body and bloude vnder the formes of bread and wine: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by witnesse of that Auncient and most worthy Father, the Bishop or Priest, offereth vp Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body and bloude, and consequently Christ him selfe. For where the body of Christe is, there also is whole Christe, bicause of the inseparable vnitie of both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And if Christe be thus offered, to whom is he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, but to the Father? Albeit I confesse, that Christe is offered to him selfe also as being God, and to the holy Ghoste to the whole most blessed Trinitie.</p>
               <p>If you had thus set forth the Argument M. Iewel, and dealt simply and truly, you should not haue needed to trouble the reader with so much Sophistrie and Logique, as here for confutation of your owne forged reason you haue bestowed. Bicause you knewe your selfe not hable to auoide the force of the whole Antecedent, slyly you answer to that parte of it onely, where it is said,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:192"/>
the Priest excuseth him selfe, as though I had layd the chiefe grounde of the authoritie in that clause onely. And thereof you take occasion to enter into a neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse common place, proouing by certaine testimonies, which no man euer denied, that sundry holy thinges are to be done not presumptuously and rashly, but reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and with feare and trembling, as namely when we offer vp the Sacrifice of Praise, when we baptise, when we preache, or heare Gods holy worde, when we pray, and cal God our Father. For the reuerent and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble demeanour that we ought to shewe in doing these holy thinges, you allege S. Basil, S. Dionyse, S. Paule, S. Cyprian.</p>
               <p>But what of al this? wil it thereof folowe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> though the Priest standing at the Aulter, and comming to offer the Mystical Sacrifice, excuse him selfe (not for praying, preaching, praising, or baptizing, but) for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the healthful hoste, that farre passeth his degree, euen the same, that Christe offered at his laste Supper, whereof he said, This is my Body, this is my Bloud, and gaue commission to doo the same: yet he offereth not Christe vnto his Father? This is the iust iudgement of God M. Iewel, that you where you be so busy in scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at other mens good Argumentes, be founde your selfe to frame most fonde and childishe Argumentes, by certaine phrases eluding weighty pointes of Christian Religion, and alwaies impugning one truthe by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truthe, which way of reasoning is of al other the weakest.</p>
               <p>Thus you see good Sir, that I haue not prooued this Sacrifice only by the vnworthinesse of the Priest, as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15584:192"/>
you say, but by other force clearly appearing in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said testimonie of S. Dionyse.</p>
               <p>Of al the authorities, that here to litle purpose you haue alleged, I had thought to touche neuer a one, forasmuche as I yeelde to tbat by the same is reported: had you not too shamefully falsified and corrupted a sentence of S. Gregorie Nazianzen,<note place="margin">M. Ievvel falsifieth and fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted S. Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene.</note> bothe with your false interlaced glose, and by changing the whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte thereof. Thus you make that learned Father to speake. <hi>How can they, or dare they offer vnto God (he saith not the body of Christe really, and in deede, but) the figure of these great Mysteries?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Nowe let vs see S. Gregorie Nazianzens owne woordes. The whole sentence being long, I wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite onely the later ende of it, which aunswereth to your allegation.<note place="margin">S.

                  </gap>? As much to say. Howe shoulde I dare to offer vp vnto him (he meaneth God) the external Sacrifice, that is the sampler of the great Mysteries?</p>
               <p>Compare this, and your owne allegation together, and you shal perceiue your vntrue dealinge and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the sentence to be espied. You haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the firste person singuler, into the thirde person plural. Whiche is an argument, that your selfe neuer saw the place it selfe in the Author, but receiued it of some, that was appointed to gather notes for you such, as you might frame to your purpose. Your Note-gatherer espying as he thought some vantage in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woordes of the Sentence, wrote them out onely, leauing out the beginning, where the pronoune <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15584:193"/>
is expressely founde. And so both you and he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the verbe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which serueth indifferently to the first person singuler, or to the third person plural, you of ignorance, as I suppose, he of malice, specially if he were learned.</p>
               <p>Although this be no litle faulte, yet is it not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test by many partes. For you haue quite hewed away a principal member of the sentence, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to say, the external Sacrifice, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> is there to be supplied. Whereby you shewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that, as you and your companions haue bannished the thing it selfe already out of the Churches of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, so would you gladly also skrape the name and terme out of the bookes of the auncient writers, if by any meanes ye could. For this one clause, <hi>the external Sacrifice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">External Sacrifice.</note> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth al your doctrine against the Sacrifice of the Aulter, and proueth your interlined Glose to be false, and heretical. For if it be an external Sacrifice, it can not be but real, and true, and a Sacrifice in dede.</p>
               <p>The addition that foloweth in S. Gregorie, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is nothing els, but a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what external Sacrifice he spake, to wit, not of that great external and open Sacrifice, which Christe offered vpon the Crosse, but of the true sampler of the same. Which is the external Sacrifice of the Churche, made by the ministerie of the Priest vpon the Aulter, one with the other in substance, but diuers in the manner of offering, as we are driuen by your affectate and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ignorance oftentimes to say.<note place="margin">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15584:193"/>
againe, it were superfluous.</p>
               <p>Now I require thee to iudge indifferently gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether M. Iewel be to be accompted a true and a faithful dealer in these weighty causes concerning our faith, and whether he be not worthy to be suspected, who hath so fowly falsified and corrupted this auncient and learned Father, by changing one person into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one number into an other, by altering the true sense with his heretical <hi>parenthesis,</hi> and by maiming the whole sentence with his cutting away of a principal member.</p>
               <p>In the ende M. Iewel to leaue in the Readers mynde an opinion of his skil in Logique,<note place="margin">A nevv fallacie di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uised by M. Iewel.</note> which is knowen to be very smal, repeating againe the former Argument of his owne forging, and falsly ascribed vnto me, saith: <hi>It is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax à meris particularibus,</hi> a kind of fallacie of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, vnknowen to Aristotle, and to al that haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> since of deceitful Argumentes. For al skilful Logicians do knowe, that of two premisses being both particular, a good argument may be concluded, although it be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in any of the three perfite Figures. And if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be not faulty for this cause, yet it procedeth (saith he) <hi>A non distributo ad distributu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Wel, if it so procede and therefore be naught, let him selfe amende it, that made it. As for my grounde, it resteth vpon the authoritie of S. Dionyse the blessed Apostle S. Paules scholer.</p>
               <p>An other faulte in this Argument, is founde contrary to the rules of Logique,<note place="margin">Beholde reader the rare cunning this man hath in Logique.</note> for that it concludeth (saith this great Logician) affirmatiuely in the second Figure. What Sir? Haue you forgoten your selfe so quickly? Said you not in the line before, it was <hi>ex meris particularibus?</hi> If it be so, then is it neither in the first, nor second, nor third
<pb facs="tcp:15584:194"/>
Figure. So that either the first faulte is none, and this later one: or this later none, and the first one, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neither this, nor that any at al. Beside this it is an <hi>Enthymema,</hi> consisting onely of two propositions. And then if it were myne Argument, how knowe you to what Mode and Figure, by a litle displacing of the termes, I were hable to reduce it vnto, if it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed?</p>
               <p>Thus I abuse thy leisure gentle Reader with stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppon these trifles. But I trust, thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how farre I was enforced thereunto by M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els trifling in an ernest mater.<note place="margin">

And thus standeth S. Dionyses saying in his ful force.</p>

it had beene no Newe Oblation, for suche had beene made by Melchisedech longe before.

               <p>If this Argument be good, that here you make, S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus not once nameth the Masse, nor real Oblation of the Sonne of God vnto his Father, <hi>Ergo,</hi> by him the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Churche can not be auouched: why may not this also be as good: Not one of the foure Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes saith expressely, that Christe offered or sacrificed him selfe vpon the Crosse, nor once nameth that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christe: <hi>Ergo</hi> Christe was not sacrificed for vs vpon the Crosse? If this Argument shalbe taken for good, then haue the Arians ouercomme. For if the Churche shalbe driuen to shewe letters, syllables, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15584:196"/>
termes: neither can we finde the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantialitie of the Sonne of God with the Father, nor the Procession of the holy Ghoste from the Father and the Sonne, nor certaine other great pointes of our Faith, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being reueled to the Churche by the holy Ghoste the spirite of truth, and declared by the expositions of the holy Fathers, we are bounde to beleue vnder paine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal damnation.</p>
               <p>Knowing your selfe ouerborne with the force of this plaine testimonie of S.

To this you make no directe Answer, but slily carye away the reader vnto the saying of Malachie, whereof I haue treated before. I vrge you with S. Irenaeus, and you

shooting wide of the marke make answer to the place of Malachie, whose saying is not in this place principally obiected, but brought in by the way as it were, by Saint Irenaeus, interpretinge the pure Sacrifice by him mentioned, of the Newe Oblation of the Newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The olde learned Fathers</hi> (you say) <hi>neuer vnderstoode so much.</hi> So much? What so muche meane you? That the Oblation of Christes body and Bloud, is, <hi>the new Oblation of the New Testament,</hi>

                  <hi>which Christ taught his Disciples, which the Church receiued of the Apostles, and now offereth vp vnto God through the whole wrrlde,</hi> as S. Irenaeus saith? Did the Fathers neuer vnderstand this much? What say you then to S. Irenaeus, who vnderstoode so much, as by his wordes it is cleare? What is this, but to set the holy Fathers at variance with S. Irenaeus?</p>
               <p>Yet you wil needes seme to vnderstande the Sacrifice that Malachie spake of, of Preaching, of a Contrite hart, of Prayer, of Praise, and thankesgeuing. For credite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you allege Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, S. Hierom, and S. Augustin. Wel, what if it be so? What answer is that to S. Irenaeus? As for the place of Malachie, as I said before, it is past, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. Certainly it can not be vnderstanded of the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans hart, for of lacke therof he complaineth not, but of polluted sacrifices. Againe the purenes of mans harte, commonly is not so great, as therfore, the name of God, should so much be magnified. And the same was in many Iewes then, no lesse then it is in the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now.</p>
               <p>To that you bringe out of Tertullian, and S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, concerning what is meante by the Pure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in Malachie, you haue myne answer before in

               <p>To prooue that Malachie by the pure Sacrifice meant not the Sacrifice of the Aulter, you bringe in S. Martialis <hi>ad Burdegalenses,</hi> whom you cal one of myne owne newe founde Doctours. If you contemne him, why doo you allege him? Wil you shunne his auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and yet craue helpe of him? If I would vse your owne Rhetorique, here might I say, what toole is so bad, that Maister Iewel wil not occupie,<note place="margin">M.

Of what authoritie so euer he be, once this is true, in your translation you haue fowly falsified him, by putting in woordes of your owne forgerie. For he speaketh nothing at al of Malachie, nor in that place once nameth him. Whose name you added of your owne vnto the sentence out of him alleged, to vnderproppe your weake and ruinous building with al.</p>
               <p>In that Epistle <hi>ad Burdegalenses,</hi> S. Martialis vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth by <hi>Ara Sanctificata,</hi> one Special Aulter, that in the Citie of Burdeaulx was consecrated in the name of GOD, and S. Steuen. Which Aulter being in olde time dedicated to an vnknowen God, he at the ouerthrowe of Idols Aulters there caused to be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued whole, and him selfe halowed it. This much is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Epistle it selfe. And as you haue falsified your Doctor with putting in stuffe of your owne to the
<pb facs="tcp:15584:198"/>
beginning of the sentence, so haue you corrupted him much worse, with cutting away from the middest the hinder parte.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Martialis Epistol. ad Burdegal.</hi>
                  </note> For these be his wordes, <hi>Nec solùm in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra sanctificata, sed vbique offertur Deo oblatio munda, sicut testatus est, cuius corpus &amp; sanguinem in vitam aeternam offerimus.</hi> Neither onely vpon the halowed Aulter, but euery where is the cleane oblation offered vp vnto God, as he hath witnessed, whose body and bloude we offer vp to life euerlasting. And what is that Christ hath wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed? for of him he speaketh. That Priestes should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp his body and bloude in euery countrie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> saying, <hi>Do this in my Remembrance.</hi> This serued not your purpose, and therefore you hewed it away.</p>
               <p>

S. Martialis speaketh of two kindes of Oblations. The one is offered vp in spirite only. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mysterie and in the Sacrament. The spiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is offered vp not only vpon a sanctified Aulter, but also euerywhere. But the mystical and Sacramental ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is of the body and bloud of Christe, is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp only vpon a consecrated Aulter, bicause thereon is the real presence of the same. And of that kinde of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in that very place which you haue so fowly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, he saith thus. <hi>Christ hauing a body both vnspotted, and without synne, bicause he was conceiued of the Holy Ghoste, and borne of the virgin Marie, permitted it to be sacrificed on the Aulter of the Crosse. And the same thing which the Iewes sacrificed through enuie, thinking so they should abolish his name quite out of the earth, we set forth vppon the halowed Aulter for cause of our health, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by this onely remedie life is to be geuen vnto vs, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15584:198"/>
death to be driuen away. For our Lorde him selfe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs, to doo this in remembraunce of him.</hi> By this it is made cleare, that if you wil stand to the authoritie of S. Martialis, you must recant your Chalenge denying the Priestes to haue power and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission to offer vp Christe vnto his Father.</p>
               <p>Vpon the false construction you make of S. Martialis, you procede, as if it were the Gospel that you said. But your grounde being false (for neither once there nameth he Malachie, and of the Sacrifice he speaketh plainely) al likewise is false, that you buylde thereon, or conclude thereof.</p>
               <p>S. Augustine (say you) calleth the same Sacrifice (whereof Malachie speaketh) <hi>Sacrificiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Laudis,</hi>

And that it should appeare, you allege him truly, you haue by your cotation in the margent, directed your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto two places. But in those places S. Augustine calleth it, <hi>Sacrificium Laudis,</hi> the Sacrifice of praise onely: as for the Sacrifice of thankesgeuing, it is of your owne putting in, S. Augustine there doth not once name it. The mater is not great: yet your vntruth is to be noted. How be it what should I note this? There is in manner nothing by you in any place alleged, which more or lesse by your crafte of falsifying, you haue not altered and corrupted.</p>
               <p>And though S. Augustine cal the pure Sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of by Malachie, <hi>the Sacrifice of Praise,</hi> what conclude you thereof? <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not the Sacrifice of the body and bloude of Christe? Thus you must conclude, for els it serueth you to no purpose. This being your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, you shew vs as good Logique, as if one shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:15584:199"/>
thus prooue your ring not to be golde. This ring is metal, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not golde. For as metal is general to gold, syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, brasse, and to other thinges of that kinde, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth them within his generalitie, so as the Argument is foolish, which from the affirmation of the general, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the denial of the special: No whit wiser, nor of better force is your reason, <hi>This Sacrifice by reporte of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, is the Sacrifice of Praise, Ergo, it is not the Sacrifice of the Body and bloud of Christe.</hi> For the Sacrifice of Praise is general to al those Sacrifices,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Praise, hovv ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral it is.</note> by which the name of God is praised, and is not only the Praise of God, that is vttered by wordes proceeding out of our mouthe. And God is praised by no other thing so much, as by this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice, representing the oblation of Christe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Crosse. And S. Augustine him selfe writing vpon the .49. Psalme, calleth the liberal almose of Zachaeus, who said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.</note>

                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>So then M. Iewel, what you bring here out of S. Augustine, disprooueth nothing at al the Doctrine of the Catholique Churche, concerning that we cal the Sacrifice of the Body and Bloude of Christe celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Masse, whereof Saint Irenaeus so plainely speaketh, that you not beinge hable to auoide the force of his cleare woordes, are fayne to shifte your

               <p>Concerning the Sacrifices of our deuotion (say I in my Answer) that be mere spiritual, they can not truly be called the newe oblation of the new Testament, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were offered vp to God in the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as now they be in the newe. By this M. Iewels shifte is quite auoided, who hath nothing to answer to this place of S. Ireneus reporting Christe, after that he had consecrated his body and bloude, to haue taught vs the newe oblation of the newe Testament, but that it is the pure sacrifice that Malachie speaketh of, that is to say, a contrite harte, or preaching of the Gospel, or prayer, or praise, and thankesgeuing, or, he can not tel what. <hi>This obiection</hi> (saith M.

               </p>
               <p>No No, M. Iewel, it controlleth the olde Fathers nothing at al. It controlleth our yong Fathers, such as you, and your felowes be, who haue most rashly, most vnlearnedly, most wickedly, and Antichristlike, aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out of the Churches of England, the most blessed Sacrifice of the body and bloude of Christe, and now being vrged and pressed with this manifest place of this Auncient and learned Father, who affirmeth it so clearely, ye haue not what to answer. Your whole booke of Replie conteineth nothing in effecte, but wyly sleightes, vaine shiftes, shamelesse lyes, and fowle corruptions of the Doctours, and Councels, aboue al measure.

               <p>Yet you wil not geue ouer,<note place="margin">Irenaeus corrupted by M.

                  <hi>Oblationes hî,c Oblationes illic. &amp;c.</hi> The head of the sentence you haue lopped of. This is the whole. <hi>It is the kinde of Oblations, that is reiected: for ther were Oblations both there</hi> (among the Iewes) <hi>and ther be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations also here. There were sacrifices among that people, there be sacrifices in the Churche. But the Kinde</hi> (or forme) <hi>is changed onely, for somuch as they be not bonde men that offer now, but freemen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What conclude you of al this M. Iewel? What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this against the real Sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christe? Mary say you, Thus answereth Irenaeus to my Obiection. What was my Obiection? This is that I said in effect, as is before rehersed, that the mere spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sacrifices of our deuotion, can not truely be called the New Oblation of the New Testament, bicause they are common to them of both Testamentes. How say you, is not this true? And what haue you to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in this saying of S. Irenaeus?</p>
               <p>The kinde, or forme of their, and our sacrifices, is changed, you wil say perhaps. I graunt this much: albe it S. Irenaeus referreth this change, not to the sacrifices, but to the offerers: bicause the olde people of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagog were bonde men, and we of the Churche are free men. But let it be, as you would haue it. Who
<pb facs="tcp:15584:204"/>
vnderstandeth not the kinde of sacrifices to be changed, for that they killed brute beastes, according to Moyses Lawe, and we kyl them not, as not being vnder that Lawe? But what? Wil you of this conclude, that they offered not vp vnto God the Sacrifices of a contrite harte, of prayers, of praise and thankesgeuing, and such other spiritual sacrifices, bicause they offred vp beastes, and bicause we now offer these? I trowe by that time you haue bethought your selfe, you wil not stande in it. For, be not the Psalmes, and the sermons of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ful of exhortations, to this ende, that these spiritual oblations should be made, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whereas they were to be done, wil you say, there were none, that did them? wil you say, the holy kinges, and Prophetes had not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hartes, prayed not, nor praised, ne thanked God? I suppose you wil not say it. To what purpose then pyked you out the former saying of S. Irenaeus? What maketh it for you? what maketh it against vs?</p>

But in respecte of those, which are mere spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrifices, of which onely M. Iewel wil Malachie to be expounded, as of a contrite harte, of prayer, of praise,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:207"/>
and thankesgeuing, Malachie can not seme repugnant to Moyses, bicause Moyses neuer forbad them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrifice that Malachie speaketh of, is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed of mere spiritual sacrifices.</item>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The .2. Conclusion. Malachies prophecie is of such a Sacrifice after the mynde of S. Chrysostome, as the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration whereof should abandon, and quite put away the Priesthoode, and Sacrifices of the Iewes. But the mere spiritual Sacrifices of our deuotion, whereto only M. Iewel draweth the prophecie of Malachie, haue not that power and effecte. For they continued with their Sacrifices, as they do with ours: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Malachie is not to be vnderstanded of the mere spiritual Sacrifices.</item>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The .4. Conclusion. The Sacrifice that Malachie prophecied of, S. Chrysostom saith it is such, as is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what it is, by the manner of it. But a thing can not be declared what it is by the manner, onlesse the manner be external, and sensible, so as it may be perceiued by

                     <item>The .5. Conclusion. Malachie by the exposition of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> S. Chrysostome speaketh of that Sacrifice, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is <hi>Nostrum,</hi> that is to say, ours, belonging to vs, that be of the newe Testament. But the Sacrifice of a contrite harte, of Praiers, Praise, and thankesgeuing be theirs of the olde Testament, as wel as ours: <hi>Ergo,</hi> of that kinde of Sacrifice he spake not.</item>
                     <item>That I make an ende of Conclusions, the sixth and last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Conclusion may be this. By interpretation of S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, the Sacrifice that Malachie prophecied of, is pure in the most excellent degree of purenesse. But the spiritual Sacrifices proceeding from the harte of man, be not pure in the highest degree of purenesse: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is an other kinde of Sacrifice, which Malachie foretolde.</item>

What can you name, but the vnbloudy Sacrifice of his body and bloude? For if you name vs the mere spiritual sacrifices of deuotion, as Prayer, Praise, Thankesgeuing, or any such other the like: you must remember, Christe did not first of al sacrifice the same.

               <p>Here I needed not to procede further in this Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, my Answer to the Chalenge being so sufficiently iustified touching the vnbloudy Sacrifice, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prooued by S.

               <p>Where as S. Cyprian saith plainely, <hi>Christe is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> (meaning the substance of the Sacrifice celebrated at the Supper and now at the Aulter) he willeth me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>the Rocke was Christe.</hi> I say to M. Iewel eftsones, it may please him to remember, that S. Augustine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth him selfe immediatly in the next sentence, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Petra Christus in signo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Rocke vvas Christe.</note> The Rocke was Christe in a signe, that is to say, the Rocke was not Christe in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and in deede, but signified Christe. If he intende thus to conclude, as the Replie semeth to reporte, As the Rocke was Christe, so Christe is the Sacrifice: but the Rocke was not Christe in deede: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Neither Christe is the Sacrifice: If he make this Argument, I denie his <hi>Maior,</hi> or first Proposition. For the Rocke was Christe in signe onely, but Christes body and bloud Really made present, by the almighty power of the Worde, is in deede the substance of the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Sacrifice.

whereas M. Iewel maketh his colourable aduantage by making Sacrifice the nominatiue case to the verbe in this saing of S.

For els hauing mencioned the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Melchisedech, which consisted of bread and wine, he would neuer haue said these wordes, <hi>Quam rem perficiens &amp; adimplens Dominus panem &amp; calicem mixtum vino obtulit,</hi>

Cyprian speaketh) offered not a true Sacrifice of his body and bloude in deede, and therefore a true and real Sacrifice, vnder the formes of bread and wine, but onely a signe and figure, or an Image representing his body and bloude: How then was he the fulnesse? How did he fulfil the truth of the forefigured Image? For if al were but a signe and token,<note place="margin">Fulnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Cyprian should make the Sacrifice of Christe at his Supper, no better then that of Melchisedech was, and, which is absurde, the truth of a forefigured image should be but a figure, and fulnesse should be voide of the thing fulfilled.</p>

Let vs heare, how you are hable to prooue it. O say you, it must needes be true. For we finde it so written by M. Iohn Foxe in his great booke of <hi>Actes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes.</hi> Why Sir dare you so constantly auouche this facte onely vppon the reporte of Foxe? As though he had not tolde vs in his false Martyrologe, a thousand mo lyes then this? I pitie you M. Iewel, that craking so muche of antiquitie, and appealing continually to the Fathers of the six hundred yeres, you are now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to stay your credite vppon Foxe, who hath into that Huge volume infarced lyes, moe in number, and notabler for vanitie, then euer were raked together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any one heape, or booke.<note place="margin">This fable by report of Foxe vvas founde, not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but probable.</note> Wel, if al were false, that here you tel, then haue you loste a ioily tale. Foxe him selfe reporteth, when Commissioners in London vpon a complaint examined the mater, that it was founde but probable. And probable he meaneth in the iudgement of them, who gladly finde fault with al that was done touching the punishment of heresie in Queene Maries reigne. Now the thing (if any such thing were done at al) being so Notorious, so openly executed, so fewe yeres then past since it was doone, so many men yet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that would haue ben present at the examination in case they had bene commaunded, the charges of the iourney from Garnesey (where it is said to haue bene
<pb facs="tcp:15584:243"/>
done) to London being borne, and could haue brought true witnesse, neuerthelesse to be founde but probable: I weene, it wil not to any wise man appeare very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                  <p>How be it let the Fable be a Storie, and the same be taken for true,<note place="margin">Of the vvoman of Garn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis childe falli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g out of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the fire</note> according as Foxe doth describe it to the aduantage, and as you M. Iewel report it: That in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesey three wemen, that is, the mother, and her twoo daughters were burnt, and that one of the Daughters was with childe, and the childe issued from her wombe being riued with the fier, and was consumed together with the fier. What of al this? In whom was the faulte, in the officer, that tooke not the childe out of the fier, or in the vnnatural mother, that brought it into the fier? In the Storie there is mention made of a childe, and of the mother, but of the childes Father, there is no woorde spoken. It appeareth very credible, that the historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was a shamed to name the childes Father, least so he should haue defaced the glorie of the mothers Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For I would faine know who was the husband to the daughter. M. Fox doth not expresse it.</p>
                  <p>But you wil say, how so euer the childe was begotten, the mother being in that case should haue bene by no Law, iustice, or reason committed vnto the fier. True it is, a woman in that case may for once claime the benefite of her belly. Mary I haue heard Lawiers say, that if whiles she is in prison, she play the strompet againe, by Lawe the iudge may denie her the benefite of her belly, and geue sentence of death vpon her. But as for your pratteling parrat Paratine (for so was her name as M. Fox registreth her) it was not knowen to the Iudge,<note place="margin">Paratine of Garne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey.</note> that she was with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15584:243"/>
childe. Had it bene knowen, doubtelesse her death had bene differred vntil she had ben brought on bed. But the honest woman, bicause she would not shame the Gospel, keping it priuy from the Magistrates, claimed not the benefite of the Lawe, and so now not only like an harlot or Heretique, but like a Murtherer went desperatly to the fier, and murdered bothe her selfe, and her childe conceiued within her. So farre the Deuil carrieth them, whom he possesseth, and leadeth at his wil. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable facte God by his most iust iudgement reueled, to the condemnation bothe of her, and of the cause for which she dyed, by suffering the childe to fal from her wombe, in the sight of al that stoode by.</p>
                  <p>Iudge now discrete Reader, to whom redoundeth the blame of the crime, whether to the Ministers of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, who not knowing the thing, executed the Lawe: or to the woman, that for auoiding a worldly shame, conceeling her owne turpitude, became a murtherer of her owne babe, before it came to perfection. So that she died gilty of three heinous crimes, of heresie, lecherie, and murther. And to these thefte may be added for the fourth. For it appeareth by the tale, that Foxe him selfe to her best estimation telleth of her, that she was a thefe, as being accessorie to the honest woman Vincent Gosser, that stole a siluer gobblet. If the mater were wel exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I doubte not she would be tried an honest woman, and a fitte vessel to receiue the glorie of these newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented Martyrdomes.</p>

               <p>How so euer it like you to scorne at our stoare, the multitude of cleare testimonies for proufe of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to the learned can not be vnknowen. Were it so that ye had but one making so directly against it, as these two here, and sundry others in this Article by me alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged make for it: ye would haue made no smal stoare of it. In bookes and pulpites, in tauernes and alebenches, your trompettes long er this should haue proclaimed it. As for these two places, let vs see, how your sclender Replie is farre to light, so to carry away the weight of them.</p>
               <p>First touching S. Chrysostome, with what plainer termes, with what more effectual wordes could any man haue expressed the truth of our Sacrifice?<note place="margin">That Priestes haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie to offer vp Christ vnto his Father.</note> If we that be Priestes, offer vp now also the selfe same hoste, which our Bishop Christe hath offered vpon the Crosse, euen that hoste which <hi>cleanseth vs from our sinnes,</hi> as S. Chrysostome saith: that being none other but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious flesh and bloud of Christ, that is to say Christe him selfe (for he offered him selfe to his Father to cleanse vs) how haue not Priestes auctoritie to offer vp Christ vnto his Father, which is the expresse Article that you denye? That euery simple man may haue in readinesse an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against such false teachers for the Sacrifice,<note place="margin">An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned to prooue the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> thus for their sake, it may be framed. Who so euer do offer vp the selfe same hoste, which Christ hath offered, they offer vp Christe. The Priestes offer the same that Christe offered: Ergo they offer vp Christe. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident in it selfe, the <hi>Minor</hi> is S. Chrysostomes, the Argument being
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15584:249"/>
good, the Conclusion must needes be true.</p>
               <p>That it may the better appeare of what force M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels Replie is,<note place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined vvith the Replie of M. Ievv.</note> this much is to be considered: That in this place of S. Chrysostome consisting of two partes, two thinges are auouched. In the first parte, he geueth vs his witnesse for the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this Sacrifice, which Priestes do now offer in the Churche. In the second parte he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth one ende, wherein the Sacrifice offered by Priestes, doth differ from the Sacrifice offered by Christ him selfe. <hi>Christ our Bishop</hi> (saith he) <hi>offered the cleansing hoste.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Heb. Hom.</hi> 17.</note>

                     </gap>oste in commemoration.</hi> Which is as much to say, The ende of the Sacrifice that Christe offered, was to cleanse vs from our synnes. The ende of the Sacrifice that is done by Priestes, is to renewe daily the memorie of this cleansing Sacrifice, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to deriue and apply vnto the deuoute and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, as also vnto them selues, the fruit and effecte of it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Epist. ad Heb. Hom.</hi> 17.</note> The identitie of the substance, of either Sacrifice, and the diuersitie of the ende of either Sacrifice, is plainely taught by S. Chrysostome in that Homilie.</p>
               <p>Now let vs examine your Replie.<note place="margin">Three thinges attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. Chrysost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by M. Ievv.</note> You attribute vnto <hi>S.</hi> Chrysostome for hauing vttered the saying that I here allege, three thinges. The first is, that <hi>in these wordes</hi> (marke Reader what this man saith) <hi>He openeth him selfe.</hi> The second is, that <hi>he sheweth in what sense other auncient Fathers vsed this worde, Sacrifice.</hi> The third is, that <hi>he ouerthroweth M. Hardings whole purpose touching the Sacrifice.</hi> Surely this is very much, and were it also true, I maruel why neither your selfe, nor any of your felowes euer heretofore alleged it against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. But certaine we are, ye shal wring hard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:15584:250"/>
ye wring this muche out of these wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hovv S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him selfe against M. Iewel.</note>That in these wordes he openeth him selfe, I may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily graunt you. But that opening is openly against your open Sacramentarie heresie. For whereas you denie the oblation and Sacrifice of the Church, he saith, that now also we offer. whereas you denie, that we offer Christe to the Father, he saith, <hi>we offer now also the selfe same hoste, which our high Bishop Christe, hath offered.</hi> And to put it out of doubte, what hoste he meaneth, he openeth him selfe, as you say, calling it, <hi>hostiam mundantem nos,</hi> the hoste that cleanseth vs, which can be none other, but Christe him selfe. And bicause the hostes that were offered in sacrifice in the olde lawe, were forthwith consumed, to shewe the excellencie of this hoste, he saith of it, that being then, that is to say, vpon the Crosse, offered, it can not be consumed. And therefore in the same Homilie he saith, that it is otherwise with vs now, then it was with the Iewes. For they on diuers daies offered diuers lambes. <hi>but we</hi> (saith he) <hi>offer not one lambe to day, and an other lambe to morowe, but alwaies we offer one, and the same lambe.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom returned vpon M. Ievvel.</note>Touching the second point, if in these wordes (let them be consideratly perused) S. Chrysostome shewe, in what sense other auncient Fathers haue vsed this woorde, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> then by the auncient Fathers your doctrine touching the truth of Christes body in the blessed Sacrament,<note place="margin">M. Ievv. ouershot him selfe in alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this place of S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom.</note> is quite ouerthrowen. For he calleth it most expressely, <hi>the Hoste that cleanseth vs from our sinnes, which Christe our high Bishop offered vp for vs vppon the Crosse.</hi> If the auncient Fathers, when so euer they speake of the hoste that is offered
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15584:250"/>
vp by Priestes in the Sacrifice of the Churche, meane thus, as S. Chrysostome speaketh, then are they of our side by your owne confession, then is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctrine concerning the Sacrament, and the Sacrifice, by them against your heresie confirmed, and mainteined. God be praised, by whose prouidence the Truth is confessed, by the ennemies of Truth. Certainely here you ouershote your selfe, in telling the truth against your selfe vnwares.</p>
               <p>Here then I shal aduertise the Christian Reader, to beare these wordes of <hi>S.</hi> Chrysostome in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to consider wel of them, for so much as in them he openeth him selfe, as Mayster Iewel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, and sheweth what meaning the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had, when they spake of the Sacrifice of the Churche.</p>
               <p>But how in these wordes he ouerthroweth my purpose touching the Sacrifice, or rather the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal Doctrine of the whole Churche, that neither I, nor M. Iewel him selfe, nor any other man. I am sure,<note place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome maketh directly for the real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> can perceiue. In, these wordes, I say whiche be here alleged in my Answer to the Chalenge. Nay, how can they not seme most plainely, and directly to auouche our doctrine touching the Sacrifice? Doth he not set Christe, and Priestes that be now, together in the office of offering? <hi>He hath offered, we offer also now,</hi> saith he. Doth he not auouche the hoste, that Christ offered, and the hoste that Priestes now offer (for thereof he speaketh) to be one, and the selfe same hoste? And that no man should doubte, what hoste he meant, saith he not, <hi>it is that, which cleanseth our sinnes</hi>? that, <hi>which
<pb facs="tcp:15584:251"/>
then being offered</hi> (to witte, vpon the Crosse with shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloude, with death, to cleanse synnes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme the worlde) <hi>can not be consumed</hi>? What hoste can this be, but the body of Christ, but Christe him selfe? For nothing could cleanse our synnes, but he, who onely is <hi>the Lambe of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that taketh a way the synnes of the worlde.</hi> Thus then the substance of the hoste, that Christe our Bishop offered, and of that we offer, is one, and the selfe same. So it is clearely proued by these wordes of S. Chrysostome, that it is not onely a memorie, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a similitude, a figure, or resemblance of Christes body, that we offer in our daily Sacrifice, but the selfe same hoste in substance, that Christe offered to cleanse vs, which is the substance of his owne body and bloud, for it was not a figure that he offered for vs, but his true and real bodye.</p>
               <p>But as the substance of his, and our Sacrifice is one, so the ende and effecte by S. Chrysostome in this place,<note place="margin">The ende of Christes Sacrifice, and of ours.</note> is diuers. He offered him selfe to death to cleanse the synnes of the worlde, to redeme mankinde. We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him in remembrance of that his death, to be partakers of his redemption. But hereof I speake more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in my preface before this Roioindre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Chrysostome (say you) <hi>remoueth al doubte, and declareth in what sorte and meaning we offer the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> How so good sir, tel it vs, I pray you, for I accompt it wel worth the learning. Mary (say you) <hi>he saith not, as M. Harding saith, we offer vp the Sonne of God vnto his Father, and that verely, and in deede.</hi> First it is a strange thing to me, that a man should remoue al doubtes, and declare the certaintie of thinges, by not saying, as you
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15584:251"/>
replye. Nexte, what if he say not in expresse termes, that we offer vp the Sonne of God vnto his Father? Wil you now go from the matter, and flie for refuge to your owne precise termes?</p>
               <p>Consider, I praye you, how this vaine wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling becommeth the Person of the Great Minister of Sarisburie.<note place="margin">M. Iewels obiection is but a vaine vvran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.</note> Whereas S. Chrysostome saith, that <hi>we offer vp the selfe same Hoste, that Christe our Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop hath offered, which cleanseth vs from our synnes,</hi> is it not as muche, as if he had said, <hi>we offer vp the Sonne of God</hi>? What hoste is that which cleanseth vs? Is it not Christe onely? Who is Christe? Is he not the Sonne of God? And to whom is Sacrifice done, but to God? Al this set together, how much varieth he from S. Chrysostome, who saith, that we offer vp the Sonne of God vnto his Father? If you sticke to that other worde, <hi>verely, and in deede,</hi> remember, you haue by your translation, made S. Chrysostome in this very place, so to speake your selfe. <hi>We offer in deede,</hi> be the wordes.</p>
               <p>Now that you haue tolde vs, what S. Chrysostome saith not, which helpeth your cause nothing at al: you shewe vs what he saith. And here you bring in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peeces, and maimed sayinges out of him, being a fraid to allege the whole sentences, as they lye in that learned Doctor, least you should marre altogether, as you should haue done, if you had suffered him to tel his owne tale. Bicause the place is somewhat long, I had rather referre the Reader vnto the .17. Homilie vpon the Epistle to the Hebrewes, where it is written, then here to reherse the whole.
<pb facs="tcp:15584:252"/>
But let vs see, what you pike out of that Homilie for your purpose,<note place="margin">M. Iuels promise vpon S. Chrysost. hovv it is ꝑformed</note> and how much it relieueth your cause. Remember what you haue promised to shewe out of S. Chrysostome, <hi>that he remoueth al doubte, and declareth in what sorte and meaning we offer the Sacrifice.</hi> You allege out of the said <hi>Homilie,</hi> foure sentences, or rather foure peeces of sentences.</p>
               <p>The first is this. <hi>Offerimus quidem &amp;c. We offer in deede,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost. Hom.</hi> 17. <hi>in epist. ad Heb.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but in remembrance of his Death.</hi> These wordes by your interpretation declare in what sorte we offer the Sacrifice. Wel, be it so, I wil not muche contende with you, so that you meane by this sorte, the excluding of the bloudy manner of oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But here I must put the reader in mynde, what foloweth immediatly in that auncient Father. Whiche you haue vntruly conceeled. <hi>Vna est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia, non multae.</hi> The hoste that we offer (daily, for there he speaketh of the dayly Oblation) is one, it is not many. If it be bread made by the handes of a man, that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and wine pressed out of the grape (for the Real Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the body and bloud of Christe ye denie) albe it the same properly can not be called an Hoste, how can you say, it is one Hoste, that we offer daily, and not many Hostes, seing that euery day we take newe bread, and newe wine for our Sacrifice?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vve haue the sampler, and the true thing it selfe, vvhich Christe offered.</note>Your second peece of a sentence is this. <hi>Hoc Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium exemplar illius est. This Sacrifice is an example of that Sacrifice.</hi> But what foloweth, <hi>Id ipsum semper offeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> We offer alwaies the selfe same thing. And what thing is that? There he sheweth. <hi>It is the Hoste that cleanseth vs, which Christe our Bisshop hath offered.</hi> So then we see it called, both the real thing it selfe, that was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15584:252"/>
offered, and the sampler of the thing. In that he calleth it a sampler, thereby he putteth vs in minde, the order and manner of offering it now, to be different from the manner of the oblation of the Crosse. For there it was bloudy, here vnbloudy: there with suffering the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death, here with commemoration, representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of his death: there the thing offered visible in proper forme, here inuisible, vnder the forme of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>Your thirde peece of a sentence taken out of S. Chrysostome, is this. <hi>This that we doo, is done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that that was done.</hi> Which wordes declare, the thing that we doo, to be donne in remembrance of the Death of Christe. And they folow immediatly vpon that he said of the <hi>cleansing Hoste,</hi> whiche our Bishop Christe offered, and we also offer the same. So that the difference betwene this, and that, is this. That was the Sacrifice that cleanseth our synnes with his bloude actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally shed, and redemed vs by vertue of it selfe. This is the Commemoratiue Sacrifice, which is offered in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of that, hauing for the substance of it, the same body and bloude of Christe, that was offered vpon the Crosse, by vertue of Consecration made really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and applieth vnto vs the merite and effecte of the cleansing, and redemption wrought and perfourmed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse.</p>
               <p>Then immediatly foloweth the last sentence of the Homilie, a parte whereof you haue taken for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>Non aliud Sacrificiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sicut Pontifex, sed idipsum sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per offerimus, &amp; caet. we offer not an other Sacrifice, as the Bishop</hi> (of the olde lawe did) <hi>but alwayes we offer the very
<pb facs="tcp:15584:253"/>
same that Christe offered, or rather we worke the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Sacrifice.</hi> In the Discourse of S Chrysostom, out of whiche M. Iewel hath piked, and culled out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peeces, three thinges in effect are declared. First, that we offer, secondly, that our manner of offering is other, then Christes was, therefore ours is called a sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler of that, and it is donne in commemoration of his Death. Thirdly, that the Hoste, or thing offered in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifice, is one and the same in substance, which is the true body of Christe. Graunt vs the first, and the last, that is to say, that we offer in deede, yea and that the same Hoste, which Christe offered: and to al men of reason and iudgement, though our Sacrifice be a sampler of Christes Sacrifice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse, and though it be done for commemoration of that, shal our Real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be sufficiently proued. For what is our endeuour in this Article, but to proue, that we offer vnto God that, which Christo our Bishop hath offered, which is Christe him selfe?</p>
               <p>And whereas making vp your <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> you say with more brauarie, then truth, <hi>Thus we offer vp Christe, that is to say, an example, a commemoration, a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Death of Christe:</hi> I neuer heard of such a <hi>that is to say,</hi> before, specially if the real presence by these wordes be excluded as your meaning is.

Chrysostom by your selfe alleged make a plaine distinction and difference betwen the hoste of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the remembrance, saying, <hi>that which we doo, is done for a commemoration?</hi> Doth it not therby appeare, that somewhat must be done before, and besides the Commemoration? Who euer so confounded thinges, as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:15584:253"/>
as by your absurde and false interpretation you doo, making the body and bloude of Christe, or Christe him selfe, and the remembrance of Christes death, one thing? What, is this your meaning, as though the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sacrifice, were nothing els, but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christes death? Let this once be graunted, and why may not any man, or woman, make vs as good a Sacrifice at their table at home in their owne howse, as your selfe can at the Communion table in our Ladies Churche at Sarisburie? For at that home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly table may Christes death be remembred, aswel as at your Communion table.</p>

                  <hi>This kinde of Sacrifice</hi> (say you speaking of the commemoration of Christes Death) <hi>was neuer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> As in a right sense it is very true, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by vs denied (for the deuoute remembrance of Christes Death by it selfe considered, is a kinde of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifice) so if you meane thereby to exclude the truth of the thing offered, whiche is the body and bloud of Christe,<note place="margin">M. Ievvel alvvaies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth the denial of one truth by thaffirma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of an other truth.</note> and serue vs with a shewe, and a remembrance onely distinct from the true thing it selfe that is offered, which seemeth to be your whole drifte: this parte of your doctrine we vtterly denie, and tel you, that for maintenance of the same, you vse a fond and vaine reason. For what an Argument is it, when two thinges be bothe true, by the affirmation of the one, to conclude the denial of the other? As for example, what witte wil allowe this Argument. The Sunne shineth, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it raineth not, or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not colde: whereas many times we see it raine, and feele it colde, when the Sunne shyneth cleare and
<pb facs="tcp:15584:254"/>
bright? Right so we tel you, and neuer stint telling you (which neuerthelesse ye dissemble to vnderstand) that this your common Argument is naught, the Sacrifice which we offer, is a sampler, or a commemoration of that which Christe offered: Ergo, it is not the same, which Christe offered. For in diuers respectes it is bothe, as now we haue proued by S. Chrysostome.</p>
               <p>It is the same in substance, that is to say, the substance of that was offered vpon the Crosse, and of that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Priestes is the Masse, in one, and the same: but it is diuers in the manner of offering. For that was offered bloudily, this vnbloudily in mysterie, and by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration. So it is the body and Bloud of Christe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and also a commemoration of the bloudy offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>The testimonie of S. Augustine (I maruel what you meant to allege it) maketh quite against you. For both it reporteth the real presence, which you denie, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a difference betwixt the thing which is offered, and Christes Death by the same signified, which you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founde. We graunt with S. Augustin, <hi>when the hoste is broken,</hi>

If you grate vpon the worde, <hi>Significatur,</hi> and therefore wil needes haue it to be a signification of Christes Sacrifice: as we denie not the signification, so we require you to acknowlege the real body and bloude of Christe, by breaking whereof
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:15584:254"/>
vnder the forme of bread, and powring whereof into the mowthes of the faithful vnder the forme of wine, the same signification, and commemoration of Christes Death is made. You handle this place of S. Augustine, as it semeth, as you handled the place of S. Chrysostome before. Sweeping cleane away the hoste, and wyping away the bloude, you leaue remaining onely a significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or token. And thus you feede your people with signes and tokens, in steede of the most holesome and substantial meate and drinke.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you not weakened the strength of S.

Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this manner of seeing Christe, and of touching his woundes, whether it be through vertue of faith, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of charitie, is not real and in dede, wil you therof ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that Christ in the Sacrifice of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not really offered? O that you would make this Argument in Louaine, or Paris, or in any other famous Schoole of Diuinitie in the worlde, this Argument I say,
<q>Christe is not now seene hanging vpon the Crosse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be his woundes touched really and in dede: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not of the Priestes offered vp in the Mysteries really:</q>
You may be sure the Audience with hissing, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling would driue you out of the Schoole.</p>
               <p>If you say, I doo you wrong in reporting your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:15584:260"/>
to disaduantage, which is your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practise to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me: I am content you frame it to your best adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Let your owne Argument stand, as your selfe haue set it forth. An Argument I may cal it, for by your <hi>Maior,</hi> any man may sone vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what should be your <hi>Minor,</hi> and conclusion. Your Argument then is this. <hi>As we see Christ eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with our eyes hanging vpon the Crosse, and thrust in our fingers, and searche his woundes: Euen so doo we see Christ comming vnto vs, and offering him selfe in Sacrifice vnto God.</hi> Your <hi>Minor,</hi> or seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d proposition, must be this. but really and in deede so we see not Christ, neither doo we so with our fingers searche his woundes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> really and in deede we see not Christe comming vnto vs, and offering him selfe in Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Why sir al this I graunt. For in deede we see not now Christe comming vnto vs, nor offering him selfe: But our controuersie is not of seing Christ comming, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him selfe: but of the offering of his body in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And to that I alleged S. Ambrose, saying, <hi>Et si Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus non videtur offere, tamen ipse offertur in terris, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Christi corpus offertur.</hi> Although Christ be not seene to offer, yet him selfe is offered in the earth, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ is offered. Lo he saith expressely, he is not seene to offer, and yet he is offered. Your parte is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the offering, and bicause you cannot, you impugne the seing of him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming and offering him selfe. We see him not, and yet he is offered in earth, as S. Ambrose saith.</p>
               <p>Now then, whereas you are driuen from this, if thus you make your Argument, as in effecte you doo, and as your fetche is to conclude:
<q>As Christ is seene of vs hanging vpon the Crosse, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15584:260"/>
as his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des be touched with our fingers, so he is by Priests offred, but he is not sene ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse really and in dede, nor his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des be so touched with our fingers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not offered really and in dede:</q>
As I graunt the Argument to be good in forme, so I denie the mater to be true. For the <hi>Maior,</hi> or first proposition is false. For Christes hanging on the Crosse, and the print of his woundes, is seene, and felt of vs by faith, or by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as I haue now declared: but Christe is offered vp in Sacrifice really, and in dede, bicause his body is really and in dede present in the Sacrament, as it hath bene against you M. Iewel by the Catholikes most sufficiently proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by scriptures, Fathers, and the faith of the Churche, and as you knowe in your owne gilty conscience.</p>
               <p>The saying which you attribute vnto S. Hierom,<note place="margin">M. Ievvel forgeth vvordes of his ovvne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to S. Hierom. <hi>Hierony. in Psal.</hi> 86.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod semel natu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est ex Maria, quotidie in nobis nascitur,</hi> Christe that was once borne of Marie, is borne in vs euery day: is an inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of your owne. S. Hierom hath it not, you may sone fil your booke with such authorities, being made at home in your owne forge. S. Hierome expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure place of the .86. Psalme tropologically, saith this much, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Si volumus, quotidie nascitur Christus,</hi> If we wil, Christ is borne daily. There he calleth the doing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vertue, the begeting and bringing forth of Christe, bicause Christ is the vertue and wisedome of his Father. But what maketh this saying against the real Sacrifice of the body and bloude of Christe? By occasion of these wordes, you reason thus, as it may be conceiued.
<q>As S. Hierom saith, Christ is borne euery day, Euen so a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d none otherwise, S. Ambros saith, Christ is sacrificed euery day. But Christe is not borne euery day really.
<pb facs="tcp:15584:261"/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> S. Ambrose meaneth not, that he is sacrificed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day really.</q>
I answer. Your <hi>Maior</hi> is false. For there is a manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude betwen the partes compared together. When we bring forth good vertues, and Christe therefore is said to be borne in vs: this is spoken by a Metaphore, and is true onely in a tropological, or morale sense, and not in the litteral sense. The other parte of the comparison, <hi>Christ is offered day, when his body is offered,</hi> as S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose saith, is a proper speache, and the same is true in the litteral sense, as now we haue prooued.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that I let not passe the other place of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, where he calleth the myndes of holy virgins, Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the reason you gather thereof is naught. For of the affirmation of an internal Sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambros. de Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nib. lib.</hi> 2. M. Iewels peculiar Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie to put away one truth by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> you inferre the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the external Sacrifice, and so you would driue out one truth by an other truthe, after your common wount. Which kinde of reasoning is very fonde and childish. For both may, and ought to stand together. Your Argument, if you conclude ought, must be this.
<q>Christe is offered in the myndes of virgins, which therefore may be called Aulters, internally, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not offered on the true Aulters in the Churche externally, and really.</q>
The Argument is naught, as euery yong Sophister know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, bicause he is offered both waies. As wel you might reason thus, Christ is God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise, Christe is man, <hi>ergo,</hi> he is not God.</p>
               <p>Thus thou mayst easily perceiue good Reader, what guileful Sophistrie M. Iewel vseth, putting away the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and outwarde Sacrifice of the Churche, by alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15584:261"/>
places of Fathers, commending vnto vs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and mere spiritual Sacrifices of mannes harte. Withal thou seest also, what so euer M. Iewel saith, that I haue founde in S. Chrysostome, and S. Ambrose, that I sought for.</p>

               <p>Sir I assure you I meane plainely would God you did so too verily if you did, we should not thus finde you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies starting a side to figures, and phrases. Folowing my prefixed order, in my Answer I come now to proue the Sacrifice by the witnesse of two auncient Fathers, S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, and S. Hierome, alleging for it, the figure of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek. First touching S. Cyprian, let his wordes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as they lie, without figure, folde, or wrinckle: how
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15584:262"/>
therof wil it folow, that Melchisedek offered verely, and really Christ him selfe? <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>S. Cyprians wordes be cleare: Christ offered the same thinge, that Melchisedek had offered.</hi> The clearer the wordes be, the lesse they serue your obscure purpose.</p>
               <p>If we graunted your translation to be true, who haue turned, <hi>hoc idem, the same thing,</hi> where it ought rather to be turned, <hi>the same</hi> (Sacrifice) being referred to Sacrifice, that goeth there before immediatly, If we wincked at you for this, I say: Yet I pray you, how foloweth this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Christ offered the same thing that Melchisedek had offered, Ergo Melchisedek offered vp Christ him selfe verily and really?</hi> If you would haue gonne the right way to worke, thus you should haue argued. Christe offered the same thing, that Melchisedek had offered: Melchisedek had offered bread and wine, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christe offered bread and wine. But bicause, if you had thus rightly framed your Argument, you had concluded with vs against your selfe by S. Cyprian, by whose interpretation the bread and wine, that Christ offered, was his body and bloud: rather then you would graunt so much, it liked you better to vse false Logique, then true Diuinitie.</p>
               <p>The wordes then of S. Cyprian taken in their plaine and litteral sense,<note place="margin">Christe offered the true bread and true wine at his Supper.</note> and without any figure doo signifie, that Melchisedek offered bread and wine, as muche to say, a bare figure: and that Christe fulfilling that Figure, offered also bread and wine. But what bread and wine? His body and bloude, the true bread, and the true wine. Which body and bloude, bicause they feede and susteine both body and soule to life euerlasting, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread and wine that Melchisedeck offered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to feede only the body, and that but for a final time: are for good cause called the true bread and wine.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you sticke to the worde, <hi>hoc ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the same Sacrifice,</hi>

                  <hi>Quomodo Melchisedech obtulit panem &amp; vinum, sic &amp; tu offeres corpus tuum &amp; sanguinem, verum panem, &amp; verum vinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Like as Melchisedek offered bread and wine: so thou shalt offer thy body and bloud, the true bread, and the true wine. What difference then and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie is betwen the figure, and the thing forefigured, that is to say, betwen Melchisedeks bread and wine, and the body and bloud of Christe: such diuersitie of substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is there in the thinges which they offered.</p>
               <p>The Christe offered the same, that Melchisedek had offered, for the vnderstanding of it, it may be said, both in consideration of the Mysterie, and of the thing it selfe in a right sense, either bicause the formes of bread and wine remained after consecration, or bicause it was bread and wine in dede before Christ had consecrated and offered. We read in the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2.</note> that when our Sauiour at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had turned water into wine, he commaunded the waiters to draw, and bring it vnto the Vssher of the Haul. They brought it, and <hi>the Vssher tasted water made wine.</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:15584:263"/>
Now true it is to saye, that the waiters did drawe, and bring, and the Vssher tasted the same thing, that the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had filled the waterpottes withal a litle before, that is, water. But what water? Forsooth water made wine. Likewise it was truely said of S. Cyprian, that Christe offered the same thing, that Melchisedech had offered before him, that is, bread and wine. But what bread and wine? Forsooth bread and wine made his body and bloude. So the Scripture saith, that Aarons Rodde deuoured the Roddes of the Enchaunters.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.</note> What rodde was that? It was the Rodde made a serpent. By this it appeareth, how sclender your Argument is, which here you gather against the Real Sacrifice out of S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wordes, and how you seeke not so much the truth, as to gainesay, and ouerthwarte the Authorities, that for the same I alleged.

               <p>It is a worlde to see your doublenes. What, are ye not resolued, whether the Sacrifice that Melchisedek made, were a Sacrifice, or no? Sir, the Sacrifice he made, that is to say, the thing which he offered in Sacrifice, was not Christe the Sonne of God, pardy. Who euer said, it was? Wel, what was it then? Mary, onely material bread, and wine, say you. So say we too. and that by the same, the Sacrifice of Christes body and bloud vnder the forme of bread and wine,<note place="margin">VVhat vvas Mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chisedeks Sacrifice by M.

For Melchisedek be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, as he was, like it is, that he prouided biefe, veale, and mutton, pigge, goose and capon, baakte, boiled, and roste.

loynes of Abraham, as S. Paule saith, when Melchisedek met him. Now whereas the Leuitical Priestes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded according to the Iawe to take tythes of the people, and haue thereby a Dignitie aboue the people: Melchisedeks taking of tythes of Abraham their chiefe Patriarke, Prince and head of the whole progenie (and consequently of Leui also and his children the Priestes of that order, for that they were then in his loynes) doth proue, the preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and excellencie of that Priesthod, in comparison of the Leuitical Priesthod, in so much that in comparison of the same, the Leuites be but Lay men, and of the popular order.</p>
                  <p>By these, and certaine other Argumentes S. Paule proueth, and setteth forth the excellencie of Christes Priesthod after the order of Melchisedek, aboue the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitical Priesthod. Among which he maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the manner of Melchisedeks Sacrifice. Bicause if he had alleged, that Melchisedek sacrificed in bread and wine, the Hebrewes woulde soone haue replied, that their sacrifices in that behalfe farre excelled, as the which being of lyuing beastes, had a more glorious shew and countenance, then the Sacrifice of bread and wine. Thus you haue two causes declared, why S. Paule, where he treateth so much of the dignitie of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek, and of the Priesthod that is after his order, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing, at least manifestly, of his Sacrifice in bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>If the Fathers haue oftentimes resembled this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Melchisedek vnto the Sacrifice that Christ made vpon the Crosse, as you say: why do you not shewe vs, where we may finde it? Wil any wise man
<pb facs="tcp:15584:268"/>
(trow you) beleue it onely vpon your bare worde? If it be a thing done oftentimes, it was the easier for you to shewe it once. But your <hi>oftentimes</hi> in the ende wil proue neuer. That Melchisedek gaue to Abraham a present of bread and wine, being returned from the battail, it is not denied. but that euer any auncient learned Father resembled that present, as you cal it abhorring the name of Sacrifice, as it had the condition of a present, vnto the Sacrifice that Christe made vpon the Crosse: I vtterly denie it. If any where they resemble the bread and wine that Melchisedek made his Sacrifice of vnto the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Crosse, they doo it in respecte that the thing signified by it, that is, the body and bloud of Christe, was one both in the Sacrifice made at the Supper, and also in that which was made vpon the Crosse: and not that the manner of Sacrifice made vpon the Crosse which was bloudy, was semblable vnto it. And so in respecte had to the body and bloud of Christe offered vpon the Crosse, and not vnto the manner of offering, I graunt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position you make of S. Cyprians wordes to be true. that is to say, that <hi>Christe offered the same thing in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of truth vppon the Crosse, that Melchisedek had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore offered in figure.</hi> But that performance of truth is by the learned Fathers commonly acknowleged in the Sacrifice of the Supper. In which Christe offered his body and bloude vnder the formes of bread and wine after the order of Melchisedek for thankesgeuing, which he offered vpon the Crosse for redemption.</p>

               <p>The authoritie you allege vnder the name of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, is not S. Augustines.

               <p>In this Diuision M. Iewel, you set forth as it were in a moustre, a number of authorities, and not one to the purpose. Yet fewe thinges excepted, you tel vs litle here, that you haue not tolde vs before. One apte and plaine testimonie would haue holpen your cause more, then al this impertinent and confuse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It is not harde for one that is furnished with stoare of Notebookes of common places, as you are, to fil the paper with heapes of allegations. This kinde of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as to the ignorant it maketh a false shewe of stoare of learning, so to the learned, bringeth assured eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of lacke, bothe of truth, and iudgement. You are much beholding to your Phrases, and metaphorical speaches. For in them at least, as in a smooddering smoke, you trust to conuey your selfe away, that the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your parte appeare not openly, as it should, if you would directly answer to the pointes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the truth of our syde is confirmed. By this you shewe your selfe to be mynded not to yeelde and to subscribe according to your promise, what so euer, and how muche so euer be proued against you.</p>
               <p>Concering Oecumenius in my Answer alleged,<note place="margin">Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> you might iustly take exception against him, you say for that he falleth without the compasse of the first six hundered yeres. As though an Author allowed by the best learned of the Churche for the speace of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen time, should be of lesse credite, then an other, that wrote one hundred yeres before him. As though also after the first six hundred yeres the holy Ghoste

forsooke the Churche, and therefore least it vnfurnished of good and learned teachers. Of what age he was, I trowe it is not certainely knowen: but that he is of great antiquitie, it is certaine. Neither can ye refuse him for a Papist, bicause he was of the Greke Churche, which your selfe haue cleared of Papistrie. Wel touching his credite, forasmuch as vpon a braue shewe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in your cause, you are so good Mayster vnto him, as not to take exception against him: we take that ye geue.

               <p>Bicause you pretend in worde (knowing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in harte) that this testimonie of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> maketh no proufe for the Sacrifice against your Chalenge: whether it be so, or no, let it he briefly examined. First, saith he not, that Christe him selfe offered an vnbloudy Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce? By the epipheton <hi>Vnbloudy,</hi> added to Sacrifice, is it not manifest, that this Sacrifice was distincte and diuers from the Sacrifice, that he made vpon the Crosse, which was bloudy? Nexte, least any man might happen to doubte, what the substance was, which was offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudily by Christe, doth not this Author declare it by his plaine Parenthesis, saying, <hi>for he offered his owne body</hi>?<note place="margin">That Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ovvne body vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blouddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Is it not cleare then, that Christes body was the substance, which he offered vnbloudily? Note then good Reader, that the substance, which was offered bloudily vpon the Crosse, and vnbloudily at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (for that was the time when the vnbloudy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was made) by this testimonie is al one, to wit the body of Christe. the body of Christe, I say, and not onely thankes geuing, praises, and remembrance, of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:15584:274"/>
his Death, whereunto onely you M. Iewel would draw it. Thus it is euident, that Christe him selfe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Father, not onely a bloudy, but also an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Let vs see, whether by <hi>Oecumenius</hi> it may appeare, that Priestes haue authoritie to offer vp the vnbloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.<note place="margin">That Prie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stes haue autoritie to offer the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice.</note> Verely it appeareth most manifestly. For saith he, <hi>Not onely Christe offered the vnbloudy Sacrifice, but also they, which from him shal doo the office of Priestes, shal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer without shedding of bloud.</hi> Marke M. Iewel, The Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, that shal haue authoritie from Christe their hye Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to execute the office of Priesthod, shal offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudly. But what shal they offer? What other thing, but that which Christe offered? What offered Christe? An vnblouddy Sacrifice. What was the substance, of that vnbloudy Sacrifice? His very body. <hi>Suum ipsius cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus obtulit,</hi> he offered his owne body, saith Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Therefore the Priestes shal offer the vnbloudy Sacrifice, which is Christes body, and the same shal they doo vpon good authoritie, for that in so doing, they shal execute the Priesthod, which they shal receiue, <hi>ab ipso,</hi> from him, that is, from Christe.</p>
               <p>If you can tel vs of any power and warrant more suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, than that which commeth from Christe vnto the Priestes of his Churche, then shal you require me to yeeld, and with you to confesse, that Priestes doo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good authoritie presume to offer vp Christe vnto his Father in their daily Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>You wil say perhaps. I heare that Priestes shal offer Christes body without shedding of bloud, but that they haue any authoritie graunted them so to doo, yet I
<pb facs="tcp:15584:275"/>
heare not. It may please you for this to consider, what fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in <hi>Oecumenius. This terme, In aeternum, for euer, signifieth so much, as that Priestes shal offer in executing their Priesthod from Christe, his vnbloudy Sacrifice. For the Prophete Dauid would neuer haue said, that Christe was a Priest for euer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.</note> 
                  <hi>in respecte of the Sacrifice, which Christe made once onely vpon the Crosse: but in respecte of the Priestes, that be now lyuing, by whom as by meanes and instrumentes, or rather ministers, Christe bothe doth offer Sacrifice, and is offered in Sacrifice.</hi> Loe here by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Priestes, Christe doth presently sacrifice, and is sacrificed. so that they do their office of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode presently, and accomplish that in deede, whereby the Priesthod of Christe after the order of Melchisedek is daily put in practise, and so continewed for euer, not onely in power and vertue, but also in acte and effecte.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VVhere gaue Christe to Priestes auctorite to sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note>It remaineth it be shewed, where, and when, Christe gaue them authoritie thus to doo. Oecumenius in the ende of this allegation saith it more plainely, then it may be doubted of, much lesse denied. <hi>Qui etiam in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica coena modum illis tradidit huiusmodi Sacrificij.</hi> Christe in his Mystical Supper deliuered vnto them the manner of such a Sacrifice. I presuppose no man to be so vaine a wrangler, as to cauille for that Oecumenius saith not, <hi>he deliuered them authoritie,</hi> but <hi>the manner how to offer this Sacrifice.</hi> For the deliuering of the manner how to doo it, had nothing auailed, onlesse he had withal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered authoritie lawfully to executeat. Thus haue you in this one authoritie expressed al the termes of your Chalenge, to wit, that Priestes haue authoritie to offer vp Christe vnto his Father in Sacrifice. For here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15584:275"/>
made of Priestes, of sacrificing vnbloudily, of the body of Christe, and therefore of Christe him selfe, of authoritie, bicause they execute Priesthod in the person of Christe, from Christe, and for Christe, in that they be meanes by whom Christ sacrificeth, and is sacrificed. The same authoritie is further auouched, by that, that Christe deliuered vnto them in his last Supper, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of such a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>How be it I was deceiued in saying, that al the termes of your Chalenge be expressed in this testimonie: for here lacketh the name of the Father. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heauen be thanked, that it forceth not muche, whether his name be expressed or no, seing it is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily included. For to whom should Christe offer Sacrifice, but to his Father? To whom ought man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sacrifice, but to God onely, as to whom and to none other, that kinde of seruice is due?</p>
               <p>If you require a plaine place witnessing that Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes haue authoritie to offer vp Christe,<note place="margin">This sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice auou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched by the Nicen Councel.</note> heare what the Fathers of the first Nicen Councel say. <hi>The Councel is aduertised</hi> (say they) <hi>that in certaine places, and Cities, Diacons geue the Sacramentes vnto Priestes.

your false sleightes to your discredite, but for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesties sake to winke at them: then thus should you be answered. 1. Where S. Hierome saith, <hi>Si volumus, quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die nascitur Christus,</hi>

Whereas then your Argument is this, <hi>As Christ is borne euery day, so is he offered by Priestes euery day, But he is not really and in deede borne euery day: Ergo neither is he offered by Priestes euery day:</hi> If this be your Argument, your <hi>Maior,</hi> or first proposition, is false, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as I haue shewed) the similitude holdeth not, and the case is not like.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15584:277"/>
Father, for your cotation is false. This much is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. The crucifying of Christe, is of two sortes. The one external, and bloudy. The other mystical, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy. In that, Christes bloude was shed, to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral redemption: In this the bloude of Christe already shed is applyed vnto vs, that is to say, the effecte of his bloude to particuler remission of synnes, and paines dew to sinnes, as if he were now hanging vpon the Crosse. This application of Christes death vnto vs, is sometimes of the Fathers called, his Crucifying, sacrificing, Death, and killing. After the first way, he was neuer crucified but once. After the second way, he is crucified daily, and so often as the Death of him that was crucified, is (the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Reconciliation presupposed) applied vnto vs to effecte.</p>

he is killed, as concerning the Application of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his Death, that is to say, his death is insinuate and applied vnto vs, when we beleue hat he was killed for vs. Which Death neuerthelesse, to wit, the effect of his Death, is applied vnto vs not by faith only, but also faith presupposed, by meane of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>So Christe is said by S. Augustine <hi>to rise againe to vs euery day,</hi>,<note place="margin">In vvhat sense M. Ievvels mystical speaches alleged out of the Fathers be true.</note> bicause we beleue that he rose againe.</p>
               <p>S.

What Sacrifice this is, Christes most plaine wordes do declare. who at his last Supper, after he had taken bread, and the Cuppe into his handes,<note place="margin">

               <p>What needeth al this longe processe vppon the woorde, <hi>Incruentum,</hi> Vnbloudy? Go to the purpose M. Iewel. By the place alleged out of S. Chrysostome, it is euident, that he vnderstandeth Malachies prophecie of the vnbloudy Sacrifice, which Christ offered at his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Table in his Last Supper, and is now daily offered by Priestes according to his Institution. Examin the
<pb facs="tcp:15584:284"/>
woordes wel. <hi>See how plainely, and clearely</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Prophete hath interpreted the Mystical Table,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysos. in Psal.</hi> 55.</note> 
                  <hi>which is the vnblouddy Sacrifice.</hi> Yet so plaine and cleare as it is, you can not see, or rather you wil not see it: And by al your witte and cunning you endeuour so to dasel the eyes of others, that they may not see it.</p>

                  <hi>Vnbloudy</hi>? Why doo you not aswel speake of the Mystical Table? Can ye not away to heare thereof? Say what you liste of the terme, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blouddy,</hi> and allege so many sentences of Doctours, as woulde fil a whole booke: yet must S. Chrysostome to al men of learning appeare to expounde the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Malachie of that whiche is vnbloudily sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Mystical Table. What Mystical Table can ye name vs now in the Churche, but that, whereon the Body and Bloude of Christe are sacrificed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is named an Aulter,<note place="margin">Aulter.

               <p>In effecte, two thinges you go about to prooue. The first is, that the Sacrifice of our Prayers, and deuotion of mynde, is called of the Fathers, Vnbloudy. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that the Ministration of the holy Communion (which terme is very common with you) is called also an vnbloudy Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:15584:284"/>Touching the first, you haue taken great paines to litle purpose. For it is by noman denied. Touching the second, what so euer you meane by your Ministring terme of the Ministration of the Holy Communion, we say, that the Hoste of the Mystical Table, whiche is none other, but the body and bloude of Christe, is both of S. Chrysostome here, and otherwheres of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fathers, called the vnbloudy Sacrifice, not for that <hi>it representeth and reporteth vnto our myndes the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Crosse,</hi> as you say (for in that respect it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called representatiue or commemoratiue): but for that being the same in substance with that, whiche was offered vppon the Crosse with shedding of bloude,<note place="margin">Bloudy, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy, referred to one subiecte.</note> it is here offered vnbloudily. And so both these termes, <hi>Bloudy,</hi> and <hi>Vnbloudy,</hi> be referred to one subiect, or thing offered, whereby the diuersitie of the manner of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is signified.</p>
               <p>Furthermore whereas you say, <hi>that the Christians Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices be mere spiritual, and procede wholy from the harte,</hi> if you meane, that al our Sacrifices be such, and that no external thing is offered in any of them: it is vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken. For the Sacrifice of Christes body and Bloude is not so mere spiritual, that it may be said to proceede onely from the harte of the offerer, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an external action of the Minister, to wit an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal pronouncing of the sacramental woordes, <hi>This is my body &amp;c.</hi> Besides this, external breade and wine be also necessary, without the which this Sacrifice can not be made.

                  <hi>Est primum Sacrificium, Spirituale illud &amp; mysticum donum, de quo Paulus ait, Imitatores estote Dei, &amp;c. The first and chiefe Sacrifice is, that spiritual and Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal gifte, whereof S. Paul speaketh. Be ye the folowers of God, as beloued children, and walke in loue, euen as Christe hath loued vs, and deliuered him selfe vnto God for vs a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and oblation into a swete sauour.</hi> By which wordes he geueth vs to vnderstand, that among al the kindes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifices whiche we haue, being ten in number, as there he reckeneth, the first and chiefe of al, is Christe him selfe, who gaue him selfe to be sacrificed bloudily for vs vppon the Crosse, and nowe in the Mystical Table offereth him selfe, and is offered vnbloudily. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof he calleth it, <hi>the spiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical gifte, the pure, healthful, and vnbloudy hoste of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Table.</hi>

Iewels to be false.</p>
               <p>If he would haue wrought directly to the purpose,
<pb facs="tcp:15584:286"/>
he should haue prooued, that the vnbloudy Sacrifice of the Mystical Table, were nothing elles, but Prayers, Thankesgeuing, Praises, and a remembraunce of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Death. For we graunt, that al these doo concurre vpon that Table. But that they be there onely, that is to say, without the Sacrifice of the Body and Bloude of Christe: we denie vpon S. Chrysostomes auctoritie, who annumbreth this Sacrifice distinctly, and alone from the reste.</p>
               <p>Againe if he would fully haue acheeued his intent, it stode him vpon to proue, that they onely are vnblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifices, and that this is not. For otherwise wee wil alwaies stande to this trueth, that both be vnblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifices, and so this is an vnbloudy Sacrifice. yea this more properly, then the other. For those mere spiritual Sacrifices be of them selues neither bouddy, nor vnblouddy, but in mere respecte of certaine exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sacrifices, whiche were offered in the olde Lawe with shedding of Bloude. But the Sacrifice of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloude of Christe offered in the Churche, is so called, in consideration of the one and the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whiche once was bloudily offerred, and is now offered without Bloudshed in a Mysterie. In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Ephesus Cyrillus calleth it,<note place="margin">

               <p>Nowe good Reader wilt thou see, how M. Iewel doth alwaies like him selfe, and what smal shifte of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning he hath? Marke whether of the affirmation of the mere spiritual Sacrifices of the mynde, he inferre not the Denial of the external and real Sacrifice of Christes Body and Bloude: that is to say, whether he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15584:286"/>
make not one trueth to put away an other truth. The thing he taketh in hande to prooue, is this. That the Sacrifice offered at the Mystical Table, is not the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice of the Churche. Remember wtihal, that his conclusion should be this, that by the vnbloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hoste of the Mystical Table, S. Chrysostome meant not the Vnblouddy Sacrifice of the Body and Bloude of Christe. His reason then is this.
<q>The Holy learned Fathers doo applie the terme,<note place="margin">M. Iewels argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes take it.</note>

This is the whole effecte of his prooufe, and this is his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be lawful forme that the force of this reason be opened, to vse the like forme of Argument in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mater, that by comparison the lewdnes of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may appeare. The holy learned Fathers do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie this terme, <hi>Necessarie,</hi> to Faith, hope, penaunce, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, fasting, praying, and to almose deedes, saying, they be necessary for a Christian man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the same Fathers thought not, that Charitie was necessary for a Christian man. Is not here a denial of a trueth inferred vppon the affirmation of an other truth? Right so doth M. Iewel prooue, that Christes Body and bloude is not the Vnblouddy Sacrifice of the Churche, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause other spiritual Sacrifices be called Vnblouddy. As thoughe the Terme might not, or were not

Bicause there is no pith in this confuse number of authorities, that be here by heapes layd together, neither prooue they any thing contrary to that we defende: I thinke it better to passe them ouer as altogether impertinent, and superfluous, then by discussing of them to be tedious vnto the reader.

               <p>If the Sacrifice of the Churche, whereof we treate, were nothing elles, but Prayers, Praises, thankes geuing, and a remembrance, and had no substance at al, which consisteth without and besides the minde of man: then might we graunt, that al Aulters of Stoane, or Timber, were needelesse.

               <p>By this saying it is witnessed vnto vs, that the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters erected in Martyrs Churches, were material, as the Churches were, and that on them Priestes made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto God.</p>
               <p>Whereas then M. Iewel admitteth none other kinde of Sacrifice in the newe Testament, than such, as for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering whereof any material Aulter is not required, and <hi>S.</hi> Augustine speaketh of a Sacrifice, that is offered vnto God vpon the material Aulters: by this we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this newe doctrine of M. Iewel touching the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to dissent from the olde Doctrine of S. Augustin. Consider wel of it Christian Reader, how safe it is for thee to forsake the Churche, to contemne S. Augustine, <hi>Optatus,</hi> and al other the olde learned Fathers, in whose workes we finde often mention of material Aulters, and the Sacrifice therevpon daily offered: and to pinne thy faith on M. Iewels sleeue, who, as thou seest, hath no sure grounde, but onely denieth al, and for colour of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, shuffleth together by heapes, patches, and peeces of the Fathers sayinges, whereby a confusion is sought, no certaintie is taught.</p>
               <p>If he wil replye against this,<note place="margin">Table, and Aulter.</note> saying, that the Fathers cal the Aulter a table (as to gete some auctoritie vnto his remoueable Communion Table he is wont commonly to translate a Table for an Aulter) it may please him to vnderstand, that the Fathers do truely cal it by bothe names, according to the double vse of the Euchariste, which is ministred vpon the same. For the Euchariste is bothe a Sacrament, and a Sacrifice. As it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so is it our heauenly foode and sustenance: As it
<pb facs="tcp:15584:289"/>
is a Sacrifice, so is it our daily offering. Vnto the which two vses S. Cyprian hauing respecte, saith of the bread and Chalice consecrated by solemne blessing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprian. De Coena Domini.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that it is bothe a medicine, and also a Sacrifice, to heale our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to purge our iniquities.</hi> Therefore the Fathers cal it a Table, in consideration we receiue from thens our substantial foode. And for that cause it is alwaies coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a white linnen cloth. They cal it an Aulter, for that we offer vpon it the heauenly Sacrifice of Christes body and bloude, and for that cause also it is fastened to the place where it standeth. Wherefore the Table doth not exclude the Aulter, nor doth the Aulter exclude the Table. But bothe are one in deede, and yet double in respecte of the double vse of the thing wrought vpon it. So that to turne the Aulter into a Table, is but a seely shifte, and a poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
               <p>This muche being now knowen, it wil be easy to perceiue, that the authorities by him alleged be to be vnderstanded, either of the Aulters, Sacrifices, smoke, and other Ceremonies vsed in the olde lawe, or of mere spiritual Sacrifices, which require none other Aulter, than the harte of man.<note place="margin">

               <p>Touching that you allege here as out of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, I doubte whether any such saying be in S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.

And now they be partakers of it, and they see such a Sacifice now to be offered vp vnto God in the whole world.</hi> He speaketh thereof, as he is woont to speake, when he commeth to this Mysterie, making this preface before, <hi>They knowe that reade.</hi> As who should say, This Mysterie is not to be reueled in open writing, least the despite of Infidels and Heretikes reache vnto it. but the beleuers that reade the place of Genesis, where it is spoken of, knowe what it meaneth. And they are partakers of it by receiuing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and see such kinde of Sacrifice to be offered now through the whole Churche, that now is dispersed ouer the whole worlde. Beholde he speaketh of a Sacrifice that is receiued of the faithful, and seene euerywhere to be offered. Which argueth the same to be an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and visible Sacrifice. Al these properties can not reasonably seme to perteine to a mere spiritual Sacrifice, but onely to the Sacrifice of the Euchariste. Thus tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth S. Augustine there.</p>

               <p>Neither doo ye sacrifice vnto God the Sacrifice of Praise in the body of Christe, which the Churche doth, as <hi>S.</hi> Augustine saith: for ye acknowledge no Sacrifice of the body of Christe at al, in whiche God is chiefly praised and thanked for his benefites.<note place="margin">The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that S.

               <p>Furthermore what Sacrifice is that, whereof the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Israel according to the flesh, were significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which S.

               <p>By this it is euident, that the Sacrifice of Praise, which Israel after the spirite, that is to say, the Churche, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp vnto God, not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedek, as <hi>S.</hi> Augustine writeth, is the Sacrifice of the Euchariste, in whiche the body and bloude of Christe is offered vp vnder the fourmes of bread and wine,<note place="margin">

On the Crosse Christe was sacrificed truly; according to the truth of substance of the thing sacrificed, and of the manner of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, which was by shedding of bloude, and killing the hoste that was to be sacrificed. In the Supper then, and in the Aulter now, he is truly sacrificed, as touching the truth of the substance of the thing that is offered,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15584:296"/>
that is to say, the body and bloude of Christe. For he said,<note place="margin">

For he is sacrificed vnbloudily, and in Mysterie. The body that now is offered, is a liue body. For it is the same in the Sacrament that hong vpon the Crosse, and that is now in heauen. But though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body be now a lyue in the Sacrament, and the bloud in the Body: yet neither is the body of vs offered, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a lyue, and now to be killed, nor the bloude, bicause it is in the body as againe to be shed: but bicause the body was once killed, and the bloude once shed. that, which is now done, is done in remembrance of that. And hereof it commeth, that this Sacrifice, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes called of the Fathers in respecte of the bloudy Sacrifice of the Crosse (as it is in the thirde, fourth, and fifth testimonie of S, Augustine here alleged to be sene) a <hi>likenes, an Image of that Sacrifice, a memorie, or Sacrament of memorie.</hi> From the affirmation of which <hi>likenes, Image<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By an example it may be made manifest, how it is

both a memorie, and neuerthelesse the thing it selfe. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Aemylius</hi> that noble man of Rome, and <hi>C.

Euery triumphe was a memorie, and solemne celebration of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of victories by them obteined, and for memories sake of worthy and famous deedes, eche Triumphe was kept. Now what a folish Argument were this, if one had then said: This triumphe is celebrated and kepte in memorie of the great Conquest, and of the Conquerour, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Conquerour him selfe is not present? For at suche Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes the Conquerours were present riding most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously in their chariotes. And euery one at suche a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie was bothe the Conquerour him selfe, and was there in memorie of him selfe hauing done the worthy Actes, for which he deserued the honour of a Triumph.

                     <hi>The Apostles in their Commentaries</hi> (or bookes) <hi>which are called (Euangelia) Gospels, haue recorded, that Christe gaue commaundement vnto them so, that they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate this meate by the prayers of the woorde of him selfe, that he tooke bread, and after he had geuen thankes, said: Do ye this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of me, This is my body. Item, that he said hauing taken the Cuppe, after he had geuen thankes, This is my bloude, and that he gaue it to them alone.</hi> Marke here (good Rearde) by witnesse of this blessed Martyr, who was so nygh vnto the Apostles time, the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to do that whiche Christe did at his supper, that is to say, to consecrate, and offer the body and bloude of Christe, was geuen to the Apostles, and consequently to their successours (for he bad them so to doo vntil he

come), and to none elles. Of his wordes this Argument may wel be gathered.</p>
                  <p>They onely haue commaundement to doo that Christe did at the Supper, to whom he gaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by reporte of S.

Now Christe consecrated his body and bloude, and offered the same, and made this Sacrifice after the order of Melchisedek. Therefore they be Priestes onely (Priestes I meane Hierarchical) that be appointed, by Christe, and haue auctoritie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate, and make this Sacrifice, whiche is the point that M.

<pb facs="tcp:15584:308"/>
is, spiritual, he semeth to vse sutteltie, and to prouide him selfe a starting hole, if he happen to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed and pursued. In respecte of vnderstanding, it is spiritual, for that whiche is hid vnder the formes of bread and wine, with vnderstanding it is conceiued, and is not with bodily sense perceiued. But in respecte of the substance of it, whiche is the Real body and bloude of Christe, it is not properly, and altogether spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, specially as Spirite doth exclude the vetitie of Body. Affirming then that euery faithful man hath authoritie to make, and offer this Sacrifice, what sown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this tale, but that euery suche hath authoritie to make, and consecaate, and offer vp the body and bloude of our Lorde, whiche belongeth onely to them that properly be Priestes, as now I haue proued? This is bothe a Sacrament, and a Sacrifice. If none may minister this Secrament, but the Minister (for he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Sacramentes generally): how muche lesse may any make, that is to say, consecrate, or outwardly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this Sacrifice, but he that is duely made Priest by Bishoply Consecration,<note place="margin">External oblation propre to Priestes, internal ꝑteineth also to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful peple.</note> and laying on of handes?

Beware Reader thou vnderstand not this of Christes absolute power, but of the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation then taken in hande. For of his absolute power he was hable to worke Miracles, whether they beleued, or otherwise. Though he be hable alwaies to heale vs, and to worke miraculously with vs, yet oftentimes the riuer of his Diuine vertue, by our ingratitude and incredulitie, is so stopped from his course, that it is not powred vpon vs. Whiche I thought good to note, that thou be not deceiued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:15584:315"/>According to this former meaning, the Priest may wel pray in his Masse, that God wol vouchesafe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke vpon, and to accepte those giftes, to wit, the body and bloude of Christe, that they may haue vertue to worke the effecte of grace in vs, that is to say, that the course of grace, whiche their vertue is to worke on their behalfe, be not stopped from vs, by our vnworthinesse.</p>
                  <p>And here it is to be considered, that when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a sute is by secrete meaning annexed vnto a gifte presented, which most commonly happeth, the partie that presenteth it, besecheth him to whom it is presented, to receiue it with good wil, and take it in good woorth.

Now as when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him selfe, or by an other he desireth, that his gifte may be accepted, his meaning is specially, that he him selfe making sute, or that his requeste be accepted: so in the Canon of the Masse the Priest, and in him Gods holy people prayeth, that God fauourably receiue those giftes, meaning, that they them selues, and their sute be fauourably receiued, as being a condicion anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed by inward intention to their offering of the giftes.

That our merciful God, who hath receiued them in his holy and heauenly intelligible Aulter, vouchesafe to sende vs for the same, the grace and gifte of the Holy Ghoste.

What is this to say, but that he prayeth not for the giftes considered in them selfe, but for grace to be geuen to the offerers, through the giftes, and for the giftes sake?

<pb facs="tcp:15584:316"/>
where Christe in the Sacrament of the Aulter is offered, there also is the Churche offered. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine the prayer of the Priest pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Canon of the Masse, may be referred to Christ being offered, in respecte of the Churche, whiche Church is offered vp whole, that is to say the body with the Head. So then thereof this sense redoundeth. O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father looke mercifully vpon these giftes, and vouchesafe to accepte them, as touching the Churche, whiche is offered.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it a strange thing in the Scriptures, the wordes of Christe spoken as of Christe him selfe, to be referred to the Churche, as to the whole body, yet so, as sometimes the speache be vnderstanded of the head onely, sometimes of the body only, which is the Church.

haue I to be moued therewith, and you the more to be ashamed of your selfe, would God it were ynough to driue you to repent of suche wicked follies.</p>
                  <p>ALso whereas you say in great spite, that in the prayer of the Canon I compare <hi>the Sacrifice of the Sonne of God, with the Sacrifice of brute Cataile:</hi> it is as false and slaunderous, as the rest of your scorneful tale is. We desire God, that he vouchesafe to accepte these giftes at our handes, as he vouchesaued to accepte the giftes, and sacrifices of Abel, Abraham, and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek. In whiche prayer, Sacrifice is not compared with Sacrifice in them selues, but Gods good accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our doing is prayed for, comparable to that, wherewith God accepted the doing of Abel, Abraham, and Melchisedek in offering their Sacrifices.

                        <hi>Sicuti</hi> (as) in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but a likenes.</note> that is to say, <hi>As,</hi> in this prayer, as in many other places, signifieth, not an equalitie, but a likenes. God forbid, but we shoulde acknowledge and confesse, this Sacrifice, whiche is Christe, to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more acceptable to God, then the Sacrifice of Abel, were it sheepe, goate, or calfe, then the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Abraham, whether it were his Sonne Isaac, or the ramme, that was tyed by the hornes in the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or the Sacrifice of Melchisedek,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</note> whiche was bread and wine. For there is no Sacrifice comparable to this, this passeth al. And therefore for the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Canon, we must consider similitude, rather then equalitie. suche similitude I meane, as mought be of the figure towarde the truth.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet doth the Aduerbe, <hi>Sicuti</hi> (as) note an

equalitie of similitude or likenes, according to the selfe same degree of likenes as touching the Sacrifices them selues, but a certaine deegree of likenes, as touching the offerers. So then the sense shal be this. Accepte these giftes ô God, as thou didst accepte the giftes or Sacrifices of Abel, Abraham, and Melchisedek, whiche were acceptable to thee not for their owne worthines, but for the worthines of that Sacrifice, which they prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and for the faith, and deuotion of them that offered the same,<note place="margin">

               <p>O M. Iewel, God geue you a simple and an humble harte, that grace may entre. God open your eyes to see the wretched malice, wherwith your harte is fraught against the Churche of Christe. Beware you continue not in this desperate minde, and purpose: least you caste your selfe, and so many as by you shalbe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, into euerlasting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If that moue you not, yet let not the fillie folie of this vaine worlde amaze your senses. Let not the pleasure of this fickle felicitie, which presently you enioye, wholy withdraw your minde from consideration of that, which is to come hereafter. Take heede, your deceiued fauourers with their light praise, and fawning flaterie, make not a foole of you. Kicke no more against the pricke: go not obout to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bright Sunne, with smoothering smokes.</p>
               <p>Touching the Sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christe, what stoare of testimonies (whereat you cease

not to skosse) I haue brought for it, how litle you haue to say against it, and al that you haue said, of how litle pith and substance it is: al may see, that haue eyes to see. The learned, and al they that can iudge, doo see it, and consider of it, I doubte not. And that is ynough, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my parte, and the defence of the Catholique do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Would God, it were ynough also touching the holesom persuasion of the people. Your selfe also now doutlesse do see it. Yet for your worldly estimations sake, hauing made suche an Arrogant Chalenge, you may not seeme to see it. At least what so euer you see, you wil not confesse your errrour.</p>
               <p>Thus in ouersight to boast of sight, in darkenes to crake of light,<note place="margin">VVho playeth Thraso his parte, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger, or Defender.</note> in weakenesse to speake of strength, in maters, for whiche of your side no learning can be shewed, to chalenge al men aliue: this is the parte of Thraso. But in this Article of the Sacrifice, for which we haue so manifest Scripture, so many Doctours, so many Councels, so common, and so long continued custome, and faith of the Churche, for proufe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to auouche stoare of testimonies: it is not the parte of Thraso, it is the confidence of him, that knoweth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This serueth not to fray the simple, as you say. it serueth to cal backe the presumptuous rashnes of a newe Gospeller, to animate right beleeuers, and to stay the simple. As for the wise, whether they wil more condemne of folie, me, for shewing iust confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in defence of the truthe, or you, for making suche a proude Chalenge against the truth: I leaue it to their secrete iudgementes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15584:320"/>Bring vs but one plaine sentence of any Scripture, auncient Doctor, or Councel making clearely for you, that a Priest hath not auctoritie, and therefore may not offer vp Christe in the Euchariste, as I haue brought many for proufe of the contrary: and I wil be contente the name of Thraso be not returned vpon you. If ye haue none to bring, as sure I am ye haue not: for your Thrafonical Chalenge, that name wil become you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then me, that (how so euer you wrangle) promise no more, then I performe.</p>
               <p>That the Reader go not farre for one suche sentence among many of our parte, let the very laste, alleged out of S. Chrysostome, be considered. In whiche he saith plainely,<note place="margin">

For if he had commaunded the Iewes to Crucifie him, they had not bene gilty of his Death. Neither permitteth the circumstance of the place, any other to be vnderstanded, then the Sacrifice of the Aulter, in whiche Christe him selfe, according to his commaundement; <hi>Doo ye this in my remembrance,</hi> is, as I haue now proued, really offered.</p>
               <p>If in defence of your side you can not shew vs so muche as one sentence of like clearenes, you must beare with wise men, if they thinke the great sturre you haue made with your Chalenge, to be great folie. And likewise must you beare with your Aduersaries, if they reporte, you haue more shew of wordes, then substance of mater.</p>
               <p>To conclude, go plainely to worke M. Iewel. The handling of these maters requireth honestie, sinceritie,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:15584:320"/>
fidelitie, truth, conscience, and the feare of God. Set vs forth the light of true thinges, if ye haue any: leaue the darke clowdes of youy Phrases, and Figures. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your Doctrine with some firme Argumentes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it with good and sufficient authorities. Be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of your loose and childish Argumentes, by whiche in manner alwaies you inferre the denial of one truth, by the affirmation of an other truth. Let the world see, that you allege your testimonies, truly, iointly, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you falsifie them not by your diuisions, taking one peece here, and an other peece there, by nipping of, by adding vnto, by hewing, mangling, and, when you doo least, by wrong and wrested vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>Otherwise if you shal continue to set maters of Faith vpon vncertaine Phrases, and Figures, and Tropical speaches, to confounde one truth with an other, to corrupte, to patche together, to mangle, and by other waies to falsifie, as hitherto you haue done: be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of your Bookes Margent neuer so thicke, be the number of your vnlearned and partial Fauourers neuer so great: the wise, the godly, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, shal iudge you, as they finde you, to be but a Maister of Phrases, a confounder of Truthes, a patcher, a mangler, a shifter, a Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier.</p>
