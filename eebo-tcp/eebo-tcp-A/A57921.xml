            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>rd by a great Body of the Enemies Horse that were got between them, and the Rendezvous, and forced them into a Close for their security; whereupon a thousand Horse were sent to relieve them, but before they came, the Dragoons themselves had beaten off the Enemy, and made good their retreat to a Church, without the losse of a man. Sir <hi>Iames Smith</hi> with his Brigade, was the man that had a Designe to have surprized them; but now we are in a manner gotten between him and <hi>Bodman;</hi> for the Army quarters in the field, and all the Villages hereabouts, that he can hardly make his retreat, unlesse he took the opportunity before our Horse came up. At our coming into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> especially at <hi>Launceston,</hi> we found the people possest with an opinion, <hi>That there would be no mercy shewn unto the Cornish;</hi> but after a dayes being at <hi>Launceston,</hi> the Town seeing the carriage of the Souldier so fair, and not one House plundered (not so much as the Governours own house) and the Country being possest with the like opinion of the civil carriage of this Army, came into the Market, and brought in provisions for supply of our Forces; but in regard <hi>Gorings</hi> Forces had plundred the Countrey of all their Horse, people were glad to bring it in on their backs. And Friday being the day for the <hi>Posse</hi> of the whole Countrey to appear at <hi>Bodman;</hi> all the North part of <hi>Cornwal</hi> refused to appear, they positively affirming, <hi>They found us Friends, and not Enemies;</hi> and those that were on the Westside of <hi>Bodman,</hi> likewise refused to come in, saying, <hi>They had not greater Enemies then Gorings Horse that were among them.</hi> A Gentleman whom I spake withall this day, who was at their meeting said. The Horse onely appeared, the <hi>Posse</hi> Foot wholly refused to come in; and indeed, there cannot be a greater advantage to us, then to drive <hi>Gorings</hi> Horse before us; for there carriages are so

barbarous, that they make every mans hand against them where they come: The Army had been this night at <hi>Bodman,</hi> but in regard the Enemy is numerous in Horse, and that we marched much upon the Downs, and was like to be late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could get in, it was held fit to quarter in the Fields and Villages here abouts, and the next day to march in a close Body, Horse and Foot; though it be the slower way, yet it is the more secure: The Prisoners that were taken this day, told me, they were glad with all their hearts they were taken upon so fair quarter, for they knew they should be all taken at last (they said) and that they give themselves already for lost: And indeed, God hath stroken their hearts with a terrour. Some Gentlemen of quality have sent privately for protections, whose not appearing against us, though not for us, keeps all that part of the Countrey in, where they are, And just now we have intelligence, that the Lord <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

THe Messenger staying till the next morning, I thought fit to give you this further account of the Enemies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and our proceedings: This morning by break of the day, the Army was drawn to a Rendezvouz upon the Heath within two miles of <hi>Bodman,</hi> a party being sent out to discover if the Enemy were in the Town, brought Intelligence they quit the Town last night about ten of the clock, Horse and Foot, the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> bringing up the Rear himself: The most of the Foot they had were Welchmen, having Leeks in their Hats, and drunk, and went out disorderly: They march'd toward <hi>Truro</hi> with a good part of their horse; the rest of their Horse we this morning received Intelligence marched towards <hi>Ware-Bridge,</hi> as if they intended to go Eastward; whereupon Lieut. General <hi>Cromwel</hi> who went the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Relieve our Dragoons, was sent unto by the General to desire him to secure the passage at <hi>Ware-Bridge,</hi> by placing some Dragoons there; who being there with One thousand Horse, and Four hundred Dragoons, will give a seasonable interruption to the Enemies advance that way. We finde the Towns-people in <hi>Bodman</hi> no wayes fearful of our coming, rather desiring it: They say they have had no Market these two Market dayes, by reason that <hi>Gorings</hi> Horse rob'd the Market people, and take away their Horses. There were two Regiments of Foot and two of Horse sent this morning from their Rendezvouz about nine of the clock, to assist those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at <hi>Ware-Bridge,</hi> where by we might the better drive the Enemy before us into a narrow compasse of Land. At this place where we are, we may see the Sea on both hands; if the Enemy had had any gallantry left in them, they would have shew'd it upon our approach to <hi>Bodman,</hi> their onely strength consisting in Horse, where they had room enough upon the Downs to play their Game, but they never appeared but once, and that at two miles distance, and retreated. I have spoken with some of the Inhabitants of this Town, who were at the grand <hi>Posse</hi> at <hi>Bodman</hi> on Friday last, and they affirm, That of the whole County of Cornwal, there

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39563:5"/>
did not appear Eighty men; but <hi>Gorings</hi> Horse, and the Horse of the County, all appeared in a great body, Those Foot that were in <hi>Bodman,</hi> were some of the Runawayes from <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> and some Welchmen that were left at <hi>Launceston,</hi> and fled hither, and some others of the Countrey, in all to the number of Four hundred at the most, which is the onely body of Infantry they have left that we can yet hear of: the same Intelligencer confirmed, That the Lord <hi>Mahone</hi> is either restrained or wounded by the Lord <hi>Hopton;</hi> yet the certainty thereof, more then the publique report of the Countrey, we cannot yet hear. I doubt it falls out ill we have not a Squadron of Ships towards <hi>Falmouth,</hi> where no doubt they may have rich booty, and intercept persons of great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Several Letters have been sent unto <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to the Commander in chief upon these Coasts; we hope that they will yet come seasonable: The Prince is at <hi>Pendennis,</hi> and I believe within two dayes will be in <hi>France</hi> if the wind hold. The head Quarter was this night at <hi>Bodman;</hi> three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments marched to <hi>Listithiel</hi> to secure the passage that way: the Forlorn hope of Horse that went thither, made the Enemy quit their Guard at <hi>Listithiel;</hi> and receiving Information that four Wain-load of Ammunition was in the way to go from <hi>Listithiel</hi> to <hi>Foy,</hi> six of the Troopers rode after it, and made the Convoy desert their charge, and brought back the four load of Ammunition this night to <hi>Bodman,</hi> there being ten Oxen to every draught: Likewise a party being sent out another way, overtook forty two Musketiers, who had their Matches lighted, and Muskets loaden, four Troopers rode up unto them, and made them all lay down their Arms, and brought them back Prisonets to the head Quarter. Another party was sent towards <hi>Truro,</hi> to discover whether the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse remained in a body, and at Castle-Dennis dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a body of about a thousand  Horse an hour before night, which we conceive onely staid till the darknesse of the night to draw off, after the rest further West; they are so Alarm'd by our parties, that they are forced to keep in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and can hardly go to Quarter, which will quickly make

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39563:6"/>
them weary and over-watcht, and altogether unfit to break through, if they had any such intention, which I believe now they have not: That we keep strong Guards at <hi>Listhiel, War-Bridge,</hi> and the Fords upon both Rivers. Sir <hi>Iohn Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles</hi> Lieutenant Colonel, and divers others are taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</p>
