            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THomas Vincent</hi> a Presbyt. Miniſter is brought in by <hi>G W.</hi> ſaying,—Tho' God ſeparately cannot ſatisfie, becauſe he cannot ſuffer, and Man ſeparately cannot ſatisfie, becauſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction wou'd not be of infinite value, yet as God-man he ſatisfied; to whom <hi>G. W.</hi> thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers—who is it that God cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? Is it himſelf? Can he not ſatisfie or pleaſe himſelf? Is he ever divided or diſpleaſed with himſelf?—Is this any leſs than Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Let but the indifferent judge in this caſe. [Note Reader, how he thus argues againſt the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to Divine Juſtice, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſound Argument for it, uſed by all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians, no leſs than Blaſphemy?</p>
            <p>Again pag. 56. whereas <hi>T. V.</hi> had affirmed that Chriſt as God could not ſuffer; he anſwereth, as to his ſaying, that God cannot ſuffer is in one ſenſe not true, though he intended as to Death, yet the Spirit of God hath ſuffered, and hath been grieved by Man's tranſgreſſions, and for this he cites, <hi>Iſai. 63. 10. Amos 2. 13. Hoſea 11. 8. 9. Pſal. 95. Gen. 6. 6. Pſal. 78. 40. Iſaiah</hi> 1. and 7. 13. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 24. 25.—and he concludes—ſo then ſurely God could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf, ſeeing it was for his own ſake that be blotted out tranſgreſſions, and here the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value, ranſom, and ſatisfaction was in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and what patience, forbearance, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and forgiveneſs, as was ſignified by Chriſt and teſtified of by his outward Suffering and Death) was really in Being in God before, and in the fulneſs of time a ſignal teſtimony thereof given to Man to induce him to receive the free Love and Grace of God, and Life and Salvation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47189:5"/>
in the Son of his Love. [Here Note Reader firſt, that whereas all Orthodox Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all theſe places cited by him here, and other the like places of God, or the Spirit of God being grieved by Men's ſins, God's ſuffering, his repenting, being grieved, being preſſed, being wearied with Men's Sins, metaphorically, but not literally, as where the Scripture ſpeaketh of God's Mouth, Eyes, Ears, Hands and Feet, and ſoles of his Feet, that it is only metaphorically, in condeſcenſion to humane capacity and frailty, and not that God hath really any ſuch bodily Parts or Members; <hi>G. W.</hi> contrary both to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and true Reaſon, and all Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by perverting the Scripture, will needs have it, that God, or the Spirit of God did and doth really ſuffer by Men's Sins, without a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, for the diſpute betwixt <hi>T. V.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> here is about the real ſuffering of God, and not a metaphorical ſuffering, for it was needful that Chriſt did really ſuffer for Men's Sins <note place="margin">And not meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically only.</note>(even as  really as Men ſuffer) and that both in his Soul and Body, in order to which ſuffering, it was needful that Chriſt ſhould be Man, becauſe as God he could not ſuffer, as <hi>T. V.</hi> argued, and tho' Chriſt God-man ſuffered, yet he did not ſuffer in his Godhead at all, or as God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Manhood, and as Man, and his being God, gave the infinite value to his Sufferings as Man, and ſeeing <hi>G. W.</hi> expounds all the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places ſtrictly, and not metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, by the ſame reaſon he is obliged to turn <hi>Muggletonian,</hi> and expound all the places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that mention God's Mouth, Heart, Eyes, Ears, Hands, Feet, ſtrictly and literally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any metaphorical ſenſe; yea, his Notion that God ſuffers really and not metaphorically is as abſurd, as that of <hi>Muggleton,</hi> and neceſſarily infers <hi>Muggletoniſme.</hi> 2. That he makes this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Divine Juſtice, to be altogether in God: and Chriſt's Humanity or Manhood, as he was Born of the Virgin, to have no hand or ſhare in; and yet elſewhere, he renders it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47189:5"/>
abſurd that God ſatisfied God, ſee above num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 2. 3. That he makes God's Forgiveneſs, to be ſignified by Chriſt, and teſtified of by his outward Suffering and Death, in the quotation above given, but not that it was purchaſed by Chriſt, for this he hath diſputed againſt moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly. 4. That tho' <hi>G. W.</hi> in ſome of his late Prints ſeems to own Chriſt's Humanity, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in his late Creed, yet he hath let us know, what he meaneth by it, not the true earthly nature of Man, having had an earthly Body ſuch as Man had, at his Creation, as any part of him. For all ſuch bodily nature (as coming from <hi>humus</hi> the ground, whereof Chriſt conſiſts as Man, he plainly denies in that Book, whereof he is thought the Author, <note n="*" place="margin">Called a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the true Chriſt and his Light in confutation of <hi>R. Cobbet</hi> printed 1668.</note> but if not, the ſecond days Meeting, whereof he is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is accountable for it, being given out by their approbation, and he and they profeſs to be of one Faith, but as humanity ſignifies Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Gentleneſs, Mercifulneſs, as oppoſite to Cruelty, in this laſt ſenſe, he owns Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Judge Reader! can there be a greater fallacy or greater Jeſuitiſh equivocation under Heaven? and in his Chriſtian Quaker he moſt fallaciouſly diſtinguiſheth betwixt Chriſt his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fleſh, and Bones, and conſiſting of it, the word conſiſting only implying his Fleſh, and Bones to be a part of him, and not the whole Chriſt.) 5.

            <p>Again in his p. 11. of his Anſwer to <hi>T. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Synopſis</hi> of Quakeriſme, <hi>T. Danſon</hi> having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that Chriſt did ſatisfie, as well <hi>agendo</hi> as <hi>patiendo</hi> p. 12. To this he anſwers, 1. If ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conſiſts as well <hi>agendo</hi> as <hi>patiendo</hi> are not Chriſt's Inward and Spiritual Operations inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his doing or works for Man's Salvation? How then can Man exclude them? and think himſelf wholly acquitted, and yet in his Sins, by the Suffering and Death of Chriſt without, as a full compenſation, and ſatisfaction in his ſtead? [Note again Reader, how tho' before he placed that ſatisfaction wholly in God, yet now he would divide it, and make one part of it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in what Chriſt did outwardly for us, in his Body of Fleſh, when upon Earth; and another part of that ſatisfaction to conſiſt, in the Inward and Spiritual Operations or Works, which Chriſt worketh in Men, which is groſſer, than any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, or at leaſt, the groſſeſt of any Popery. in this caſe; for tho' the Papiſts maintain, that Men are juſtified by good Works, wrought by the Spirit in them, and which the Spirit helps Men to work, and that theſe good Works are meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of Juſtification, yet we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we ever heard or read, that any of the Popiſh Authors, make the good Works of the Saints, wrought in them by the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, any part of Chriſt's ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, for they diſtinguiſh betwixt Chriſt's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and Men's Juſtification; the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt conſiſting in thoſe Actions and Sufferings of his, which were only his, and wherein Men had no part, nor ſhare, according
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47189:6"/>
to that. Iſaiah 53. <hi>I have tread the Wine-preſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and God hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> But according to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s notion, Men have a part or ſhare in that ſatisfaction, for the good Works that Chriſt by his ſpirit Works in Men, are the Works of Men, and not the Works of Chriſt, or the Spirit only, yea formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they are only the Works of Men, for it is not Chriſt in Men, nor the Spirit, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, repents, obeys, but it's Men that believe, repent, obey by the help of Chriſt and his Spirit, which works of Men, not perfectly anſwering the perfection of God's Law cannot be any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Juſtice. Here he confounds Chriſt's ſatisfaction, which only belongs to Chriſt as his work, without us, and the work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tification needful to be wrought in us, by the help of the Spirit, which ought to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and are plainly diſtinguiſhed both in the Scriptures and generally in Chriſtian Authors; for tho' Men's Sanctification is no part of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Juſtice, yet it is altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to make Men capable of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings purchaſed to Men by Chriſt his ſatisfaction for them.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>G. W.</hi> in his part of the Chriſtian Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, anſwers to his opponent, having ſaid, that Sin itſelf cannot cauſe God to alter his purpoſe, <note place="margin">p. 270.</note> 
               <hi>this he ſays,</hi> is not only a great miſtake to ſay, Sin cannot cauſe God to alter his purpoſe, (as in this caſe) but alſo gives a great liberty to Hypocrites, who believe they are eternally Elect Perſons, to continue in Sin and Preſumption; and he plainly aſſerts that God's declared thought or intention may be altered, as the condition of Men changeth from evil to good, or from good to evil, for which he cites <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Note Reader, how <hi>G. W.</hi> who is ſo ready to charge his Opponents with Blaſphemy, is guilty of it too much, making God, like mortal Men not only capable of ſuffering, but of altering and changing his thoughts and purpoſes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him mutable, with whom there is no varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47189:7"/>
nor ſhadow of turn, grounding his falſe notion on his perverſion of <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 3, 4, 5, 6. as if it were to be underſtood ſtrictly, and after the manner of Men, which ought to be underſtood in a metaphorical ſenſe only; and is there no other way, to deal with Hypocrites, and beat them out of their falſe hopes, and perſuaſions, but by rendring the unchangeable God, like to changeable Men. If it be once granted, that God's Thoughts, and Counſels, and Purpoſes can be changed, we have no certainty, but that his whole declared Word, and revealed Will may be changed, yea, not only what he hath promiſed, but what he hath ſworn may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which is expreſly contrary to Scripture, that ſaith, that both his Word and his Oath are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, and if ſo, then ſurely his Thoughts <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> are no leſs immutable, yea the immutability of his Counſel is expreſly mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. his <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> gifts and calling are without Repentance, his Counſels of old are Faithfulneſs and Truth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25. 2. his Word is for ever ſetled in Heaven.—Again, for the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſanull it? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 27. But according to <hi>G. W.</hi> Men can and do often diſanull it, and change it; as for the inſtances in Scripture of either promiſes not performed, or threatnings not executed, they were and are conditional, and do all either expreſs or imply ſome condition, not in the will and purpoſe of God, but in Men, whoſe conditions do oft change, and therefore the veracity of God is ſufficiently demonſtrated, without any change or ſhadow of change in the Thoughts or Purpoſes of God. And indeed ſuch who hold that God can change his Thoughts and Purpoſes, muſt conſequentially hold that he has not an infallible and perfect knowledge of all future things, and accordingly ſuch who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly hold the laſt, hold the firſt; for if Men had an infallible knowledge of future events, they had no need to change their thoughts, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Men's thoughts and deſigns, do naturally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47189:7"/>
proceed from their want of the knowledge of future events, but no ſuch defect can be in God, and therefore no change, all manner of change being contrary to the Nature of his Infinite perfection.</p>

            <p>In the Concluſion, the more ſincerely minded among the People called Quakers are earneſtly requeſted, that they would effectually deal with thefe two Men. <hi>G.

Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſhould be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the importunity of the more ſincere-hearted among that People, and that God ſhould turn their hearts, to ſo good a work, as fairly and freely to retract their former Errors, and either diſown their former Books, or make an
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47189:8"/>
               <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> to purge out whatever is a miſs in them, their Example (being the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal leading Men now among the Quakers, ſince the deceaſe of <hi>G.
