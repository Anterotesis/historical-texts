            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
PROPOSAL
For Amending the
Silver Coins
OF
ENGLAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving often reflected on the
Misfortunes, that the Clipping
Counterfeiting, and Melting
down of the Silver Coin of <hi>England</hi>
would bring on this Nation; and fore-seeing
that I should be involved in the
same as a Member of the Society; I
thought it my Duty to bestow some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in the thoughts of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to find out a proper Remedy for
that Publick Disease, being encouraged
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37772:3"/>
by the Insight I have had already
into that matter, having had an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to apply my self to know the
different Standards of Gold and Silver,
either in Ingot, or in Current Coin.</p>
            <p>I fram'd then a Project about two
Years ago, in which I had always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Eyes the great Difficulty of
finding out a sufficient Fund to carry
on the War, and supplying the Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of amending our Silver Coins. 'Tis
true, the Distemper was not then so
great as it is at present, but I thought
it ought speedily to be remedied, for
fear it should become worse, if I may
say, not uncurable. I considered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with my self all the Objections
that, I think, are made at this day;
and, I hope, I have removed them as
much as is possible, humanly speaking.
However, I grant, that there are in this
Case such Difficulties as will never be
removed, if no Body will contribute
towards it, as for Example; 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
our old Coin is hardly worth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37772:3"/>
half of its first value, and if every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will have the old Species changed
for new ones of the same Weight,
Standard, and Price, as the old was
made for, and will not at the
same time contribute any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it under pretence of the Taxes
he is obliged to pay, to carry on the
War; I don't know how they may be
satisfied unless one should have the
power of making something of nothing,
or the rare Secret so much inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of converting our Lead into Gold
or Silver. But if Men were more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and were once sensible of the
Inconveniences that bad Mony brings
into their Trade, and of the loss they
suffer daily by the diminution of the
Coin, they would (rather than be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Trust or Exchange) earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the King and Parliament to find
out, in their Wisdom, a proper Remedy
for that Disease, and instead of repining
at the very name of Taxes, for that
purpose, they would cheerfully offer to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37772:4"/>
pay them; for the Amendment of our
Silver Coin will appear to any Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, a necessary Thing to secure
our Riches, establish our Prosperity,
and enable us to carry on this War with
more Vigour, and less Charge.</p>
            <p>But if Men will shut their Eyes
against their own Interest, must we be
always in this deplorable Condition? I
don't think so, and I make bold to say,
that His Majesty and the Two Houses
of Parliament are to the rest of the
Nation, what a good Father is to his
Child: And now supposing that a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had suffered his Child to be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times let Blood by way of Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to preserve his Health; would
it not be a very odd thing if he should
refuse to suffer him to be let Blood
once more to dissipate a Flux, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Judgment of the best
Physicians, would infallibly deprive him
of his Sight? Sure I am, that no good
Father would give ear to the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Apprehensions his Child should
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37772:4"/>
have of the Chirurgions Lancet. The
Application is easy enough, but, I hope,
it is needless; for, I think, I see a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Disposition in the Nation, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body seems resolved to pay what
Taxes shall be found necessary to free
our selves from the innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that attend the badness of
our Coin.</p>
            <p>This Disposition ought to Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
all Friends and true Lovers of
<hi>England,</hi> to impart all they know of
this Matter, so that their Projects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compar'd together, the best
and the most easy way might be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
out of them, for the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Silver Coin. The Right
Honourable the Lords of the Treasury
have given us a good Example, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
some Ingenious Gentlemen to
give their Opinions concerning several
Projects, and ordering Mr. <hi>Lownds</hi> their
Secretary to make a Report of the same,
with his own Thoughts on the Case,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37772:5"/>
which he has performed with a great
deal of Ingenuity and Accuracy.</p>
            <p>It was from this Motive, that I made
bold to present on the Fourth of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
last, to the Lords of the Treasury,
a <hi>Project for Reforming our Coin;</hi> which
since that time, I have laboured to
improve and illustrate, by answering
all the Difficulties and Objections, that
I thought could be made against it.
I have also examined the various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of those who have written on
that Subject, and perused almost all the
Projects that were given the last Session
of Parliament. It would be useless,
and too tedious to make particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
on those Projects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I'll content my self with these few
General Propositions.</p>
            <p>I. That an Ounce of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the same Weight and
Standard, has in all parts in the
World the same Intrinsick value,
as here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37772:5"/>
II. That the Denomination of the
pieces of Gold and Silver, or the
raising or the lowering their
current Price, adds nothing to the
Intrinsick value thereof; as for
Example, If the Piece we call a
Crown, was raised from five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to ten Shillings, or lowered
to 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> it is always the same
Piece, there is no more and no
less Silver in it, and its Allay is
neither courser nor finer.</p>
            <p>III. If its Intrinsick value be always
the same; 'tis plain that Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will take our Coin according
to it, and not according to its
Denomination.</p>
            <p>VI. That our Coin being taken by
Foreigners only according to its
Intrinsick value, they give their
Commodities in Exchange, in
Proportion to the same.</p>
            <p>V. That they take our Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in Exchange for theirs, or for
Gold or Silver proportionably, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37772:6"/>
to the Estimation they
make of our Coins, <hi>viz.</hi> according
to its Intrinsick value.</p>
            <p>VI. That the Exchange with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries is always fixed
and settled, (or with a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
difference, sometimes
more sometimes less, according to
what we owe them, or they owe
us) when the Value, Weight, and
Standard of the Coins are settled.</p>
            <p>VII. That Foreigners make a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
profit upon us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the uncertainty of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of our Clipt Mony, and have
a great advantage in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
taking the occasion from
the badness of our Mony.</p>
            <p>From these Observations it follows,
that the raising or lowering our Coin,
is nothing to the Riches of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but that it is highly necessary to
melt down all the Clipt Mony, to make
new Coins, which may not be Clipped,
and to fix its Weight and Standard,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37772:6"/>
and then all the Commodities, both
of our own Country, and Foreign;
and the Exchange will in a short time
fall proportionably to its Intrinsick
value.</p>
            <p>There is no sensible Man, but will,
I am sure, own this Consequence, and
that it is time to do it, the Disease
growing every day worse and worse;
but the great Difficulty is to find out a
Practicable Way in this time of War.
I must confess this is a weighty one,
but, I hope, the Project which I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
last Year to the Lords of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
will make it appear to be very
possible, and therefore I offer it again
with some Additions, in Relation to
the Present Time.</p>
            <p>I don't presume however, that this
Project should be the only one by
which our Coins may be amended,
seeing I have since that time made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
which I have annexed to my
former, to shew that I am very willing
to impart whatever I know on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37772:7"/>
and, I think, as I said before,
that every true <hi>English-man</hi> ought to
do the like.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A PROPOSAL to have all
the Silver Mony of England Melted
down, and made New, and to be of the
same Weight and Standard, as the
New Mill'd Mony now is, or of more;
and that the Loss which thereby will
happen to those who have Clipt Mony,
will be so inconsiderable, that even they
themselves shall be willing to bring in
their Mony to be new Coined, and that
the Diminution of the Numerical quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

Melting it down, will be more than

               <p>WHereas the Crown Piece, or

from whence it follows, that upon

Loss cannot be mended by the usual
ways, but by a General Tax, (which
is not seasonable in this time of War)
or by Means that are not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Grandeur of this Nation,
as the lessening of the Weight of the
Coin, without increasing the Price
thereof; or the lessening of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
by mixing of Copper or other
Allay; or lastly, in setting an higher
value than <hi>Five Shillings,</hi> or <hi>Sixty
Pence</hi> to the said Crown Piece. And

               <p n="6">VI. In order to encourage People to

               <p>Whereas in the Two Years Melting,
Contentions may probably arise about

               <p>Who shall be called Mint-Bankers, or
Changers. Those of <hi>London</hi> shall send
every Week the old Coin to the <hi>Tower</hi>
to receive new; and those of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
every Month, unless it is thought
fit to erect new Mints in several parts of
<hi>England,</hi> as it has been done formerly
in such a Case.</p>
               <p>And for the Ease of those Bankers,
and of the Mint too, (which shall not
be able to Coin Mony enough to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
those that shall carry in their old
Mony) all the Sums under 10 <hi>l.</hi> shall
be paid in new Coin, but the Sums
above that, shall be paid in Bills, half
upon the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> and half
upon the <hi>Million Bank.</hi> Therefore all
those Mint-Bankers, or Changers, shall
give to the King Security of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pounds each, and each of them
may draw at two days Sight upon the
General Register-keeper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> payable in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37772:16"/>
Banks, as far as the said Sum of Ten
Thousand Pounds, and no more.</p>
               <p>The Banks are to be paid every
Month, more or less, as the new Coin
shall be made; so that they shall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
more at one time than <hi>130000l.</hi>
and the Interest thereof shall be paid
after the Rate of Three <hi>per Cent per
Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in Consideration of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
when the Banks shall carry their
old Mony to be exchanged, they shall
have the benefit of the Coinage weight
for weight; but they shall tarry Three
Months to receive their Payments in
new Mony, without any allowance of
Interest.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is to be considered by the
Parliament, that if His Majesty by a
special Love to his Subjects, will take
upon him such a good Thing for the
Nation; He shall be at extraordinary
great Charges for two or three Years
together. Therefore in Consideration,
that His Majesty shall make good the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37772:16"/>
Loss of the old Coin, from 15 Penny-weight
to 10 dw. for Three-pence for
every Penny-weight, which will cost
him more, and also Pay a great many
new <hi>Officers,</hi> that shall be employed for
that purpose; besides the Sixteen-pence
Half-penny that he pays for the Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of every Pound Weight of Silver,
to which Expences the Act for Coinage,
nor any other Benefit arising by this
Project, can suffice. 'Tis Necessary,
that the Parliament should allow Fifty
Thousand Pounds a Year, for Three
Years only; and a Register shall be
kept at the <hi>Tower,</hi> wherein all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Charges shall be entred, and
the Parliament is to Promise to make
the Loss good, in case it shall appear
by the said Register, that the King is
a Looser.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THose who will be at the pains
to peruse my Project with any
Attention, will easily perceive that I
propose, 1. To Melt down all the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Coins of <hi>England:</hi> 2. To make
new Milled Mony: 3. To have the
said new Milled Mony of the same
Standard as the former, <hi>viz.</hi> 11 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
2 dw. Fine, and 18 dw. Allay: 4.
To have the new Milled Mony of the
same Weight at least, as the now Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mony is, <hi>viz.</hi> The Crown of 19
dw. 254833/1000000 parts, or 19 dw. 8 gr. and
a half a little more; and the Pound
Weight, or 12 Ounces of Silver Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
to be cut in 62 Shillings, 124
Six-pences, 186 Four-penny Pieces, 372
Two-penny Pieces, and 744 One-penny
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37772:17"/>
Pieces, if thought fit to make such
small Silver Pieces, which, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it is better to defer, till the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be supplied with a reasonable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of new Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Six-pences: 5. That the loss
of the Owners of the Mony shall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inconsiderable: 6. That they shall
bring in their Mony very willingly to
be new Coined, and 7. That the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the Numerical Quantity of
the old Species, will be more than sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
I don't question in the least, but
that my Project will seem at first to be
impracticable, but, I hope, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
very possible, if carefully examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and especially with the few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
here set down.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I see so many People who declare
against the Raising of our Coin; that,
I think, it is necessary first of all to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the Reasons I have to
demand, that the new Crowns should
be Current for Two Years at 6 <hi>s.</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37772:18"/>
8 <hi>d.</hi> I have laid down as an Axiom, at
the beginning of this Writing; that
the Denomination of the Species of
Gold or Silver, do not change their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Value; and that therefore the
Nation is neither the richer nor poorer,
by raising or lowering the <hi>Coin,</hi> I propose
then to raise the Crown Pieces to <hi>6s. 8d.</hi>
for Two Years, for the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
1. To make the Loss that will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
by Clipt and Brass Mony less sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the Owners thereof: 2. That
Guineas may fall by degrees from the
extravagant Price they have been raised
to; for if they should fall at once from
30 <hi>s.</hi> to 21 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> as they must do
whenever we have good Silver Mony,
and its Price fixed at 5 <hi>s.</hi> an Ounce, it
would be a great Loss to many Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and other People, because for this
Twelve-Month past we have seen hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any other Mony but Guineas: 3.
Because People are already disposed to
it; and had it not been for an Act of
Parliament, they would have certainly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37772:18"/>
raised the Milled Crowns thereabout
to that price, proportionably to the
price of Gold: 4. I have fixed it to
6 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> rather than to 6 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> without
any other Mystery, but because that
price is devisible by equal quantities of
Pence, Farthings, and accommodated
to the present denominations of Crowns,
Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and also to the Species
of Gold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the First Article of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
wherein, I say, there is about one
third part of our Coin lost by Clipping.
I know that some Ingenious Men are of
another opinion, and that they pretend
that there is abundance of old Mony
unclipt hoarded up; I wish it may
prove so, but that is so far from being
an Objection to my Project, that it
makes it more easy. I own, I have
supposed the thing at the worst, but a
Table hereunto annexed, will make it
more plain, and therein I have calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
how many Ounces of Silver we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37772:19"/>
want to make good the Loss. When
I Presented my Project to the Lords of
the Treasury, I supposed there was but
Four Millions and a half of Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in <hi>England,</hi> but upon better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
I have thought I might suppose
Five.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I demand two Years time to melt
down all the old Silver Coin of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to make the new, for the
following Reasons, 1. Because it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to have Mints enough to do it in
a shorter time, 2. Supposing there
should be Mints enough, yet it would
be necessary to allow two Years time,
for if there was but one allowed, the
price of Silver, which must fall gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
should fall too suddenly, <hi>viz.</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Six Months; and so the Inhabitants
of the remotest Counties from <hi>London</hi>
should hardly have time enough to be
acquainted with it: 3. I grant that
there is no time to be lost in this Affair,
but too great a Precipitation may be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37772:19"/>
liable to as great Inconvenience, as a
Delay; and after all, People must have
time to carry their old Mony to the
Mint, and the Mint must have time to
Coin it. It will be well enough, if we
are in the mean time supplied with new
Coin for Sums not exceeding 10 <hi>l.</hi> and
Bills upon the Banks for greater ones by
the Changers, as it is in my Proposal,
for this answers all our wants,</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is just, and more convenient,
that the Mint should take the old Coin
rather by Weight, than by any other
way; and it will be a greater Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for the King and the Nation, that
in the Books appointed for that purpose
at the Mint, or in the hands of the
Changers; there should be several
Columns, whereof one should be for
the Weight, and the others for the old
Estimation in Pounds, Shillings and
Pence.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:37772:20"/>
6. It is proposed, that the old Mony
be taken in Current Payments at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rate, the better to carry on our
Trade till we have new Mony enough.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I suppose the new Crown to weigh
a full Ounce, though I know it does
weigh only 19 dw. 8 gr. and a half,
which makes an Allowance of about
3 and one third <hi>per Cent,</hi> for the Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the Stamp; so that if a Pound
Weight of Silver Standard, valued at
Three Pound is cut, as it is usual in 62
Shillings, a Pound and eight Ounces of
Silver, which will cost but 5 <hi>l.</hi> will
make 103 Shillings and Four-pence in
Number, though they be but of the
same weight. I say, that an old Crown
weighing 15 dw. is to be Current, and
taken at the Mint for Five Shillings,
which is a necessary Consequence from
what I said at first concerning the Price
of Silver, for if a new Crown weighing
an Ounce is worth 6 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> an old
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37772:20"/>
Crown of Silver Standard of 15 dw.
must by the same reason be worth 5 <hi>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Silver is the Center of Trade,
and all things in the World, either
Lands, Houses, Goods, Diamonds, and
other Commodities, are but its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference;
so that if the price of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is not fixed, 'tis impossible to make
a just Estimation of Commodities, as
it is impossible to say how far the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
is from the Center, if the
Center be not fixed.</p>
               <p>'Tis then highly necessary to fix the
price of Silver in <hi>Quantity, Quality,</hi> and
<hi>Estimation,</hi> either Coined or not Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The price of <hi>Quantity</hi> of Silver
not Coined, is fixed in <hi>England</hi> by the
Weight of a Pound containing 12
Ounces <hi>Troy,</hi> the Ounce of 20 <hi>dw.,</hi> and
the <hi>dw.</hi> of 24 <hi>gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The price of <hi>Quantity</hi> of Silver Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is fixed from a number of Pieces
that the King orders to be cut from a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37772:21"/>
Pound Weight of Silver, as 12 Crowns,
62 Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The price of <hi>Quality</hi> of Silver not
Coined, is fixed by the Assay that is
made to know whether it is better or
worse than Standard.</p>
               <p>And of Silver Coined, by the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of the same, which is 11 Ounces
2 <hi>dw.</hi> Fine, 18 <hi>dw.</hi> Allay.</p>
               <p>The price of <hi>Estimation</hi> of Silver
Coined, is fixed by Publick Authority,
being ordered that a Crown Piece
weighing 19 <hi>dw. 8 gr. ½</hi> be esteemed
Five Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the price of <hi>Estimation</hi> of Silver
not Coined, is not fixed in <hi>England,</hi> and
I think, it is absolutely necessary to fix
it.</p>
               <p>As to the Price of <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of Silver, I believe it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
difficult, if not impossible, to fix it
in a better way, than it is now, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the least Alteration in this Case
would be liable to many Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37772:21"/>
but as to the Price of <hi>Estimation</hi>
of Silver not Coined, I see no reason
why it should it be Arbitrary rather than
the Estimation of Silver Coined, and if it
be prohibited to sell a Crown (weighing
19 <hi>dw. 8 gr.</hi> that is to say, within a
small matter of an Ounce) above Five
Shillings; I would fain know why an
Ounce of Silver not Coined of the
same Standard as the Crown, should
be sold for Six Shillings and Six-pence?
As long as the thing continues so, there
is no doubt but the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> will melt
down all the Milled Mony that falls
into their hands, for the Profit is clear.
But if the Price of Estimation of Silver
not Coined is once fixed, and that it
be prohibited to sell or buy above the
Price set upon it by Law, (they may
sell it under if they please) and that
the Estimation of the Silver Coined be
proportionable to it, which are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
difference for the Stamp of
3 ¼ or 3 ⅓ <hi>per Cent.</hi> as it is now, we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37772:22"/>
need not fear that our Coin will be
melted down; no Body shall have the
least Temptation towards it, and the
Reason is very plain, for Silver in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
will be then as cheap and cheaper,
as the Silver Coined, of 3⅓ <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is enough to shew how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
it is to fix the Price of the Ounce
of Silver, but I must remove an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
that Clippers and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
with them, are like to make in
name of Merchants that Trade in
Gold and Silver, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the
price of Silver is lower in <hi>England</hi>
than in other Countries, no body
will Import Bullion, but rather will
Export all the Coin they Can. This
may appear specious to those who
have not well considered that the
price of all Commodities both of
our own and Foreign Countries is
always proportionable to the Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Value of Silver, and not to the
Denomination of the Species of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37772:22"/>
same, and so Foreigners will then
Barter their Silver with us, for our
Commodities, as much as they did
before, with this only difference, that
the Estimation of Commodities, and
the Estimation of Silver will be low,
then more proportionable, more just,
and more certain. It is not to be
wondered why Bankers, Goldsmiths,
Refiners and the like, should make
their Endeavours to hinder the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of the price of Silver Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
every body knows that this
is against their private Interest, for
they are a sort of People who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themselves to the cost of the
Nation.</p>
               <p>I humbly conceive that it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Necessary to fix the price of
the Ounce of Silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Standard at
Five Shillings, for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to prevent the Melting
down of our Coin; but for the
Reasons contained in my first Proposal,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37772:23"/>
and in these Additions, I thought, it
was Necessary to raise now our
Coin, <hi>viz.</hi> The Crown Piece to Six-Shillings
and Eight-pence, to reduce
it afterwards by degrees to Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which must be after Two
Years, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 25th of <hi>March
1696,</hi> to the 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1698,
that the same Price shall be fixed for a
Crown Piece, and an Ounce of Silver.
It would be very necessary also to fix the
Price of Gold, so that it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exceed Sixteen times the Value
of Silver, Weight for Weight.</p>
               <p>I own, that there is a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objection against the raising and
lowering of our Coin, and which it
is impossible to avoid in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the World, and this concerns
the Leases of Estates, that are made
for a long time, for in this Case
the Land-lord must lose or get con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably;
However, as I demand
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37772:23"/>
but Two Years Time, I think, no
body will grumble at it, especially
if a Man considers how much he
loses every Day, and the trouble
he is perpetually put to, by reason
of the Badness of our Coin.</p>

that ought to Weigh Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Ounces, and shall Weigh but
200 or 50 Pounds, the said Man shall
receive Ten pounds in new Coin, and
Forty pound in <hi>Bills</hi> upon the Banks,
payable to the Bearer, and for the
other Fifty, that would be Loss to
him, were it not provided for, he
shall receive a Note for the same up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Banks, which shall be
exchanged with Bank <hi>Bills</hi> bearing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Two-pence a Day for one Year.</p>
               <p>7. And for the Re-payment of the
said Banks, it shall be provided by the
Parliament a sufficient Fond to re-pay
in One Years time the Sum of Five
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37772:28"/>
Hundred Thousand Pounds, and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Thousand Pounds more for the
Interest thereof after the Rate of Six
<hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. To Encourage those who have
Plate or Foreign Bullion, to carry it
to the Mint, to be Coined, such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are to have the Benefit of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
which is 3⅓ or 3¼ <hi>per Cent.</hi> viz.
Weight for Weight, Standard Silver
and Gold.</p>
               <p>9. And to prevent people from
Melting the old Coin, to carry it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to the Mint to receive the
Advantage of 3¼ or 3⅓ <hi>per Cent.</hi> (which
Benefit is designed to help to bear the
Charges of the clipt Mony.) All Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
that shall not be Marked at the
<hi>Tower</hi> (as it is largely expressed in my
First <hi>Proposal)</hi> shall be deemed Coin
of <hi>England</hi> Melted, and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
esteemed 3⅓ <hi>per Cent.</hi> worse than
Standard, and for such taken accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
at the Mint.</p>

10. Now to supply in part the Loss
that will happen to the Publick, by
reason of the Clipt Mony, which will
amount to Fifteen Hundred Thousand
Pound or thereabouts, as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by a Computation hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
I have thought fit to propose
the following New <hi>Million Adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. There will be delivered a Hundred
Thousand Tickets at Ten Pound a piece,
in the same way as they were delivered
in the first Million Adventure.</p>
               <p>2. Old Crown-pieces, Half-Crowns,
Shillings, Six-pences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
under the degree adove-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
shall be taken for Tickets, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Ten Pounds of that Clipt Mony
weigh together Fifteen Ounces, (tho'
they ought to weigh Thirty Eight
Ounces 14 <hi>dw. 4 gr.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Twenty Pounds of Counterfeited
Mony, shall be judged Equivalent to
Ten Pound of Clipt Mony, and taken
for one Ticket, unless the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfeited
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37772:29"/>
Mony should be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
bad, which must be left to the
Discretion of those whose who shall be
appointed to deliver Tickets.</p>
               <p>4. In Consideration of the said Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
arising by an Hundred Thousand
Tickets, at Ten Pound a piece, it will
be provided a Fond of an Hundred
and Twenty Thousand Pound a Year,
which shall be divided into Prizes and
Blanks as follows;

And for the Hundred Thousand
Pound remaining, they are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for paying the Blank Tickets at
Twenty Shillings a Year each, for sixteen
Years together, as in the <hi>Million Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
of 1694, and for the Charges
of the same.</p>
               <p>It remains only to pay the two Banks
of the Five Hundred Thousand Pound
advanced by them, and for that, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this <hi>Proposal,</hi> has a Project rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at hand, to raise that Sum, as also
the Hundred Thousand Pound for the
Yearly Rent of the <hi>Million Adventure,</hi>
which he has not thought fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
here. The Computation hereunto
annexed, will shew what Charges the
Nation must be at, besides this new
<hi>Million Adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would I deal with others, as I was
dealt by in the first <hi>Million Adventure,</hi>
of which I can boast I was the <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
Though <hi>tulit alter honores,</hi> I should
say, that I am the <hi>Contriver</hi> of this, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37772:30"/>
I act by other Principles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I own, that Major <hi>Hayens,</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> is the first who
has Invented how to apply such a Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to the Mending of the Coin, and
I add nothing to it, but that Twenty
Pound of counterfeited Mony ought
to be Equivalent to Ten Pound of clipt
Mony, and taken for a Ticket in this
<hi>Adventure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what I have said, it follows,
that the Publick shall lose nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
clipt Mony, and it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they should be no losers by
Guineas; but besides the Difficulty of
the Thing, there is no Justice that the
State should make good the loss of
Eight Shillings and above upon every
Guinea, seeing they have been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to that extravagant Price against
the general consent of the Nation, as
it is plain from an Act of Parliament
passed last Sessions, to prevent Clipping.
The King has got nothing by it, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37772:30"/>
on the contrary has lost very much,
and therefore it is but just that those
who have got by raising the Price of
Gold, should now suffer by lowering
of the same.</p>
               <p>The Prejudice which the King and
the Nation in general have suffered
by the high price of Guineas, may be
well guessed at by this only Instance,
<hi>viz.</hi> That whereas Six Millions were
sufficient for the Charges of the War,
when Guineas were at 21 <hi>s. 6 d.,</hi> Nine
Millions or very little less, are now
absolutely Necessary to bear the very
same Charges; Cloath, and all other
Commodities having been raised in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to Guineas. This Observation
by the by sheweth that we lose every
Year to no purpose, twice as much as
it will cost us once for all to reform our
Coin.</p>
               <p>However, to help the Publick as
much as possible, I make bold to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that Guineas be lowered by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37772:31"/>
according to the Table annexed
to my first Project, <hi>viz.</hi> every Three
Months, and so that Guineas be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the First of <hi>Ianuary 1695/6,</hi>
to the First <hi>April</hi> 1696, at 28 <hi>s. 8 d.,</hi>
From the First of <hi>April</hi> to the First of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> at 26 <hi>s. 10 d.;</hi> From the First
of <hi>Iuly</hi> to the First of <hi>October,</hi> at 25 <hi>s.
1 d.;</hi> And from the First of <hi>October</hi> to
the First of <hi>Ianuary 1696/7,</hi> at 23 <hi>s. 3 d. ½;</hi>
and thenceforth, that no Body presume
to take them above the Price of 21 <hi>s.
6 d.</hi> This will prevent many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
but let the Parliament fix the
Price of Guineas, or not, they must
needs fall to 21 <hi>s. 6 d.,</hi> as soon as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is fixed at 5 <hi>s.</hi> an Ounce.</p>
               <p>I have considered this Matter these
Three Years since, and though what
I propose be directly against my own
private Interest; I think, it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Necessity for the Honour and
general Interest of the Nation to melt
down our old Clipt Mony, and make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37772:31"/>
new Coin of the same Standard, Weight
and Price as the former; and when
that is done, and our Trade and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
secured, I question not to see
<hi>England</hi> the happiest Country in the
World, which is my Hearts desire.</p>
