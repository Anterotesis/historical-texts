            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whole Fleets fraughted with Adventures are Arrived from thence; and <hi>Love,</hi> that was never thought to be the Province of thoſe People, in whom, Cruelty is as Natural as Living, has a greater Influence there, than in any other part of the World. His moſt Secret My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are Revealed to them; and there is no manner of Cunning, Stratagem, Delicacy, or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, for the Carrying on a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Adventure, but what that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we have ever looked upon with ſome kind of Horrour, does put in Practice. In a word, <hi>Barbary,</hi> which in all other things is rightly called by that Name, is the moſt refin'd part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in point of <hi>Love:</hi> as if this <hi>God</hi> had taken Delight to make Proſelytes of ſo Barbarous a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo unfit to be His Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

               <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Tripoly</hi> being Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in the very Capital City of His Territories, by a Famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel called <hi>Sidi. Ackmet-Benoc,</hi> was reduced to the Neceſſity of having Recourſe to <hi>Caragus</hi> King of <hi>Tunis</hi>; with whom, though His Brother in Law, His Correſpondence for ſome time had not been very great. He Reſolved to ſend Him a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Embaſſy, for the engaging Him to free him out of ſo ſevere an Extremity. The Forces of that Rebel, who had Subdued almoſt all the <hi>Moors</hi> of the Country, were in ſuch a Poſture, as that He muſt neceſſarily have loſt all, unleſs He received ſpeedy Succours. But that His Deſign might have the better Succeſs; He Fancied, His beſt way would be to give that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Sultana</hi> His Wife, who was that King's Siſter; and being a Witty Woman, and having great Power over Her Brother, She might with the leſs Difficulty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110751:4"/>
Him on His Side. All things were quickly prepared for this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Three of the fineſt Ships of <hi>Tripoly</hi> were Ordered to Convoy the <hi>Sultana</hi>; for only the Sea was open and free, and all thoſe who were to attend Her in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, being imbarked, they ſet Sail in the fineſt Seaſon imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and Arrived in Five or Six Days at the Port of <hi>Mahometa,</hi> which is two Days Journey from <hi>Tunis.</hi> The King having had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Her Coming, went to Receive Her in that City; their Interview was full of Joy and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. <hi>Caragus</hi> loved His Siſter extreamly, and ſeemed unable to expreſs the great Delights He took in ſeeing Her. The <hi>Sultana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naturally of a very Careſſing Humour, and having no leſs Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Her Brother, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable enough to make returns to all His Kindneſſes, according as the Occaſion of Her Embaſſy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110751:4"/>
Required. There was no Talk of Buſineſs during the firſt Day; She was wholly took up with Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Careſſes, and in asking general News, that are the firſt Diſcourſes that uſually furniſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in ſuch Occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahometa</hi> is a ſmall Town, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unfit to entertain Perſons of that Rank; But the Grandees of that Country, who never Travel without their Tents, are alwayes well Lodged, whereſoever they come. The King had Cauſed One of the Richeſt and Fineſt that had been ſeen, to be prepared for the <hi>Sultana.</hi> He had no ſooner learnt the next Day that She might be ſeen, than that He went to make Her a Viſit. The <hi>Sultana</hi> having Notice of it, and being willing to make uſe of the good Diſpoſitions She ſaw in Her Brother, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared (as is the Cuſtome of the Country) the Preſents She was to make Him; amongſt which were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110751:5"/>
two Slaves, the one a Jeweſs, the other a Chriſtian, both of them were Young, very agreeable and perfect Beauties. The Jeweſs was the livelier of the two, and ſeemed to have a great deal of Wit; which made the <hi>Sultana</hi> fancy, that Her Brother would like her better than the Chriſtian; who, though very Waggiſh at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and no leſs Cunning than the other had an Air ſomething more ſerious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caragus</hi> coming thereupon to His Siſter, found Her in an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Magnificence in the midſt of all theſe Fine and Rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents She brought Him, and which She offered Him at His Entrance.</p>
            <p>The King after having highly Valued, and extreamly Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them: Received them with all the Acknowledgement as became the Affection He had for His Siſter: But She told Him, they were not the Fineſt, and that She had ſtill
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110751:5"/>
ſomething more rare to give Him: Whereupon She Cauſed the two Beautiful Slaves to come out; at the ſight of whom, <hi>Caragus</hi> was immediately Charmed; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally what ſuted beſt with His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and His Siſter knowing His Amorous Complection, had not without Reaſon, kept this Preſent for the laſt. He Eyed them both for ſome time, without ſaying a word; and both extreamly pleaſed Him. The Chriſtian, However contrary to the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Charmed Him moſt. They were Both of them Dreſſed very Magnificently, and after the <hi>Franca</hi> Mode: Inſomuch, that the Beauty and particular Merit of each of them, could only determine the Choice. The King declared His mind immediately to His Siſter, who could not forbear telling the Fair Chriſtian. This Cruelly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jeweſs; but ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe had wherewith to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110751:6"/>
her ſelf, for the Happineſs of her Rival, having been Choſen to be ſent to the Grand Siegniors <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> whoſe Favourite ſhe was. Her Reign however did not laſt long, by Reaſon of a certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, more uſual to Fair, than Black Women.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caragus</hi> would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well ſatisfied with His Siſters Preſents, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with that of thoſe two Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Slaves, if He might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it, as well as the others: But the Aſcendant of His Amours, did not ſute in His Birth with that of Marriage; and though Nature had endowed Him with Gifts, and Inclinations that were diſpoſed to Pleaſures; yet it had not given Him a Heart that could reſiſt the Sallies of a Jealous, and an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Wife. He was Married to the <hi>Sultana Homais,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportably Nice in that Point; and He knew not how He ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110751:6"/>
make Her allow the Preſents of thoſe two Slaves, who were ſo Beautiful, as that they could not fail of making a Woman Jealous, who was ſo ſometimes for no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all. Not that She had too much Paſſion for the King; Her Mind was only filled with Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Glory had in Her the Effect, that Love has in the Hearts of other Women. Inſomuch, that they were very much perplexed how to find out the Means, that that haughty Princeſs might ſuffer (without murmuring) thoſe two Fair Creatures in the <hi>Seraglio. Roſtan Baſhaw</hi> a Witty Man, having been long in great Favour with the King, who was wholly led by his Counſels, was Conſulted in this Affair; and his Opinion was, that the beſt Courſe would be that the <hi>Sultana</hi> Her ſelf ſhould offer thoſe two Slaves to the Queen. But She knowing the Spirit and Humour of that Princeſs, excuſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110751:7"/>
Her ſelf from it; and deſired the King not to expoſe Her to be ill Received by the Queen, with whom She was altogether unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have the leaſt Diſpute; and indeed, the King did not think it Convenient She ſhould. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Roſtan,</hi> promiſing himſelf a great deal of Pleaſure in thus ſpigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Woman whom he had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hate, offered to preſent them himſelf, either as from the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or from the King. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Caragus</hi> approve of this deſign, knowing the Averſion they had for one another; and ſaid, He would Himſelf think of ſome other Means. Then they fell to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Affairs of <hi>Tripoli</hi>; and <hi>Rostan</hi> being already Gained by the <hi>Sultana,</hi> ſeconded Her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and made the King promiſe Her all manner of Succours, and that he would forget all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Complaint, He had had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> Her Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110751:7"/>Nothing of Importance was done in the Kingdom, but what the Queen would have a ſhare in; and having had Notice as well as the King of the <hi>Sultana</hi> of <hi>Tripoli's</hi> Coming, and of the Occaſion of Her Embaſſy, She reſolved to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the King to <hi>Mahometa,</hi> that She might oppoſe or favour the <hi>Baſhaw's</hi> Deſign, according as the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſhould Carry Her ſelf to Her. But She no ſooner learnt of what Nature one of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents was, that She had newly made Her Brother, than that She fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Paſſion againſt Her, as promiſed no leſs, than to Second the Deſigns of the Rebel, that She might Revenge Her ſelf on a Wretch; thus She call'd the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who came to Inſult Her, even in Her own Houſe, when She ſtood in moſt need of Her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caragus</hi> would willingly have Concealed this Intrigue from the Queen: But the Beauty of thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110751:8"/>
two Slaves had at their firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſo much Noiſe at Court, that it was impoſſible to keep the <hi>Queen</hi> long in ignorance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving People about the King, who were wholly at Her Diſpoſal, and who gave Her account of all His Actions; She was quickly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of what paſſed at the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's.</hi> She fell into a Rage againſt the King, and beſides what She called Him in Her Fury; She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Threatnings againſt His Siſter, who going to juſtify Her ſelf, and endeavour to appeaſe Her, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Entrance into Her Tent. This too ſenſible Affront for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Rank and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, having put Her likewiſe into an angry Humour, all the Court was ſoon Divided: and both ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Partizans and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, a great Diſorder was upon the point of happening, for the Sake of thoſe two Women. The Peace was at length made; and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110751:8"/>
Articles were, That the <hi>Sultana</hi> ſhould carry Her two Slaves back with Her, and that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould deſire Her to come and ſee Her, that She might repair the Injury She had done Her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſtan</hi> Enraged at all this; could have wiſhed the King would once have made uſe of His Authority with the <hi>Queen</hi> His Wife; and that the Slaves, as was Reaſonable, ſhould have ſtayed in ſpight of all Her Power: But <hi>Caragus</hi> a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, if ever there was one, choſe rather to deprive Himſelf of that Pleaſure, than to ſee Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in His Houſe. The two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes continued to ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not without Coldneſs; which rendered the Feaſts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements the leſs agreeable, that the King had prepared for His Siſter. The <hi>Queen</hi> not being able to be at Reſt, as long as She ſaw thoſe two Slaves in Her Court, gave the <hi>Sultana</hi> as little Reaſon to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110751:9"/>

               <hi>Roſton,</hi> ever a declared Enemy of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than any in the ſervile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances the King had for Her, ſeeing the <hi>Sultana</hi> thus depart with thoſe two Charming Slaves, He reproached Him ſeverely with his faint-heartedneſs and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution. The Power he had always had over Him, made Him take that Liberty: And the King ſeeing He was in the Right, and that indeed He ought not to let Himſelf be thus Governed by a Woman, ſuffered all this very patiently. The <hi>Court</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Tunis,</hi> where the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Queen</hi> entred as in Triumph, taking a Pride, and valuing Her ſelf highly every where, that She had got the better of the fair <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and of proud <hi>Roſton</hi>; for thus ſhe called them out of Contempt.

long neglect to Revenge Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He knew Her, had ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Her, and was not ignorant, that though Her Heart contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a vaſt deal of Ambition, it had likewiſe at length a great deal of Love: And this was what He waited for, as a certain means to ruin Her. She was Obliged to Him, for what ſhe was; 'twas He who made Her Queen, and being to recompence this Service with her Affection, ſhe had only repayed it with Ingratitude. But to be Regular, it is requiſite that I enlarge ſomething more upon this part of the Story, that will be very ſatisfactory to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Curioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homais</hi> was the Daughter of an Eaſtern Turk, of a very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Antient Family, Her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Abounded in the Gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but wanted thoſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. <hi>Roſtan,</hi> being a Knight Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer, and having heard talk
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110751:10"/>
of Her Beauty, long'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a ſight of Her, which was not difficult for Him to Procure: For, beſides that, She was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Related to Him, which was a pretence ſufficient enough to make a Viſit to the Father; the Title of a Princes Favorite is ſuch a Paſport as will make Him who poſſeſſes it be every where, welcome where He has a mind to go. Whereupon he went one Day to Her Houſe, and as Fortune would have it, the Father was gon out; and though the Laws of the Country do not ſuffer a Man to enter a houſe when the Maſter is not at home; yet it is long ſince Favourites have put themſelves above all Laws: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Porter knowing Him, and not daring to refuſe Him entrance, He went in to the firſt Apartment, where as Fortune would ſtill have it, He met with <hi>Homais</hi>; She would have run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110751:11"/>
at firſt as the Cuſtome is, being the Honour of a Maid runs ſome Riſque to be ſeen by a Man. But <hi>Roſtan</hi> running after ſtayed Her, and lifting up Her <hi>Barnus,</hi> with which She had hid Her ſelf, He was Charmed at the Sight of Her, and ſaid to Her in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all that the moſt Tender, and Paſſionate Heart on Earth is Capable of Inſpiring ſo Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Perſon. <hi>Homais</hi> deplored the outrage that <hi>Roſtan</hi> had newly done Her, and though theſe Tears were more feigned, than Real, they quite Inflamed the too ſenſible Favourite with Love. He made Himſelf known to that Weeping Beauty, and fell to perſwading Her, that he being a Couzin, might take the liberty He had done, without offending the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Maid. <hi>Homais</hi> believed Him, and was Appeaſed; for, ſhe was not willing to Weep any longer, but ſhe wanted a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110751:11"/>
to be ſatisfied. <hi>Roſtan</hi> had the moſt Wit, and was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Man of any in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; few Women were able to reſiſt his Paſſion, when He had been Charmed with the Beauty of any One, or that He ſeemed to be ſo: for, in <hi>Africa</hi> as well as elſe-where, Men are very expert in thoſe Caſes, and there is often more of <hi>Caprichio</hi> in their Amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſigns than a real ſence of Affection. However <hi>Roſtan</hi> was this time Smitten in good earneſt; and as there is no Crime but what muſt be Attoned for one time or other, Love outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges perhaps againſt Him, for ſo many Treacherous prancks as He had played him, prepared to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf by <hi>Homais</hi> means. He had heard much talk of this Illuſtrious Couzin, and had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe often wiſhed that he knew Her; but Ambition alone Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced all her Deſires, and She
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110751:12"/>
had not the leaſt deſign of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. Her Mother who had the folly of all thoſe who have pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Daughters had put it in her Head; That ſhe was only born for a King: Inſomuch, that ſhe conſidered this Couzen, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee Him, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than that He might be a means of Raiſing Her to that High Degree of Fortune. But <hi>Roſtan</hi> only thought of Himſelf, and Love is a Jewel we never care any one ſhould ſhare with us in. He ſpeaks, he ſighs, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he promiſes; all this is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received; but ſhe requires of <hi>Roſtan</hi> other proofs of his Paſſion. He employs his Credit with the King in favour of the Father, and obtain'd for him the Office of an <hi>Aga</hi> in the <hi>Divan,</hi> under the pretence of being His Relation. This procured him a great deal of Acknowledgment from the whole Family; but was of little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110751:12"/>
to his Love. <hi>Homais</hi> made no Account of the Honour and Riches that were heaped upon her Father, and only thought her ſelf obliged to People for what they did meerly for her. The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Sultana</hi> would have pleaſed her: <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who daily became more and more in Love, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that he found Reſiſtance, lets himſelf be ſurpriſed, promiſes her that Title, goes Cunningly to work, and at length procures her it. Thus was her Family load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honour and Benefits, and it ſeemed, that Love had nothing more to deſire; for <hi>Homais</hi> being made <hi>Sultana,</hi> was Arrived at the higheſt point of Glory ſhe could reaſonably Aſpire to. But who can content the Ambitious Heart of a Woman? <hi>Homais</hi> only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Dignity of <hi>Sultana,</hi> as a Degree towards the Royalty, and was unwilling to content her ſelf with that. However ſhe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110751:13"/>
thought it the wiſeſt Courſe, not to diſcover yet a while her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> for fear of frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him at once; and leſt He ſhou'd prevent the Snare ſhe laid for him, ſhe was ſomething Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and beſtowed upon him ſome Favours; ſo that if he was not altogether happy, ſo neither had he altogether reaſon to Complain. This State for a Lover, who is not yet Advanced very far in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Miſtreſs, has ſomething very ſenſible in the beginning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems as if he had but one ſtep more to make, to Arrive at that Charming degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein we have nothing more to deſire; but how Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable is it when we are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there too long! We are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Night and Day with vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, impatiences and diſguſts; and it is almoſt better to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Unhappy. <hi>Roſtan</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than Languiſh and

ſo tender, as would have melted any other Heart in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Roſtan:</hi> but that of <hi>Homais,</hi> did but the more Animate this Ambitious Woman in the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of purſuing her Deſign, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Cozin ſo much in love with her as that he was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er able to refuſe her any thing: Inſomuch that <hi>Roſtan</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one day more Paſſionate than ever, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked her, <hi>If ſhe deſired his Death, for a tryal of his Love?</hi> She anſwered him <hi>No, but that ſhe ſtill deſired ſomething of him, that was above all He had yet done for Her: That perhaps He would be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at it, and find it a difficult Task, That however She muſt neceſſarily obtain it of Him, if it was true he loved her as much as he ſaid he did; and that her Heart was only to be given upon that Condition. Roſtan,</hi> who would have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life a thouſand times for Her ſake, not believing there
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110751:14"/>
could poſſible be any thing but what he might do, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to know the buſineſs, He begged her to tell him without making Him Languiſh any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>What ſervice, what help, what hazard, what trouble, and in what he might employ his Life for Her ſake</hi>; proteſting to her already by way of Advance, <hi>That there was nothing but what he would do to pleaſe her, and make himſelf altogether worthy of her Heart. Homais</hi> having got this aſſurance from him, made no more difficulty to tell him what her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Heart aſpir'd to, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Crown could content it, and that he ſhould be Maſter of every thing but that, in caſe he procured it her, and that then ſhe would ſatisfy his Longings, &amp; Sacrifice all things to him, when ever he deſired it. Never did a Thunderbolt falling at the feet of a Man, cauſe ſuch an Effect upon a Heart, as this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110751:15"/>
of <hi>Homais</hi> did upon that of the amorous <hi>Roſtan.</hi> He fancied his hearing failed him; and that he had not rightly underſtood what that Ungrateful and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Creature had newly ſaid. He was near upon a quarter of an hour without being able to anſwer her, keeping his Eys fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ground, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable Air, without once rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them up to her, who was no longer in any perplexity. <hi>Is this</hi> (ſaid he to her, after ſome great ſighs, with which he eaſed his Heart) <hi>what you deſire from my Love? Is this,</hi> (repeated he once more) <hi>the recompence that I am to expect for my Services: Can I only be happy by rendring my ſelf the moſt wretched of all Men? Cannot I pleaſe but by Destroying my ſelf. Ah, too Fatal Deſtiny! Perfidious Love, Ungrateful Miſtreſs</hi>!

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110751:15"/>
to his own Houſe, where probably he paſſed his time but very ill. <hi>Homais</hi> could have wiſhed, that <hi>Roſtan</hi> had not been ſo nice in Love, that he had been more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and that her Deſign had ſucceeded better; but ſhe could not Repent of what ſhe had done: for her Ambition made her look upon all manner of Conditions as beneath her, except that of being <hi>Queen</hi>; ſhe fancied her Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and that <hi>Roſtan</hi> would but give her her due, though he Purchaſed it at that Rate.</p>
            <p>This Deſolate Lover paſſed ſome Days without ſeeing the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sultana</hi>; and was ſo extream Melancholly, that it Amazed all the <hi>Court</hi>; and likewiſe Troubled the King very much, who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn the Occaſion of it, though it had almoſt brought him to the Grave. But at length, after having Conſulted his Heart again for ſome time, if it would not chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110751:16"/>
to Dye, than not be beloved, but by ſeeing what it adored, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by another, he was loath to leave this World; inſomuch, that he reſolved to Write to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Creature, which he did in theſe Terms.</p>

Why did you not Ask my Life? I ſhould not have found it difficult to have ſatisfied you: I fancy, I ſhould not have dared to have Murmured: But require Love to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it ſelf, to make my Heart help you to Stab me: Certainly nothing can be more Cruel or Unjust.

               <hi>Roſtan</hi> Trembled when he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Letter, and Read it with extraordinary Motions of Joy, and of Love. There was more of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, than Kindneſs; but all that came from that Beautiful <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> Charmed him, he would have Loved it, though it had been Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and indeed, nothing could be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110751:17"/>
more Bitter to the Heart of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, than what ſhe exacted from him. He however Reſolved to do it; and from that Day beginning to Recover, he made ſecret Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Cabals, for the bringing his Deſign to Effect; and the King knew not that it proceeded from him, and indeed the Marriage was Conſummated in a very few days, and without his being the leaſt ſuſpected. Some of the Chief of the <hi>Divan,</hi> were deputed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this Prince, that it was time he ſhould think of leaving them Lawful Succeſſours, that it would be the Glory of his Race, and the Benefit of his Kingdom; and that he needed only to chooſe which of the <hi>Sultana's</hi> he liked Beſt. The King having thanked them for their Zeal for the Good of the State, and the Affection they had for his Perſon, made them this Anſwer, That he had no other deſire, than that of ſatisfying them; but that,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110751:18"/>
as it was an Affair that demanded ſome Reflection, he could not give them a poſitive Anſwer at that time; but that he would in few days, and then diſmiſſed them.</p>
            <p>He then Conſulted ſome of his Confidents upon the Choice he was to make, who being all gained by <hi>Roſtan,</hi> to whom they almoſt all owed their Fortunes, made him caſt his Eyes upon ſeveral <hi>Sultana's,</hi> but Extolled none of their Merits ſo much as they did that of <hi>Homais,</hi> who was the moſt perfect Beauty in all that Country. The King being very ſenſible on that ſide, was eaſily taken; and having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Conſulted therein his dear <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> who was the Soveraign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator of all his Wills: He was confirmed more than ever in that Choice; this Favourite thanking him, that he Condeſcended of himſelf to do this Honour to one of his Relations, whom he was not Acquainted with, but whom
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110751:18"/>
he had heard talked of with great Admiration. This Prince being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Love, upon the Reports of others, with a Creature he had not yet ſeen, impatiently longed to Content his Heart, as well as ſatisfy the deſires of his People: and having called a <hi>Divan</hi> the next Morning, he concluded the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Conſummated it that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Evening. They go to Work in that Country without much Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; and all Buſineſs is both quickly Reſolved on, and quickly put in Execution. Thus is <hi>Homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> Raiſed upon the Throne; her Ambition had nothing more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to: and all ſhe had to do more, was to ſatisfy Love. Though <hi>Roſtan</hi> might now hope to be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly Happy, yet he was not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Joy; and not being yet perfectly Recovered, the Remnants of his Diſeaſe ſerved for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to help him Conceal all the Torments of his Heart, while
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110751:19"/>
all others were full of Joy and Mirth. The King, who kept nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him, took Delight in acquainting him as his Confident, with the ſecret Beauties of <hi>Homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> which had Charmed him: but which almoſt Madded the unhappy <hi>Roſtan.</hi> In a word, never had Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more Reaſon to complain of his ill Fortune, than that Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had; but his Sufferings were not yet at an end, and Love was preparing him ſome that were much more Stinging.</p>
            <p>The Haughty <hi>Homais</hi> being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Proud, found Greatneſs her Province, and eaſily Acted the part of a <hi>Queen.</hi> She had all her Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time promiſed her ſelf to be ſo one Day, and except a certain Joy, for being Arrived at the higheſt Point of her Deſires, there was not any Alteration in her. <hi>Roſtan,</hi> whoſe Amorous Policy required he ſhould behave himſelf ſo as to give no ſuſpition, more eſpecially in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110751:19"/>
beginning of this Marriage, when the King was all Flame, and would have been Jealous of nothing, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeeing her; and likewiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the Occaſions of following that Prince, when he went to the <hi>Queen's</hi> Apartment, where having nothing yet to do, it would have been a Torment to him, to have been there. But at length, ſome time being thus paſſed in theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, and without Summoning her to perform her Promiſe, Love ſpurring him on, told him, That the Hour was come, to put <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> in mind of it, and of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement ſhe owed him. The <hi>Queen</hi> ſtanding no longer in need of him, and fearing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her <hi>Grandeur</hi> to a Favourite, who acted the Maſter but too much already, was very far from having thoſe Amorous Complaiſances for him, that would render her his Slave. However, as her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not yet ſo well Eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110751:20"/>
as not to be afraid to have him for her Enemy; prudence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe ſhould diſſemble, and ſhe choſe to weary him by much wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Inſomuch, that ſhe daily Entertained him with puts-off and delays, taking ſometimes one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and ſometimes another. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> not wanting penetration, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered what all theſe Shifts tended to. He fell immediately into a Rage; but it was not yet time to make it appear. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Charge, he asked, he preſſed, he ſigh'd, talk't of Dying. All this did him no good: She pittied him; but was yet more afraid of ruining her ſelf, and the King's Jealouſy was a pretext ſhe made uſe of, and which ſerved for Anſwer, to all the Reproaches he made her; from Reproaches he proceeded to Threatnings: but ſhe Laughed both at his Reproaches, and his Threatnings, and believed ſhe had Reaſon to Treat him, as

he did her; for being ſeduced by too much Vanity, and daring to aſpire to Favours, that he ought only to expect from the meer Grace of her, who was above him. How great was his Deſpair, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus deceived: he was ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged againſt himſelf, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf as the main Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for having truſted in the moſt Traiterous, and Ambitious Woman under the Heavens, he had like to have turned his Vengeance upon his own Perſon: but conſidering how great a Satisfaction, and Kindneſs it would be to that ungrateful Creature, to free her from ſuch an Enemy as himſelf; ſtaying him, he turned all his Choler againſt her, and prepared her all the Effects of an invincible Hatred. The Truth is, Nothing is ſo dangerous as a Lover outraged, to that point. He paſſes uſually from one extremity to another. But <hi>Homais</hi> fancyed her ſelf already above ſuch kind of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.

She begun to Rule the King, whoſe ordinary Weakneſs was to let himſelf be Governed, though he was Born to Govern o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Roſtan</hi> kept a watching Eye over the <hi>Queen's</hi> Actions. <hi>Caragus,</hi> whoſe ſtrongeſt Paſſion laſted ſeldome above Four and Twenty Hours, began to have leſs eagerneſs and kindneſs for her. Her Pride, and her Haughty, and imperious Manners ſomething diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him; and <hi>Roſtan,</hi> whom he told his Mind to in that Caſe, was very inſtrumental towards the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting him all together. He had often talked to him of <hi>Ozira's</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the General of the <hi>Galeyes</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and engaged him to make her a private Viſit, which was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſeveral others. The <hi>Queen</hi> was not long without obſerving this Change, or divining from whence it proceeded. The King was of the Nature of ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110751:21"/>
who have more Will than Deed, and having got a Miſtreſs, that pleaſed him better than the <hi>Queen</hi>; he was more than uſually abſent from her, which others would have been more troubled at, than <hi>Homais</hi> was: But her Heart had had a Deſtiny, that not only Comforted her for the King's Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; but made her find it to be her Advantage, not to have him ſo often near her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> a young Favourite of the King had that Liberty in the <hi>Serrallio,</hi> that only a Man of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu's</hi> Humour was capable of giving to a young Man ſo handſome, and well made as he was, and in whom nothing was wanting, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe, who are encharged with keeping thoſe Priſons of <hi>Love.</hi> He had leave to enter into all the Apartments of the Women; and even to have Adventures there, with which he every Evening en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the King, who took a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110751:22"/>
Delight therein it. <hi>Homais</hi> would not ſuffer him at firſt to come into her Lodgings, as he did into all the others; but the King not being able to Live without ſeeing him, and loving him with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Kindneſs, begged her not to deprive him of that Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he obtained without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for what the <hi>Queen</hi> had done, was only to inſinuate her ſelf the more into the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence- She had ſeen young <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> in two or three Occaſions; ſhe had found him very Handſome, and of a very Charming Wit; and the pleaſant Stories the King told her of him, ſometimes having extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diverted her, ſhe would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have had that Pleaſure oftner, had ſhe not been afraid of making the King Jealous. Wherefore, ſhe made uſe of this Addreſs, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to Care for this young Favourite, who might perhaps one time or other have told Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110751:22"/>
of her; to the end, the King whoſe weak ſide ſhe knew might interpoſe, and procure her Conſent, that he might have free Acceſs to her Apartment, as well as to the others of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being not Cunning enough to penetrate into the Thoughts of ſuch a Woman as <hi>Homais,</hi> bore her a grudg for the Contempt ſhe ſeemed to have for Him, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all ſhe could do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, there ſtill remain'd a Rancor in His Heart againſt Her, which He did not think He ſhould be ſo ſuddainly Cured of. <hi>Roſtan</hi> wanting ſuch a Man as <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> for the carrying on his Deſign of ruining the <hi>Queen,</hi> did not find it difficult to engage Him on his ſide, &amp; ſtill animating him more and more againſt her, he was well aſſured that having ſuch a Spy, ſhe could neither do, nor ſay any thing that might be turned to her Diſadvantage, but he ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110751:23"/>
be immediately informed of. That was true, if Love had not been ſtronger than Hatred; but where are thoſe irritated Hearts that can reſiſt a pretty Woman, eſpecially when ſhe makes uſe of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance. <hi>Homais</hi> did not fail to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Effect, that Her ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſing of <hi>Ibrahims</hi> coming into Her Apartment had had upon his Spirit; and that he was too young to be able to unravel Her real Deſignes; but ſhe was in hopes of making him return to her very quickly, and be at her diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. The employ this Favorite had near the King in the <hi>Wardrobe,</hi> and all that concerned his Perſon, gave her opportunities enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often all alone in her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Inſomuch, that ſhe took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at thoſe hours to come up to him, and ask him very often uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs queſtions; which ſerved her for a pretext to take and indeavour to reduce him. All this however was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110751:23"/>
not yet Powerful enough, &amp; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the haughty <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was too prepoſſeſſ'd againſt her, for him to yield to ſuch weak Baites; on the contrary the more Advances ſhe made of that Nature, the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion he ſeemed to have for her, for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> without being wanting in the reſpect he owed her, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very hard-hearted. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtings ſo much the haughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Beauty as Reſiſtance. It often netled her to the very Soul; and ſhe would ſometimes have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingy been angry, had ſhe not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpoile all. Inſomuch, that ſhe wholly employed her mind in Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and ingaging Artifices to ſoften the ſavage humour of this handſome young Fellow, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the hours ſhe knew he was to come, in poſtures that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of inflaming with Love the moſt inſenſible hearts in the World, and ſomtimes ſhe imployed him to dreſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110751:24"/>
her, and ſometimes to undreſs her under different pretexts, wherein ſhe did not at all manage her ſelf, that he might ſee Beauties, that are the true Poyſon of the eyes, there is not a man whoſe heart is proof againſt theſe kind of Aſſaults. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> bluſhed, and ſometimes grew pale on thoſe Occaſions, and when ſhe asked him what he ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he knew not what anſwer to make, but Sighed.</p>
            <p>Things were much in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture when news came of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> of <hi>Tripoli's</hi> voyage, and that the Court went to <hi>Mahometa,</hi> but <hi>Ibrahim</hi> did not go, having had ſome buſineſs that ſtayed him at <hi>Tunis.</hi> The Queen being extream uneaſy by reaſon of his abſence, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently longed to ſee him; but to ſee him in private, counting all the reſt for nothing. <hi>Roſtan</hi> had of late obſerved, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was no longer ſo exact in giving him an account of the Queens carriage;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110751:24"/>
that he ſpoke of her with more Moderation, than he uſed to do; that he ſtayed longer, than was requiſite in her Apartment, that he even paſſed whole Days there. All this I ſay, having cauſed him to make ſome Reflections, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied he was none of the Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and that ſo ſubtle a Woman, as <hi>Homais</hi> might eaſily have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Fidelity of ſuch a young Man as <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> He knew that though a Woman was Haughty, ſhe might not be inſenſible, and that he ought not to Judge of her, by her Carriage to himſelf; that there are Hearts that love to ſtoop, as others do to mount; and that what he had not been able to Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by his Services and his Love, another might have brought to paſs by his Youth, and other Qualities that he had not; that every Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had her weak ſide, and that the Secret was to find it out, or rather to be made for it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110751:25"/>
certainly Hearts that abſoluetly depend on the <hi>Caprichio</hi> of the Stars. He would have the Pleaſure of clearing this Point, he ſtudied <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who was not upon his Guard, not thinking he was ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerved, and he found at length what he ſought for. But he would make no noiſe of it, till he had wherewith to convict thoſe, he would accuſe; well knowing that in theſe kind of things nothing ought to be done by halfes. At the Courts return from <hi>Mahometa,</hi> He fancied that the juncture would be favourable enough for him, and that the Queen who had not ſeen her dear <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in a long time would not fail to ſeek for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity; wherein indeed ſhe was not miſtaken; for he was no ſooner arrived, than that ſhe let him know by a <hi>Mooreſs</hi> who was their confident that ſhe muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſee him that evening, and that ſhe was well aſſured the King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110751:25"/>
would not lye in the <hi>Seraglio. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim</hi> made Anſwer, that he would not fail to come: he knew the Hour and Place of Aſſignation; thoſe things having been long Regulated between them. <hi>Roſtan</hi> having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Affair in his Head, watched him Inceſſantly; and perceiving he did all things in haſt that Evening, he did not doubt, but that there was ſome Deſign of an Amorous Interview: Inſomuch, that the King having a mind he ſhould be of a Party, that was to go Sup at the General of the <hi>Galleyes</hi> Houſe, he deſired to be Diſpenced with all, having Affairs of great Importance to do; not being willing to loſe ſo fair an Opportunity, as he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied was then offered him. And indeed, ſhe could not have eſcaped him, had he not had to do with the moſt ſubtle Woman that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ever Created, and with the Blindeſt Prince that was ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth. He cauſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:110751:26"/>
to be watched, to know when he went into the <hi>Queens</hi> Apartment, and having learnt that he was there; he did not think of taking the ordinary way to ſurprize them, well imagining that the Door would be ſhut, and that Means would be found out to make the Gallant eſcape before it ſhould be Opened; and that this would only make a Noiſe, and turn all to his own Confuſion. He had too much Experience in thoſe kind of things to undertake them ſo indiſcreetly. The <hi>Queens</hi> Chamber joyned to a <hi>Terraſs,</hi> which indeed could not be got up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being it was Bordered by the Walls of the Caſtle, and was ſo High, that it was only to be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a Ladder; but from the Garret that was over <hi>Homais's</hi> Chamber, one might come down by a Rope, yet not without Pain and Hazard; but when a Perſon is ſpurred on by Jealouſy, and the Revenge of an outraged Love, he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110751:26"/>
is willing to undergo all manner of Trouble, and ready to attempt all Hazards, provided he may bring to paſs his Deſigns. Our Lovers fancied themſelves very ſecure, not ſuſpecting to be ſurprized on that ſide. All the other wayes were Locked up, the <hi>Terraſs</hi> was a Place that was looked upon as inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and they had not ſo much as thought of ſhutting the Door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there came a freſh Air from thence, which in thoſe Hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys is ſomething very Charming. The Beautiful <hi>Queen,</hi> and happy <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had not been long together, when the enraged <hi>Roſtan</hi> came down upon the <hi>Terraſs.</hi> His impatience did not permit him to wait till they had Wantoned, and Toyed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle together: they were only at the Preludiums of an Amorous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, that are very ſenſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Lovers, after more than a Fortnights Abſence. He was willing (however) to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110751:27"/>
of Liſtening to them a Moment, becauſe he heard them Talk of him, and that he made part of the Converſation they had together. <hi>I never Diverted my ſelf worſe in all my Life</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Queen</hi>) <hi>than I did at</hi> Mahometa; <hi>not only becauſe you were not there my dear</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim, <hi>but for that I was Conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuffer near me, and ſee dayly before my Eyes that Haughty</hi> Sultana <hi>of</hi> Tripoly; <hi>who in Concert with</hi> Roſtan, <hi>had a Deſign to have plaied me a baſe prank by the means of two Slaves, ſhe brought with her; and by whom they would have infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the eaſy Humour of poor</hi> Caragus, <hi>under the pretext of making him a Preſent of them. Thou knoweſt how little I care for my Husband, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoſe two wretched Slaves could have Diſturbed me; I would even Furniſh him with Prittier than thoſe my ſelf, if it was neceſſary; but as they came from the Hands of my greateſt Enemies, I was not willing</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:110751:27"/>
               <hi>they ſhould Triumph over me. In a word, I got the better of that proud</hi> Sultana, <hi>and that inſolent</hi> Roſtan; <hi>ſhe was obliged to return with her two Slaves, and he ſtaid with ſhame, for having had ſuch ill ſucceſs in his Deſign. But Madam</hi> (Interrupted <hi>Ibrahim</hi>) <hi>who can aſſure me, That the Hatred you have Conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Ibrahim <hi>can laſt; for he is both the Handſomeſt, and Wittieſt Man in the Kingdom, and has the moſt Power with the King: In a word, a Man you are Indepted to for all you have? Thou ſayeſt true</hi> (Anſwered the <hi>Queen</hi>) <hi>but it is for all theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reaſons that I hate him: he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies he Merits all things, and that there is not a Womans Heart that can reſist the Advantages he has; and that all the World ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to that Favour, which he unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily Uſurps over the King's eaſyneſs: And for my part, I am Reſolved to let him ſee to the Contrary: I Laugh both at him, and all his Power; and</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:110751:28"/>
               <hi>my Affection, that he conſiders as the utmost Triumph of his Fortune, has not found in him, what it finds in thee. It is for thee Dear</hi> Ibrahim (Added ſhe) <hi>that it has kept it ſelf all intire. The King his Throne and Crown are not worth the Pleaſure I take in ſeeing, and being alone with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such paſſionate Words as theſe were Accompanied as is eaſy to believe, with ſeveral ſorts of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, and followed, I ſhall not ſay by what, it is ſufficient to have a Humane Underſtanding to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, and a Heart ſomething leſs ſenſible than Marble, to have a Sence of it. I leave you to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what a Rage <hi>Roſtan</hi> was in. I fancy, that though the moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant of all Men had been in his place, he could not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne diſturbing ſo agreeable an Entertainment: Neither did he wait till all was done; he entred, and found our Lovers in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110751:28"/>
and doubtleſs, very much ſurprized at the ſight of him. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> took his <hi>Sabre</hi> in his Hand, and the poor <hi>Ibrahim</hi> fancied he was then a Dead Man; but the <hi>Queen</hi> being the boldeſt Creature that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was, flew upon <hi>Roſtan,</hi> not without being Wounded, gave time to her Gallant to Recover himſelf out of his Fright, and make his Eſcape; and ſhe likewiſe, made a Thouſand Reproaches to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent <hi>Roſtan,</hi> for the boldneſs he had taken to enter at that Hour into her Chamber, and of his baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make uſe of his Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Woman. <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who was not himſelf in his Fury, was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtayed by the quantity of Blood, that he ſaw run down the <hi>Queen's</hi> Face, though the Wound was not very great; but ſeeing that the Gallant was Eſcaped, who was the moſt Eſſential Party, he would have Run after him, to have ſtayed him. However ſomething too late, for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110751:29"/>
the <hi>Sultana</hi> foreſeeing his Deſign, was Nimbler than he, and having ſhut the Door ſhe took the Key, and cryed out Murder withal her force. The King having for ſome Reaſon put off the Party he had made, till the Night after, being by chance in his Apartment, was much ſurprized to hear all this Noiſe, and Running in all haſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Queen's</hi> Chamber, he Knocked at the Door, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill a Crying out, and they not Opening the Door, he cauſed it to be broke Open, and found the <hi>Queen</hi> all Diſheviled, her Face all covered with Blood, and <hi>Rostan</hi> with a <hi>Sabre</hi> in his Hand. Never was Man ſo Amazed; but Fury ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Surprize at the ſight of ſo ſtrange a Spectacle. <hi>Ah Traitor</hi>! (ſaid he to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> and Drawing his <hi>Sabre) Is it thus that thou diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt thy King, or doſt thou At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Life of what he has most Dear?</hi> And Running on a ſuddain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110751:29"/>
at him, one would have ſaid that he was going to Cleave him in two; but the good Prince not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Bloody Humour, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never done ſo much in his Life before, as to Draw his Sword, ſurprized to ſee with what indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and without moving <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> ſtood him, though he might have Run away, or defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſtopped, and conſidering him from Head to Foot: <hi>What cam'ſt thou to do here?</hi> (Added he) <hi>and if thou art Guilty, as thou really art, Why doſt thou not ſteal from my Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? It is becauſe I am not Guilty,</hi> Anſwered <hi>Roſtan</hi> with a firm Voice) <hi>that I do not fear that Vergeance; for it is not upon me that you ought to vent your Fury: There is the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> (Added he, pointing at the <hi>Queen</hi>) <hi>and the Object of her Crime is ſo baſe a Subject, that I ſhould not dare to name it. Homais,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe had ſeen the King, ſeemed to Faint away, that ſhe might A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110751:30"/>
him the more againſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> Recovering from the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Swoon, juſt as the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> had done Speaking: <hi>Ah Sir</hi>! (Cried ſhe with a Languiſhing Voice) <hi>What an Abominable Man is that? He is not Contented with having endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Raviſh from me my Honour; he would likewiſe Ruin me in your Opinion, which is more Dear to me than the Life he would deprive me of, for not conſenting to his infamous Deſires. Baſe Wretch</hi>! and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Torrent of Tears ſtopping her Voice, ſhe gave the King time to vent himſelf in Injuries, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt <hi>Roſtan.</hi> The Truth is, that Women for the moſt part are very ſubtle Comedians, and that in ſome Occaſions it is difficult to prevent, being deceived. <hi>Caragus</hi> was not much Enchanted by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi> and in any other Incounter, <hi>Rostan</hi> would have had a Thouſand times the better of her: But here all ſpoke againſt him, the Hour,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110751:30"/>
Place, the <hi>Sabre</hi> in his Hand, the Blood that Ran ſtill from the <hi>Queen's</hi> Head; and moreover, all her Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maces and Poſtures: for ſhe Acted her Part ſo to the Life, that it would have raiſed Pity in <hi>Tygers,</hi> &amp; ſaid not a Word to him: Nor would he give himſelf the Trouble to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her; and much leſs to Defend himſelf. And indeed, what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood was there in what he ſaid, that it was not he but another, who would have diſhonoured the King, ſeeing he only was ſhut up in the <hi>Queens</hi> Chamber; and that poor Princeſs in the moſt pittiful Condition that it was poſſible to ſee a Woman in. And this was what the King repreſented to him; but he Anſwered, That it was not then a fit time for him to Clear that Myſtery; and that it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the Man he Mentioned, ſhould be firſt Seized, and from whom he might Learn all that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; that he would go uſe his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110751:31"/>
Endeavours, and bring him to him as ſoon as he could. <hi>What Man will he bring?</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Sultana</hi>) <hi>without it be ſome one that he had doubtleſs Bribed againſt me; and who is it that can enter my Chamber, he having the Key in his Pocket. I the Key,</hi> (Replyed <hi>Rostan,</hi> looking upon her with Indignation) <hi>I the Key of your Chamber? Yes you</hi> (Replyed ſhe;) <hi>And Sir</hi> (Added ſhe, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King) <hi>be pleaſed to Search him, and you will find it.</hi> Which the King being pleaſed to do, did not fail to find it in his Pocket; which was an Evident Proof of <hi>Roſtan's</hi> Crime: but it was the <hi>Queen</hi> who ſtriving with him had put it there. <hi>Well</hi> Roſtan (ſaid the King to him, with his Arms-a-Croſs) <hi>What do you ſay now, and who are thoſe People you can bring? who ſhall juſtify you for the most Horrid Perfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the falſeſt Attempt that ſuch a Man as you could Commit. Be gone</hi> (Added he) <hi>your Head ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110751:31"/>
Anſwer for it.</hi> The Unfortunate <hi>Roſtan,</hi> without being concerned at theſe Threatnings, lifting his Eyes up to Heaven, <hi>O God</hi> (Cryed he) <hi>can there be ſuch a Wicked Woman up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth</hi>; having ſaid theſe words, he withdrew to go ſeek out <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>; but there was little likelihood he would ſtay the Iſſue. Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sleep when they have been Surprized in ſuch an Action as that; and Fear is almoſt inſeparable from Crime.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Homais,</hi> who had had the Happineſs, and Addreſs to turn the Advantage on her ſide, ſhe had not ſo much to Fear; the King ſtayed with her to Comfort her, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her no leſs, than to cauſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> to be Hanged the next Day, at one of the Corners of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, being the uſual Place for ſuch kind of Executions. <hi>Homais,</hi> I ſay, being willing to make uſe of the Conjuncture, for the ſecuring to her ſelf entirely the King's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

caſt her ſelf at his Knees, and after having Obtain'd from him, that he would not be Angry with her, for what ſhe was a going to tell him; ſhe confeſſed to him, after what manner ſhe came to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being his Wife, what <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> pretended to upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and how that all the Rage, &amp; all the Hatred he had againſt her, proceeded only from her refuſing ever to Conſent to ſo infamous a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and for that ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been Faithful to him. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus</hi> was ſo Aſtoniſhed at this piece of News, that he could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Queen</hi>; but ſhe Confirmed what ſhe ſaid with ſo many Oaths, and added to it ſo many particular Circumſtances, offering to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all this to his Face, and that he durſt not, diſavow it; that at length the King could not forbear giving Credit to her, ſeeing that all theſe Accuſations ſuted very well with the Adventure of that Day.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110751:32"/>
The Reſolution of putting him to Death was already taken; and it was a thing certain, that he ſhould be Executed the next Morning at break of Day. Thus you ſee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions quickly taken, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as quickly paſt; but the Minds of ſome Princes, as well as of ſome other Men, cannot anſwer much for their Reſolutions. And indeed, this was none of the moſt Juſt that ever was. He Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Man without hearing him: a Man, who in Truth ſeemed to have Offended him in the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner; but whom he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Loved more than himſelf, who was the Maſter of his Wills; and to ſay all in a word, the <hi>King</hi>'s King: As indeed happened the Day after, when he came to the King's Dreſſing. <hi>How dare you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before me</hi> (ſaid the King to him) <hi>after what you have done? Do not you know</hi> (Added he) <hi>that I have cauſed a Gibbet to be prepared for</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:110751:33"/>
               <hi>you? Yes</hi> (Anſwered <hi>Rostan</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>but it will be for a Faithleſs</hi> Queen, <hi>and her Dear</hi> Ibrahim. <hi>Why</hi> Ibrahim? (Replyed the King) <hi>and what Concern can that poor young Man have in the</hi> Queen's <hi>Crime, if it is true that ſhe is Criminal? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Sir</hi> (Anſwered <hi>Rostan</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion) <hi>without it be, that laſt Night I found him in a fair way to do you a great deal of Honour; but I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is not the first time, and you would not have had any Reaſon to doubt of this, had he not eſcaped from me; and that the</hi> Queen <hi>having ſhut the Door, ſeized on the Key, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly put it into my Pocket.</hi> The King, all eaſy as he was to Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and eſpecially in regard of things that <hi>Roſtan</hi> told him, did not however believe it at firſt; but when he had Related to him all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of that Adventure; and that he had learnt that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was gone aſide, he begun to ſuſpect ſomething; yet he had ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110751:33"/>
for that Handſome Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he laid nothing ſo much to Heart as his Abſence. He Asked <hi>Roſtan, If he knew not whither he was gone; and if they had not ſent in ſearch after him:</hi> He Anſwered, <hi>That he had cauſed above a Hundred Spahy's to Purſue him; and that he hoped to ſee him Hanged before Noon. Why Hanged?</hi> (Replyed this weak Prince) <hi>How! Shall I put to Death for the ſake of a Woman, a Man who perhaps has no other Crime than his Weakneſs? No,</hi> (Continued he) <hi>I ſhould Condemn my ſelf, who have much greater Failings in that kind than he has. If</hi> Ibrahim <hi>has inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, it is without doubt the</hi> Queen <hi>who brought him to it: and what can we expect from a Woman, but all manner of ill, as Our</hi> Law <hi>tells Us? No, no,</hi> Ibrahim <hi>merits ſome excuſe; and if the</hi> Queen <hi>is Culpable, we muſt make uſe of the Priviledge we have, which is to put her away, without staining my Hands</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:110751:34"/>
               <hi>in the Blood or Life of People, who would Accuſe me before</hi> Mahomet <hi>of my own Crimes. Such Morals as theſe are owned by the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Divinity; and I find them agreeable enough in what Concerns the Failings of others, and eſpecially thoſe of Women: but few Husbands in</hi> Europe <hi>would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, or be content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of</hi> Caragus. <hi>They would have talked immediately of Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Poyſon; and there is no kind of Death but what they would have made uſe of, to have made away both the falſe Wife, and her Gallant. But this is but a Folly, and the greateſt that can be Committed. A Wife is a Wife; and though her Husband be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Prudent and Careful, if ſhe has a Mind to Honour his Wife Pate with a fine ſtately Branch, ſhe will find the means to deck him, notwithſtanding all his Obſtinacy and Precaution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when the thing is done, the beſt way is to Comfort ones ſelf as the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> did. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:110751:34"/>
however was in a Rage; but notwithſtanding all he could ſay to Animate the Spirit of his Maſter to Revenge, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was too Dear to him; and he would rather have loſt a Thouſand Wives, than that Favourite. The <hi>Africans</hi> are ſtrange People in certain Caſes. They have Inclinations, and Humours that raiſe Horrour in all other Mortals. And yet it is but meer, Gallantry amongſt them; and they make Songs and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> manner, as we do in <hi>Europe,</hi> upon a fine Miſtreſs. Let us leave this Point which is too Odious for Rational People, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who not being able to perſwade the King to take a vigorous Reſolution againſt Perſons, who had ſo cruelly Offended him. Left him, to go know if there was no News of <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> He learnt that he was newly Seized. He cauſed him to be brought before the King, all Bound, and Fetter'd as he was; who was ſenſibly toucht
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110751:35"/>
to ſee him in that Condition; and falling into a Rage againſt <hi>Roſtan</hi> himſelf: he cauſed him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, took him aſide, and made him confeſs more things than he was willing to know, He retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> and asked his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> though it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him alone to Grant it him; and that the Offence purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him, and not <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who had no other ſhare in it, than what his Jealouſy made him take. Now all <hi>Roſtan</hi>'s Love being turned into Fury, he did not find it difficult to Comply with the King, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> ſeeing he would have it ſo, expecting that he would at leaſt give an example of Juſtice on the other Party; and that he would Revenge them both on the haughtieſt, and moſt ungrateful Woman upon the Face of the Earth, which the King promiſed him to do; but more to pacify him, than with any Deſign to keep his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110751:35"/>
Word; for he knew hemſelf well enough And indeed, he had no ſooner ſeen the <hi>Queen,</hi> than that ſhe got him on her ſide againſt <hi>Rostan,</hi> perſwading him that there was Treachery in her Caſe, and that he had Corrupted <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who ever having had a ſpight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her; for that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhe had refuſed him Entrance into her Apartment, had taken at length that Occaſion to Revenge himſelf. The King after all, knew not what to think of it; he ſaw on all ſides probability enough in what was told him, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who had reaſon, and who not: But he ſtill bore all the Burden; and therefore, could have wiſhed that all Parties could have been as well ſatisfied, as he was. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>Queen</hi> not to ſpeak to him any more of <hi>Roſtan,</hi> and then <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> to leave the <hi>Queen</hi> at Quiet; and that he would leave to him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Care of her Conduct, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110751:36"/>
he would have an Eye over her; and that it would be ſo much the worſe for him if he was deceived. As for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he was expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden upon pain of Hanging, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enter the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but with the King, nor to have any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce directly or indirectly with the <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time <hi>Caragus</hi> being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſome Affairs of State, to ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Tripoly</hi>; he gave that Character to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> not ſo much to render it the more ſignal, being one of moſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, and pompous Men of his Kingdom, as to be then rid of him; and enjoy a little Repoſe for ſome time in his Family, hoping that this Abſence might likewiſe in ſome manner, ſtifle the Hatred of thoſe two irritated Spirits. Wherefore <hi>Roſtan</hi> departed for <hi>Tripoly,</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that Court with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Train of People, all well made, and with an Epuipage more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110751:36"/>
becoming a Prince, than an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour. The Rebel was retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the Mountains, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Forces of the King of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> joyned with thoſe of the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> purſued him: Inſomuch, that the City was open, and they only thought of Diverting themſelves for that Happineſs, which paſſed for a kind of Victory. <hi>Rostan's</hi> coming did not at all diminiſh the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements; on the contrary they were Augmented for his ſake, who not only Loved them, but whoſe Humour and Wit, was even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to invent New Ones, as he did. At length, after having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome Months in all manner of Pleaſures, and diſpatched the Affairs with the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> He was ſent about, he took his Leave; and did not fail to take with him out of Revenge, which he was never wanting in, that Chriſtian Slave, who had ſo Charmed the King his Maſter; and whom the <hi>Sultana</hi> his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110751:37"/>
Siſter, would have made him a Preſent of. Wherefore, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very well ſatisfied to <hi>Tunis</hi>; but not ſo much for the Glory he had Acquired in that Embaſſy, as for the joy he had upon the account of that Fair Slave, for whom he did not doubt, but that the King would take Fire more than ever, as ſoon as he ſaw her; and that by this means he ſhould almoſt Mad the proud <hi>Queen.</hi> The Truth is, ſhe did not expect ſuch a blow; for having taken Advantage of her Enemies abſence, ſhe had made ſuch progreſſes over the King's Mind, whoſe Deſtiny was to let ſome or other ever Govern him, that ſhe fancied her ſelf above all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes: ſhe had likewiſe ſeen, contrary to his Order, her Dear <hi>Ibrahim</hi>; and this good Prince was ſo lulled aſleep, or rather ſo inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he did not ſee, or would not ſee what paſſed before his Eyes. At length <hi>Rostan</hi> Arrived;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110751:37"/>
and as he never went by-wayes to Work in all he did, and that he Loved to do every thing ſo, as to be talked of; he had not the precaution that others would have taken, which was to have Concealed that fair Slave; and have ſhewed her to the King, before the <hi>Queen</hi> knew any thing of her. He cauſed her to enter with him into <hi>Tunis</hi> with a Queenly Pomp; nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Rich, nor better Suted than his Train. <hi>Homais</hi> had no ſooner the News of it, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſported with Paſſion, ſhe ran to the King's Chamber, who knew nothing yet of this buſineſs, and ſo well perſwaded him, and Repreſented to him the Malice of <hi>Roſtan</hi>; that at length ſhe obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his word, that he would not ſee that Slave. And indeed, the King was ſo Reſolved, if he had not had to do with a Man, who knew him better than he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and who would have made
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110751:38"/>
him done things more difficult, than thoſe that were according to his Inclination. He ſaw him enter his Chamber, coming to Kiſs his Hand, and give him an Account of the Succeſs of his Commiſſion. Immediately the Affection he had for him, and which was as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, having made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get part of the things he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed the <hi>Queen</hi>; he Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Embraced him, with all the Careſſes imaginable, Repeating to him ſeveral times, how tireſome his Abſence had been to him; and that he had hardly Reliſhed any real Joy: but then Proceeding from theſe Tenderneſſes to the News he had newly Learnt, that he had brought with him that Chriſtian Slave; he repreſented to him as ſeriouſly as he could, the fault he had Committed, to ſeek thus for Occaſions to fall out again with the <hi>Queen,</hi> that he knew very well, he Loved to be at Peace; and that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110751:38"/>
he had deſired him to Live in good Correſpondence with her: and in a word, he might be aſſured that it was to no purpoſe, he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf the Trouble of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him that Creature; for he had made an Oath not to ſee her. <hi>But Sir,</hi> (Anſwered <hi>Roſtan</hi>) <hi>What Reaſon has the</hi> Queen <hi>then to Complain of me? What Injury do I do her? That Creature has Charmed me, as well as ſhe did you; I offered her to bring her with me, and take care of her; and ſhe was willing I ſhould. How do I Wrong the</hi> Queen? <hi>And you Sir, Who deſires you to ſee her? How! A Beauty whom I will make the ſweeteſt Charm of my Life of, whom I only brought for my own uſe; and whom I am already Jealous of to Death; Should I deſire ſo Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and Amorous a Prince as you are to ſee her? Pardon me if I tell you, you are too Wiſe, and know me too well to have only ſuch a Thought; but I perceive what your Addreſs</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:110751:39"/>
               <hi>Aimes at. I am too good a Servant of the</hi> Queen, <hi>I will not make new Quarrels between you. She is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Princeſs, ſhe deſerves all your Affection; and even to Morrow, in Complyance to her deſire, I will ſend my Beautiful and Dear Slave into ſuch a place, as no Body in the World ſhall know what's become of her.</hi> The King, who knew <hi>Roſtan</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, as <hi>Roſtan</hi> knew him, perceived his Malice, and the Sence that was to be given to his Words. However, he could not forbear; and the thought that this Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man was going to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf agreeably to his Coſts, if he let him proceed, having brought into his Mind, all the Graces of that Charming Slave, whom he could not ſee without Grief, and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in the Arms of another, making him repent the Reproaches he had newly made him; he told him (not without Bluſhing) that he ſhould not be ſo haſty, and that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110751:39"/>
he would ſpeak to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and endeavour to make her give her an Apartment in the <hi>Seraglio. An Apartment in the</hi> Seraglio (Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cheating <hi>Roſtan</hi>) <hi>Why ſo? May not I have to my ſelf</hi> (Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he) <hi>a Maid whom you Deſpiſe; and will you have it ſaid, that it is alwayes I who put your Royal Family into Diſorder; and have me bear the brunt of all the</hi> Queen's <hi>Anger, who has already but too great an Averſion for me. Ah! Send me back with that Slave to</hi> Tripoly: <hi>For I ſhould chooſe rather to be unhappy the reſt of my Dayes, with that Beautiful Creature, than to give you more reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching me, as you now do.</hi> The King was in ſuch a Confuſion, that he knew not what Anſwer to make him; for he eaſily perceived that he Triumphed over his Weakneſs. But at length, the Love he had formerly had for her; and which got Ground on his Heart by the degrees, that <hi>Roſtan</hi> ſeemed to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110751:40"/>
his Deſign, having made him break through all theſe Obſtacles: He told him, <hi>That it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Will, that this Slave ſhould ſtay; that he knew very well, that it was for him he brought her; but that ſome Meaſures were to be taken with the</hi> Queen. <hi>Roſtan</hi> Vowed, that what he had ſaid, was the naked truth; but that he was his King, and the abſolute Maſter of all that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him; and that thus he might diſpoſe of her as he pleaſed, provided he would Anſwer for all that ſhould happen; and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Account, whom he knew to be his Sworn Enemy, and that ſhe would not fail to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould know the Amorous Commerce he had with that Slave. The King, having taken upon himſelf, the Care of all theſe Things, went at that Inſtant to find out the <hi>Queen</hi>; and told her, <hi>That he came again to Confirm to her the Proteſtation he had</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:110751:40"/>
               <hi>made her, not to ſee that Slave; but that for her greater Security, and their mutual Repoſe, it was requiſite ſhe ſhould take her to her ſelf, and give her ſome ſmall Apartment, ſuch as ſhe thought fit in the</hi> Seraglio; <hi>becauſe that as long as ſhe ſhould be in</hi> Roſtan's Hands, <hi>he could neither ſee him, nor go to his Houſe; but that ſhe would fancy, and be jealous it was upon that Slaves account.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> was eaſily Trepanned; hoping indeed, that having that Slave at her diſpoſal, and in her Eye both Night and Day, it would be more difficult for the King to ſee her, than at <hi>Roſtan's</hi>; who having her in his Houſe, would not have fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make the King break his word at length. Inſomuch, that ſhe conſidered the Propoſal he made her, as much to her Advantage; and ſhe deſired him, <hi>That if he was willing to ſet her Mind at Reſt, he would let her come as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and not ſtay till the maligne</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:110751:41"/>
               <hi>Perſwaſions of her Enemy, had made him change his Reſolution again, as they already had ſo often done.</hi> The King promiſed her, <hi>That ſhe ſhould be in the</hi> Seraglio <hi>that ſame Day; and that he was going to give Orders for that end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarice,</hi> (Thus was this Beautiful Slave called) was not one of thoſe ſparkling Beauties, that ſurprize people, as far off as they ſee them. Her Air was Sweet and Modeſt, the Face of a Child; but of a Child that has a Thouſand Charms, Brown, fine Blew Eyes, and a Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Whiter than is poſſible to be Imagined. Her Shape more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially was extream Delicate and Fine. She had ſomething Cunning in her Mouth, and which was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Character of her Soul; for, notwithſtanding all her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which her Air of Youth was Accompanied with; ſhe was more ſubtle and diſſembling, than any Creature of her Age. She was then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110751:41"/>
               <hi>Twenty</hi> Years Old at leaſt, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be <hi>Sixteen.</hi> She was a Native of <hi>Chio,</hi> an <hi>Iſland</hi> in all Ages Fruitful in Beauties, and is at preſent under the Dominion of the Grand <hi>Seignior.</hi> Her Father, who was of a pretty Conſiderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the <hi>Iſland</hi>; but whoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Fortune was but ſmall, Sold her to the Admiral of <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who made a Preſent of her to the <hi>Sultana.</hi> But now <hi>Clarice</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the King of <hi>Tunis</hi>; where the <hi>Queen,</hi> to whoſe Diſpoſition it was left to give her an Apartment, Lodged her as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhe could, and all the reſt of her Equipage; and as her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was anſwerable to her Lodging, it is eaſy to fancy what kind of Life ſhe paſſed, being a Stranger, and in a Place where ſhe neither ſaw nor knew any Body. This Life was very different from what <hi>Roſtan</hi> had promiſed Her at <hi>Tripoly,</hi> having given her hopes,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110751:42"/>
               <hi>That if ſhe managed her ſelf right, and made good uſe of her Charms, ſhe would become abſolute Miſtreſs of the King; and that there could not be with ſuch an Amorous Prince as he was, a more happy Creature than ſhe. Roſtan</hi> was not a falſe Prophet herein; but the time was not yet come, and Love has his Hours.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Clarice</hi> Lived with a great deal of Grief, and in a ſad Melancholly in this <hi>Seraglio. Caragus,</hi> whoſe Prudence required, for the Curing the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, that he ſhould diſſemble, and not ſee (at leaſt in the Beginning) that Slave, that he might have the more Liberty to do ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, conſtrained himſelf for ſome time, not without Violence; but by much Conſtraining, he at length forgot her; being of a Humour, that ſuch things as put him in pain, diſpleaſed him quickly; and the Flame of his Paſſion being only like a Fire of Straw; it was often
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110751:42"/>
almoſt as ſoon out as kindled. He hardly remembred the fair <hi>Clarice</hi> was in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when <hi>Rostan</hi> came one Morning into his Chamber, and ſhewed him this Letter that he had newly received from this Slave.</p>

God forbid</hi> (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King) <hi>that I ſhould have ſuch a Thought; her Death would coſt me too many Tears. What Pleaſure
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110751:43"/>
do you then take</hi> (Replyed <hi>Roſtan</hi>) <hi>to have her in the</hi> Seraglio, <hi>where you ſee how ſhe is Treated?</hi> The King falling to Excuſe himſelf, upon the Meaſures he was obliged to keep with the <hi>Queen. O Heavens! Is it poſſible</hi> (Cryed <hi>Rostan</hi>) <hi>that you ſhould have more regard for a Wife, than ſhe has for you? For in a word, do not you know, that her Commerce with</hi> Ibrahim <hi>continues still; and has ſhe blinded you to that point, as that you do not ſee, what all the</hi> Seraglio <hi>ſees?</hi> The King Bluſhed at this Reproach, not but that he had ſome ſuſpicion of what <hi>Rostan</hi> told him; but becauſe, that indeed he almoſt made himſelf blind, that he might not ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than was neceſſary for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe into the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Affairs. He cared not for her; and had on the contrary a very great Affection for <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> of whom he would have been more Jealous than of his Wife. And for this reaſon, he was afraid
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110751:44"/>
to be throughly Informed of this Affair, leſt it might oblige him out of Honour to Puniſh, or at leaſt to put away this Dear Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; and the one was almoſt as Cruel to him, as the other. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> came very unſeaſonably to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with more than he was willing to know; and quickly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off this Diſcourſe, he told him, to Appeaſe him, <hi>That he would ſee</hi> Clarice <hi>that Day without fail.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> being ſomething indiſpoſed, gave him a very fair Opportunity. He had been told before where that Slave was Lodged; and for the more Precaution, and that his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit might make the leſs Noiſe, he reſolved to ſtay till it was Night, and go thither all alone. He came thither, but was ſtrangely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; for entring the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he found the <hi>Queen</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Clarice.</hi> They were both extreamly Surprized; for as they ſought not for one another, they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110751:44"/>
did not think to have ſeen one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in that Place. They were both of this Opinion, that their coming thither, was not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to have met together; and having been ſome time without ſpeaking, and the <hi>Queen</hi> as the boldeſt, breaking Silence, <hi>I Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>that I ſhould Surprize you here, at one time or other. And for my part</hi> (Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King) <hi>the Truth is, I did not think to Surprize you here. How! What have you to ſay?</hi> (Replyed ſhe) <hi>Is it a Crime to watch you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Reaſon to distruſt you? No</hi> (Replyed he) <hi>but it is a very great one, to pretend to be indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Morning, and come to an Aſſignation in the Evening. I Sir, to an Aſſignation</hi> (Replyed ſhe) <hi>O Heavens! Is it to ſave your ſelf from my juſt Reproaches, that you begin thus firſt to accuſe me? I perceive what your buſineſs is here. And I</hi> (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King) <hi>ſuſpect no leſs of</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:110751:45"/>
               <hi>you; but I ſhall Remedy it. Ah! I ſhall Remedy it too</hi> (Anſwered ſhe, Riſing up haſtily to have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) <hi>I will not be played upon by a wretched Slave; and be looked upon more as a Cypher, than a</hi> Queen. <hi>No Body has a Right over my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Madam,</hi> (Replyed the King with ſomething a fierce Tone) <hi>but I have over yours. Over mine Sir,</hi> (Anſwered the <hi>Queen</hi> again) <hi>you have, 'tis true; but be aſſured, that I ſhall ever Regulate my ſelf by you. You are too good an Example</hi> (Added ſhe, as ſhe was going away) <hi>not to be followed.</hi> The King wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſeeing, as well as hearing her, made her no Anſwer, and let her go; but not knowing where to find <hi>Clarice,</hi> ſeeing ſhe was not in the Apartment that was given her, he was obliged to return to his own, and make inquiry after her. It was <hi>Ibrahim's</hi> Misfortune to meet with him in the way, as in all probability he was going to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110751:45"/>
the <hi>Queen.</hi> He was Amazed to ſee the King, who Eying him with ſome indignation. <hi>You will at length weary my Patience</hi> Ibrahim, (ſaid he to him) <hi>you abuſe my good Nature; and you do not remember how often, and what I forbad you.</hi> This young Favourite not wanting Wit, ſeeing the King came from <hi>Clarice</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, made uſe of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to juſtify himſelf; and told him, <hi>That having learnt that he had a deſire to make a Viſit to that Slave, he came immediately after him to acquaint him, how that the</hi> Queen <hi>had, two dayes before, given her a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Apartment than the former.</hi> Though the King had no reaſon to give Credit to what <hi>Ibrahim</hi> told him, who could not divine his Deſign, being he had mentioned it to no Body but <hi>Roſtan.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf however with this Excuſe; becauſe he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have any reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him, and having ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110751:46"/>
him whither they had removed that Slave; he referred his Viſit till the next day, for fear the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould come and diſturb them.</p>
            <p>It was not to oblige <hi>Clarice,</hi> that this Jealous Princeſs hnd given her another Apartment; but becauſe that ſhe had Being in a retired place, where there was no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the King would come, and find her; without that he had a Deſign to ſee that Slave, which ſhe did not expect; ſhe fancied it would be more convenient for her Amours, than her own Apartment, where ſhe was afraid of being Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and did not enjoy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the pleaſure of ſeeing her Dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as ſhe hoped to do with full Liberty in <hi>Clarice's</hi> Chamber. But ſhe had but ill Succeſs the firſt time, which did not however much Trouble her, being very glad to have found the King in a way to break the Oaths he had made her, of not ſeeing that Slave; fancying
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110751:46"/>
that this alone might ſerve her for an Excuſe, if ſhe for Her part, was not found ſo very Faithful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſtan</hi> was at the King's Riſing, to know how that firſt Viſit had paſſed. This Prince, who could not keep any Secret from him, not only acquainted him, that he had not found <hi>Clarice</hi> in her former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, but that he had met the <hi>Queen</hi> there. Whereupon <hi>Roſtan</hi> did not fail to Penetrate immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into the Truth of this Change; and to Animate the King at the ſame time, both againſt the <hi>Queen,</hi> and for <hi>Clarice,</hi> whoſe Life he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him Reſponſible; for, if he did not go and ſee her, <hi>Caragus,</hi> who was already all diſpoſed to it, was eaſily perſwaded to follow <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi>'s Counſel; and as ſoon as he was Dreſt, he went to that Slaves Apartment, whom he found at her Toylet, and in an Undreſs. She was (as I have already ſad) a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty Creature; but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110751:47"/>
in a careleſs Habit, and never was Woman ſo Charming as ſhe in that Condition. The King was in a Surprize; the Truth is, that conſidering the Complexion he was of, there needed not much to Charm him; but he was this time quite after another manner, than ever he had been before; and to that Degree, that he knew not what to ſay to her, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity that ſight caſt him in at firſt. <hi>Clarice</hi> not expecting this Honour, ſeeing the little Notice that Prince had taken of her; Bluſht as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, and her Cheeks Glowed with a Red, ſo much the more Charming; as that it admirably well became the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Complexion, and that it was Natural. <hi>Is it for ſuch a Perſon as you, Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe riſing) <hi>to Surprize People? I come here</hi> (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King) <hi>with a great deal of Confuſion, to ask you a Thouſand Pardons for my Negligence. I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:110751:47"/>
               <hi>I had Reaſons enough to juſtify my ſelf; but ſince I have ſeen you, I know not any, but what Condemns me: For nothing ought to be capable of making me forget the most Charming Perſon upon the Earth. Clarice,</hi> who had Evidently obſerved the Effect that her Beauty had produced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's Heart, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted to ſee him Confirm it by his Words. She Anſwered him with her tender, and innocent Air, <hi>That the Honour was too great that he did her:</hi> And in a Word, the Converſation proceeding much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ended by a New Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the King promiſed <hi>Clarice</hi>; and he only left her to go and give Order to prepare it for her that very day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> having had Notice from <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> of the Viſit the King had made that Slave, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Allarm'd, to hear that one of the fineſt Apartments of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> was Furniſhing for her. She
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110751:48"/>
gueſſed what this tended to; and Attributing all to <hi>Roſtan</hi> her Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy, by whoſe perſwaſion the King did all things; ſhe ſent to deſire this Prince to do her the Favour to come one Moment to her Apartment, that ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to him. The King made Anſwer, <hi>He was ſomething Buſy then, and that he would ſee her another time.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged than ever, could hardly curb her Rage; but as it was not yet time to ſhow it: and that ſhe did not Deſpair of reducing the King. She reſolved to Diſſemble, and knowing that he was in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> ſeeing that Apartment prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf: She without further waiting, went to find him out. As ſoon as ſhe appeared, all the Company in the Room withdrew, and ſhe caſt her ſelf at the King's Feet, with a ſad dejected Look, and a very humble Countenance; but yet Majeſtick, Grandeur being
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110751:48"/>
as inſeparable from all her Actions. She held a great Handkerchief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Eyes, with which ſhe ſeemed to dry up ſome Tears; and uſing the Tone of a very Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Woman: <hi>May I Sir,</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>ask you one Favour more? I am ſo Unfortunate, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made all my Happineſs conſiſt in poſſeſſing you, I am not capable of procuring yours; and that you ſeek elſewhere, wherewith to Content your ſelf; My Preſence would diſturb your Pleaſures here: I cannot ſee a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that belongs to me in the Armes of another. Give me leave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and go paſs far from hence the remainder of a wretched Life.</hi> The King, who had expected, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf for ſome Action of Fury from that haughty Princeſs; againſt which, he would perhaps have reſiſted, found himſelf Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with ſo much Humility; and was almoſt half Vanquiſh't with only ſeeing at his Feet a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110751:49"/>
of that Humour. The Truth is, that nothing has ſo great an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon a Heart, as the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Returns of thoſe Proud Spirits, becauſe they are unexpected; and that they are known to be very Rare, and that they coſt them Dear. The King (as I have newly ſaid) wholly Changed with this only Action; and already forgetting <hi>Clarice,</hi> he ſpoke to her with ſo much Sweetneſs, as made her diſcover all his Weakneſs. The diſſembling <hi>Homais</hi> did not fail to take Advantage of it, and told him all that was capable of Engaging him, and making him abandon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he had in Favour of the Slave, not ceaſing to proteſt to him, That ſhe had neither Titles, Honours, Eſtate, nor Life, but what ſhe would willingly Sacrifice to him: but that he ought to Conſider, that for a Moment of Pleaſure he might have with a Slave, he was going to Render her the moſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110751:49"/>
wretched Woman upon the Earth, in the ſight of all his Kingdom; though all the <hi>Divan</hi> had deem'd her Worthy of ſharing with him his Crown. The King, as if it had been a great Crime, to have once wronged a Woman, whom he knew was not very true to him, denied he had ever had any ſuch Deſign; and did all he could to ſet her Mind at reſt. But the <hi>Queen</hi> ſtill ſeeming very much diſquieted, told him, <hi>That there was only two wayes to pacify her, which was either to ſend that Slave back to</hi> Tripoly, <hi>or Marry her to ſome one of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> The King was Troubled at this Propoſition; but not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Excuſe doing it after the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances he had made in that point; He choſe rather to get her a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than deprive himſelf all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the ſight of ſo Lovely a Maid. Wherefore he told her, <hi>He would Marry her; and that he would Endeavour to find ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:110751:50"/>
               <hi>that was a fit Match for her.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> ſatisfied with this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though it had been more ſafe for her, <hi>Clarice</hi> had been ſent back: ſhe only deſired the King, he would once keep his word with her; and that for their Mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, this affair might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; to the end, that Slave might leave the <hi>Seraglio</hi> as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Caragus</hi> promiſed her to do it; and parting, he went to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>'s Apartment, to acquaint her with this News, and ſee how ſhe would Receive it. But ſhe could not fail of being Surprized, after the Obliging things he had ſaid, and the Promiſes he had made her, to ſee ſo ſuddain, and ſo great a Change: She could not forbear ſhedding Tears, and deſired the King, ſince it was left to her choiſe to Marry, or to return to <hi>Tripoly,</hi> ſhe might have leave to go thither; not being willing to redouble her unhappineſs, by Marrying a Man,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110751:50"/>
whoſe Fortune was as much to make as hers. The King being moved with her Tears, and Charmed more than ever with her Beauty, was now much leſs willing, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to part from her. But means were to be found to Appeaſe the <hi>Queen,</hi> or at leaſt to ſtop her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: for he Dreaded her violent Spirit; and therefore, had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Rostan</hi>'s Counſel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> had been ſo often deceived by the Promiſes the King had made her, that ſhe would have had Reaſon to fear, he would have failed her again this time, if ſhe had known the Paſſion he had for that Slave; but as the King had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen her, ſhe fancied it was only a ſlight Amour, which he would make no difficulty of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to her Satisfaction: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſhe expected to ſee <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> ſuddenly Married, which ſhe thought would put a ſtop to his budding Deſires, which might have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110751:51"/>
been diſadvantageous to her, if ſhe had not bethought her ſelf betimes of preventing it; for by removing that Creature out of the King's ſight, and Marrying her with a Chriſtian, was not only the means of making him ſlight her, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her altogether: the force of his Paſſion never Proceeding ſo far, as to Love People long, that were out of his ſight. She was expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with great impatience the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Affair, when ſhe ſaw the King come into her Chamber, who told her ſmilling, <hi>That it was a thing Concluded on, that ſhe ſhould be ſatisfied; and that</hi> Clarice <hi>was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Marry, not a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>but a</hi> Turk; <hi>becauſe there being in that Country only wretched Slaves of that Religion, ſhe choſe rather to turn</hi> Turk, <hi>than be Reduced to ſo miſerable a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</hi> The <hi>Queen,</hi> after having thanked the King for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance; and having declared to him, through a Zeal of Religion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110751:51"/>
the joy ſhe had of that Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, asked him, <hi>Who it was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for her Husband?</hi> The King made Anſwer, <hi>That it was</hi> Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him; <hi>and that</hi> Clarice, <hi>who had ſeen him two or three times by chance, having found him to her Mind, had made Choice of him her ſelf; and that he had given her his Word that ſhe ſhould have him.</hi> The <hi>Sultana</hi> not expecting to be Attacked on that ſide, was in an inſtant ſo full of Grief, that ſhe was not ſo much Miſtreſs of her ſelf, as to prevent ſhewing it in her Looks. She was even quite out of Countenance; and notwithſtanding all the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Spirit, ſhe remained mute, and without reply. The King, whoſe Deſign was to obſerve her, took great Delight to ſee her in that Perplexity; and that he might quite Confound her; <hi>I do not ſee, Madam</hi> (purſued he with a Rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tone, which however was not uſual to him) <hi>how a fitter Husband</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:110751:52"/>
               <hi>for that Slave can be found. She is Pritty,</hi> Ibrahim <hi>is Handſome; and I am ſure all the Earth will approve of ſo Accompliſht a Match. As for you, Madam, — For me, Sir,</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſhe) <hi>I ſhall not Oppoſe it: but I perceive your Deſign; you would give that Slave to</hi> Ibrahim, <hi>becauſe that, being Maſter of the Husband, you might eaſily have the Wife at your diſpoſal: Thus you are willing enough to Conſent to it; becauſe by this means, you Diſpoſe of her ſo, as to ſee her with the more Conveniency: But A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! All the Misfortune will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Ah! No Madam,</hi> (Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the King Her) <hi>If that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only makes you fear the Union of thoſe two Perſons; For your Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will ſend them both far from hence; and I will go this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to make them Conſent to it.</hi> The King, who never knew how to Diſſemble, Acted his part ſo well this time, that he deceived the <hi>Queen,</hi> as ſubtle as ſhe was; for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110751:52"/>
all he had ſaid to her, came purely from <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who knowing the weak ſide of the Lady better than the King, had given him his Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; being aſſured, ſhe would ſooner Conſent to all things, than this Match. And indeed, the <hi>Queen</hi> Loved <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with ſuch a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather ſuch a Rage, that there was nothing but what ſhe would have done, to have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted loſing him; and the King had no ſooner left her, than that all Alarm'd, ſhe ran to her Cloſet, to Write to that Dear Gallant; which ſhe did in theſe Terms, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and Trouble ſhe was in.</p>

will be, and thy Misfortune. I ſhould Dye of Regret, and thou wouldſt not have any great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with her; for it is not for thy ſake that ſhe is to be Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee.

Be upon thy Guard; I fancy that thou haſt that kindneſs for me as not to quit me for another: But herein thou muſt ſhew Reſulution, and be aſſured, that I will never abandon thee; and that I will ſooner loſe my Life, than loſe thee.

            <p>This was a great Tryumph for <hi>Roſtan,</hi> which the King bore all the burden of, &amp; could not rejoyce as he did; but he comforted himſelf with the repriſals he had upon <hi>Clarice,</hi> whom he hoped to have ſuddainly an entire, and free poſſeſſion of: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having not the ſcruples and delicacies of other Husbands, and a Miſtreſs being dearer to him than ten Wifes, he was not concerned for all the <hi>Queen</hi> could do, having even wiſhed ſhe might have done more, if more could be done, that he might have had the more Right to Reprizals. And indeed, ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate a Creature as <hi>Homais,</hi> could not well ſtop in ſo fair a way, and the nooze was already ſo wide, that ſhe could not forbear ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through it.</p>

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had been that day at the <hi>Queen</hi>'s to tell her, <hi>That he was going without farther delay, to marry</hi> Ibrahim <hi>with</hi> Clarice; <hi>and that the nuptialls would be about the Evening, which ſhe was to prepare her ſelf for.</hi> The <hi>Queen,</hi> who ſince the News of this Match, had been in fearful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and Torments, and which had wholly changed her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, fancyed ſhe had found a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plauſible pretext to defer it, by telling him, <hi>That ſhe was not very</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> who was too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to let her ſelf be trepanned by words, which were too obliging for her, whom the <hi>King</hi> had no reaſon to be ſatisfied with, eaſily perceived, that there was malice couched under; and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of ſo ſuddain a match, had other ends, than only to pleaſe her. But ſhe thought fit likewiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble: Nor indeed had ſhe any apparent reaſon to oppoſe it, after what the <hi>King</hi> had ſaid to her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making known to him how

            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> reply'd, That the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of letting him out by day was eaſy to be overcome, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing him in ſome <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Cloathes, by which means he might eaſily get out of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi>: The <hi>Keeper</hi> made anſwer, That that was true, if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had the keeping of him; but as there were others beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who were continually coming into his Chamber to have an eye

            <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> Whoſe paſſion would have furniſhed her with a thouſand inventions upon that Subject, found out quickly what was requiſite to deceive the <hi>Keepers,</hi> by putting ſome Body in his place, who ſhould put on his Cloathes; but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was to find this ſome Body, who would thus ſacrifice his life for his ſake, the danger being as inevitable: Inſomuch, that ſhe choſe rather to run that riſque her ſelf, than loſe that occaſion; not ſeeing any ſurer means to free her Gallant out of ſo cruel a perplexity, and ſet her own mind at reſt. She knew what anſwer to make in caſe ſhe was ſurprized there: For the jealouſy ſhe had ſeemed to have of the <hi>King,</hi> for his Marrying that Slave to one of his Creatures, that

            <p>The Rogue of a Keeper, fancying the buſineſs to be come to the Point, that thoſe who ſet him to work, were willing to have it, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of the <hi>Queens</hi> Opinion; and told her what ſhe had to do, that it was neceſſary ſhe ſhould put on the <hi>Mooreſſes</hi> Cloathes who carried Meat to <hi>Ibrahim</hi>; and that ſhe her ſelf ſhould carry him his Dinner; and when ſhe was come into his Room, ſhe might give him hers, and take his Clothes at the ſame time, and act the part of a Priſoner till the Evening; and that when the Gates of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> were ſhut, and the other Keepers were gone, he would let her out, and ſhe might return to her Apartment.</p>
            <p>Things being thus regulated, they followed the meaſures they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that is to ſay, this Rogue hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Ah!

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had not the patience to let her make an end, and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her at that propoſition; He told her, <hi>He would never do ſo baſe an action; knowing very well, that the</hi> King <hi>would put her to Death, or cauſe her to be ſhut up in ſome place, from whence ſhe could never get out; and that he would rather expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the moſt cruel Death, than give the leaſt occaſion, that any miſchief ſhould happen to her for his ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Queen</hi> knew ſo well how to repreſent to Him, That ſhe had nothing to be afraid of; that things were ſo well contrived, that there would not be the leaſt appearance, that ſhe had any way contributed to his eſcape; and that there was no going back in that buſineſs; that at length, this too generous Lover was perſwaded to obey her: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he put of his Cloathes,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110751:60"/>
and put on the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s; in which, after mutual Careſſes, Tears, and the moſt tender <hi>fare-wels</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he went out of the Room, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted by the ſame Keeper. But they were hardly out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> e're he was ſeized, and likewiſe the <hi>Keeper</hi> for formes ſake; and were carryed into another Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deſpair and complain, and accuſe Heaven, Deſtiny, and even his <hi>Prophet Mahomet,</hi> of his misfortune.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> dreſt in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Cloathes, and wrapt up in her <hi>Barnus,</hi> with which ſhe hid her face, kept lying upon the Bed, that the Guards who came in and out, might not ſtand to look on her; and that ſhe might with leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act the part ſhe did, She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready took an extream delight in imagining ſhe had freed her dear <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and that he was out of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> gone from <hi>Tunis</hi>; and that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110751:61"/>
he would be quickly ſecure from the deſignes of his Enemies; that ſhe might go to him her ſelf, as ſhe was reſolved to do, not being able to live without that Dear Gallant.</p>
            <p>She thus employed her mind with a thouſand agreeable thoughts, that the time might not ſeem Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, till the hour the <hi>Keeper</hi> had promiſed to come, and fetch her from thence, and conduct her to her Apartment.</p>
            <p>But this Comedy was not to be yet at an end. One of the fineſt ſcenes was ſtill to come, which ſhe did not in the leaſt expect; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>King, Roſtan, Clarice,</hi> and <hi>Her ſelf</hi> were to be the Principle Actors. It paſſed about the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and they all Three came into the Priſoner's Chamber. <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> (ſaid <hi>Roſtan,</hi> who had Charged himſelf with that Adventure) <hi>here we are to Conclude the Match, you have been ſpoke to of; for you are</hi>

               <hi>not to come out of Priſon, till you have Married</hi> Clarice: <hi>It being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Repoſe, both of the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Queen, <hi>who both deſire it, and will ſee it Finiſhed this Evening; that</hi> Clarice <hi>may go out of the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio <hi>to Morrow; and that you may depart together, and retire into ſome place out of the Kingdom. Come, Riſe, and give me your Hand, Swear here before the</hi> King, <hi>that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Maid for your Lawful Wife; and that you will never Abandon her, in what part of the World ſo ever you go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſy to imagine, what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity the unfortunate <hi>Queen</hi> was in, ſeeing her ſelf upon the point of falling into the cruelleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that could have befalled her. But as it was already Late, and there being no Light in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe fancied, ſhe might perhaps avoid it, and not be known: She Roſe, gave her Hand to <hi>Roſtan,</hi> for this pretended Marriage, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110751:62"/>
prepared her ſelf no leſs, than to Stab that Slave with a Ponyard ſhe ever carried about her, if for her ſake ſhe received any Affront; as indeed ſhe had like to have put it in Execution; but ſhe would have paid Dear for the Stroke.</p>
            <p>Thereupon two Flambeus being brought in, to give Light to this Fine Ceremony; the King, who till then had walked in the Room without ſaying a Word, come near thoſe that were to be Married, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the falſe <hi>Ibrahim</hi> hid himſelf under his <hi>Barnus,</hi> that his Face might not be ſeen, he bid one of the Guards take it from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People were not uſed to be Married without being ſeen. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that they then diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the fair <hi>Queen</hi> in <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Cloaths; who, all of a ſuddain Tranſported with Motions of Rage, Shame, and Jealouſy, was going to Revenge her ſelf with her Ponyard upon that poor Victime, if he had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110751:62"/>
not Cried: <hi>Ah Madam! What do you do? It is</hi> Ibrahim.</p>
            <p>At that Voice, fixing her Eyes upon him, ſhe knew him; and her Ponyard falling out of her Hands, ſhe had occaſion for help to hold her up from falling upon the Floor, being ready to Faint, through ſuch quite different Motions, after the Riſque that this Dear Lover had Run, of Dying by her own Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſtan</hi> took a great Delight in all this Adventure; but the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe Nature was not ſo Cruel, though moſt Concerned, reſolved to withdraw, after having given Order that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould be Lead to her Apartment; and that <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> ſhould be kept more Narrowly than ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rostan</hi> was extreamly Delighted with all this Encounter; but it had only filled <hi>Ibrahim</hi> with Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Grief: yet as the <hi>King</hi> was one, who laid not things much to Heart; and beſides the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110751:63"/>
of Women, being not of ſo great Conſequence to Husbands in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> where they are Acquainted with their Weakneſſes; as in <hi>Europe,</hi> where they expect more Virtue, though Women every where, there needed no more than the ſight of <hi>Clarice</hi> to put him in a better Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. To that intent, he went to ſee her, and paſſed ſome Hours with her, with ſo much the more Joy, as that he did not fear the <hi>Queen</hi> would come, and diſturb him. This Viſit Augmented his Paſſion more than ever: He expreſſed it to <hi>Clarice</hi> in ſuch paſſionate Terms, that ſhe was not altogether inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: And as there was to be a Feaſt the next day, at a Country Houſe, of the General of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,</hi> who was deſirous to Treat the <hi>King,</hi> He deſired her to be there, or otherwiſe he would not go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he had given his word; not being able to paſs an Hour, much leſs half a Day, out of her
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110751:63"/>
ſight, without Trouble and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
            <p>The fair <hi>Clarice</hi> conſenting to it, the <hi>King</hi> told her, that the <hi>Chious</hi> of <hi>Tripoly's</hi> Wife, would carry her thither; a very Honorable employ for that Lady, and which ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted her ſelf of, like a Woman of Wit and Courage. The Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was very Magnificent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſtan</hi> who conſidered that day as a day of Tryumph for him, and the entire ruine of the <hi>Queen</hi> put all the Company in a way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Joy and Pleaſures: The King was in the beſt Humour Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; and with Reaſon, for it is ſaid to be there, that he firſt gave Proofs of his Paſſion to his Dear <hi>Clarice,</hi> who appeared in a Pompous and Magnificent Dreſs.</p>
            <p>The Deſolate <hi>Queen</hi> did not paſs her time ſo agreeably. She was not only to bear the Grief of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Ambition overturned; and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110751:64"/>
a Slave, who had at length got the better of her: but ſhe was likewiſe to ſupport the cruel Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her Love. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was in Priſon, and ſhe in fears of what would become of his Life: But that which Grieved, and Stung her moſt, was the Remembrance of the Affront ſhe had Received, by the Prank that that Traitor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> had played her; and which ſhe would willingly have been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of, at the Peril of her Life. In a word, Glory, Ambition, Love, all was Ruined in her; and only Death, could Comfort her in ſo much Affliction. But ſhe was not willing of her ſelf, to give that Triumph to her Enemies, and ſhe hoped, that as long as ſhe ſhould Live, ſhe ſhould be Powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or at leaſt, Ingenuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to repay them ſooner or later, part of the Ills they made her Suffer.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ſhe had not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110751:64"/>
that command of her ſelf, but that the great Diſorder there was in her heart, troubling extreamly the good diſpoſition of Her Body, ſhe fell ſick; and in a few dayes, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced within an Ace of the Grave. The <hi>King</hi> not knowing what it was to keep Reſentment againſt his greateſt Enemies, could not preſerve ſo much hatred againſt a Woman, whom he had in ſome manner loved; but that the pitty he had, to know ſhe was in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, brought him back to her. He was even ſo concerned at the ſight of her, and ſo moved with the ſenſible and pittyful things ſhe ſaid to him, that if this unhappy <hi>Queen</hi> had asked him to have abandoned his dear <hi>Clarice,</hi> he would without doubt have promiſe her he would; but I know not, if he would have kept his word <hi>Homais</hi> more diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, asked him only; <hi>If he would pardon what had past, and live with her in the ſame good underſtanding as they</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:110751:65"/>
               <hi>did together, for ſome time after their Marriage?</hi> Which the <hi>King</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with more Goodneſs, than ſhe could have hoped for; and likewiſe declared to her, in a very careſſing manner, how extreamly he was grieved, and how ſenſible he was to ſee her ſo ill; and how joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he ſhould be, to ſee her recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And this aſſurance was ſo great a Cordial to that poor afflicted One, that ſince that Viſit, her Fevour, as well as her Trouble of mind, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed every day. The <hi>King</hi> came often to ſee her; but that was of no diſadvantage to <hi>Clarice</hi>: On the contrary, ſhe continually augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Authority and Favour; and though he had a great deal of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her, before he poſſeſſed her intirely; yet it ſeemed, that ſince this Union, his Love was become more ardent than ever; Contrary to the cuſtome of all other Lovers, who are often ſenſible of the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of their flames, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:110751:65"/>
they continue to enjoy what they love; the Habit of Pleaſures diſguſting them from that of loving ſtill the ſame thing. This <hi>Prince,</hi> I ſay, who paſſed for the moſt fickle of all Lovers, appeared now the moſt conſtant of all men: his Cares, his Aſſiduities, his Eagerneſſes for the faire <hi>Clarice,</hi> had no bounds, and he ſtill found ſome new Charme in her: From thence may be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this Maid, with her little Aire of innocence, was the moſt ſubtle Creature that ever was to have found the way to fix the <hi>Kings</hi> heart, who nothing pleaſed but ſhe. This did not fail to make ſome envy, and others jealous of her: But the Power ſhe had got over the <hi>King</hi> having inſenſibly made her haughty, ſhe came to have many Enemies; for ſhe deſpiſed thoſe ſhe was moſt obliged to: ſhe neglected <hi>Roſtan,</hi> to whom ſhe owed all ſhe had; and having been made <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> through the Interceſſion of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110751:66"/>
General of the Gallyes, who was her particular Friend, ſhe fell out with him about a thing of ſmall conſequence; which cauſed ſeveral Rumours to run of her, which were not to her Advantage. There was a report, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Tripoly</hi> knew what ſtuff ſhe was made of before he gave her to the <hi>Sultana</hi>; that an Aga of the <hi>Baſhawes</hi> had found her as kind as that <hi>Admiral</hi> had been; and <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> likewiſe had been payed for the pains he had taken, in bringing her to <hi>Tunis</hi>; yet all theſe Storyes, and all the other Tempeſts, which roſe up againſt her, blew over, and rather turned to her Advantage. The King had not thoſe Delicacies of other Lovers; He had declared more than once, that in point Miſtreſſes, he loved them beſt at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand, and that he ever found enough for him to do; that is to ſay, he loved to have way made for him, and to enjoy pleaſure without pain.</p>
