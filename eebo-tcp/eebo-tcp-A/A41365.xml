         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am not satisfied, that ever <hi>Goedartius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to publish these <hi>Papers:</hi> or that He
aimed at any thing more, then to please and
gratifie his Fancy, and the excellent skill
he had in <hi>Limning.</hi> And this appeares from
the almost totall neglect of descriptions, which
he had sufficient oppertunity, to have well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and the many references to the Colours
in his <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igns,</hi> which <hi>Calcography,</hi> or <hi>Printing</hi>
could not represent; besides the tumultuous order,
we have them first published in, after his Death:
above all, the little advancement he seemes to
have made, in his Skill, in the nature of <hi>Insects,</hi>
after 40. Yeares (as he says himselfe) daily
conversing with them: so that he seemes rather,
to have diverted with them, then to have given
himselfe the trouble of well understanding them.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this, you will find him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where very just, and true in his Observations:
but in many places very short, and hardly Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>le.</p>
            <p>Again, as he most industreously fed them, and
<pb facs="tcp:49809:3"/>
observed their <hi>Changes;</hi> so he committed little
or nothing to Writing or <hi>Designe,</hi> but what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with him, and (as he understood it)
had its right <hi>Change:</hi> Which is more, than any
man ever did before him; So that we need not
admire, that so long, and pertinatious an Industry
produced so few <hi>History</hi>s: For he <hi>Designed</hi> not
all, that came to hand, but such only, as it was his
good fortune to Feed, and bring up to <hi>Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet in these few <hi>Historys,</hi> you will have
something of all the severall <hi>Genus's</hi> of <hi>Insects,</hi>
that are in Nature.</p>
            <p>He left his Papers in <hi>Dutch,</hi> which were at
severall times, and that by divers hands, put forth
in <hi>Latin:</hi> His <hi>Latin Interpreters</hi> have added
Comments, indeed; but were Men wholy ignorant
in <hi>Naturall History;</hi> and their Comments are meere
<hi>Rapsodies,</hi> and altogether impertinent to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of any one <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Godartius:</hi> As he,
who shall attentively consider them, will plainly
find: wherefore in this our <hi>Translation;</hi> I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, and have Printed the <hi>Authors</hi> words
only, and have here and there used the freedom of
animadverting, upon what is not agreeable to my
owne experience in these matters: besids I have
<hi>Methodised</hi> the <hi>Historys,</hi> according to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
natures of the <hi>Insects</hi> they treat about; and;
<pb facs="tcp:49809:3"/>
(where I could understand him) I have explained
many things, that might be doubted of: And
those who injoy a sutable leasure may hereby be put
in a ready way, to pursue the <hi>History</hi> of these long
neglected <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also I have taken great care of the <hi>Designes,</hi>
in transferring them upon <hi>Copper Plates;</hi> which I
dare promise are Exquisitly performed, by the best
of our <hi>English Artists:</hi> which was my expence; and
which the Book-sellers were not willing to Reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse
me; so that this Impression consists but of a
150. <hi>Coppys,</hi> which were intended only for
the curious. And upon this occasion I must needs
say, that <hi>Naturall History</hi> is much injured,
through the little incouragement, which is given
to the <hi>Artist,</hi> whose Noble performances can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be enough rewarded; being not only necessary,
but the very beauty, and life of this kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Reader</hi> shall yet desire to be informed, why
the Comments go no farther, then the greater part
of the work only; let him know, that the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
lay by me unfinished, and in the first draught
for above Seven Years, and had so done long enough,
had not my very good Friend <hi>Mr. T. K.</hi> of <hi>Cowk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reig,</hi>
very Obligingly undertaken to Transcribe
and perfect it. So that the humour of Comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:49809:4"/>
being past me, and the notions I once had of
these things, being lesse fresh in my memory, I
had little leisure to instruct my selfe againe,
but suffered it to go in that particular, as he
found it.</p>

for change, with its head hanging downwards, as you

were like wet Paper; Off of which fell certain watery

they became in halfe an houre dry, expanded,

               <p>This Butterfly feeds on sweet things, as Sugar, and
the Honey of flowers: Also it is mainly delighted in
rotten fruits, for which they fight among them selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49809:5"/>In winter time they hide them selves within the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

               <p>Also they are found lying hid in hollow Trees.</p>
               <p>It is well Observed by our <hi>Author</hi> that this Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar,

their beginning from the Eggs of their respective But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflys.

               <p>Before the Catterpillar changes its shape for that of

rising, and falling often with his body it conducts its
body into a circle, upon which it swells so, that the skin
cracks all the length, and so by little and little it falls
off, a new skin growing underneath. And at that time
they rest a while.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49809:6"/>This is very notable in these Catterpillars, that where

               <p>Afterwards the Butterfly let fall from his Taile four

about Flowers, dipping that long Sting, or Tongue into
the flowers, and so to suck out the Honey, or sweet juice,
not setling or lighting upon the Flower, but doing of it as
they fly; for if they setled, their Legs were two short to
suffer them to use their <hi>Tongue;</hi> and this I take to be
the cause, of their constant taking their nourishment in
flight, and not alighting, or setling upon the flower,</p>
               <p>There is a sort of <hi>Gnatts,</hi> bread in Trees, which in
like manner are armed with long Stings, and can use them
siting, because they have long Feet, especially in the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

hinder their feeding, save when they are upon the Wing.</p>

supplyed it with Earth and fragments of Leaves, in order

it has a sharp <hi>Pinn</hi> or <hi>Sting,</hi> and <hi>Venemous,</hi> which it
vses (as soon as it is troubled) to defend it selfe with,
with a swift agitation, and every where; that it may
Wound them that hurts it, with the motion of the Sting.</p>
               <p>The Male <hi>Catterpillars</hi> are Green (as we said) and want
those round sports which look like Eves; the Females are
not so Beautifull, but of a more Grayish colour.</p>
               <p>Before that these <hi>Catterpillars</hi> change, they move long
and much, and exactly clean themselves of all Excrements:
they make themselves no covering (as all other <hi>Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars</hi>
are diligently wont to doe) but puting off their
Hackle, they are changed into <hi>Chrysalis's</hi> as is expressed
in the <hi>Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This change happned the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1663.
and the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Year following 1664. came forth
a lusty <hi>Butterfly,</hi> which lived till the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> fasting.</p>
               <p>I could never Observe from these kind of <hi>Catterpillars</hi>
a perfect and compleat <hi>Butterfly,</hi> but with contracted,
and as it were scorched Wings, not to be expanded, or fit

               <p>(3ly.) A probable reason why our <hi>Author,</hi> never could
have a compleat <hi>Butterfly,</hi> of this Kind, was, because

hearing, for at the least noise it feares and contracts it
selfe, as I have often tryed.</p>
               <p>The time of its change approaching, it abstaines from
meat, and seeks a fit place to rest in, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I put it some bits of Wood and <hi>Vine leaves,</hi> of which
and the juice of its Body mixt, it made it selfe a House,
and changed in it, the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1665. And
lived in it untill the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> and longer, which

               <p>This is most certain (this Animall) did live without
food from the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1665. untill the <hi>16th.</hi> of
<hi>Aprill,</hi> 1668. To which its coldnesse and continuall rest,
did seem to conduce very much, from which and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciousness

which rest in winter, and eat not till the Spring or summer.</p>

dyed, by being taken out of its <hi>Foliculus,</hi> and therefore in

               <p>As to its coldnesse; I can witnesse that in the depth of
Winter, and in the very deep Snow, I have found both <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars</hi>
and <hi>Hexapode Worms,</hi> lying upon the Snow, and
therefore have crawled out upon it. I say these <hi>Catterpillars</hi>
were so hard Frozen that thrown against a Glasse, they
made a sound like stones; but put under the Glasse and set
before the Fire, did quickly crawl about, and bestir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

look upon as a kind of unquenched Lime, put Life into

from rotten <hi>Willow,</hi> and is found lying in the Bodies of

wont to be made by boyling.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Catterpillar</hi> lives of this fat juice, and is to be
found in the marrow of that Tree, both Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for our <hi>Dutch-Boors,</hi> when they cleave them in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
often light upon them: But to have their change they
must either keep them in a warmer place, or not take
them out of the Wood.</p>

creeping in the High-wayes, then seekeing out a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place for to change in; which choice is an old
decayed <hi>Willow,</hi> for its softness, and for its food.</p>
               <p>Concerning the manner of the Propogation of these
<hi>Catterpillars,</hi> it is obscure, and not fully known to me,
and cannot easily be found out, for on the outside of the
Tree are no chinks or cracks, no (not small) holes, and
yet <hi>Catterpillars</hi> are to be found within.</p>
               <p>This is most certain, that I have found these often in the
<hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Willows,</hi> and it is likely they are there gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of corrupt Wood by heate, as other <hi>Animalls,</hi>
which are spontaneousely begot.</p>
               <p>Also haveing very often tryed to keep them to know
what would become of them, they all Dyed, and when
I did stop up their Dead Bodys in Juggs, I had a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

Generated of heat and corrupted matter.</p>

little Worms are capable of piercing the Tree, by little and
little, that is as they Eat, that probably these little Holes
grow up againe, after they are once fully entered, at least so as
not to be visible, but to a very dilligent enquiry. Again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably

time, it is as well worth our pains, the picking these out of
Blossoms betimes, as the weeding of Corne is. And my reason
is, because they are bred but once in a season or about a time;
and therefore if you rid the Fruit once of them, the Fruit is
secure of them ever after. But of these I purpose to say more

               <p>It change the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1659. As is <hi>Figured</hi> in the
<hi>Table,</hi> they undergo the like change in the Fethers of
<hi>Duck,</hi> wrapt up and hid therein, that nothing but a
little hole was left for the <hi>Butterfly</hi> to go out of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>7th.</hi> Day of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1659. came forth a <hi>Butterfly,</hi>
or Moth <hi>Figured</hi> in the <hi>Table,</hi> this Moth is beautifull and
delights in flying, wherein it uses strange motions and
windings. These Moths live long unlesse they be taken
in Spiders webs.</p>
               <p>They shun the light and hide themselves in obscure
places, and sometimes in Gardens, under the leaves of
Plants: They feed on the Sweet Dews on Flowers, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Flyes; they hide themselves in winter in Houses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>History,</hi> some have doubted whether the <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar</hi>
was ever perfectly formed before its change, but
was rather borne after the change, because that untill the
change it remained in the place of its birth, and took its
nourishment there as Children do in the Womb, and
Chickens in their Eggs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Butterfly</hi> living abroad in summer, and returning
into Hovses in Winter, is enough to satisfy the manner of
this <hi>Catterpillars</hi> birth, which is from the <hi>Animall</hi> Parent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and not of putrified flesh, also it was in disguise in the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

to break forth of each side its body; this was done with
great anxiety, and contortion of its Body: The first
Worm, as soon as borne, fastned upon the wound, it came
out off, and suckt up all the juice, and substance of the
Mother <hi>Catterpillar;</hi> so that nothing but skin was left:
The other Worm through the firsts greediness, being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all food, dyed in the wound, out of which it
was coming: Whose body also, the Mother being evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
was consumed and drawn dry by the first Worm.
This first Worm being now satisfied, with the Bodies of
Mother and Brother, rested moveless, and without any
other food, untill the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1664. And then
<hi>changed</hi> into a Black Egg: The 18<hi>th.</hi> Day of <hi>May,</hi> the

wou'd be apt to fall in: also a deep soile they love, that
the water may not soak thorough, and trouble them.</p>
               <p>In such an earth they dig holes, to breed in; sometimes
three, and sometimes three foot and a halfe deep, and a
foot square within: into these holes they carry fine, and

               <p>Every Bee lay 9. little <hi>Worms</hi> in this <hi>Theca,</hi> or <hi>Cell,</hi>

be like a compleat Egg: This <hi>Cell</hi> now to the Sense is

this <hi>Theca,</hi> or <hi>Cell;</hi> as though they had a mind to
keep it warme, and so hatch it; and again I saw them
scratch it, as though they wou'd make a crack or opening

               <p>The <hi>Worms</hi> included in this Egg-like <hi>Cell,</hi> daily grew
biger and biger; in the mean time the lesser Bees did not

did help forwards, this work of breaking it open; and
they growing; the heat also increased, which made the

out of the Chamber, in which I did keep them; but

others, and the Honey gathered for winter.</p>

Him I saw near dying early ith morning before the

did excite a noise to them, creeping out of the House:
But wholy horrid and Trembling in body; hither come,
as it were tired, he lay down and without Convultion
of the feet, sweetly did expire; neither did that seem a
wonder to me, for his feet were long since numbed with

out of the Cmbs, whose Head was pluckt from the

               <p>I beheld this Trunk palpitating, and lying alive two

               <p>It is also worth admiration, about the birth of these

               <p>The <hi>Worm,</hi> of the 110<hi>th. Table,</hi> was brought in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ship from <hi>New Zeland,</hi> in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> into this

               <p>I found it in the bark of wood, of which Chests are
wont to be made, in which is wont to be brought <hi>Sugar,</hi>
out of the <hi>Indies;</hi> from that bark it hath its <hi>Originall,</hi>
and doth seek nourishment; it began to undergoe the

19<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and at that time <hi>changed</hi> the skin; and
with the skin the shape; by little and little, the colour,
members and all the rest.</p>
               <p>The manner of the <hi>change</hi> (as I Observed it) I have
set forth in the <hi>Table,</hi> and at length, the Transformation
being compleated, an <hi>Insect,</hi> (perhaps never seen in these

               <p>The <hi>Worm,</hi> of the 111<hi>th. Table,</hi> is in <hi>Dutch</hi> called the

               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49809:68"/>I took this <hi>Worm</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1659. And I kept
it a whole Year in a Glasse bottle, with Earth put in the
bottome: To which I injected the seed of <hi>Henbite,</hi> with
a <hi>White flower.</hi> (for there is another Herb of that name
with <hi>Purple flowers</hi>) and I observed in the evening the
<hi>Worm</hi> to be wont to come forth, up from the bottom of
the Bottle, that it might feed upon the Herb, and Flower,
before described; this being done, again it hid it self
within the Earth; for never or very seldom, it do's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
in the Day time, above ground.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Wormes</hi> of this kind have eaten enough, and
have come to the just Magnitude of body, they seek
high places; that they may safely quiesce, and that they
may pleasingly compose themselves to Transformation,
which they expect.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Worm</hi> seems to come from the seed of those <hi>Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
which eat the leaves of trees, and which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in <hi>Holland</hi> upon the tops of Trees in <hi>May,</hi> for then
their nourishment every where abounds.</p>
               <p>This kind is wont to stay above ground two whole
Months, or a little more, the rest of the Months of the
Year, it lyes hid under ground and useth no nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
like to a dead thing, and it do's always, unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
plainly quiesce; but touched with a hot hand, or
otherwise, it forthwith stirrs; as I have often tryed.
And this also of this kind of <hi>Beetle,</hi> never to be found
two or more joyned under ground; but alwayes <hi>Solitary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the <hi>Worms</hi> hither to described, were transformed
into <hi>Beetles,</hi> they had lived over the forth Year.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Worm</hi> of this <hi>Table,</hi> did begin to <hi>change</hi> it's forme
on the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1658. and I have described the
manner of it'<hi>s</hi> Transmutation; and in <hi>May,</hi> 1659.
from that came a <hi>Beetle</hi> deplcted also.</p>
               <p>It lives long, provided it be not starved; for want of

               <p>This Kind of <hi>Worm,</hi> I found creeping upon <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne;</hi>
and in vaine have sought it other where: They
are pernicious creatures, for they eat the green Ears or
Sheathings of Wheat: They swiftly ascend, and descend,
as soon as they perceive the Corn to be touched with a
Stick or the Hand, (The like is above noted of an <hi>Eruca</hi>)
forthwith they cast themselves upon the ground, be
they little or greater; the lesse swiftlier, then the greater;
for that these are not so Tenacious of the Corne as those,
which are Armed in the hinder parts with <hi>Clikers,</hi> by
the help of which, they hold hard upon the Corne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen upon the ground they creep into it, and ly hid
under it.</p>
               <p>One of these, affixed to a stalke of wheat, being about
to <hi>change</hi> into a new forme, the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> as is depict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
On the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> came forth an <hi>Animall</hi> very
thirsty, for as soon, as it came forth, it drunk much,
and often.</p>
               <p>I learnt by experience, (and all that I have writ I have
proved so) this Animall may very long be kept alive
with water, and Sugar; but destitute of water; it lives
not above four or five Days.</p>

               <p>These <hi>Animalls</hi> for the Elegancy of them, are called
<hi>Lady-clocks;</hi> they owe their Originall to the Seed which
their Parents shed and put upon the <hi>Curran-bush leaves;</hi>
and which the heat of the Sun hatches.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Eggs</hi> like seeds layd close in a round, as loaves
in an <hi>Oven,</hi> the 20 of <hi>May,</hi> first did look black: But the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49809:69"/>
29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> did grow greenish at the bottome; and the
Second of <hi>Iune,</hi> every one of these Eggs, had a black spot,
or point in the middle; and the 5<hi>th.</hi> of the same month,
Animalls were hatched out of these <hi>Eggs;</hi> partly yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
and partly black; in which no touch of life did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
unlesse breathed on, then they moved, or rolled,
to and fro.</p>
               <p>But the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> when now their feet are grown,
and hardened with the benefit of the aire, they creep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
then run about; but about evening, and when
the aire was cooler, they run together, and kept close;
either for company, or for heating one another; and in
this situation, and posture, they remained till 16 ith
Morning of the day following; then every one set out
to seek food, and that, the dew which useth to fall upon
the leaves from the skie, and endued with a peculiar
force of Aliment, well knowne to those, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
for food; for they feed on it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> About the
13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> these <hi>Insects</hi> did put off their skins, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
like; which being done, they are Yellowish and
Blackish.</p>
               <p>The Day after, <hi>viz.</hi> The 14<hi>th.</hi> or about it, they
<hi>change</hi> forme another time, and colour, so as to grow
Yellow and Reddish.</p>
               <p>They begin the 3<hi>d. change,</hi> two Dayes after the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>change,</hi> in that very posture, and with a Black and
Red colour.</p>
               <p>The 4<hi>th. Transmutation</hi> they are wont to undergo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And this is the last <hi>change</hi> which they suffer, and by it
they get their last skin, partly Black and Red, and
where it is Red, variegated with Black spots, or points,
as is depicted.</p>
               <p>Tis worth the noting, as often at they cast their skin,
they fix their feet fast to the Leafe or Paper, they <hi>chance</hi>
to be on, and when they have fixt them, they creep out
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49809:70"/>
of the skin, and leave it standing so, that seeing of it, you
woul'd say it was verily one of those Animalls standing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I sustained these Creatures for some time with dew,
collected before Sun-rise from the <hi>Curran-bush leaves,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I saw them to have attained to their full Magnitude,
and perfection, nor to make any further <hi>change,</hi> and then

               <p>With this sort of <hi>Worm, Skins</hi> and all things made of

               <p>This I found upon the Feathers of the dryed body of
a <hi>Duck,</hi> eating the fat and skin thereof, and perhaps they
are bred of it, because they feed of it, as many <hi>Insects</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xist
from that, with which they are nourished, as the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
Write. They creep very swiftly, as soon as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any thing, which may trouble them; they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forthwith under the Feathers, so that they may not
easily be found.</p>
               <p>This deserves Admiration, these Worms to cast 10
<hi>Skins,</hi> before they <hi>change;</hi> and as oft to cleanse, as they
cast their skins.</p>
               <p>Their Excrement is like a slender Thred twisted, yet
firmly compacted, a Span long, and which may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for it is <hi>Viscons,</hi> and hard to break, and under dirt,
they are wont to ly hid.</p>
               <p>I tryed this Worm to have fed, from the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi>
to the first of <hi>September,</hi> when it did desist from eating, it
began its Transmutation, as is depicted <hi>Number</hi> 114. and
the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to have bred first a Hair coloured
<hi>Animall;</hi> which then put on a Red, and lastly a Black
colour. which was Yellowish, in the middle of the body.</p>
               <p>You may keep these Anmalls, as long as you please if

from them, and they live not above four days.</p>
               <p>No Insects are so fearfnll as these are, for let them
have the least perceivance of any thing, that may hurt
them, and they presently counterseit themselves dead
for fear of being killed; and indeed, it is so with all

               <p>But you'l ask, how knew you to distinguish <hi>Male</hi> and

               <p>For <hi>Gryllotalpae</hi> or <hi>Field Crickets,</hi> I know them by
many experiments to be very rebust, and of a firm life.</p>
               <p>I cut off the head of one of them; which after 2 dayes
was wholy eaten by another <hi>Field Cricket:</hi> onely 2 little
Nerves being left, yet the head lived 12 hours after.</p>
               <p>I hanged another <hi>Field Cricket</hi> by a string in the heat
of the Sun, so that it became wholy Black: yet it died
not, before the 7<hi>th.</hi> day.</p>
               <p>They are very ingenious in building their nest: for
that end, they do elect a certain <hi>Glebe</hi> of earth firm
and Tenacious: and therein they make themselves a hole
to go in and out at; within they make a great cavitie,
in the which they depose more then 100. Sometime
150. eggs.</p>
               <p>This being done: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shut up, and they strengthen the <hi>Glebe</hi> as much, as
may be; for that being broken, all the eggs perish, and
are consumed of certain <hi>Black Flyes;</hi> which ly hid under
ground; therefore they are very anxious and solicitous
of conserving, and making firm this <hi>Glebe;</hi> therefore
they perpare for themselves a certain subteraneous <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

round about the <hi>Glebe,</hi> that they may go round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this <hi>Glebe,</hi> and preserve it: besides, about this <hi>Glebe</hi>
they have other holes, and hiding places; whither in time
of necessity they may Fly.</p>
               <p>Again, they know how to raise up their nests, by a
wonderfull industrie, in a hot and dry season, that they
may almost touch the superficies of the earth: that by
so much the better and sooner, the egs may be cherished
with the heat of the Sun, and hatch; on the contrary,
the air enclining to cold and humiditie, they do sink
lower into ground their nests.</p>
               <p>I have observed also the <hi>Field Crickets</hi> to have wings,
but not to fly: but for ornament; that with them they
may cover, and preserve the very tender hinder part
of the body.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Island Wallachia</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> there are many
<hi>Field Crickets,</hi> and they do much hurt to the young and
tender corne, which they sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and cut the roots.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gardiners,</hi> that they may remove them, put into
the ground little pots, that the upper lips may be equall
with the superficies of the ground, the <hi>Field Crickets</hi>
falling into these cannot get out.</p>
               <p>Or their nests are to be broken, and the eggs spoiled</p>

it had been, just before; for it cou'd scarce draw its load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

eat more meat, and greedilier, then before: also in a

               <p>And the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> I found it again crept with the

               <p>After this manner it placed its seed upon the earth

being done, it lived not long after; for when the leaves
of <hi>Anemony</hi> did wither, it died with hunger, without
doubt.</p>
               <p>From the seed of this Animall, which was first layed,
many very little <hi>Wormes</hi> were hatched, not thicker, then

               </p>
               <p>The seed which it layed the Second time, the 29 of
<hi>Iune</hi> produced also many <hi>Worms,</hi> just like the former;
but not so many in number, to satisfie my curiosity, I
took them up on my Pencill point, a little wetted, one

906. but many I lost in the telling.</p>
               <p>I took great pains to find out a gratefull food for
these <hi>Worms;</hi> but to little purpose, I gave them honey,
dead earth <hi>Worms,</hi> Ants Eggs, Sugar, Bread, divers green

               <p>I Observed <hi>Gnats</hi> to retire to <hi>Cisterns</hi> in great
Numbers; and especially about the begining of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi>
thither they carry their Seed, and after
the same manner, as I have often learnt by my own
proper Experience; for they are wont to sit upon
the surface of the Raine-watter, contained in <hi>Cisterns,</hi>
the hinder part of the their Bodies being inclined
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49809:83"/>
downwards; and to excerne their Seed, and that Seed
so dejected, doth forthwith sinck to the bottom and
after a little time, is converted in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Bloody little Insects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Little Bloody Worms</hi> are nourished of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
little Creatures swimming in the Water, which I
have been wont to call Water Lice, because they have
almost the same forme with the paper Lice, and they
stay there 11 Months, and they do make themselves
little Cells of their own juice, mixt with the particles
of Lime, within which they hide themselves, against
the extream cold.</p>
               <p>But the time of the Naturall <hi>change</hi> being at hand,
they do convene in great numbers, and the heads of
all being joyned, the hinder parts of their Bodies,
are long much tossed, too and fro, and do excite
a great motion of Water, with which motion, I
have Observed a great plenty of a certain <hi>Tenacious
juice,</hi> in which they compose themselves for undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>change.</hi>

               <p>The 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> and 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> I Observed many
<hi>Gnats</hi> to flie out of the foresaid Juice: The Males have
light Fethers on the Head, but not the Females; but
do swel with Eggs, nor yet can so vehemently prick
our skins as the males.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Gnats</hi> do arise from bloody little <hi>Worms,</hi> so they
do vehemently desire Humane blood; for that end
they enter into our Honses about Night, even by
the Chimneys, and other hidden places, if they find
not the Doors and Windows open, then they thrust
their Trunks, or Darts into the parts of the skin:
Where they may find an open passage to the Blood;
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49809:84"/>
but hollow within like Pipes, and adapted
to draw blood upwards.</p>
               <p>I have sometimes Observed, that a <hi>Gnat</hi> well filled with
blood, not to recede from our Skin, untill a drop of
Water, had been rejected out of her Bodie: Which
I guesse to be the <hi>Serum;</hi> and in so short a time to
be seperated from the Blood, and rejected as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Gnats,</hi> new bred, do ascend from the
bottom of <hi>Cisterns,</hi> they are <hi>White,</hi> and do seem to
want Feet, and Wings; but these do appear in the
space of a quarter of an houre, and they are wont so
long to adhere to the sids and walls of the <hi>Cisterns;</hi>
untill the wings are now enough expanded, are hard,
and are fit for flight.</p>
               <p>But some will Object, how I cou'd so accuratly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
what <hi>Gnats</hi> do in the bottom of <hi>Cisterns;</hi>
to whom I Answere, I Observed all things in a

those things, which are wont to be found in <hi>Cisterns,</hi>
to wit Lime, little Stones, Earth and Rain Water, to
which I put the above described Red <hi>worms.</hi> Also
I was forced to place that Vessell in a cold place;
also often to renew the Water, and to admit the

               <p>For experience taught me, those little <hi>Worms,</hi>

humour come from the Wall, they may take it with
their feet, for with this all their feet are embrewed,

not hurt themselves; for when they fall on the ground

Fight so, that they kill one another; for they are very
