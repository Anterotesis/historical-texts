            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fiue kings are vp in Armes againſt them, and are ready to pay their fraude with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3824:5"/>
violence: VVhat ſhould theſe poore men doe? If they make not their peace, they die by ſtrangers; if they doe make their peace with Forrainers, they muſt die by neighbours. There is no courſe that threatens not ſome danger; Wee haue ſped well if our choice hath light vpon the eaſieſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience.</p>
                     <p>If theſe <hi>Hiuites</hi> haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, againſt Iſrael, yet what haue they done to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? I heare of no trechery, no ſecret information, no attempt. I ſee no ſinne but their league with Iſrael, &amp; their life: yet (for ought we find) they were free men; no way either obliged, or obnoxious. As Satan, ſo wicked men cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3824:5"/>
abide to loſe any of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: if a Conuert come home, the Angels welcome him with ſongs, the Diuels follow him with vprore and fury, his old Partners vvith ſcornes and obloquy.</p>
                     <p>I finde theſe neighbour Princes halfe dead with feare, and yet they can finde time to be ſick of enuie. Malice in a wicked hart is the king of Paſsions: all other vaile &amp; bow when it comes in place; euen their owne life was not ſo deare to them as reuenge. Who would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue lookt, that theſe Kings ſhould haue tryed to haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Copie of this league? or if their fingers did itch to fight, why did they not rather think of a defenſiue war againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3824:6"/>
an offenſiue againſt the <hi>Gibeonites. Gibeon</hi> was ſtrong, and would not bee won without bloud; yet theſe <hi>Amorites,</hi> which at their beſt were too weake for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> would ſpend their forces before hand on their neighbors. Here was a ſtrong ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in weake breaſts: they feared, and yet began to fight; they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Jſrael,</hi> yet began to fight with <hi>Gibeon.</hi> If they had ſat ſtill, their deſtruction had not beene ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: the malice of the wicked, haſtens the paſe of their owne iudgement. No rod is ſo fit for a miſchieuous man, as his owne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and theſe other Cities of the <hi>Hiuites,</hi> had no King: &amp; none yeelded, and eſcaped, but they. Their Elders conſulted before for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3824:6"/>
their league; neither is there any challenge ſent to the King, but to the Citie: And now the fiue Kings of the <hi>Amorits</hi> haue vniuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted againſt them. Soueraignty abuſed, is a great ſpur to out-rage; the conceit of authoritie in great perſons, many times lies in the way of their own ſafety, whiles it vvill not let them ſtoope to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſes of inferiours. Hence it is, that heauen is peopled with ſo few Great-ones: hence it is, that true contentment ſeldome dwells high; whiles meaner men of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirits, enioy both earth and heauen.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had wel proued that thogh they wanted an Head, yet they wanted not wit; and now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3824:7"/>
the ſame wit that won <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their friendſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, teacheth them to make vſe of thoſe they had won. If they had not more truſted <hi>Ioshua,</hi> then their walls, they had neuer ſtolne that league; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhold they haue vſe of their new Protectors, but now that they were aſſailed? Whither ſhould wee fly but to our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when the powers of darknes (like mighty <hi>Amorites)</hi> haue beſieged vs? If euer wee will ſend vp our prayers to him, it will be, when we are beleaguered with euils. If we truſt to our owne reſiſtance, wee cannot ſtand; we cannot miſcary, if we truſt to his: in vaine ſhall we ſend to our <hi>Ioshua</hi> in theſe ſtraits, if we haue not before come to him in our freedom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3824:7"/>
Which of vs would not haue thought <hi>Ioshua</hi> had a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his forbearance; &amp; haue ſaid, You haue ſtolne your league with me; why do you expect help from him whom yee haue decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? All that wee promiſed you, was a ſufferance to liue; inioy what wee promiſed, wee will not take your life from you; Hath your faithfulnes deſerued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more then our couenant; we neuer promiſed to hazard our liues for you, to giue you life with the loſſe of our owne. But that good man durſt not conſtrue his owne couenant to ſuch an aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; Hee knew little difference betwixt killing them with his own ſword, and the ſword of an <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:</hi> vvhoſoeuer ſhould giue the

blow, the murder would bee his. Euen permiſsion in thoſe things wee may remedy, makes vs no leſſe actors then conſent; ſome men kill as much by looking on, as others by ſmiting: VVee are guilty of all the euill wee might haue hindered.</p>
                     <p>The noble diſpoſition of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> beſides his ingagement, will not let him forſake his new vaſſalls: Their confidence in him, is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to draw him into the Field. The greateſt obligation to a good mind, is anothers truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which to diſappoint, were merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly perfidious. How much leſſe ſhall our true <hi>Ioshua</hi> faile the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our faith?

our prayers to thee into thy <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> thy mercy bindes thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: neuer any ſoule miſcaried that truſted thee; we may be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in our truſt, our truſt can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Speed in beſtowing, doubles a gift; a benefit deferred, loſes the thanks, and prooues vnprofitable. <hi>Ioshua</hi> marches all night, &amp; fights all day for the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> They tooke not ſo much pains in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to deceiue him, as he in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deliuer them. It is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt victory to ouercome euill with good; if his very <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been in danger he could haue done no more: God, and his <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi> make no difference betwixt <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Iſraelited, and his owne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3824:9"/>
naturall people. All are Iſraelites whom he hath taken to league: we ſtrangers of the Gentiles, are now the true Iewes; GOD neuer did more for the naturall Oliue, then for that wild Impe which he hath graffed in. And as theſe <hi>Hiuites</hi> could neuer be thankfull enough to ſuch a <hi>Ioshua;</hi> no more can we to ſo gracious a Redeemer, vvho forgetting our vnwoorthineſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to our <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs from the powers of hell, and death.</p>

                        <hi>Ioshua</hi> fought, but God diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited the <hi>Amorites;</hi> The praiſe is to the workman, not the inſtrument: Neither did God ſlay them onely with <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s ſword, but with his owne haile-ſtones; that now the

                        <hi>Amorites</hi> may ſee both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenges come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one hand.

                     <p>If they had no enemy but <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> they might hope to runne away from death, ſith feare is a better footeman, then deſire of reuenge; but novv, vvhither-ſoeuer they

runne, heauen will be aboue their heads: And now, all the reaſon that is left them in this confuſion of their thoughts, is to wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well dead; there is no eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where GOD intends a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. Wee men haue deuiſed to imitate theſe inſtruments of death, and ſend foorth deadly bullets out of a clowd of ſmoke; wherein yet, as there is much danger, ſo much vncertaintie: but this God, that diſcharges his Ordinance from heauen, directs euery ſhotte to an head, and can as eaſily kil as ſhoot. It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God: hee hath mo waies of vengeance, then hee hath creatures. The ſame heauen that ſent foorth water to the old world, fire to the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     <p>Was it not miracle enough that God did braine their Aduerſaries from heauen, but that the Sunne and Moone muſt ſtand ſtil in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Is it not enough that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites</hi> fly, but that the greateſt Planets of heauen muſt ſtay their owne courſe, to witneſſe, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the diſcomfiture? For him which gaue them both beeing and motion, to bid them ſtand ſtill, it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3824:11"/>
ſeemes no difficulty, although the rarenes would deſerue admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but, for a man to commaund the chiefe ſtarres of heauen (by whoſe influence he liueth) as the Centurion would do his ſeruant, Sunne ſtay in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and Moone ſtand ſtill in <hi>Aialon,</hi> it is more then a wonder. It was not <hi>Ioshua,</hi> but his faith that did this; not by way of precept, but of prayer. If I may not ſay that the requeſt of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man (as wee ſay of the great) commaunds, Gods glorie vvas that which <hi>Ioshua</hi> aimed at: hee knew that all the world muſt needs be witneſſes of that, which the eye of the world ſtood ſtill to ſee. Had he reſpected but the ſlaughter of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> hee knew the haile-ſtones could doe that alone; the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3824:11"/>
Sunne needed not ſtand ſtill to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that clowd to perſecute them; but the glory of the ſlaughter was ſought by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that hee might ſend that vp, whence thoſe haile-ſtones, and that victory came: All the earth might ſee the Sunne and Moon; all could not ſee the cloud of haile, which becauſe of that heauie burden flew but low. That all Nations might knowe the ſame hand commands both in earth, in the clouds, in heauen, <hi>Ioshua</hi> now prayes, that hee which dishartned his enemies vpon earth, &amp; ſmote them from the cloud, would ſtay the Sunne and Moone in heauen. God neuer got himſelfe ſo much honour by one dayes worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the heathen; and vvhen was it more fitte, then now, vvhen
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3824:12"/>
fiue heathen Kings are banded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</p>
                     <p>The Sun and the Moone were the ordinary Gods of the world: and who would not but think, that their ſtanding ſtill but one houre, ſhould be the ruine of Nature? &amp; now, all Nations ſhall well ſee, that there is an higher then their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; that their Gods are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the GOD whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhould ſerue, at whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both they and Nature ſhall ſtand at once. If that God which meant to work this miracle, had not raiſed vp his thoughts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, it had bin a blameable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which now is a faith vvorthy of admiration. To deſire a miracle without cauſe, is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

God hath loſt them the thanke of their former labours; their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhall make them of brethren, aduerſaries; their own bloud ſhall giue handſell to their new Altar.

Euery ouerture in matter of Religion, is woorthie of ſuſpicion, worthie of our ſpeedie oppoſition: God lookes for an early redreſſe of the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of impietie.

alterations: one ſpoonefull of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will quench that fire at the firſt, which afterwards whole buckets cannot abate.</p>
                     <p>Yet doe not theſe zealous Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elires runne raſhly and furiouſlie vpon their brethren, nor ſay, What need wee expoſtulate? The fact is cleare: what care wee for words, when wee ſee their Altar? What can this meane, but either ſeruice to a falſe God, or diuiſion in the ſeruice of the true? There can bee no excuſe for ſo manifeſt a crime: Why doe we not rather thinke of puniſhment, then ſatisfaction? But they ſend ere they goe; and conſult ere they execute. <hi>Phineas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt, and ten Princes (for euery Tribe one)

are addreſſed both to inquire, &amp; diſſwade; to inquire of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the fact; to diſſwade from that which they imagined was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Wiſedome is a good guide to zeale, and onely can keepe it from running out into furie: If diſcretion doe not hold in the raynes, good intentions wil both breake their owne necks, and the riders: yea, which is ſtrange, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, the zeale of God, may leade vs from God.</p>
                     <p>Not onely wiſedome, but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mooued them to this meſſage. For, grant they had beene guiltie, muſt they periſh vnwarn'd? Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meanes muſt firſt be vſed to recall them, ere violence be ſent to perſecute them. The old rule
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3824:17"/>
of Iſrael, hath been ſtill to inquire of <hi>Abel;</hi> No good Shepheard ſends his dog to pul out the throat of his ſtrayed ſheepe, but rather fetches it on his ſhoulders to the fold: Sudden crueltie ſtands not with religion: He which will not himſelfe breake the bruiſed reed, how will hee allow vs, either to bruiſe the whole, or to breake the bruiſed, or to burne the broken?</p>
                     <p>Neither yet was here more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in ſending, then vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the miſconſtruction. They begin with a challenge; &amp; charge their brethren deeply with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, apoſtaſie, rebellion. I know not how two contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities fall into loue; it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuſpicious, &amp; yet many times
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3824:18"/>
ſuggeſts iealous feares of thoſe we affect. If theſe Iſraelites had not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their brethren, they wold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue ſent ſo farre to reſtraine them; they had neuer offred them part of their owne patrimonie: if they had not been exceſsiuely iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, they had not cenſured a doubtfull action, ſo ſharply. They met at <hi>Shilo,</hi> where the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was; but if they had conſulted with the Arke of God, they had ſaued both this labor, &amp; this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: This caſe ſeemed ſo plain, that they thought aduice needleſs: Their inconſiderateneſs therefore brands their brethren with crimes whereof they were innocent; and makes themſelues the onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. In caſes which are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vncertaine, it is ſafe either
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3824:18"/>
to ſuſpend the iudgement, or to paſſe it in fauor; otherwiſe, a plain breach of charitie in vs, ſhall bee worſe then a queſtionable breach of iuſtice in another.</p>
                     <p>Yet this little gleame of their vncharitable loue began at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; if they had not feared their owne iudgements in the offence of <hi>Ruben,</hi> I knowe not whether they had been ſo vehement: The fearefull reuenges of their brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens ſinne are ſtill in their eye. The wickednes of <hi>Peor,</hi> ſtretched not ſo farre as the plague; <hi>Achan</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was beaten: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by iuſt induction, they argue (Ye rebel to day againſt the Lord, tomorrow wil the Lord be wroth with all the Congregation.) They
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3824:19"/>
ſtill tremble at the vengeance paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and finde it time to preuent their own puniſhment, in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brethren. Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings haue then their right vſe, when they are both carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and made patterns of what he may doe.</p>
                     <p>Had theſe <hi>Reubenites</hi> been as hot in their anſwere, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in their charge, heere had grown a bloudy warre out of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion: But now their anſwer is milde and moderate, and ſuch as wel ſhewed, that though they were further from the Arke, yet no leſſe neer to GOD. They thought in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, This act of ours, though it were wel meant by vs, yet might well be by interpretation ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3824:19"/>
it is reaſon our mildneſſe ſhould giue ſatisfaction for that offence, vvhich we haue not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented. Heereupon, their anſwer was as pleaſing, as their act vvas dangerous. Euen in thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereby an offence may be occaſioned (though not giuen) charitie bindes vs to cleare both our owne name, and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others.</p>
                     <p>Little did the Iſraelites looke for ſo good a ground of an action ſo ſuſpicious; An Altar vvithout a ſacrifice? An Altar and no Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle? An Altar without a precept, and yet not againſt God? It is not ſafe to meaſure all mens actions by our owne conceit, but rather to thinke there may bee a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3824:20"/>
further drift, and warrant of their act, then we can attaine to ſee.</p>
                     <p>By that time the <hi>Reubenites</hi> haue commented vpon their owne vvorke, it appeares as iuſtifiable, as before offenſiue. What vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and religion is found in that Altar, which before ſhowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Idolatry? This diſcourſe of theirs, is full both of reaſon and pietie; We are ſeuered by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Iordan</hi> from the other Tribes; perhaps heereafter, our choice may exclude vs from <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie may peraduenture ſay, <hi>Iordan</hi> is the bounds of all natural Iſraelites; the ſtreames whereof neuer gaue way to thoſe beyond the Riuer: If they had beene ours, either in bloud or religion, they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3824:20"/>
would not haue been ſequeſtred in habitation. Doubtleſſe therfore theſe men are the ofspring of ſom Strangers, which by vicinity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, haue gotten ſome tincture of our language, manners, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; What haue wee to doe with them, what haue they to doe with the Tabernacle of God? Sith ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not either remooue Gods Altar to vs, or remoue our Patrimonie to the Altar; The Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the Altar ſhall go with vs, not for ſacrifice, but for memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; that both the poſterity of the other Iſraelites may know, we are no leſſe deriued from them, then this Altar from theirs; &amp; that our poſterity may know, they pertain to that Altar, whereof this is the reſemblance.

Euen thoſe were Idolaters by whoſe hands God plagued the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries of Iſrael. In <hi>Moab,</hi> the ſame wickednes proſpers, which in Gods owne people is puniſhed: the iuſtice of the Almightie can leaſt brooke euill in his owne; the ſame heathen which prouoked Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to ſinne, ſhall ſcourge them for ſinning. Our very profeſsion hurts vs, if we be not innocent.</p>
                     <p>No leſſe then eighteene yeares did the rod of <hi>Moab</hi> reſt vpon the inheritance of God: Iſrael ſeemes as borne to ſeruitude; they came from their bondage in the Land of Egypt, to ſerue in the Land of Promiſe; They had neglected God, now they are neglected of GOD; Their ſinnes haue made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3824:25"/>
them ſeruants, whom the choice of GOD had made free, yea his firſt borne. Woorthy are they to ſerue thoſe men, whoſe falſe Gods they had ſerued, &amp; to ſerue them alwaies in thraldome, whom they haue once ſerued in Idolatry. We may not meaſure the continuance of puniſhment, by the time of the commiſsion of ſinne; one minutes ſin deſerues a torment beyond all time.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe, Iſrael was not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their own miſery, as not to complain ſooner then the end of eighteene yeeres; The firſt houre they ſighed for themſelues, but now they cried vnto GOD. The very purpoſe of affliction is to make vs importunate; Hee that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3824:25"/>
heares the ſecret murmurs of our griefe, yet will not ſeeme to heare vs, till our cryes be loud &amp; ſtrong. GOD ſees it beſt to let the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent dwell for the time vnder their ſorrowes; hee ſees vs ſinking all the while, yet he lets vs alone till wee be at the bottome: and when once we can ſay, <hi>Out of the depths haue I cryed to thee;</hi> inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>The Lord heard me.</hi> A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement ſuter cannot but be heard of God, whatſoeuer hee askes. If our prayers want ſucceſſe, they want hart; their bleſsing is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their vigour. Wee liue in bondage to theſe ſpirituall <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> our owne corruptions. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents vs; but where are our ſtrong cries vnto the GOD of heauen? where are our teares? If
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3824:26"/>
wee could paſsionately bemone our ſelues to him, hovv ſoone ſhould we be more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours? Some good motions wee haue to ſend vp to him, but they faint in the way. We may call long enough, if we cry not to him.</p>
                     <p>The ſame hand that raiſed vp <hi>Eglon</hi> againſt Iſrael, raiſed vp alſo <hi>Ehud</hi> for Iſrael, againſt <hi>Eglon;</hi> When that Tyrant hath reuenged God of his people, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his people of him. It is no priuiledge to be an inſtrument of Gods vengeance by euil meanes: Though <hi>Eglon</hi> were an Vſurper, yet had <hi>Ehud</hi> beene a Traytor if God had not ſent him; it is onelie in the power of him that makes Kings, when they are once ſettled,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3824:26"/>
to depoſe them. It is no more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for our moderne butchers of Princes, to ſhow they are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, then to eſcape the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of GOD in offering to doe this violence, not being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                     <p>VVhat a ſtrange choice dooth God make of an Executioner? A man ſhut of his right hand; either he had but one hand, or vſed but one, and that the worſe, and more vnready: Who would not haue thought both hands too little for ſuch a worke; or, if either might haue been ſpared, how much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the left? GOD ſeeth not as man ſeeth; It is the ordinary wont of the Almightie, to make choice of the vnlik elieſt meanes. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3824:27"/>
of God muſt not bee meaſured by their own power, or aptitude, but by the will of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: Tho <hi>Ehud</hi> had no hands, he that imployed him, had enabled him to this ſlaughter. In humane things, it is good to looke to the meanes; in diuine, to the worker; No meanes are to be contemned that God will vſe; no meanes to be truſted that man will vſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>
                     <p>It is good to be ſuſpicious where is leaſt ſhow of danger, and moſt appearance of fauour. This left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed man comes with a preſent in his hand, but a dagger vnder his skirt. The Tyrant, beſides ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, lookt for gifts; and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues death in his bribe: Neither
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3824:27"/>
God nor men, doe alwaies giue where they loue. How oft dooth God giue extraordinary illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, power of miracles, beſides wealth and honor, where he hates? So doe men too oft accompanie their curſes with preſents; either leaſt an enemy ſhould hurt vs, or that wee may hurt them. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is the fauour in gifts, and not the ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ehuds</hi> faith ſupplies the want of his hand: Where GOD intends ſucceſs, he lifts vp the hart with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of courage, &amp; contempt of danger. What indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of this proiect would not haue condemned it, as vnlikely to ſpeed; To ſee a maimed man goe alone to a great King, in the midſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3824:28"/>
of all his troupes; to ſingle him out from all witneſſes; to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with one hand in his owne Parlor, where his Courtiers might haue heard the leaſt exclamation, and haue comne in, if not to the reſcue, yet to the reuenge. Euery circumſtance is full of improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: Faith euermore ouerlookes the difficulties of the way, &amp; bends her eyes onely to the certainty of the end. In this inteſtine ſlaughter of our tyrannicall corruptions, when we caſt our eyes vpon our ſelues, we might well deſpaire; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what can our left-hands doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe ſpirituall wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? But when wee ſee who hath both commaunded, and vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to proſper theſe holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, how can wee miſdoubt the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3824:28"/>
ſucceſs? <hi>I can doe all things throgh him that ſtrengthens me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Ehud</hi> hath obtained the conuenient ſecrecie both of the weapon &amp; place; now with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident forhead he approaches the Tyrant, and ſalutes him, vvith a true and awfull preface to ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an act. <hi>I haue a meſsage to thee from God.</hi> Euen <hi>Ehuds</hi> poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard was Gods meſſage; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vocall admonitions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the reall iudgements of God, are his errands to the world. Hee ſpeakes to vs in raine &amp; waters, in ſickneſſes &amp; famine, in vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times &amp; inundations: Theſe are the ſecondary meſſages of God; if we will not hear the firſt, we muſt heare theſe to our coſt.</p>

I cannot but wonder at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout reuerence of this Heathen Prince; Hee ſate in his Chaire of State; The vnweildineſſe of his fat body was ſuch, that he could not riſe with readineſs and eaſe; yet no ſooner doth he heare newes of a meſſage from God, but hee riſes vp from his Throne, &amp; reuerently attends the tenor therof: Though hee had no Superior to controle him, yet hee cannot abide to bee vnmannerly in the buſineſſe of GOD.</p>
                     <p>This man was an Idolater, a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: yet what outward reſpects doth he giue to the true God? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ceremonies of pietie, and complements of deuotion, may well be found with falſhood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3824:29"/>
They are a good ſhadow of truth where it is: but where it is not, they are the very body of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Hee that had riſen vp in Armes againſt Gods people, and the true worſhip of God, now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vp in reuerence to his Name: GOD would haue liked well to haue had leſs of his curteſie, more of his obedience.</p>
                     <p>He lookt to haue heard the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with his eares, and he feeles it in his guttes; So ſharp a meſſage, that it pierced the body, &amp; let out the ſoule through that vncleane paſſage: neither did it admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aunſwer, but ſilence and death. In that part had hee offended by pampering it, and making it his God; and now his bane findes the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3824:30"/>
ſame way with his ſinne. This one hard and cold morſell, which hee cannot digeſt, payes for all thoſe gluttonous delicates, whereof he had formerly ſurfeted. It is the manner of God, to take fearefull reuenges of the profeſſed enemies of his Church.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruell, that neither any noiſe in his dying, nor the fall of ſo groſs a body, called-in ſome of his attendants: But that GOD, which hath intended to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any deſigne, diſpoſes of all circumſtances to his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If <hi>Ehud</hi> had not come forth with a calme and ſettled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and ſhut the doores after him, all his proiect had been in the duſt. What had it been better that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3824:30"/>
the King of <hi>Moab</hi> was ſlaine, if <hi>Iſrael</hi> had neither had a meſſenger to informe, nor a Captain to guide them? Now hee departs peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, &amp; blowes a trumpet in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> gathers <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and falls vpon the body of <hi>Moab,</hi> as well as hee had done vpon the head, and procures freedome to his people. Hee that would vndertake great enterpriſes, had need of wiſdome, and courage; wiſedome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue, and courage to execute; wiſedome to guide his courage, &amp; courage to ſecond his wiſedome: both which, if they meet with a good cauſe, cannot but ſucceed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Deborah</hi> had beene no Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe, if ſhee durſt haue ſent in her owne name; Her meſſage is from him that ſent herſelfe, <hi>Hath not the

How many thinke it a perpetual bondage to haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God at their elbow?

To preſcribe that to others, which we draw back from dooing our ſelues, is an argument of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs and falſity: <hi>Barac</hi> ſhall ſee that <hi>Deborah</hi> doth not offer him that cup, whereof ſhe dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne; without regard of her ſexe ſhee marches with him to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and reioyces to be ſeen of the tenne thouſand of Iſrael. With what ſcorne did <hi>Siſera</hi> looke at theſe gleanings of Iſrael? How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall did this match ſeeme of ten thouſand Iſraelites againſt his three hundred thouſand foot, ten thouſand horſe, nine hundred cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Iron? And now in a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, he calls for his troupes, and meanes to kill this handfull of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael with the very ſight of his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked chariots; and onely feared it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3824:35"/>
would be no victory to cutte the throates of ſo few. The faith of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barac</hi> was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled with this world of Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, which from Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> they ſaw hiding all the Vally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them; they knew whom they had belieued, and how little an arme of fleſh could do againſt the God of Hoſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barac</hi> went down againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> but it was GOD that deſtroyed him. The Iſraelites did not this day wield their owne ſwords, leaſt they ſhould arrogate any thing; God told them before hand, it ſhould be his own act.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3824:35"/>
And now proud <hi>Siſera,</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curſes of the heauineſſe of that Iron carriage, is gladde to quit his Chariot, and betake himſelfe to his heeles. Who euer yet knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earthly thing truſted in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſappointment? It is wonder if God make vs not at laſt as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of whatſoeuer hath ſtolne our harts from him, as euer wee were fond.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Siſera</hi> hopes to haue ſped better then his followers, in ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable an harbour of <hi>Iael.</hi> If <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>Iael</hi> had not been great perſons, there had beene no note taken of their Tents; There had been no league betwixt King <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> and them: now their greatnes makes them known, their league
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3824:36"/>
makes them truſted. The diſtreſſe of <hi>Siſera</hi> might haue made him importunate, but <hi>Iael</hi> begins the curteſie, and exceeds the deſire of her gueſt: Hee askes vvater to drinke, ſhee giues him milke; hee wiſhes but ſhelter, ſhee makes him a bed; hee deſires the protection of her Tent, ſhe couers him with a mantle. And now <hi>Siſera</hi> pleaſes himſelfe with this happy change, and thinks how much better it is to be here, then in that whirling of chariots, in that horror of flight, amongſt thoſe ſhriekes, thoſe woundes, thoſe carcaſſes. Whiles hee is in theſe thoughts: his weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; eaſie repoſall hath brought him aſleepe. VVho would haue looked that in this tumult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, euen betwixt the very iawes

                     <p>Now whiles hee was dreaming, doubtleſſe, of the claſhing of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ratling of chariots, neighing of horſes, the clamor of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the furious purſute of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; <hi>Iael</hi> ſeeing his temples lie ſo faire, as if they inuited the naile &amp; hammer, entred into the thought of this noble execution; certainly not without ſom checks of doubt, and pleas of feare: What if I ſtrike him? And yet who am I, that I ſhould dare to thinke of ſuch an act? Is not this <hi>Siſera,</hi> the famou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt captaine of the world, whoſe name hath wont to be fearefull to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3824:37"/>

What if hee ſhould awake, whiles I am lifting vp this inſtrument of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What if I ſhould be ſurpriſed by ſome of his followers while the fact is greene, and yet bleeding? Can the murder of ſo great a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be hid, or vnreuenged? Or if I might hope ſo, yet can my heart allow mee to be ſecretly treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? Is there not peace betwixt my houſe, and him? Did not I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite him to my Tent? Doth he not truſt to my friendſhip &amp; hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? But what doe theſe vveake feares, theſe idle fancies of ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? If <hi>Siſera</hi> be in league with vs, yet is he not at defiance with God? Is hee not a Tyrant to Iſrael? Is it for nothing that GOD hath
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3824:37"/>
brought him into my Tent? May I not now finde meanes to repay vnto Iſrael all their kindneſſe to my Grand-father <hi>Iethro?</hi> Dooth not GOD offer mee this day, the honour to bee the Reſcuer of his people? Hath God bidden mee ſtrike, and ſhall I hold my hand? No <hi>Siſera,</hi> ſleepe now thy laſt, and take here this fatall reward of all thy cruelty and oppreſsion.</p>
                     <p>He that put this inſtinct into her hart, did put alſo ſtrength into her hand; He that guided <hi>Siſera</hi> to her Tent, guided the naile throgh his temples; which hath made a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die way for his ſoule throgh thoſe parts, and now hath faſtened his eare ſo cloſe to the earth, as if the body had been liſtening what was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3824:38"/>
becomne of the ſoule. There lyes now the great terror of Iſrael at the foote of a woman: Hee that brought ſo many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands into the Field, hath not now one Page left, either to auert his death, or to accompany it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile it: Hee that had vaunted of his Iron chariots, is ſlaine by one naile of Iron, wanting onely this one point of his infelicity, that hee knowes not by whoſe hand he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Who can complaine either of ſolitarineſs, or oppoſition, that hath GOD with him? With him, not only as a witneſs, but as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Euen wicked men and diuells cannot exclude God, not the bars of hell can ſhutte him out; Hee is with them perforce, but to iudge, to puniſh them: Yea, God will be euer with them to their coſt; but to protect, comfort, ſaue, hee is with none but his.</p>
                     <p>Whiles he calls <hi>Gideon</hi> valiant, he makes him ſo. How could hee be but valiant, that had God with him? The godleſs man may bee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3824:42"/>
careleſſe, but cannot be other then cowardly. It pleaſes God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his owne graces in men, that he may interchange his owne glory, with their comfort; how much more ſhould wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the graces of one another? An enuious nature is preiudiciall to God; Hee is a ſtrange man in whom there is not ſome viſible good; yea, in the Diuels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wee may eaſily note ſome commendable parts, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſtrength, agilitie: Let God haue his owne in the worſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yea, let the worſt creature haue that praiſe, which God wold put vpon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> cannot paſſe ouer this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, as ſom faſhionable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3824:42"/>
but layes hold on that part, which was moſt important; the tenure of all his comfort; and (as not regarding the praiſe of his valour) inquires after that vvhich ſhould be the ground of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the preſence of God: God had ſpoken particularly to him; He expoſtulates for all. It had bin poſsible GOD ſhould be preſent with him, not with the reſt; as hee promiſed to haue been with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Iſrael:</hi> and yet when God ſaies, <hi>The Lord is with thee,</hi> he anſwers, <hi>Alas Lord, if the Lord bee with vs. Gideon</hi> cannot conceiue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as an exempt perſon; but puts himſelfe among the throng of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, as one that could not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any particular comfort, while the common caſe of Iſrael
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3824:43"/>
laboured. The maine care of a good hart is ſtill for the publique, neither can it inioy it ſelfe, while the Church of God is diſtreſſed. As faith drawes home generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo charitie diffuſes generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from it ſelfe to all.</p>
                     <p>Yet the valiant man was heere weake; weake in faith, weake in diſcourſe; whiles he argues Gods abſence by affliction, his preſence by deliuerances, and the vnlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſucceſs by his own diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; all groſs inconſequences: Rather ſhould hee haue inferred Gods preſence vpon their correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for whereſoeuer God chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there he is, yea, there hee is in mercy. Nothing more proues vs his, then his ſtripes; hee will not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3824:43"/>
beſtow whipping where he loues not. Fond nature thinks GOD ſhould not ſuffer the wind to blow vpon his deare ones, becauſe her ſelfe makes this vſe of her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; but none out of the place of torment, haue ſuffered ſo much as his deareſt children. Hee ſayes not we are Idolaters; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath forſaken vs, becauſe wee haue forſaken him: This ſequell had been as good, as the other was faultie; (The Lord hath deliuered vs vnto the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> therefore hee hath forſaken vs:) Sinnes, not afflctions, argue God abſent.</p>
                     <p>Whiles <hi>Gideon</hi> bewrayeth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, God both giues him might and imployes it; <hi>(Goe in this thy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3824:44"/>
might, and ſaue Jſrael.)</hi> Who wold not haue looked that God ſhould haue looked angerly on him, and chid him for his vnbeliefe? But he whoſe mercy will not quench the weakeſt fire of grace, though it be but in flax, lookes vpon him with compaſsionate eyes; and to make good his owne word, giues him that valour hee had acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> had not yet ſaid, <hi>Lord deliuer Jſrael:</hi> much leſſe had hee ſaid, <hi>Lord deliuer Iſrael by my hand.</hi> The mercy of God preuents the deſire of <hi>Gideon:</hi> if God ſhold not begin with vs, we ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer miſerable; if hee ſhould not giue vs till we aske, yet who ſhold giue vs to aske; if his ſpirit did not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3824:44"/>
worke thoſe holy grones, &amp; ſighes in vs, wee ſhould neuer make ſute to God. He that commonly giues vs power to craue, ſometimes giues vs without crauing, that the benefit might be ſo much more welcome, by how much leſs it was expected; and we ſo much more thankfull, as hee is more forward. When he bids vs aske, it is not for that he needes to be intreated; but that hee may make vs more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bleſsings, by deſiring them: And where hee ſees feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he ſtayes not for words; and he that giues ere wee aske, how much more will hee giue when we aske.</p>
                     <p>Hee that hath might enough to deliuer Iſrael, yet hath not might
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3824:45"/>
enough to keepe himſelfe from doubting. The ſtrongeſt faith will euer haue ſome touch of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And yet this was not ſo much a diſtruſt of the poſsibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as an inquiry after the meanes; <hi>Whereby ſhall I ſaue Iſrael?</hi> The ſalutation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>Gideon,</hi> was as like to <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> ſalutation of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as their anſweres were like: Both Angels brought newes of deliuerance; both were anſwered with a queſtion of the meanes of performance; with a report of the difficulties in performing: <hi>Ah my Lord, whereby ſhall I ſaue Iſrael?</hi> How the good man diſparages himſelfe! It is a great matter (O Lord) that thou ſpeakeſt of, and great actions require mightie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3824:45"/>
As for me, who am I? My Tribe is none of the greateſt in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; My Fathers family, is one of the meaneſt in his Tribe, and I the meaneſt in his family; Pouerty is a ſufficient bar to great enterpriſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereby ſhall I?</hi> Humilitie is both a ſigne of following glory, &amp; a way to it, and an occaſion of it: Bragging and height of ſpirit, will not carry it, with GOD: None haue euer been raiſed by him, but thoſe which haue formerly deiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues; None haue been confounded by him, that haue been abaſed in themſelues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is that he adds, <hi>I will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be with thee;</hi> as if hee had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Hadſt thou not beene ſo poore in thy ſelfe, I wold not haue
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3824:46"/>
wrought by thee. How ſhold God be magnified in his mercies if wee were not vnworthy? How ſhould he be ſtrong, if not in our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
                     <p>All this while, <hi>Gideon</hi> knew not it was an Angel that ſpake vvith him; Hee ſaw a man ſtand before him like a Trauailer, with a ſtaffe in his hand. The vnuſualneſs of thoſe reuelations in thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted times was ſuch, that <hi>Gideon</hi> might thinke of any thing rather then an Angell: No maruell if ſo ſtrange a promiſe from an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne meſſenger, found not a perfect aſſent; Faine would he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, but faine would hee haue good warrant for his faith. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith we cannot goe vpon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3824:46"/>
too ſure grounds. As <hi>Moſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ſent vpon the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, deſired a ſigne, whereby Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael might knowe that God ſent him: So <hi>Gideon</hi> deſires a ſigne from this Bearer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to know that his newes is from God.</p>
                     <p>Yet the very hope of ſo happy newes, not yet ratified, ſtirres vp in <hi>Gideon</hi> both ioy and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After all the iniury of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,</hi> he was not ſo poore, but he could beſtowe a Kid, and cakes, vpon the Reporter of ſuch tidings. Thoſe which are rightly affected with the glad newes of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deliuerance, ſtudy to ſhow their louing reſpects to the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:3824:47"/>
The Angel ſtayes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of <hi>Gideons</hi> feaſt. Such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure dooth GOD take in the thankfull indeauours of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that he patiently waites vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leyſure of our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Gideon</hi> intended a dinner, the Angel turned it into a ſacrifice. He whoſe meat and drinke it was to doe his Fathers will, calls for the broth and fleſh to be poured out vpon the ſtone; And when <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> lookt hee ſhould haue bleſſed, and eaten, hee touches the feaſt with his ſtaffe, and conſumes it with fire from the ſtone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. He did not ſtrike the ſtone with his ſtaffe (For the attrition of two hard bodies would natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beget fire) but hee touched the meat, and brought fire from the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3824:47"/>
ſtone: And now whiles <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaw and wondred at the ſpirituall act, he loſt the ſight of the Agent.</p>
                     <p>Hee that came vvithout intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vvould not haue departed without taking leaue, but that hee might increaſe <hi>Gideons</hi> vvonder, and that his wonder might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his faith. His ſalutation therefore was not ſo ſtrange as his farewell. <hi>Moſes</hi> touched the rock with his ſtaffe, and brought forth vvater, and yet a man, and yet continued vvith the Iſraelites. This meſſenger touches the ſtone vvith his ſtaffe, and brings foorth fire, &amp; preſently vaniſhes, that he may approue himſelfe a ſpirit. And now <hi>Gideon,</hi> when he had gathered vp himſelfe, muſt needes thinke,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3824:48"/>
Hee that can raiſe fire out of a ſtone, can raiſe courage and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of my dead breaſt; He that by this fire hath conſumed the broth and fleſh, can by the feeble flame of my fortitude conſume <hi>Midian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> did not ſo much doubt before, as now he feared. We that ſhall once liue with, and bee like the Angels, in the eſtate of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie thinke we cannot ſee an Angel, and liue. <hi>Gideon</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for mighty in valour, yet he trembles at the ſight of an Angel. <hi>Peter,</hi> that durſt draw his ſword vpon <hi>Malchus,</hi> and all the traine of <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet feares when he thought he had ſeene a ſpirit. Our naturall courage cannot be are vs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3824:48"/>
out againſt ſpirituall obiects. This Angel was homely &amp; familiar, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him for the time, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of that fleſh wherof he would afterwards take the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; yet euen the valiant <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> quakes to haue ſeen him: How awfull and glorious is the God of Angels, when he will be ſeen in the ſtate of heauen!</p>
                     <p>The Angel that departed for the wonder, yet returnes for the comfort of <hi>Gideon;</hi> It is not the wont of God to leaue his children in a maze, but hee brings them out in the ſame mercy which led them in, and will magnifie his grace in the one, no leſſe then his power in the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:3824:49"/>
Now <hi>Gideon</hi> growes acquainted with God, and interchanges pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of familiarity; He buildes an Altar to God, and God conferres with him; and (as he vſes where he loues) imployes him. His firſt task muſt be to deſtroy the god of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> then the Idolaters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Whiles <hi>Baals</hi> Altar &amp; groue ſtood in the hill of <hi>Ophrah, Iſrael</hi> ſhould in vaine hope to preuaile: It is moſt iuſt with God that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould continue with the ſin, and no leſs mercy, if it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue after it. Woldſt thou fain be rid of any iudgment? Inquire what falſe Altars &amp; groues thou haſt in thy heart; down with them firſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt muſt <hi>Baals</hi> Altar be ruined ere Gods be built, both may not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3824:49"/>
ſtand together; The true GOD will haue no ſocietie with Idols, neither will allow it vs. I doe not heare him ſay, That Altar &amp; groue which were abuſed to <hi>Baal,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate now to me; but as one whoſe holy ielouſie wil abide no worſhip till there be no idolatry, hee firſt commands down the monuments of ſuperſtition, and then inioynes his owne ſeruice; yet the wood of <hi>Baals</hi> groue muſt be vſed to burne a ſacrifice vnto God: When it was once cut down, Gods deteſtation, &amp; their danger ceaſed. The good creatures of God that haue beene profaned to Idolatry, may in a change of their vſe, bee imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the holie ſeruice of their Maker.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:3824:50"/>
Though ſome <hi>Iſraelites</hi> vvere penitent vnder this humiliation, yet ſtill many of them perſiſted in their wonted Idolatry. The very houſhold of <hi>Gideons</hi> father were ſtill <hi>Baalites,</hi> and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Ophrah</hi> were in the ſame ſin: yea if his father had been free, what did he with <hi>Baals</hi> groue and Altar? He dares not therfore take his fathers ſeruants, thogh he tooke his bullocks, but commaunds his owne. The Maſter is beſt ſeene in the ſeruants: <hi>Gideons</hi> ſeruants (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Idolatrous retinue of <hi>Ioaſh)</hi> are religious, like their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; yet the miſ-deuotion of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> and the <hi>Ophrathites</hi> was not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>Ioaſh</hi> is eaſily perſwaded by his ſonne, and eaſily perſwades his neighbours, how vnreaſonable it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3824:50"/>
is to plead for ſuch a god, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak for himſelfe; to reuenge his cauſe, that could not defend himſelfe. Let <hi>Baal</hi> plead for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

Before he knew that he ſpake with a God, he might haue iuſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours for his diſtruſt; but after God had approoued his preſence, and almighty power, by fetching fire out of the ſtone, then to call for a watery ſigne of his promiſed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3824:52"/>
deliuerance, was no other then to poure water vpon the fire of the ſpirit. The former triall God gaue vnwiſhed; this, vpon <hi>Gideons</hi> choice and intreatie: The former miracle was ſtrong enough to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Gideon</hi> through his firſt exploit of ruinating the idolatrous groue, and Altar; but now, when he ſaw the ſwarme of the <hi>Midianites</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> about his eares, he calls for new ayde; and not truſting to his <hi>Abiezrites,</hi> and his other thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee runnes to God for a further aſſurance of victorie.</p>
                     <p>The refuge was good, but the manner of ſeeking it, ſauours of diſtruſt. There is nothing more eaſie then to be valiant, when no perill appeareth; but when euills
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3824:52"/>
aſſaile vs vpon vnequall tearms, it is hard, and commendable Not to be diſmaied. If GOD had made that proclamation now, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was commaunded to be made by <hi>Gideon, Let the timorous depart,</hi> I doubt whether <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not wanted a Guide: yet how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the Almighty to ſatisfie our weak deſires!</p>
                     <p>What tasks is he content to bee ſet by our infirmitie? The fleece muſt be wet, and the ground dry; the ground muſt be wet, and the fleece dry: Both are done; that now <hi>Gideon</hi> may ſee whether hee would make himſelfe hard earth, or yeelding vvoll. God could at pleaſure diſtinguiſh betwixt him, and the <hi>Midianites,</hi> &amp; poure down
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3824:53"/>
either mercies or iudgement where he liſts, and that hee was ſet on worke by that God, which can commaund all the Elements, and they obey him; Fire, Water, Earth, ſerue both him, and (when he will) his.</p>
                     <p>And now when <hi>Gideon</hi> had this reciprocall proofe of his inſuing ſucceſſe, he goes on (as hee vvell may) harneſſed with reſolution, and is ſeene in the Head of his troupes, and in the face of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.</hi> If we cannot make vp the match with God, when wee haue our owne asking, wee are worthie to ſit out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> had but thirty thouſand ſouldiers at his his heeles; the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:3824:53"/>
couered all the vally, like Graſhoppers: and now whiles the Iſraelites thinke, We are too few; God ſayes, <hi>The people are too many.</hi> If the Iſraelites muſt haue looked for victory from their fingers, they might well haue ſaid, The <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> are too many for vs; but that God, whoſe thoughts and words are vnlike to mens, ſayes, <hi>They are too many for mee to giue the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites into their hands.</hi> If humane ſtrength were to be oppoſed, there ſhould haue needed an equalitie; but now God meant to giue the victory, his care is not how to get it, but how not to loſe or blemiſh the glory of it gotten. How ielous God is of his honour! Hee is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue deliuerance to Iſrael, but the praiſe of the deliuerance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3824:54"/>
he will keepe to himſelfe; and will ſhorten the meanes, that hee may haue the full meaſure of the glory. And if hee will not allow lawfull meanes to ſtand in the light of his honour, how will hee indure it to be croſſed ſo much as indirectly? It is leſs danger to ſteale any thing from God, then his glory.</p>
                     <p>As a Prince, which if wee ſteale or clip his coyne, may pardon it; but if we goe about to rob him of his crowne, will not be appeaſed. There is nothing that we can giue to God, of whom wee receiue all things; that which he is content to part with, he giues vs; but he will not abide wee ſhould take ought from him, which he would reſerue for himſelfe. It is all one with him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3824:54"/>
to ſaue with many, and with fewe, but hee rather choſes to ſaue by fewe, that all the victory may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to himſelfe. O God, what art thou the better for our praiſes, to whom becauſe thou art infinite nothing can be added? It is for our good that thou wouldſt be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of vs; Oh teach vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the benefit of thy mercifull fauours, and to returne thee the thanks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideons</hi> Army muſt be leſſened; Who are ſo fitte to be caſhered as the fearefull? God bids him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proclaime licence for all faint harts to leaue the field. An ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument may ſhame a good work: God will not glorifie himſelfe by cowards. As the timorous ſhall be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3824:55"/>
without the gates of heauen; ſo ſhall they be without the liſts of of Gods field. Although it vvas not their courage that ſhould ſaue Iſrael, yet without their courage God would not ſerue himſelfe of them. Chriſtianity requires men; for if our ſpiritual difficulties meet not with high ſpirits, in ſteed of whetting our fortitude, they quaile it. <hi>Dauids</hi> royall Band of Woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, was the type of the forces of the Church; all valiant men, and able to incounter with thouſands.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt we be ſtrong one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but acquainted with our owne reſolutions; not out of any carnal preſumption, but out of a faithfull reliance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtrength of God; in whom, when we are weak, then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3824:55"/>
we are ſtrong. Oh thou white li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer! doth but a foule word, or a frowne ſcarre thee from Chriſt? Dooth the loſſe of a little land, or ſiluer diſquiet the? Doth but the ſight of the <hi>Midianites</hi> in the vally ſtrike thee? Home then, home to the world; thou art not then for the conquering Band of Chriſt: If thou canſt not reſolue to follow him throgh infamie, priſons, racks, <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mee thinks now, Iſrael ſhould haue complained of indignity, &amp; haue ſaid, VVhy ſhouldſt thou thinke, O <hi>Gideon,</hi> that there can be a cowardly Iſraelite? And if the experience of the power and mercy of God, be not enough to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3824:56"/>
make vs feare leſs, yet the ſenſe of ſeruitude muſt needes haue made vs reſolute; for who had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be buried dead, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quick? Are we not faine to hide our heads in the caues of the earth, and to make our graues our houſes? Not ſo much as the very light that wee can freely inioy; the tyrannie of death is but ſhort and eaſie, to this of <hi>Midian:</hi> and yet what danger can there be of that, fith thou haſt ſo certainly aſſured vs of Gods promiſe of victory, and his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous confirmation? No, <hi>Gideon,</hi> thoſe harts that haue brought vs hither after thy Colours, can as well keepe vs from retyring.</p>
                     <p>But now, vvho can but bleſſe himſelfe, to finde of two &amp; thirtie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3824:56"/>
thouſand Iſraelites, two &amp; twenty thouſand cowards? Yet all theſe in <hi>Gideons</hi> march made as faire a flouriſh of courage as the boldeſt. VVho can truſt the faces of men, that ſees in the Army of Iſrael, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two for one timorous? How many make a glorious ſhow in the warfaring Church, vvhich when they ſhall ſee danger of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall ſhrinke from the ſtandard of God? Hope of ſafety, examples of neighbours, deſire of prayſe, fear of cenſures, coaction of lawes, fellowſhip of friends, draw many into the field; which ſo ſoone as euer they ſee the Aduerſary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their conditions: and if they may cleanly eſcape, will be gone early from Mount <hi>Gilead.</hi> Can any man be offended at the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3824:57"/>
number of theſe ſhrinkers, when he ſees but tenne thouſand Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites left of two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in one morning.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men that would haue bin aſhamed to go away by day, now drop away by night; And if <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhould haue called any one of them backe, and ſaid, Wilt thou flee? would haue made an excuſe. The darkneſs is a fit vaile for their paleneſſe, or bluſhing; fearfulneſs cannot abide the light: None of theſe thouſands of Iſrael but wold haue bin loath <hi>Gideon</hi> ſhould haue ſeen his face whiles hee ſaid, I am fearefull; very ſhame holds ſome in their ſtation, whoſe hearts are already fled. And if we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that men ſhould be witneſſes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3824:57"/>
of that fear which we might liue to correct, how ſhall wee abide once to ſhow our fearefull heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that terrible Iudge, when hee calls vs foorth to the puniſhment of our feare? Oh the vanitie of fooliſh hypocrites, that run vpon the terrors of GOD, whiles they would auoyde the ſhame of men?</p>
                     <p>How doe wee thinke the ſmall remainder of Iſrael looked, when in the next morning-muſter they found themſelues but tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand left? How did they accuſe their timorous Countrymen, that had left but this handfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the millions of <hi>Midian?</hi> And yet ſtill, God complaines of too many; and vpon his triall, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes nine thouſand ſeauen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3824:58"/>
more. His firſt triall was of the valour of their minds: his next is of the ability of their bodies; Thoſe which beſides boldnes are not ſtrong, patient of labour and thirſt, willing to ſtoope, content with a little (ſuch were thoſe that took vp water with their hand) are not for the ſelect Band of GOD. The Lord of Hoſts will ſerue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of none but able Champions; If he haue therefore ſingled vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his combat, this very choice ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that hee findes that ſtrength in vs, which we cannot confeſſe in our ſelues. How can it but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs in our great trialls, that if the ſearcher of hearts did not find vs fit, hee would neuer honour vs with ſo hard an imployment?</p>

                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:3824:58"/>
Now, when there is not ſcarce left one Iſraelite to euery thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> it is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable with God to ioyne battell. When God hath ſtripped vs of all our earthly confidence, then doth hee finde time to giue vs victory; and not till then, leaſt he ſhould be a loſer in our gaine: Like as at laſt he vnclothes vs of our body, that he may clothe vs vpon with glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If Gideon</hi> feared when he had two and thirty thouſand Iſraelites at his heeles, is it any wonder if hee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when all theſe were ſhrunke into three hundred? Though his confirmation were more, yet his meanes were abated. Why vvas not <hi>Gideon</hi> rather the Leader of thoſe two and twenty thouſand
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3824:59"/>
runne-awaies, then of theſe three hundred ſouldiers? Oh infinite mercie, and forbearance of God, that takes not vantage of ſo ſtrong an infirmitie, but in ſtead of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, incourages him. That wiſe Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath prepared a dream in the head of one <hi>Midianite,</hi> an interpretation in the mouth of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and hath brought <hi>Gideon</hi> to bee an auditor of both; and hath made his enemies Prophets of his victory, incouragers of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, proclaimers of their owne confuſion. A <hi>Midianite</hi> dreames, a <hi>Midianite</hi> interprets. Our verie dreames many times are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; there is a prouidence in our ſleeping fancies: euen the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God may haue viſions, &amp; power to conſtrue them aright;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3824:59"/>
How vſually are wicked men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of their owne deſtruction? To foreknow &amp; not auoyd, is but an aggrauation of iudgement.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Gideon</hi> heard good newes (tho from an enemy) he fel down and worſhipped. To heare, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but a Barly-cake, troubled him not, when hee heard withall, that his roling down the hill ſhold breake the Tents of <hi>Midian;</hi> It matters not how baſe wee bee thought, ſo we may be victorious. The ſoule that hath receiued full confirmation from God, in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his ſaluation, cannot but bow the knee, and by all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of bodie, tell how it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed.</p>

I vvould haue thought <hi>Gideon</hi> ſhould rather haue found full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the promiſe, and act of GOD, then in the dreame of the <hi>Midianite.</hi> Dreames may be full of vncertainty; Gods vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings are infallible: well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might the miracle of GOD giue ſtrength to the dreame of a <hi>Midianite;</hi> but what ſtrength could a Pagans dreame giue to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous act of God? yet by this is <hi>Gideon</hi> throughly ſettled. When wee are going, a little thing driues vs on; when we are come neere to the ſhore, the very tide vvithout ſailes, is enough to put vs into the harbour. We ſhall now heare no more of <hi>Gideons</hi> doubts, but of his atchieuements: And though God had promiſed by theſe three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3824:60"/>
to chaſe the <hi>Midianites,</hi> yet he neglects not wiſe ſtratagems to effect it. To wait for Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in doing nothing, is to abuſe that diuine Prouidence, which will ſo worke, that it vvill not allow vs idle.</p>
                     <p>Now, when wee would looke that <hi>Gideon</hi> ſhould giue charge of whetting their ſwords, &amp; ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their ſpeares, and fitting their Armour, he onely giues order for empty pitchers, and lights, and trumpets. The cracking of theſe pitchers ſhall breake in peeces this Midianitiſh clay: the kindling of theſe lights, ſhall extinguiſh the light of <hi>Midian:</hi> theſe trumpets, ſound no other then a ſoule-peale to all the hoſt of <hi>Midian:</hi> there ſhal
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3824:61"/>
need nothing but noiſe &amp; light to confound this innumerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                     <p>And if the pitchers, and brands, and trumpets of <hi>Gideon,</hi> did ſo daunt &amp; diſmay the proud troopes of <hi>Midian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Amalecke,</hi> Who can we think ſhall be able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt terror, vvherein the trumpet of the Archangell ſhall ſound, and the heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, &amp; the elements ſhal be on a flame about our eares?</p>
                     <p>Any of the vveakeſt <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would haue ſerued to haue broken an empty pitcher, to haue carried a light, &amp; to haue ſounded a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and to ſtrike a flying aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Not to the baſeſt vſe will God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3824:61"/>
employ an vnworthy Agent; Hee will not allow ſo much as a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly torch-bearer.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſlipt away for feare, when the feareful <hi>Midianites</hi> fled, can purſue, and kill them, &amp; can follovv them at the heeles, whom they durſt not looke in the face.

                     <p>To haue queſtioned ſo ſudden a victory had bin pardonable: but to deny it ſcornfully, was vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Iſraelites. Carnall men think that impoſsible to others, vvhich themſelues cannot doe: From

                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideon</hi> hath vowed a fearfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and now performes it; the taunts of his brethren may not ſtay him from the purſute of the <hi>Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites;</hi> Common enmities muſt firſt be oppoſed, domeſticall, at more leyſure. The Princes of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth</hi> feared the tyranny of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianitiſh</hi> Kings, but they more fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Gideons</hi> victory. What a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath their enuy drawn them into? that they are ſory to ſee Gods enemies captiue; that Iſraels free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt bee their death; that the <hi>Midianites</hi> &amp; they, muſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at one and the ſame Reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. To ſee themſelues priſoners to <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> had not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3824:66"/>
been ſo fearefull, as to ſee <hi>Zeba</hi> &amp; <hi>Zalmunna</hi> priſoners to <hi>Gideon.</hi> Nothing is more terrible to euill mindes, then to read their owne condemnation in the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of others: Hell it ſelfe would want one peece of his torment, if the wicked did not knowe thoſe whom they contemned, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p>I knowe not whether more to commend <hi>Gideons</hi> wiſedome and moderation in the proceedings, then his reſolution and iuſtice in the execution of this buſineſs. I doe not ſee him runne furiouſlie into the Citie, and kill the next; His ſword had not been ſo drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with bloud, that it ſhold know no difference: But he writes down
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3824:67"/>
the names of the Princes, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles them forth for reuenge.</p>
                     <p>When the Leaders of GOD come to a <hi>Iericho,</hi> or <hi>Ai,</hi> their ſlaughter was vnpartiall; not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or child might liue to tell newes: but now that <hi>Gideon</hi> comes to a <hi>Succoth,</hi> a Citie of Iſraelites, the Rulers are called foorth to death, the people are frighted with the example, not hurt vvith the iudgement. To enwrappe the innocent in any vengeance, is a murderous iniuſtice: Indeede where all ioyne in the ſin, all are woorthy to meet in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is like, the Citizens of <hi>Succoth</hi> could haue been glad to ſuccour <hi>Gideon,</hi> if their Rulers had not forbidden: they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3824:67"/>
eſcape, vvhiles their Princes periſh.</p>
                     <p>I cannot thinke of <hi>Gideons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge without horror; That the Rulers of <hi>Succoth</hi> ſhold haue their fleſh torne from their backs with thornes &amp; briers; that they ſhould be at once beaten, and ſcratcht to death. What a ſpectacle it was to ſee their bare bones looking ſome-where through the bloudie ragges of their fleſh and skinne, and euery ſtroke worſe then the laſt; death multiplied by torment! Iuſtice is ſometimes ſo ſeuere, that a tender beholder can ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it from crueltie.</p>
                     <p>I ſee the <hi>Midianites</hi> fare leſſe ill; the edge of the ſword makes a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3824:68"/>
ſpeedie and eaſie paſſage for their liues, whiles theſe rebellious Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites die lingringly vnder thornes and bryers, enuying thoſe in their death, whom their life abhorred. Howſoeuer men liue or die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pale of the Church, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iſraelite ſhalbe ſure of plagues. How many ſhal vnwiſh themſelues Chriſtians, when Gods reuenges haue found them out? The place where <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled with GOD <note place="margin">Peni-el.</note> and preuailed, now hath wreſtled againſt God, and takes a fall; they ſee God auenging which would not belieue him deliuering.</p>
                     <p>It was now time for <hi>Zeba</hi> &amp; <hi>Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munna</hi> to follow thoſe their troups to the graue, whom they had led in the field: Thoſe which the day
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3824:68"/>
before, were attended with an hundred thirty fiue thouſand fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, haue not ſo much as a Page now left to weepe for their death; and haue liued onely to ſee all their friends, and ſome ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, die for their ſakes. Who can regard earthly greatneſs, that ſees one night change two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kings of the world into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues? It had been both pitie and ſinne, that the heads of that Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitiſh tyranny, into which they had drawne ſo many thouſands, ſhould haue eſcaped that death.</p>
                     <p>And yet, if priuate reuenge had not made <hi>Gideon</hi> iuſt, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had died; The bloud of his brothers calls for theirs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes his ſword to their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3824:69"/>
Hee both knew and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the <hi>Madianitiſh</hi> oppreſsion, vnder which Iſrael groned: yet the cruelty offered to all the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Fathers ſonnes, had not drawne the bloud of <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> if his own mothers ſons had not bled by their hands. Hee that ſlew the Rulers of <hi>Succoth</hi> and <hi>Penuel,</hi> &amp; ſpared the people, now hath ſlaine the people of <hi>Midian,</hi> and would haue ſpared their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: but that God which wil finde occaſions to wind wicked men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iudgement, wil haue them ſlain in a priuate quarrell, which had more deſerued it for the publike; If we may not rather ſay, that <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> reuenged theſe as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, not as a brother: For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors to reſpect their own ends
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3824:69"/>
in publique actions, and to weare the ſword of iuſtice in their owne ſheath, it is a wrongfull abuſe of authoritie. The ſlaughter of <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> brethren, was not the greateſt ſinne of the Midianitiſh Kings; this alone ſhall kill them, vvhen the reſt expected an vniuſt remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. How many lewd men hath God paid with ſome one ſinne for all the reſt?

                        <hi>Gideons</hi> young ſon is bidden to reuenge the death of his Vncles; His ſword had not yet learn'd the way to bloud, eſpecially of Kings, though in irons: Deadly executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require ſtrength both of heart and face. How are thoſe aged in euill, that can draw their ſwords vpon the lawfully Anointed of God? Theſe Tyrants pleade not now for continuance of life, but for the haſte of their death; <hi>Fall thou vpon vs.</hi> Death is euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with paine, which it is no maruell if we wiſh ſhort: Wee doe not more affect protraction of an eaſefull life, then ſpeed in our diſſolution; for heere euery pang that tends toward death, renewes it: To lie an houre vnder death, is tedious; but to be dying a whole

day, we thinke aboue the ſtrength of humane patience. Oh what ſhal wee then conceiue of that death, which knowes no end? As this life is no leſſe fraile then the bodie which it animates; ſo that death is no leſſe eternall then the ſoule which muſt endure it: For vs to be dying ſo long as wee now haue leaue to hue, is intolerable; and yet one onely minute of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tormenting death, is worſe then an age of this.

Who is ſo worthy to weare the Crowne of Iſrael, as hee that won the Crowne from Midian. Their Vſurpers were gone, now they are headleſs; It is a doubt whether they were better to haue had no Kings, or Tyrants; They ſue to <hi>Gideon</hi> to accept of the Kingdom, &amp; are repulſed; There is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter example of modeſtie, then <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> When the Angel ſpake to him, he abaſed himſelfe belowe all Iſrael; when the Ephraimites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with him, hee prefers their gleanings to his vintage, and caſts his honour at their feet: and now when Iſrael profers him that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which he had merited, hee refuſes it. Hee that in ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming would allow them to cry, <hi>The ſword of the Lord, and of Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

Why doe we not rather labor for that Kingdome which is free from all cares, from all vncertaintie?</p>
                     <p>Yet he that refuſes their Crown, calls for their earings, although not to enrich himſelfe, but religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So long had God bin a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

No ſooner is a ſecret diſlike kindled in any people againſt their Gouernours, then there is a <hi>Gaal</hi> ready to blow the coales: It were a wonder if euer any faction ſhould want an Head; As contrarily, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man was ſo ill, as not to haue ſome fauorers: <hi>Abimelec</hi> hath a <hi>Zebul</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Shechem;</hi> Lightly, all treaſons are betrayd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with ſome of their owne; His intelligence brings the ſword of <hi>Abimelec</hi> vpon <hi>Shechem,</hi> who now hath demoliſhed the City, &amp; ſown it with ſalt. Oh the iuſt ſucceſsions of the reuenges of God! <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod is puniſhed with the bloud of his ſonnes; the bloud of his ſons is ſhed by the procurement of the <hi>Shechemites;</hi> the bloud of the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites</hi> is ſhed by <hi>Abimelec:</hi> the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3824:79"/>
bloud of <hi>Abimelec</hi> is ſpilt by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The retaliations of God, are ſure and iuſt, &amp; make a more due pedigree, then deſcent of nature.</p>
                     <p>The purſued <hi>Shechemites,</hi> flie to the houſe of their god <hi>Berith;</hi> now they are ſafe: that place is at once a fort, and a ſanctuary. VVhether ſhould we fly in our diſtreſſe but to our GOD? And now this refuge ſhall teach them what a God they haue ſerued: The iealous God whom they had forſaken, hath them now where he would, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyces at once to be reuenged of their god, &amp; them: Had they not made the houſe of <hi>Baal</hi> their ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they had not died ſo fearfully. Now, according to the prophecie of <hi>Iotham,</hi> a fire goes out of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3824:80"/>
bramble, and conſumes theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, and their eternall flames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the houſe of their <hi>Berith:</hi> the confuſion of wicked men, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of the falſe Deities vvhich they haue doted on.</p>
                     <p>Of all the Conſpirators againſt <hi>Gideons</hi> ſonnes, only <hi>Abimelec</hi> yet ſuruiues, and his day is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. His ſucceſs againſt <hi>Shechem,</hi> hath filled his hart with thoughts of victorie; He hath caged vp the inhabitants of <hi>Tebez</hi> within their tower alſo; and what remaines for them, but the ſame end with their neighbours? And behold, while his hand is buſie in putting fire to the dore of their tower, which yet was not hie (for then he could not haue diſcerned a woman to be his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3824:80"/>
Executioner) a ſtone from a vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand ſtrikes his head; His paine in dying, was not ſo much as his indignation to know by whom he died: &amp; rather wil he die twiſe, then a woman ſhal kill him. If God had not known his ſtomack ſo big, he had not vexed him with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of his Victor: God findes a time to reckon with wicked men for all the arrerages of their ſinnes. Our ſins are not more our debts to God, then his iudgements are his debts to our ſinnes, which at laſt hee will be ſure to pay home. There now lies the greatneſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelec;</hi> vpon one ſtone had hee ſlaine his ſeuenty brethren, &amp; now a ſtone ſlaies him; His head had ſtolne the Crown of Iſrael, &amp; now his head is ſmitten: And what is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3824:81"/>
                        <hi>Abimelec</hi> better that he was a King? What difference is there betwixt him, and any of his ſeauenty bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom he murdred, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in guiltineſſe? They beare but their owne bloud; hee, the weight of all theirs. How happy a thing is it to liue well! that our death, as it is certaine, ſo may be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: What a vanitie it is to inſult in the death of them, whom wee muſt follow the ſame way?</p>
                     <p>The Tyran hath his payment, &amp; that time which he ſhold haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in calling for mereie to GOD, and waſhing his bloudie ſoule with the laſt teares of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he vainly ſpends in depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an idle reproach; <hi>Kill me, that it may not be ſaid, He died by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:3824:81"/>
A fitte concluſion for ſuch a life. The expectation of true and endleſs torment, doth not ſo much vex him, as the friuolous report of a dishonor; neither is he ſo much troubled with, <hi>Abimelec</hi> is frying in hell, as, <hi>Abimelec</hi> is ſlaine by a woman.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Srael,</hi> that had now long gone a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from GOD, hath bin puniſhed by the regiment of the Concubines ſonne, and at laſt ſeekes protection from the ſonne of an harlot: It is no ſmall miſerie to be obliged vnto the vnworthy. The concubines ſon made ſute to them; They make ſute to the ſon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3824:85"/>
of the harlot. It was no fault of <hi>Ieptha</hi> that hee had an ill mother, yet is he branded with the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his baſtardie; neither would God conceale this blemiſh of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which <hi>Ieptha</hi> could neither auoyd, nor remedy. God, to ſhow his deteſtation of whoredom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenges it not onely vpon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but vpon their iſſue: Hence he hath ſhut out the baſe-ſon from the congregation of Iſrael, to the tenth generation, that a tranſient euil might haue a durable reproch attending it; And that after the death of the Adulterer, yet his ſhame might liue. But, that God who iuſtly ties men to his lawes, will not abide that wee ſhould tie him to our lawes, or his owne; He can both rectifie and ennoble the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3824:85"/>
bloud of <hi>Ieptha.</hi> That no man ſhould be too much diſcouraged with the errors of his propagation, euen the baſe ſon of man may be the lawfully begotten of God; &amp; though hee be caſt out from the inheritance of his brethren vpon earth, may bee admitted to the kingdome of Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>I heare no praiſe of the lawfull iſſue of <hi>Gilead;</hi> onely this miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne is commended for his valour, and ſet at the ſterne of Iſrael: The common gifts of God reſpect not the parentage or blood, but are indifferently ſcattered where he pleaſes to let them fall. The choice of the Almighty, is not guided by our rules; As in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſo in earthly things, it is not in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3824:86"/>
him that willeth: If GOD would haue men glory in theſe outward priuiledges, he would beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them none but the worthy.</p>
                     <p>Now, who can bee proude of ſtrength or greatnes, when he ſees him that is not ſo honeſt, yet is more valiant, and more aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Had not <hi>Ieptha</hi> been baſe, he had not been thruſt out; and if he had not been thruſt out from his brethren, hee had neuer been the Captaine of Iſrael. By contrarie paſes to ours, it pleaſeth GOD to come to his owne ends: and how vſually doth he looke the contrary way, to that he moues? No man can meaſure the concluſion of Gods act by his beginning: Hee that fetches good out of euill,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3824:86"/>
raiſes the glory of men out of their ruine. Men loue to goe the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way, and often faile: GOD commonly goes about, and in his owne time comes ſurely home.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gileadites</hi> were not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to expell <hi>Ieptha,</hi> as gladde to recall him; No <hi>Ammonite</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them when they parted vvith ſuch an helper: Now, whom they caſt out in their peace, they fetch home in their danger and miſery. That God who neuer gaue ought in vaine, will finde a time to make vſe of any gift that hee hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon men; The valour of <hi>Ieptha</hi> ſhall not ruſt in his ſecrecie, but bee imploied to the common preſeruation of Iſrael: Neceſsitie will driue vs to ſeeke vp all our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3824:87"/>
helps, euen thoſe whom our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe hath deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>How iuſtly are the ſutes of our need vp braided with the errors of our proſperitie? The Elders of <hi>Gilead</hi> now heare of their ancient wrong, and dare not finde fault with their exprobration; <hi>Did yee not hate mee, and expell me out of my Fathers houſe? How then come yee now to mee in time of Tribulation?</hi> The ſame expoſtulation that <hi>Iep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> makes with <hi>Gilead,</hi> GOD alſo at the ſame time makes with Iſrael; <hi>Ye haue for ſaken me, &amp; ſerued other Gods; wherefore ſhould I deliuer you any more: Goe &amp; cry vnto the gods whom ye haue ſerued.</hi> As we, ſo God alſo findes it ſeaſonable to tell his children of their faults, whiles hee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3824:87"/>
is whipping them. It is a ſafe and wiſe courſe, to make much of thoſe in our peace, whom we muſt make vſe of in our extremity; elſe it is but iuſt, that we ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of thoſe, whom we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Can we look for any other anſwere from God then this? Did ye not driue me out of your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, out of your harts, in the time of your health and iollitie? Did yee not plead the ſtrictneſſe of my charge, &amp; the weight of my yoke? Did not your wilfull ſinnes expell mee from your ſoules? What doe you now crowching &amp; creeping to me in the euill day? Surelie, O God, it is but iuſtice, if thou bee not found of thoſe, which vvere glad to loſe thee; it is thy mercie, if after many checks, and delaies,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3824:88"/>
thou wilt be found at laſt. Where an act cannot be reuerſed, there is no amends, but confeſsion; and if God himſelfe take vp with this ſatisfaction, <hi>He that confeſses, ſhall finde mercy;</hi> how much more ſhold men hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues well paid with words of humilitie, and depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iepthaes</hi> wiſedome had not bin anſwerable to his valour, if he had not made his match before hand; He could not but know how tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly Iſrael had dealt with <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> VVee cannot make too ſure worke, when we haue to doe with vnfaithfull men: It hath been an old policie to ſerue our ſelues of men; and after our aduantage, to turne them vp. He bargains ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3824:88"/>
for his Soueraignttie ere he winne it, <hi>Shall I be your Head?</hi> We are all naturally ambitious, and are ready to buy honor euen with hazard. And if the hope of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſuperioritie incouraged <hi>Ieptha</hi> to fight againſt the forces of <hi>Ammon,</hi> what hart ſhould vvee take in the battels of God againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes, when the God of heauen hath ſaid, <hi>To him that ouercomes, will I giue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nations, and to ſit with me in my Throne?</hi> Oh that wee could bend our eyes vpon the recompence of our reward; how willingly ſhould wee march forward againſt theſe mighty <hi>Ammonites! Ieptha</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his valour, and yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates with <hi>Ammon,</hi> ere he fights. To make war any other then our
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3824:89"/>
laſt remedy, is not courage, but cruelty and raſhneſs: And now, when reaſon will not preuaile, he betakes himſelfe to his ſword.</p>
                     <p>As God began the warre vvith <hi>Ieptha,</hi> in raiſing vp his hart to that pitch of fortitude; ſo <hi>Ieptha</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his warre at GOD, in crauing victory from him, &amp; pouring out his vow to him: His hand tooke hold of his ſword; his hart, of God: therefore hee, whom the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſtiles valiant, the new, ſtiles faithfull; Hee who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his ſtrength, dares truſt in none, but the arme of God: <hi>If thou wilt giue the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites into my hand.</hi> If <hi>Ieptha</hi> had not lookt vpward for his victory, in vaine had the <hi>Gileadites</hi> lookt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3824:89"/>
vp to him: This is the diſpoſition of all good harts, they looke to their ſword, or their bowe, as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, not as Patrons; and whiles they vſe them, truſt to God. If we could doe ſo in all our buſineſſes, wee ſhould haue both more ioy in their ſucceſſe, and leſſe diſcomfort in their miſcariage.</p>
                     <p>It was his zeale to vow: it vvas his ſinne to vow raſhly. <hi>Iacob</hi> his fore-father, of whom hee learned to vow, might haue taught him a better forme; <hi>If GOD will bee with me, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> It is well with vowes, when the thing promiſed makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe good: But when <hi>Ieptha</hi> ſaies, <hi>Whatſoeuer thing commeth out of the doores of my houſe, ſhall bee the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3824:90"/>
Lords, or I will offer it for a burnt ſacrifice;</hi> his deuotion is blind, and his good affection ouer-runnes his iudgement: For what if a dog, or a ſwine, or an aſſe had met him, where had been the promiſe of his conſecration?</p>
                     <p>Vowes are as they are made; like vnto ſents, if they bee of ill compoſition, nothing offends more; if well tempered, nothing is more pleaſant: Either certainty of euill, or vncertainty of good, or impoſsibilitie of performance, makes vowes no ſeruice to GOD. When we vow what we cannot, or what we ought not doe, we mock God inſteed of honoring him: It is a vaine thing for vs, to go about to catch God hood-winkt; The
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3824:90"/>
conſcience ſhall neuer finde peace in any way, but that which we ſee before vs, and which we know ſafe both in the kind, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is no comfort in (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture I may pleaſe GOD.) What good child wil not take part of the Parents ioy? If <hi>Ieptha</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with Trophees, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if his daughter meet him with Timbrels: Oh that we could be ſo affected with the glorious acts of our heauenly Father! Thou ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueſt thine enemies, and mightily deliuereſt thy people. O GOD, a ſong waiteth for thee in Sion.</p>
                     <p>Who vvould haue ſuſpected danger in a dutifull Triumph? VVell might <hi>Iepthaes</hi> daughter haue thought; My ſexe forbad me
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3824:91"/>
to doe any thing towards the help of my Fathers victory; I can doe little, if I cannot applaud it; If na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue made me weake, yet not vnthankfull; nothing forbids my ioy to be as ſtrong as the Victors; Though I might not goe out with my father to fight, yet I may meet him with gratulations; A Timbrel may become theſe hands which were vnfit for a ſword; This day hath made me the daughter of the Head of Iſrael; This day hath made both Iſrael free, my father a Conqueror, and my ſelfe in him noble: and ſhal my affection make no difference? What muſt my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needs think, if hee ſhall finde me ſitting ſullenly at home, whiles all Iſrael ſtriues who ſhall run firſt to bleſſe him with their acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3824:91"/>
Should I onely be inſenſible of his, and the common happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
                     <p>And now, behold when ſhee lookes for moſt thanks, her father anſwers the meaſures of her feet, with the knockings of his breaſt, and weeps at her muſick, &amp; teares his clothes to looke vpon her, whom he beſt loued, and giues no anſwere to her Timbrels, but <hi>Alas my daughter, thou art of them that trouble mee:</hi> Her ioy alone hath changed the day, &amp; loſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that victory, which ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed to ſee won. It falls out often, that thoſe times and occaſions, which promiſe moſt contentment, prooue moſt dolefull in the iſſue: The hart of this Virgin was neuer
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3824:92"/>
lifted vp ſo hie as now, neither did any day of her life ſeem happy but this; and this onely, proues the day of her ſolemne, and perpetuall mourning: As contrarilie the times and euents which wee haue moſt diſtruſted, proue moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall. It is good in a fair morning, to thinke of the ſtorme that may riſe ere night, and to enioy both good and euill fearefully.</p>
                     <p>Miſerable is that deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which troubles vs in the performance; Nothing is more pleaſant then the acts of true pietie: <hi>Ieptha</hi> might well ſee the wrong of this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the diſtaſte of it; yet whiles himſelfe had troubled his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee faies, <hi>Alas my daughter, thou art of them that trouble mee.</hi>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:3824:92"/>
She did but her dutie, he did what he ſhould not; yet hee would be rid of the blame, tho he cannot of the ſmart. No man is willing to owne a ſin; the firſt man ſhifted it from himſelfe, to his wife; this, from himſelfe to his daughter: Hee was ready to accuſe another, which onely committed it himſelfe. It were happy if we could be as loth to commit ſinne, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</p>
                     <p>The inconſideration of this vow was very tough, and ſettled; <hi>I haue opened my mouth, and cannot goe backe.</hi> If there were iuſt cauſe to repent, it was the weakneſs of his zeale, to thinke that a vow could binde him to euill; An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull vow is ill made, but worſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3824:93"/>
performed. It were pitty this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie ſhould light vpon any, but an holy obiect: No lone can make a truer debt, then our vow; which if we pay not in our performance, God will pay vs with iudgement. We haue all opened our mouthes to God in that initiall, and ſolemn vow of Chriſtianity; Oh that wee could not goe backe! So much more is our vow obligatory, by how much the thing vowed is more neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Why was the ſoule of <hi>Ieptha</hi> thus troubled, but becauſe he ſaw the entaile of his new honour thus ſuddenly cut off? He ſaw the hope of poſteritie extinguiſhed, in the virginity of his daughter. It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to vs, to affect that perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3824:93"/>
in our ſucceſsion, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vs in our perſons; Our very bodies would emulate the eternity of the ſoule. And if GOD haue built any of vs an houſe on earth, as well as prepared vs an houſe in heauen, it muſt be confeſſed a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, worth our thankfulneſs: but as the perpetuitie of our earthlie houſes is vncertaine; ſo let vs not reſt our harts vpon that, but make ſure of the houſe which is eternall in the heauens.</p>
                     <p>Doubtleſſe, the goodnes of the daughter added to the fathers ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Shee was not more louing, then religious; neither is ſhe leſſe willing to be the Lords, then her fathers: and as prouoking her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that which he thought pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3824:94"/>
though to her own wrong, ſhe ſaies, <hi>If thou haſt opened thy mouth vnto the Lord, doe with mee as thou haſt promiſed.</hi> Many a daughter would haue diſſwaded her father with teares, and haue wiſht rather her fathers impietie, then her own preiudice; Shee ſues for the ſmart of her fathers vowe. How obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious ſhould children be to the will of their carefull Parents, euen in their finall diſpoſition in the world, when they ſee this holie maid willing to abandon the world vpon the raſh vow of a father? They are the liuing goods of their Parents, and muſt therefore waite vpon the beſtowing of their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: They miſtake themſelues, which thinke they are their owne; If this maid had vowed herſelfe to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3824:94"/>
God vvithout her Father, it had been in his power to abrogate it; but now that hee vowed her to GOD vvithout her ſelfe, it ſtands in force. But what ſhall wee ſay to thoſe children, whom their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents vow and care, cannot make ſo much as honeſt; that will be no other then godleſſe in ſpight of their Baptiſme, and education? What, but that they are giuen their Parents for a curſe, and ſhall one day finde what it is to bee rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p>All her deſire is, that ſhee may haue leaue to bewaile that which ſhe muſt be forced to keepe, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie: If ſhee had not held it an affliction, there had been no cauſe to bewaile it; it had bin no thanke
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3824:95"/>
to vnder-goe it, if ſhee had not known it to be a croſs. Teares are no argument of impatience; wee may mourne for that wee repine not to beare: How comes that to be a meritorious vertue vnder the Goſpell, which was but a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder the Law? The daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iſrael had been too lauiſh of their teares, if virginitie had bin abſolutely good: VVhat iniurie ſhould it haue been to lament that ſpirituall preferment, which they ſhould rather haue emulated?</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Iepthaes</hi> daughter vvas two monethes in the mountaines, ſhe might haue had good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to eſcape her fathers vow; but as one, whom her obedience tyed as cloſe to her father, as his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3824:95"/>
vow tyed him to God, ſhe returns to take vp that burden, which ſhe had bewailed to foreſee: If we be truly dutifull to our father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, wee would not ſlip our necks out of the yoke tho we might, nor flie from his commaunds, though the doore were open.</p>

                     <p>As a Phyſitian firſt tells the ſtate of the diſeaſe with his Symptoms, and then preſcribes; ſo dooth the Angell of God, firſt tell the wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> her complaint, then her remedy; <hi>Thou art barren.</hi> All our afflictions are more noted of that GOD which ſends them, then of the Patient that ſuffers them: how can it be but leſſe poſsible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing that he knows not, than that hee inflicteth not? Hee

ſaith to one, Thou art ſicke; to an other, Thou art poore; to a third, Thou art defamed; Thou art op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to another: That all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye, takes notice from heauen of euery mans condition, no leſſe then if he ſhould ſend an Angel to tell vs he knew it; His knowledge compared with his mercy, is the iuſt comfort of all our ſufferings. O GOD, vvee are many times miſerable, and feele it not; Thou knoweſt eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe ſorrowes which wee might haue; Thou knoweſt what thou haſt done: do what thou wilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou art barren.</hi> Not that the Angel would vpbrayd the poore woman with her affliction; but therefore he names her paine, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3824:98"/>
the mention of her cure might be ſo much more welcom; Comfort ſhal com vnſeaſonably to that hart which is not apprehenſiue of his owne ſorrow: We muſt firſt know our euils, ere we can quit them. It is the iuſt method of euery true Angel of GOD, firſt to let vs ſee that whereof either wee doe, or ſhould complaine, and then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply comforts. Like as a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, firſt pulls downe the body, and then raiſes it with cordialls. If wee cannot abide to heare of our faults, wee are not capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement.</p>
                     <p>If the Angel had firſt ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt conceiue,</hi> and not premiſed, <hi>Thou art barren;</hi> I doubt whether ſhee had conceiued faith in her

ſoule, of that infant which her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould conceiue; Now, his knowledge of her preſent eſtate, makes way for the aſſurance of the future. Thus euer it pleaſes our good God, to leaue a pawne of his fidelitie with vs; that vvee ſhould not diſtruſt him in what he will do, when we find him faithfull in that which we ſee done.</p>
                     <p>It is good reaſon that he which giues the ſonne to the barren mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould diſpoſe of him, and diet him both in the wombe firſt, and after, in the world. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt firſt be a Nazarite, that her ſonne may be ſo. Whiles ſhee was barren, ſhe might drink what ſhe would: but now that ſhee ſhall conceiue a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> her choice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3824:99"/>
muſt be limited; There is an holie auſterity that euer followes the ſpeciall calling of GOD; The worldling may take his full ſcope, and deny his backe and belly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but he that hath once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that bleſſed burden, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a type, muſt bee ſtrict and ſeuere to himſelfe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his tongue, nor his palat, nor his hand may runne riot; Thoſe pleaſures which ſeemed not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly for the multitude, are now debarred him. We borrow more names of our Sauiour then one; As wee are Chriſtians, ſo wee are Nazarites, the conſecration of our God is vpon our heads; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our very haire ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Our appetite muſt be curbed, our paſsions moderated, and ſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3824:100"/>
eſtranged from the world, that in the loſſe of parents, or children, nature may not make vs forget grace. What doth the looſenes of vaine men perſwade them that God is not curious, when they ſee him thus preciſely ordering the very diet of his Nazarites? Nature pleades for liberty; religion for reſtraint: Not that there is more vncleanneſſe in the grape, then in the fountaine; but that wine findes more vncleanneſſe in vs, then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the hie feede is not ſo fit for deuotion, as abſtinence. Who ſees not a ceremony in this commaund? VVhich yet carries with it this ſubſtance of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vſe, that God and the bellie will not admit of one ſeruant; that quaffing and cramming is not the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3824:100"/>
way to heauen: A drunken Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is a monſter among men. We haue now more ſcope then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; not drinking of vvine, but drunkenneſſe with wine is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Euangelicall Nazarite; wine, wherein is exceſs. Oh that euer Chriſtian ſhould quench the ſpirit of GOD, with a liquor of Gods owne making; That they ſhould ſuffer their hearts to bee drowned with wine, and ſhould ſo liue, as if the practice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, were quite contrary to the rule of the law.</p>
                     <p>The mother muſt conceiue the onely Giant of Iſrael, &amp; yet muſt drinke but water; neither muſt the child touch any other cup. Neuer wine made ſo ſtrong a Champion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3824:101"/>
as water did heere: The power of nouriſhment, is not in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in their Maker. <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions kept their complexion, vvith the ſame diet where-with <hi>Sampſon</hi> got his ſtrength; he that gaue that power to the grape, can giue it to the ſtreame. O God, how iuſtlie doe wee raiſe our eyes from our tables vnto thee, which canſt make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nouriſh, and wine enfeeble vs!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sampſon</hi> had not a better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then <hi>Manoah</hi> had a wife; ſhe hides not the good newes in her owne boſome, but imparts it to her husband: That wife hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make a true vſe of her Head, which is euer reade to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with him, about the meſſages
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3824:101"/>
of God. If ſhee were made for his helper, hee is much more hers. Thus ſhould good women make amends for their firſt offence; that as <hi>Eue</hi> no ſooner had receiued an ill motion, but ſhe deliuered it to her husband; ſo they ſhould no ſooner receiue good, then they ſhould impart it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manoah</hi> (like one which in thoſe lend times had not loſt his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God) ſo ſoone as hee heares the newes, falls downe vpon his knees: I do not hear him call forth and addreſſe his ſeruants to all the coaſts of heauen (as the children of the prophets did in the ſearch of <hi>Elias)</hi> to finde out the meſſenger; but I ſee him rather looke ſtraight vp, to that GOD
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3824:102"/>
which ſent him; <hi>My Lord, I pray thee let that man of God come again.</hi> As a ſtraight line is the ſhorteſt, the neereſt cutte to any bleſsing is to goe by heauen; As we may not ſue to God, and neglect meanes, ſo wee muſt ſue to GOD for thoſe meanes which we ſhall vſe.</p>
                     <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſee the ſtrength of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noahs</hi> faith, I maruell not that hee had a <hi>Sampſon</hi> to his ſonne; he ſaw not the meſſenger, hee heard not the errand, hee examined not the circumſtances; yet now hee takes thought, not whether he ſhal haue a ſonne, but how he ſhall order the ſonne which hee muſt haue; and ſues to God, not for the ſon which as yet hee had not, but for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of gouerning him, when
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3824:102"/>
he ſhould be. <hi>Zachariah</hi> heard the ſame meſſage, &amp; crauing a ſigne, loſt that voice wherwith he craued it: <hi>Manoah</hi> ſeekes no ſigne for the promiſe, but counſell for himſelfe; and yet, that Angel ſpake to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> himſelfe, this onely to the wife of <hi>Manoah;</hi> that, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple like a glorious ſpirit; this, in the houſe, or fielde, like ſome Prophet, or Traueller; that to a Prieſt, this to a woman. All good men haue not equall meaſures of faith; The bodies of men haue not more differences of ſtature, then their graces: Credulity to men is faulty and dangerous; but in the matters of GOD, is the greateſt vertue of a Chriſtian; Happy are they that haue not ſeene, yet belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: True faith takes all for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3824:103"/>
yea for performed, vvhich is once promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Hee that before ſent his Angel vnasked, will much more ſend him againe, vpon intreatie; thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meſſengers are readie both to obey their Maker, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his children. Neuer any man prayed for direction in his duties to God, and was repulſed: rather will God ſend an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to inſtruct vs, then our good deſires ſhall be fruſtrate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manoah</hi> prayed, the Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againe; not to him, but to his wife. It had been the ſhorter way, to haue come firſt to the man whoſe prayers procured his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: But as <hi>Manoah</hi> went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3824:103"/>
and immediatly to GOD, ſo God comes mediatly &amp; about to him; and will make her the meanes to beare the meſſage to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who muſt beare him the ſonne: Both the bleſsing and the charge are chiefely meant to her. It was a good care of <hi>Manoah,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angel had giuen order to his wife alone, for the gouerning of the childs diet, to profer himſelfe to this charge; <hi>How ſhall we order the child?</hi> As both the Parents haue their part in the being of their children, ſo ſhould they haue in their education; it is both vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vnnaturall in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, to caſt this burden vpon the weaker veſſel alone: it is no reaſon that ſhe which alone hath had the paine of their birth, ſhould haue
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3824:104"/>
the pain of their breeding. Thogh the charge be renued to the wife, yet the ſpeech is directed to the husband; the act muſt be hers, his muſt be the ouer-ſight; <hi>Let her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all that I haue commanded her.</hi> The head muſt ouer-look the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it is the duty of the husband to be carefull that the wife do her dutie to GOD.</p>
                     <p>As yet, <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaw nothing but the out-ſide of a man, and therfore offers the Angel an anſwerable entertainment, wherein there is at once Hoſpitality and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. No man ſhal bring him good newes from GOD, and goe away vnrecompenced; How forward he is to feaſt him, whom hee tooke for a Prophet: their feet ſhould be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3824:104"/>
ſo much more beautifull, that bring vs newes of ſaluation, by how much their errand is better.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Manoah</hi> might learn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God in this man, hee ſets off the proffer of his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes from himſelfe, to God; and (as the ſame Angel which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Gideon)</hi> turnes his feaſt into a ſacrifice: And now he is <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> ſolicitor to better thanks than hee offered. How forward the good Angels are to incite vs vnto pietie! Either this was the Sonne himſelf, which ſaid It was his meat and drinke to doe his Fathers will, or elſe one of his ſpirituall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſame diet. Wee can neuer feaſt the Angels better, then with our harty ſacrifices to God;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3824:105"/>
Why do not we learne this leſſon of them, whom wee propound to our ſelues as the patterns of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? We ſhall be once like the Angels in condition, why are wee not in the meane time in our diſpoſitions? If wee doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke, and exhort one another to godlineſſe, and doe care more for a feaſt, then a ſacrifice, our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is not Angelicall, but brutiſh.</p>
                     <p>It was an honeſt minde in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah,</hi> whiles hee was addreſsing a ſacrifice to God, yet not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his meſſenger; faine would he know whom to honour; True pietie is not vnciuill, but whiles it magnifies the authour of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, is thankfull to the meanes: Secondary cauſes are woorthy of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3824:105"/>
regard: neither need it detract any thing from the praiſe of the agent, to honor the inſtrument. It is not onely rudeneſs, but iniuſtice in thoſe, which can bee content to heare good newes from God, with contempt of the bearers.</p>
                     <p>The Angell wil neither take nor giue, but conceales his very name from <hi>Manoah.</hi> All honeſt motions are not fit to be yeelded to; good intentions are not alwayes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grounds of condiſcent. If wee doe ſomtimes aske what we know not, it is no maruell if wee receiue not what wee aske. In ſome caſes, the Angel of God tells his name vnasked, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Virgin; heere, not by intreaty: If it were the Angel of the couenant, he had
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3824:106"/>
as yet no name but <hi>Iehouah;</hi> if a created Angel, hee had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to tell his name; &amp; a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meſſenger hath not a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his charge: Beſides that, hee ſaw it would bee of more vſe for <hi>Manoah,</hi> to know him really, then by words. Oh the bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe men, which (as if they had long ſoiourned in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and been acquainted with all the holy Legions of ſpirits) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their orders; of their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, when this one Angels ſtoppes the mouth of a better man then they, with <hi>Why dooſt thou aske after my name, which is ſecret?</hi> Secret things to God; reuealed, to vs and our children. No word can be ſo ſignificant as actions; The act of the Angel tels beſt who hee was;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3824:106"/>
Hee did wonderfully: wonderfull therefore was his name. So ſoon as euer the flame of the ſacrifice aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, hee mounted vp in the ſmoke of it; that <hi>Manoah</hi> might ſee the ſacrifice, and the meſſenger belonged both to one God; and might know, both whence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the meſſage, and whence to expect the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gideons</hi> Angel vaniſhed at his ſacrifice, but this in the ſacrifice; that <hi>Manoah</hi> might at once ſee both the confirmation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the acceptation of his obedience, whiles the Angel of God vouchſafed to perfume him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with that holy ſmoke, &amp; carry the ſent of it vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:3824:107"/>
belieued before, and craued no ſigne to aſſure him; God volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily confirmes it to him aboue his deſire: <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be giuen.</hi> Where there are begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of faith, the mercy of GOD will adde perfection.</p>
                     <p>How doe we thinke <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife looked to ſee this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? They had not ſpirit enough left to looke one vpon another: but in ſteed of looking vp cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to heauen, they fall downe to the earth, on their faces; as weak eyes are dazeled with that which ſhould comfort them. This is the infirmitie of our nature, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the cauſes of our ioy; to be aſtoniſhed with our confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue death in that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3824:107"/>
viſion of God, wherein our life &amp; happineſs conſiſts. If this homely ſight of the Angell did ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found good <hi>Manoah,</hi> what ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the enemies of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall be brought before the glorious Tribunall of the God of Angels?</p>
                     <p>I maruell not now, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appeared both times rather to the wife of <hi>Manoah;</hi> her faith was the ſtronger of the two. It falls out ſometimes, that the weaker veſſel is fuller; and that of more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor: that wife is no helper which is not ready to giue ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort to her husband; The reaſon was good, and irrefragable, <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill vs, hee would not haue receiued a burnt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3824:108"/>
offring from vs;</hi> God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept gifts, where he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and profeſſes hatred. The ſacrifice of the vvicked, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord: If wee can finde aſſurance of Gods accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſacrifices, wee may be ſure hee loues our perſons. If I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to wickednes in my hart, the Lord will not heare mee; but the Lord hath heard mee.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3824:109"/>
tho not of his paſsion; and as one that had learned ſo to be a ſutor, as not to forget himſelfe to bee a ſonne. Euen in this deplored ſtate of Iſrael, children durſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be their own caruers; how much leſs is this tolerable in a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided and Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Whoſoeuer now diſpoſe of themſelues without their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they doe wilfully vn-child themſelues, and change naturall affection for violent.</p>
                     <p>It is no maruell if <hi>Manoah</hi> and his wife were aſtoniſhed at this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall motion of their ſon; Did not the Angell (thought they) tell vs that this child ſhould be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God, and muſt he begin his youth in vnholy wedlock? Did
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3824:110"/>
not the Angel ſay that our ſonne ſhould beginne to ſaue Iſrael from the Philiſtims, and is he now cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued in his affections by a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Philiſtims? Shall our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from the Philiſtims be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne in an alliance? Haue we bin ſo ſcrupulouſly carefull, that hee ſhould eate no vncleane thing, &amp; ſhall wee now conſent to an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh match? Now therefore they grauely indeauour to coole this intemperate heat of his paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with good counſell; as thoſe which well knew the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of an vnequall yoke; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in religion, alienation of affections, diſtraction of thoughts, conniuence at Idolatry, death of zeale, dangerous vnderminings, and laſtly, an vnholy ſeed: Who
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3824:110"/>
can blame them if they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to call a Philiſtim, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                     <p>I wiſh <hi>Manoah</hi> could ſpeake ſo loud that all our Iſraelites might heare him; <hi>Is there neuer a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all Gods people, that thou goeſt to take a wife of the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtims?</hi> If religion be any other then a cypher, how dare we not regard it in our moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant choice? Is ſhee a faire Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim? Why is not this deformitie of the ſoule more powerfull to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, then the beautie of the face, or of metall to allure vs? To dote vpon a faire skinne when we ſee a Philiſtim vnder it, is ſenſuall and brutiſh.</p>

                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:3824:111"/>
Affection is not more blind, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deafe. In vaine doe the Parents ſeeke to alter a young man, not more ſtrong in body, then in will; Tho he cannot defend his deſires, yet he purſues them; <hi>Get mee her, for ſhe pleaſes mee.</hi> And although it muſt needs be a weake motion that can plead no reaſon, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; yet the good Parents, ſith they cannot bow the affection of their ſonne with perſwaſion, dare not breake it with violence. As it becomes not children to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their choice; ſo Parents may not be too peremptorie in their denial; It is not ſafe for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ouer-runne Parents in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their affections; nor for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (where the impediments are not very materiall) to come ſhort
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3824:111"/>
of their children, when the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are once ſettled: The one is diſobedience; the other may be tyranny.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe either <hi>Sampſon</hi> in making this ſute, or his Parents in yeelding to it, by a diuine diſpenſation in both: For on the one ſide, whiles the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God notes, that as yet his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents knew not this was of the Lord, it may ſeeme that hee knew it; and is it likely hee would know and not impart it? This alone was enough to win, yea to command his Parents; It is not mine eye one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the counſell of God, that leades me to this choice; The way to quarrell with the Philiſtims, is to match with them; If I follow mine
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3824:112"/>
affection, mine affection followes God, in this proiect. Surely, hee that commaunded his Prophet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to marry an harlot, may haue appointed his Nazarite to marry with a Philiſtim: On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, whether it were of God permitting, or allowing, I find not; It might ſo be of God, as all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in the Citie; and then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Gods decree, ſhall be no excuſe of <hi>Sampſons</hi> infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I would rather think, that God meant onely to make a Treacle of a Viper; and rather appointed to fetch good out of <hi>Sampſons</hi> euill, then to approue that for good in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which in it ſelfe was euil.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Sampſon</hi> went on woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he might haue made the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3824:112"/>
excuſe, <hi>There is a Lion in the way:</hi> but he that could not be ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perſwaſion, will not by fear. A Lion, young, wilde, fierce, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, comes roring vpon him when hee had no weapon but his hand, no fence but his ſtrength; the ſame Prouidence that carried him to <hi>Timnah,</hi> brought the Lion to him. It hath been euer the faſhion of God, to exerciſe his Champions with ſome initiatory incounters: Both <hi>Sampſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> muſt firſt fight with Lions, then with Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims; &amp; he whoſe type they bore, meets with that roring Lion of the wilderneſſe, in the very threſhold of his publique charge. The ſame hand that prepared a Lion for <hi>Sampſon,</hi> hath proportionable matches for euery Chriſtian; God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3824:113"/>
neuer giues ſtrength, but hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes it: Pouerty, meets one like an armed man; Infamy, like ſome furious maſtiue, comes flying in the face of another; the wild Bore out of the forreſt, or the bloudie Tyger of perſecution ſets vpon one; the brawling curres of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prauitie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, are ready to bait ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by all theſe meaner and brutiſh aduerſaries, wil God fit vs for greater conflicts: It is a pledge of our future victory ouer the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Philiſtims, if we can ſay, My ſoule hath been among Lions. Come forth now thou weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and behold this preparatorie battel of <hi>Sampſon;</hi> Doſt thou think GOD deales hardly with thee in matching thee ſo hard, and calling
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3824:113"/>
thee forth to ſo many fraies? What dooſt thou but repine at thine own glory? How ſhouldſt thou be vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, without reſiſtance?</p>
                     <p>If the Parents of <hi>Sampſon</hi> had now ſtood behind the hedge and ſeene this incounter, they vvould haue taken no further care of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their ſonne with a Philiſtim; For who that ſhould ſee a ſtrong Lion ramping vpon an vnarmed man, would hope for his life and victory? The beaſt came briſtling vp his fearefull mane, wafting his raiſed ſterne, his eyes ſparkling with furie, his mouth roaring out knells of his laſt paſſage, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing death from his noſtrills, and now reioyced at ſo faire a prey. Surely, if the Lion had had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3824:114"/>
aduerſary then him whom he ſaw, hee had not loſt his hope; but now he could not ſee that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker was his enemy; <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord came vpon Sampſon;</hi> What is a beaſt in the hand of the Creator? He that ſtrooke the Lions with the awe of <hi>Adam, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſubdued this rebellious beaſt to <hi>Sampſon;</hi> VVhat maruell is it, if <hi>Sampſon</hi> now tore him, as if it had bin a young Kid? If his bones had been braſſe, and his skin plates of iron, all had been one: The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to paſs.</p>
                     <p>If that roring Lion, that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout continually ſeeking whom he may deuour, find vs alone among the vineyards of the Philiſtims,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3824:114"/>
where is our hope? Not in our heeles; hee is ſwifter then we: not in our weapons; we are naturally vnarmed: not in our hands, which are weak and languiſhing; but in the ſpirit of that GOD, by whom we can do all things: if God fight in vs, who can reſiſt him? There is a ſtronger Lion in vs, then that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sampſon</hi> was not more valiant then modeſt; hee made no words of this great exploit: the greateſt performers euer make the leaſt noyſe; He that works wonders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, could ſay, <hi>See thou tell no man;</hi> where as thoſe, whoſe hands are moſt impotent, are buſieſt of their tongues. Great talkers ſhow that they deſire only to be thought
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3824:115"/>
eminent, whereas the deepeſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are leaſt heard.</p>
                     <p>But, whiles he concealed this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent from others, hee pondred it in himſelfe; and when hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Timnath,</hi> went out of the way to ſee his dead Aduerſary, and could not but recal to himſelfe his danger, and deliuerance; Heere the beaſt met me, thus he fought, thus I ſlew him. The very dead Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taught <hi>Sampſon</hi> thankfulneſſe: there was more hony in this thought, then in the carcaſſe. The mercies of GOD are ill beſtowed vpon vs, if we cannot ſteppe aſide to view the monuments of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances; Dangers may bee at once paſt, &amp; forgotten. As <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had not found his hony-comb,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3824:115"/>
if he had not turned aſide to ſee his Lion; ſo we ſhall loſe the comfort of Gods benefits, if we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our perills by meditation.</p>
                     <p>Leaſt any thing ſhould befall <hi>Sampſon,</hi> wherein is not ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his Lion doth more amaze him dead, then aliue; For loe, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe is made an Hiue; &amp; the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of death, is turned into the ſweetneſs of hony. The Bee, a nice &amp; dainty creature, builds her cells in an vnſauory carcaſſe; the carcaſs that promiſed nothing but ſtrength, and annoyance, now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers comfort &amp; refreſhing; and in a ſort, payes <hi>Sampſon</hi> for the wrong offered. Oh the wonderfull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our GOD, that can change our terrors into pleaſure, and can
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3824:116"/>
make the greateſt euils benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all! Is any man, by his humiliation vnder the hand of GOD, growne more faithfull, and conſcionable? there is hony out of the Lion. Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man by his temptation or fall become more circumſpect? there alſo is hony out of the Lion: there is no <hi>Sampſon</hi> to whom euery Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dooth not yeeld hony: Euerie Chriſtian is the better for his euils; yea, Satan himſelfe, in his exerciſe of Gods children, aduantageth them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sampſon</hi> doth not diſdaine theſe ſweets, becauſe he finds them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly layd; His diet was ſtrict, and forbad him any thing that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour'd of legall impurity; yet hee eates the hony-combe out of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3824:116"/>
belly of a dead beaſt; Good may not be refuſed, becauſe the means are accidentally euil; Hony is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtill, tho in a dead Lion. Thoſe are leſſe wiſe, and more ſcrupulous then <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which abhorre the graces of God, becauſe they finde them in ill veſſels: One cares not for the Preachers true doctrine, becauſe his life is euill; Another will not take a good receit from the hand of a Phyſitian, becauſe he is giuen to vnlawfull ſtudies; A 3<hi rend="sup">d,</hi> wil not receiue a deſerued contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution from the hands of a Vſurer. It is a weak neglect not to take the hony, becauſe we hate the Lion: Gods children haue right to their fathers bleſsings, whereſoeuer they finde them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:3824:117"/>
The match is now made; <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (tho a Nazarite) hath both a wedding, and afeaſt; God neuer miſliked moderate ſolemnities in the ſeuereſt life; and yet this Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall-feaſt was long, the ſpace of ſeuen daies. If <hi>Sampſon</hi> had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the beſt Iſraelite, this celebration had been no greater; neither had this perhaps been ſo long, if the cuſtome of the place had not required it. Now I doe not heare him pleade his Nazari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for a colour of ſingularitie: It is both lawfull and fit, in things not prohibited, to conforme our ſelues to the manners and rites of thoſe with whom we liue.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Sampſon</hi> might think it an honour to match with the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3824:117"/>
hee whom before the Lion found alone, is now accompanied with thirty attendants; They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them companions, but they meant them for ſpies: The curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the world are hollow and and thankleſſe; neither doth it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer purpoſe ſo ill, as when it ſhowes faireſt. None are ſo neere to danger, as thoſe whom it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with ſmiles; whiles it frownes, wee knowe what to truſt to; but the fauours of it are worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feares &amp; ſuſpicion: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen defiance is better then falſe loue.</p>
                     <p>Auſteritie had not made <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> vnciuill; hee knowes how to entertaine Philiſtims with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall familiaritie: And that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3824:118"/>
parts might be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued anſwerable to his armes, hee will firſt try maiſteries of wit, and ſet their braines on worke vvith harmleſs thoughts; His riddle ſhal appoſe them, and a deepe wager ſhall hinde the ſolution; Thirtie ſhirts, and thirty ſutes of raymem; neither their loſſe, nor their gaine could be much, beſides the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beeing diuided vnto thirtie partners: but <hi>Sampſons</hi> muſt needs bee both waies very large, vvho muſt giue or receiue thirty alone. The ſeauen dayes of the feaſt are expiring, and yet they which had been all this while deuouring of <hi>Sampſons</hi> meat, cannot tell who that cater ſhould be from whence meat ſhold come. In courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſtrong feeder takes-in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3824:118"/>
meat, and ſends out filthineſs; but, that meat and ſweetneſſe ſhould come from a deuouring ſtomack, was beyond their apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>And as fooles and dogges vſe to beginne in ieſt, and end in earneſt, ſo did theſe Philiſtims; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they force the Bride to intice her husband to betray himſelfe. Couetouſnes &amp; Pride haue made them impatient of loſs: and now they threat to fire her, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, for recompence of their entertainment, rather then they will loſe a ſmall wager to an Iſraelite. Some-what of kinne to theſe ſauage Philiſtims, are thoſe cholerick Gameſters, which if the dice bee not their friend, fall out with GOD, curſe (that which is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3824:119"/>
not) Fortune; ſtrike their fellowes, and are ready to take vengeance vpon themſelues: Thoſe men are vnfit for ſport, that loſe their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence together with their wager.</p>
                     <p>I do not wonder that a Philiſtim woman loued herſelfe and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers family, more then an Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Bride-groome; and if ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed teares vpon her husband, for the ranſome of them. <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelfe taught her this difference, <hi>I haue not told it my father or my mother, and ſhould I tell it thee?</hi> If ſhe had not been as ſhee was, fhee had neither done this to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> nor heard this from him; Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall reſpects are dearer then naturall; It was the law of him that ordained marriage (before euer
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3824:119"/>
Parents were) that Parents ſhould bee forſaken, for the husband or wife: But now, Iſraelitiſh Parents are woorthy of more intireneſſe, then a wife of the Philiſtims; And yet, whom the Lion could not conquer, the teares of a woman haue conquered. <hi>Sampſon</hi> neuer bewrayed infirmitie but in vxori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes; What aſſurance can there be of him that hath a Philiſtim in his boſome? <hi>Adam,</hi> the perfecteſt man, <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the ſtrongeſt man, <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt man, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed with the flattery of their helpers. As there is no comfort comparable to a faithfull yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, ſo wo be to him that is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a Philiſtim.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:3824:120"/>
It could not but much diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to ſee that his aduerſaries had plowed with his heifer, &amp; that vpon his own back; now therfore hee payes his wager to their coſt. <hi>Aſcalon</hi> the Citie of the Philiſtims is his wardrobe, he fetches thence thirty ſutes, lined with the liues of the owners: Hee might vvith as much eaſe haue ſlaine theſe thirtie companions, which were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this euill; but his promiſe forbad him whiles he was to clothe their bodies, to vnclothe their ſoules; and that ſpirit of GOD, which ſtird him vp to reuenge, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him in the choice of the ſubiects. If we wonder to ſee thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie throates cut for their ſutes, wee may eaſily know, that this was but the occaſion of that ſlaughter,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3824:120"/>
whereof the cauſe was their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, and tyranny. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſlew two hundred Philiſtims for their fore-skinnes: but the ground of his act was their hoſtilitie.

If the Philiſtims had not bin as much enemies to God, as to <hi>Sampſon;</hi> enemies to Iſrael in their oppreſsion, no leſſe then to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> in this particular iniurie, that purpoſe and execution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, had been no better then wicked: Now he to whom venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongs, ſets him on worke, and makes the act iuſtice: when he commaunds, euen very crueltie is obedience.</p>

It was a buſie and troubleſome proiect of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to vſe the foxes for his reuenge: for not without great labour &amp; many hands could ſo many wilde creatures be gotte together, neither could the wit of <hi>Sampſon</hi> want other deuiſes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie; But he meant to finde out ſuch a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as might in ſom ſort anſwere the offence, &amp; might imply as much contempt, as treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. By wiles, ſeconded with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, had they wronged <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in extorting his ſecret, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his wife: &amp; what other Embleme could theſe foxes tied together preſent vnto them, then wilineſs combined by force, to worke miſchiefe?</p>

Theſe foxes deſtroy their corn, before he which ſent them, deſtroy the perſons. Thoſe iudgements which beginne in outward things, end in the owners; A ſtranger that had been of neither ſide, vvould haue ſaid, What pitty it is to ſee good corn thus ſpoiled: If the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature be conſidered apart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the owners, it is good; and therefore if it be miſ-ſpent, the abuſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects vpon the maker of it; but if it be looked vpon, with reſpect to an ill maſter, the beſt vſe of it, is to periſh. He therefore that ſlew the Egyptian cattell with murrain, &amp; ſmote their fruit with haile-ſtones; hee that conſumed the vines of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael with the Palmer-worme, and Caterpiller, and Canker-worme; ſent alſo foxes by the hand of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3824:125"/>
                        <hi>Sampſon,</hi> into the fields of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims. Their corne was too good for them to enioy, not too good for the foxes to burn vp; God had rather his creature ſhould periſh any way, then ſerue for the luſt of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>There could not be ſuch ſecrecy in the catching of three hundred foxes, but it might well be knowne who had procured them: Rumor will ſwiftly fly of things not done: but of a thing ſo notoriouſly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, it is no maruell if Fame be a blab. The mention of the offence drawes in the prouocation: &amp; now the wrong to <hi>Sampſon</hi> is ſcanned &amp; reuenged; Becauſe the fieldes of the Philiſtims, are burned for the wrong done to <hi>Sampſon</hi> by the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3824:125"/>
                        <hi>Timnite</hi> in his daughter, therefore the Philiſtims burne the <hi>Timnite</hi> &amp; his daughter. The tying of the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand between two foxes, was not ſo witty a policy, as the ſetting of a fire of diſſenſion betwixt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims: What need <hi>Sampſon</hi> be his owne executioner, when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will vndertake that charge? There can be no more pleaſing proſpect to an Iſraelite, then to ſee the Philiſtims together by the eares.</p>
                     <p>If the vvife of <hi>Sampſon</hi> had not feared the fire for herſelfe, and her fathers houſe, ſhe had not betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her husband, her husband had not thus plagued the Philiſtims, the Philiſtims had not conſumed her and her father with fire: now ſhee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3824:126"/>
leapes into that flame which ſhee meant to auoid. That euill which the wicked feared, meets them in their flight: How many in a feare of pouerty, ſeeke to gaine vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably, and die beggers? How many to ſhunne paine and danger haue yeelded to euill, and in the long runne haue been met in the teeth with that miſchiefe which they had hoped to haue left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them? How many, in a deſire to eſchue the ſhame of men, haue fallen into the confuſion of God? Both good and euill are ſure pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters at the laſt.</p>
                     <p>Hee that was ſo ſoone pacified towards his wife, could not but haue thought this reuenge more then enough, if he had not rather
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3824:126"/>
wielded Gods quarrell then his owne; He knew that GOD had raiſed him vp on purpoſe, to be a ſcourge to the Philiſtims, whom as yet he had angred more then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: As if theſe therefore had been but floriſhes before the fray, he ſtirres vp his courage, &amp; ſtrikes them both hip and thigh, vvith a mighty plague. That God vvhich can do nothing imperfecty, where he begins either mercy or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not leaue till hee haue happily finiſhed: As it is in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, ſo in his puniſhments; One ſtroke drawes on another.</p>
                     <p>The Iſraelites were but ſlaues, &amp; the Philiſtims were their maſters: ſo much more indignely threfore muſt they needs take it, to be thus
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3824:127"/>
affronted by one of their owne vaſſals: yet ſhall we commend the moderation of theſe Pagans; <hi>Sampſon,</hi> beeing not mortally wronged by one Philiſtim, falls foule vpon the whole Nation; the Philiſtims hainouſly offended by <hi>Sampſon,</hi> doe not fall vpon the whole Tribe of Iudah, but being muſtered together, call to them for ſatisfaction from the perſon offending: the ſame hand of God which wrought <hi>Sampſon</hi> to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, reſtrained them from it; It is no thanke to themſelues, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wicked men cannot bee cruell.</p>
                     <p>The men of Iudah, are by their fear made friends to their Tyrans, &amp; traytors to their friend; it was in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3824:127"/>
their cauſe that <hi>Sampſon</hi> had ſhed bloud, and yet they conſpire with <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he Philiſtims, to deſtroy their own fleſh and bloud. So ſhal the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims be quit with Iſrael, that as <hi>Sampſon</hi> by Philiſtims, reuenged himſelf of Philiſtims; ſo they of an Iſraelite, by the hand of Iſraelites. That which open enemies dare not attempt, they worke by falſe brethren; and theſe are ſo much more perilous, as they are more entire.</p>
                     <p>It had been no leſſe eaſie for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to haue ſlaine thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Iudah that came to binde him, then thoſe other of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, that meant to kill him bound: And what if he had ſaid; Are yee turnd Traytors to your
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3824:128"/>
Deliuerer? your bloud bee vpon your owne heads. But the ſpirit of God (without whom he could not kill either beaſt, or man) would neuer ſtirre him vp to kill his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, tho degenerated into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims; they haue more power to binde him, then hee to kill them: Iſraelitiſh bloud was precious to him, that made no more ſcruple of killing a Philiſtim, then a Lion: That bondage and vſury that was allowed to a Iew from a Pagan, might not bee exacted from a Iew.</p>
                     <p>The Philiſtims that had before plowed with <hi>Sampſons</hi> heifer in the caſe of the Riddle, are now plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a worſe furrow with an heifer more his owne. I am aſhamed to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3824:128"/>
heare theſe cowardly Iewes ſay, <hi>Knowſt thou not that the Philiſtims are Lords ouer vs? Why haſt thou done thus vnto vs? We are therefore come to binde thee:</hi> Whereas they ſhould haue ſaid; Wee find theſe tyrannicall Philiſtims to vſurp do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer vs; thou haſt happily begun to ſhake off their yoke, and now wee are come to ſecond thee with our ſeruice; the valor of ſuch a Captain ſhall eaſily lead vs forth to liberty; We are ready either to die with thee, or to be freed by thee: A fearefull man can neuer be a true friend; rather then incur any danger, hee will be falſe to his owne ſoule. Oh cruell mercie of theſe men of Iuda! <hi>We will not kill thee, but we will bind thee, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee to the hands of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3824:129"/>
that they may kill thee.</hi> As if it had not been much worſe to die an ignominious and tormenting death, by the hands of Philiſtims, then to bee at once diſpatcht by them, which wiſht either his life ſafe, or his death eaſie.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> was purſued by the Philiſtims vpon the mountaines of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> he could ſay to his Armor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, Draw forth thy ſword, and kill mee, leaſt the vncircumciſed come and thruſt me thorough, &amp; mock mee; and at laſt, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall vpon his own ſword, then theirs: And yet theſe coſins of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> can ſay, <hi>Wee will not kill thee, but we will bind thee, &amp; deliuer thee.</hi> It was no excuſe to theſe Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, that <hi>Sampſons</hi> binding had
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3824:129"/>
more hope, then his death; It was more in the extraordinary mercie of God, then their will, that he was not tyed with his laſt bonds: Such is the goodneſs of the Almightie, that he turnes the cruell intentions of wicked men to an aduantage.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Iewes that might haue let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues looſe from their owne bondage, are binding their Deliuerer, whom yet they knew able to haue reſiſted. In the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtrength, there is vſe of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; There was more fortitude in this ſuffering, then in his former actions; <hi>Sampſon</hi> abides to be tied by his owne countrymen, that hee may haue the glory of freeing him ſelfe victoriouſly. Euen ſo, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, our better Nazarite, thou
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3824:130"/>
which couldſt haue called to thy Father, and haue had twelue legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels for thy reſcue, wouldſt be bound voluntarily, that thou mightſt triumph; So the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyrs were racked, &amp; would not be loſed, becauſe they expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a better reſurrection: If we be not as well ready to ſuffer ill, as to doe good, wee are not fit for the conſecration of God.</p>
                     <p>To ſee <hi>Sampſon</hi> thus ſtrongly manicled, and expoſed to their full reuenge, could not but bee a glad ſpectacle to theſe Philiſtims; &amp; their ioy was ſo full, that it could not but flie forth of their mouthes in ſhouting and laughter; whom they ſaw looſe with terror, it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee bound. Is is the ſport of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3824:130"/>
the ſpirituall Philiſtims, to ſee any of Gods Nazarites fettered with the cords of iniquitie; and their Imps are ready to ſay, Aha, ſo would wee haue it. But the euent anſwers their falſe ioy, with that clauſe of triumph, <hi>Reioyce not ouer me, O mine enemy: tho J fall, yet I ſhall riſe againe.</hi> How ſoone vvas the countenance of theſe Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims changed, and their ſhouts turn'd into ſhriekings? <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord came vpon Sampſon,</hi> and then, what are cords to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? His new bonds are as flax burnt with fire; and he rouzes vp himſelfe, like that young Lion whom he firſt incountred, &amp; flyes vpon thoſe cowardly aduerſaries, who if they had not ſeen his cords, durſt not haue ſeene his face. If
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3824:131"/>
they had been ſo many diuels, as men, they could not haue ſtood before that ſpirit, which lifted vp the hart &amp; hand of <hi>Sampſon.</hi> Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men neuer ſee fairer proſpect, then when they are vpon the verie threſhold of deſtruction; Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Ruine, are ſo cloſe borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon each other, that where we ſee the face of the one, we may be ſure the other is at his backe. Thus didſt thou, O bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when thou wert faſtned to the Croſſe, when thou layeſt bound in the graue with the cords of death; thus didſt thou miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe vp thy ſelfe, and vanquiſh thine enemies, and lead captiuitie captiue; Thus do all thy holy ones when they ſeem moſt forſaken, &amp; laid open to the inſultation of the

world, finde thy ſpirit mightie to their deliuerance, and the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture of their malicious aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe three thouſand Iſraelites were not ſo ill aduiſed, as to come vp into the rock vnweaponed, to apprehend <hi>Sampſon; Sampſon</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might haue had his choice of ſwords, or ſpeares, for this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with the Philiſtims; yet hee leaues all the munition of Iſrael, &amp; finding the new iaw-bone of an Aſſe, takes that vp in his hand, and with that baſe inſtrument of death, ſends 1000 Philiſtimes to their place. All the ſwords and ſhields of the armed Philiſtims, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that contemptible Engine, which hath novv left a thouſand

bodies, as dead as the carcaſſe of that beaſt, whoſe bone it was. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arme: it was in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which moued the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in the arme. O God, if the meanes bee weake, yet thou art ſtrong: Through God we ſhal do great acts; Yea, I can do all things through him that ſtrengtheneth me.

                     <p>It is no maruell, if he were thus admirably ſtrong, and victorious, whoſe bodily ſtrength God meant to make a type of the ſpirituall power of Chriſt: And behold, as

the three thouſands of Iuda ſtood ſtill gazing with their weapons in their hands, while <hi>Sampſon</hi> alone ſubdued the Philiſtims; ſo did men and Angels ſtand looking vpon the glorious atchieuements of the Sonne of God, who might iuſtlie ſay, <hi>I haue trode the wine-preſse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Both the <hi>Sampſons</hi> complained of thirſt; The ſame GOD which gaue his Champion victory, gaue him alſo refreſhing; and by the ſame meanes; The ſame bone yeelds him both conqueſt, &amp; life; and is of a weapon of offence, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a vvell of water: He that fetcht water out of the flint for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, fetches it out of a bone for <hi>Sampſon.</hi> What is not poſsible to

                     <p>As an hood-winkt man ſees ſom little glimmering of light, but not enough to guide him; ſo did <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who had reaſon enough left him to make triall of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> by a crafty miſ-information; but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

It is not ſo great wiſedom to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom wee diſtruſt, as it is folly to truſt them whom wee haue found tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous: Thriſe had he ſeene the Philiſtims in her chamber, ready to ſuſpriſe him, vpon her bonds; and yet will needs be a ſlaue to his Traytor. Warning not taken, is a certaine preſage of deſtruction; and if once neglected it receiue pardon, yet thriſe is deſperate.</p>
                     <p>VVhat man would euer play thus with his owne ruine? His har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot bindes him, and calls-in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners to cut his throat; hee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3824:138"/>
riſes to ſaue his owne life, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to carry away theirs, in peace. Where is the courage of <hi>Sampſon?</hi> Where his zeale? Hee that killed the Philiſtims for their clothes; Hee that ſlew a thouſand of them in the field at once; in this quarrell, now ſuffers them in his chamber vnreuenged. Whence is this? His hands were ſtrong, but his hart was effeminate; his harlot had diuerted his affection. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſlackens the raines to his ſenſuall appetite, ſhall ſoone grow vnfitte for the calling of GOD. <hi>Sampſon</hi> hath broke the greene withies, the new ropes, the woofe of his haire, &amp; yet ſtill ſuffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fettered with thoſe inuiſible bonds of an harlots loue; and can indure her to ſay, <hi>How canst thou
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3824:139"/>
ſay, I loue thee, when thy hart is not with mee; thou haſt mocked me theſe three times:</hi> Wheras he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue ſaid to her; How canſt thou challenge any loue from me, that haſt this thriſe ſought my life? Or canſt thou thinke my mocks a ſufficient reuenge of this treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? But contrarily, he melts at this fire; and by her importunate inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, is wrought againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Wearineſſe of ſolicitation, hath won ſome to thoſe actions, which at the firſt motion they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; like as wee ſee ſome ſutors are diſpatcht, not for the equity of the cauſe, but the trouble of the proſccution; becauſe it is more eaſie to yeelde, not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. It is more ſafe to keepe our ſelues out of the noyſe of ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3824:139"/>
then to ſtand vpon our power of deniall.</p>
                     <p>Who can pitty the loſſe of that ſtrength which was ſo abuſed? who can pitty him the loſs of his locks, which after ſo many warnings can ſleepe in the lappe of <hi>Dalilah?</hi> It is but iuſt that he ſhould riſe vp from thence, ſhauen and feeble; not a Nazarite, ſcarce a man. If his ſtrength had lyen in his hair, it had been out of himſelfe; it was not therefore in his locks, it was in his conſecration, whereof that haire was a ſigne. If the razor had come ſooner vpon his head, he had cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a Nazarite; and the gift of God had at once ceaſed, vvith the calling of GOD; not for the want of that excretion, but for the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3824:140"/>
want of obedience. If God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe his graces, when hee is too much prouoked, who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his mercie? He that ſleeps in ſin, muſt looke to wake in loſſe, and weakeneſs. Could <hi>Sampſon</hi> thinke, Though I tell her my ſtrength lies in my haire, yet ſhee will not cut it; or though ſhee doe cut my haire, yet ſhal I not loſe my ſtrength; that now hee riſes and ſhakes himſelfe in hope of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vigor? Cuſtome of ſucceſſe, makes men confident in their ſins, and cauſes them to miſtake an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary tenure for a perpetuity.</p>
                     <p>His eyes were the firſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which betrayed him to luſt: and now they are firſt pull'd out; and he is ledde a blind captiue to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3824:140"/>
                        <hi>Azzah,</hi> where hee was firſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to his luſt. The <hi>Azzahites,</hi> which lately ſaw him not without terror, running lightly away with their gates at mid-night, ſee him now in his owne perpetuall night, ſtruggling with his chaines: and that he may not want paine, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his bondage, hee muſt grind in his priſon.</p>
                     <p>As hee paſſed the ſtreet, euery boy of the Philiſtims could throw ſtones at him, euery woman could laugh, and ſhout at him; and what one Philiſtim doth not ſay, whiles he laſhes him vnto bloud, There is for my brother, or my kinſman, whom thou ſleweſt. Who can look to runne away with a ſinne, when <hi>Sampſon</hi> a Nazarite is thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued?
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3824:141"/>
This great hart could not but haue broken with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it had not pacified it ſelfe with the conſcience of the iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of all this vengeance.</p>
                     <p>It is better for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to bee blinde in priſon, then to abuſe his eyes in <hi>Sorek:</hi> yea, I may ſafelie ſay, hee was more blinde when he ſaw licentiouſly, then now, that hee ſees not; Hee was a greater ſlaue when hee ſerued his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then now in grinding for the Philiſtims. The loſſe of his eyes ſhowes him his ſin; neither could hee ſee how ill hee had done, till hee ſaw not.</p>
                     <p>Euen yet, ſtill the God of mercy lookt vpon the blindneſs of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:3824:141"/>
and in theſe fetters enlargeth his heart from the worſe priſon of his ſinne; His haire grew together with his repentance, &amp; his ſtrength with his haire. Gods merciful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations of his owne, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſeuere, that they ſeeme to differ little from deſertions; yet at the worſt, he loues vs bleeding: &amp; when we haue ſmarted enough, wee ſhall feele it.</p>
                     <p>VVhat thankfull Idolaters were theſe Philiſtims? They could not but knowe, that their bribes, and their <hi>Dalilah,</hi> had deliuer'd <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to them, and yet they ſacrifice to their <hi>Dagon;</hi> and, as thoſe that would be liberall in caſting fauors vpon a ſenſeleſſe Idol (of vvhom they could receiue none) they cry
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3824:142"/>
out, <hi>Our God hath deliuered our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy into our hands.</hi> Where vvas their <hi>Dagon,</hi> when a thouſand of his clients were ſlaine with an aſſes iaw? There was more ſtrength in that bone, then in all the makers of this God; and yet theſe vaine Pagans ſay, <hi>Our God.</hi> It is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Superſtition to miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret all euents, and to feed it ſelfe with the conceit of thoſe fauours, which are ſo farre from beeing done, that their Authors neuer were. Why doe not we learn zeale of Idolaters? And if they be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their deliuerances to a falſe deitie; how cheerefully ſhould we aſcribe ours to the true? O God, whatſoeuer be the meanes, thou art the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our ſucceſſe: Oh that

                     <p>No Muſician would ſerue for this feaſt, but <hi>Sampſon;</hi> hee muſt now bee their ſport, which was once their terror; that hee might want no ſorrow, ſcorne is added to his miſerie: Euery wit, and hand playes vpon him; Who is not readie to caſt his bone, and his ieſt at ſuch a captiue? So as doubtleſſe hee wiſht himſelfe no leſſe deafe, then blinde, and that his ſoule might haue gone out with his eyes. Oppreſsion is able to make a wiſe man mad: and the greater the courage is, the more painfull the inſultation.</p>

Now <hi>Sampſon</hi> is puniſhed, ſhall the Philiſtims eſcape? If the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God beginne at his own, what ſhall becom of his enemies? This aduantage ſhal <hi>Sampſon</hi> make of their tyranny, that now death is no puniſhment to him, his ſoule ſhall flie foorth in this bitterneſſe, without pain; &amp; that his dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge ſhal be no leſs ſweet to him, then the liberty of his former life: He could not but feel God mockt through him; and therfore whiles they are ſcoffing, hee prayes; his ſeriouſneſs hopes to pay them for all thoſe ieſts. If he could haue bin thus earneſt with God, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, the Philiſtims had vvanted this laughing ſtock: No deuotion is ſo feruent, as that which ariſes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extremity; <hi>O Lord God, I pray
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3824:143"/>
thee think vpon me; O God I beſeech thee ſtrengthen mee at this time onely.</hi> Tho <hi>Sampſons</hi> haire were ſhorter, yet he knew Gods hand was not; as one therefore that had yet eyes <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ow to ſee him that was inuiſible, and whoſe faith was recouered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſtrength, hee ſues to that God, which was a party in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, for power to reuenge his wrongs, more then his owne: It is zeale that moues him, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; his renued faith tells him, that he was deſtin'd to plague the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims: &amp; reaſon tells him, that his blindnes puts him out of the hope of ſuch another oportunity. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, that this play of the Philiſtims muſt end in his death, he recollects all the forces of his ſoule and body, that his death may be a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3824:144"/>
puniſhment in ſteed of a diſport; and that his ſoule may bee more victorious in the parting, then in the animation: and ſo addreſſes himſelfe both to die, and kill; as one, whoſe ſoule ſhall not feele his own diſſolution, whiles it ſhal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo many thouſand Philiſtims with it to the pit. All the acts of <hi>Sampſon</hi> are for wonder, not for imitation: So didſt thou, O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour, our better <hi>Sampſon,</hi> conquer in dying; and triumphing vpon the charriot of the Croſſe, didſt lead captiuity captiue; The law, ſin, death, hell, had neuer bin vanquiſht, but by thy death; All our life, liberty, and glory, ſprings out of thy moſt precious bloud.</p>

                     <p>Neither yet was <hi>Micha</hi> more ſtriken with his mothers curſes, then with the conſcience of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: ſo ſoone as he findes there was a purpoſe of deuotion in this treaſure, he dares not conceale it, to the preiudice (as he thought) of GOD, more then of his mother.

                     <p>I doubt not but this ſiluer, and this ſuperſtition came out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, together with the mother of <hi>Micha.</hi> This hiſtory is not ſo late in time, as in place; for the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> was not yet ſetled in that firſt diuiſion of the promiſed land; ſo as this old woman had ſeen both the Idolatry of Egypt, &amp; the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

that thou canſt not ſee rebellion in euery of theſe actions, yea in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery circumſtance, rebellion? What, more Gods then one? An houſe of Gods, beſide Gods houſe?

action, and reſts it ſelfe vpon thoſe grounds, which afterward it ſees cauſe to condemne. It is a ſure way therfore to informe our ſelues throughly ere we ſettle our choice, that wee be not driuen to reuerſe our acts with late ſhame, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now did <hi>Micha</hi> beginne to ſee ſome little glimpſe of his own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; He ſaw his Prieſthood faultie, he ſaw not the faults of his Ephod, of his Images, of his Gods, &amp; yet (as if he thought all had been well, when hee had amended one) hee ſayes, <hi>Now I know the Lord will be good to mee.</hi> The carnall hart plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelfe with an outward forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; and ſo delights to flatter it ſelfe, as that it thinks, if one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance

be right, nothing can be amiſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at this time extremely corrupted; yet the ſpyes of the <hi>Danites</hi> had taken notice euen of this young Leuite, and are glad to make vſe of his Prieſthood. If they had but gone vp to <hi>Shilo,</hi> they might haue conſulted with the Arke of God: but worldly minds are not curious in their holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices; If they haue a God, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod, a Prieſt, it ſuffices them; They had rather inioy a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with eaſe, then to take paines for the true: Thoſe that are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their diet, in their purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in their attire, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, yet in Gods buſineſſes are very indifferent.</p>

The author of lyes ſometimes ſpeakes truth for an aduantage: &amp; from his mouth, this flattering Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite ſpeakes what he knew would pleaſe, not what hee knew would fall out; The euent anſwers his prediction, and now the ſpyes magnifie him to their fellowes: <hi>Michaes</hi> Idol is a God, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite is his Oracle. In matter of iudgement, to be guided onely by the euent, is the way to error; Falſhood ſhall be truth, and Satan an Angell of light, if we follow this rule; Euen very coniectures ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen right; A Prophet, or Dreamer may giue a true ſigne, or wonder, and yet himſelfe ſay, Let vs goe after other Gods. A ſmall thing can winne credite with weake mindes, which where they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3824:153"/>
haue once ſped, cannot diſtruſt.</p>
                     <p>The idolatrous <hi>Danites</hi> are ſo beſotted with this ſucceſs, that they wil rather ſteale, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> want the gods of <hi>Micha;</hi> and becauſe the Gods without the Prieſt can doe them leſſe ſeruice, then the Prieſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gods, therfore they ſteale the Prieſt with the gods. O miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iſraelites! that could think that a God, which could be ſtoln; that could looke for protection from that, which could not keep it ſelfe from ſtealing; which was won by their theft, not their deuotion: Could they worſhip thoſe Idols more deuoutly then <hi>Micha</hi> that made them? And if they could not protect their maker from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, how ſhall they protect their theeues? If it had been the holie
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3824:153"/>
Arke of the true God, how could they thinke it would bleſſe their violence, or that it wold abide to be tranſlated by rapine, and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Now their ſuperſtition hath made them mad vpon a God, they muſt haue him; by what meanes they care not, tho they offend the true God, by ſtealing a falſe. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge is fit to be the firſt ſeruice of an Idol. The ſpyes of <hi>Dan</hi> had bin curteouſly intertained by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha:</hi> thus they reward his hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. It is no truſting the honeſtie of Idolaters: if they haue once caſt off the true God, whom will they reſpect?</p>
                     <p>It ſeemes, Leuites did not more vvant maintenance, then Iſrael wanted Leuites; Heere was a tribe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3824:154"/>
of Iſrael without a ſpirituall guide. The with-drawing of due meanes, is the way to the vtter deſolation of the Church; Rare offerings make cold Altars. There needed ſmall force to draw this Leuite to change his charge; <hi>Hold thy peace, and come, &amp; be our father, &amp; Prieſt; Whether is it better, &amp;c.</hi> Heere is not patience, but ioy; Hee that was won with tenne ſhekels, may be loſt with eleuen: When main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and honour calls him, he goes vndriuen; and rather ſteales himſelfe away, then is ſtoln. The Leuite had too many Gods, to make conſcience of pleaſing one: There is nothing more in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, then a Leuite that ſeekes nothing but himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:3824:154"/>
Thus the wilde fire of Idolatrie, which lay before couched in the priuate ball of <hi>Micha,</hi> now flies fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly through all the Tribe of <hi>Dan;</hi> who (like to Theeues that haue caried away plaguie clothes) haue inſenſibly infected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and their poſteritie, to death: He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and ſuperſtition haue ſmall beginnings, dangerous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, pernicious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions. This contagion is like a canker, which at the firſt is ſcarce viſible; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it eates away the fleſh, and conſumes the body.</p>

                     <p>The law of God allow'd the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite a wife; humane conniuence, a concubine; neither did the Iewiſh concubine differ from a wife, but in ſome outward complements; Both might challenge all the true eſſence of marriage; ſo little vvas the difference, that the father of the concubine, is called the father in law to the Leuite. She whom ill cuſtome had of a wife made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, is now by her luſt, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine made an harlot: Her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, together with the change of her bedde, hath changed her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. Perhaps her owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thruſt her out of doores, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

the iuſt ſeueritie of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Diſmiſsion was too eaſie a penalty for that which GOD had ſentenced with death: Shee that had deſeru'd to bee abhorred of her husband, ſeekes ſhelter from her father. Why would her father ſuffer his houſe to be defiled with an adultereſſe, tho out of his own loynes? VVhy did hee not rather ſay; VVhat? Dooſt thou looke to finde my houſe an harbour for thy ſinne? Whiles thou wert a wife to thine husband, thou wert a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me; Now, thou art neither; Thou art not mine, I gaue thee to thy husband; Thou art not thy husbands, thou haſt betrayed his bed; Thy filthineſs hath made thee thine owne, and thine adulterers; Goe ſeeke thine entertainement,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3824:159"/>
where thou haſt loſt thine hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie; Thy lewdneſs hath brought a neceſsity of ſhame vpon thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors; How can I countenance thy perſon, and abandon thy ſin? I had rather be a iuſt man, then a kinde father; Get thee home ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thy husband, craue his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſs vpon thy knees, redeem his loue with thy modeſtie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; when his heart is once open to thee, my doores ſhall not be ſhut: In the meane time, know I can be no father to an harlot; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Parents is the refuge of vanitie, the bande of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the bane of children. How eaſily is that Theefe induced to ſteale, that knowes his Receiuer: When the lawleſneſſe of youth knovves vvhere to finde pittie &amp;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3824:159"/>
toleration, vvhat miſchiefe can it forbeare?</p>
                     <p>By how much better this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite was, ſo much more iniurious was the concubines ſinne: What husband would not haue ſaid; She is gone, let ſhame and griefe goe with her, I ſhall finde one no leſs pleaſing, and more faithfull: Or if it be not too much mercy in me to yeeld to a returne, let her that hath offended, ſeeke mee; VVhat more direct way is there to a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued looſeneſſe, then to let her ſee I cannot want her? The good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Leuite caſts off all theſe tearms; and now after 4 moneths abſence, ſends him to ſeek for her, that had runne away from her fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: And now he thinks, She ſind
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3824:160"/>
againſt me: perhaps ſhee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; Perhaps, ſhame and feare haue with-held her from retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Perhaps ſhee will be more loyall, for her ſinne; If her impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie ſhould winne me, halfe the thanks were loſt; but now, my vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie offer of fauour ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her for euer. Loue procures truer ſeruitude then neceſsitie: Mereie becomes well the heart of any man, but moſt of a Leuite. He that had helped to offer ſo manie ſacrifices to God for the multitude of euery Iſraelites ſinnes, ſaw how proportionable it was, that man ſhould not hold one ſinne vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: Hee had ſerued at the Altar to no purpoſe, if hee (whoſe trade was to ſue for mercie) had not at all learned to practice it.</p>

                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:3824:160"/>
And if the reflexion of mercie wrought this in a ſeruant, vvhat ſhall wee expect from him, whoſe eſſence is mercy? O God, wee doe euery day breake the holy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of our loue; Wee proſtitute our ſelues to euery filthy tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then runne, and hide our ſelues in our fathers houſe, the world; If thou didſt not ſeeke vs vp, wee ſhould neuer returne; If thy gracious proffer did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vs, wee ſhould be vncapable of forgiueneſs; It were abundant goodnes in thee to receiue vs, when we ſhold intreat thee: but lo, thou intreateſt vs that we wold receiue thee. How ſhould wee now adore, and imitate thy mercy, ſith there is more reaſon, wee ſhould ſue to each other, then that thou ſhouldſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3824:161"/>
ſue to vs; becauſe we may as well offend, as be offended.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſee the womans father make any meanes for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when remiſsion came home to his doores, no man could entertaine it more thankfully. The nature of many men is forward to accept, and negligent to ſue for; they can ſpend ſecret wiſhes vpon that, which ſhall coſt them no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour.</p>
                     <p>Great is the power of loue, which can in a ſort vndoe euills paſt, if not for the act, yet for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Where true affection was once conceiued, it is eaſily peeced againe, after the ſtrongeſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; Heere needs no tedious
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3824:161"/>
recapitulation of wrongs, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of ſute; The vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are forgotten, their loue is renued; and now the Leuite is not a ſtranger, but a ſonne; By how much more willingly he came, by ſo much more vnwillingly hee is diſmiſſed. The foure moneths ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his daughter is anſwered with foure dayes feaſting; Neither was there ſo much ioy in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wedding feaſt, as in this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he deliuered his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intire; now, deſperate: then he found a ſonne; but now, that ſonne hath found his loſt daughter, and he found both: The recouerie of any good, is farre more pleaſant then the continuance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:3824:162"/>
Little doe we knowe what euill is towards vs; Now did this old man, and this reſtored couple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelues all ioy, &amp; content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this vnkind ſtorm; and ſaid in themſelues, Now we begin to liue: And now this feaſt, which was meant for their new nuptialls, prooues her funerall. Euen when wee let our ſelues looſeſt to our pleaſures, the hand of God (thogh inuiſibly) is writing bitter things againſt vs: ſith we are not worthie to know, it is wiſedome to ſuſpect the worſt, whilſt it is leaſt ſeene.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it falls out, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more iniurious then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; If this old man had thruſt his ſonne and daughter early out of doores, they had auoyded this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3824:162"/>
miſchiefe; now, his louing impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity detaines them to their hurt, and his owne repentance. Such contentment doth ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on find in the preſence of thoſe we loue, that death it ſelfe hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, but departing; The greateſt comfort of our life, is the fruition of friendſhip, the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, is the greateſt paine of death: As all earthly pleaſures, ſo this of loue, is diſtaſted with a neceſsitie of leauing. How wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is that onely loue to take vp our harts, which is not open to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger of interruption; which ſhall out-liue the date euen of faith and hope, and is as eternall, as that GOD, and thoſe bleſſed ſpirits whom we loue? If we hang neuer ſo importunately vpon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3824:163"/>
ſleeues, and ſhed floods of teares to ſtop their way, yet wee muſt be gone hence; no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no force, ſhall then remooue vs from our fathers houſe.</p>
                     <p>The Leuite is ſtayed beyond his time by importunitie; the motions whereof are boundleſſe, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; one day drawes on another; neither is there any reaſon of this dayes ſtay, which may not ſerue ſtill for to morrow. His reſolution at laſt breaks throgh all thoſe kind hinderances; rather will hee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a benighting, then an vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary delay. It is a good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Leuite makes haſte home; An honeſt mans heart is where his calling is; Such a one, when he is abroade, is like a fiſh in
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3824:163"/>
the ayre; whereinto if it leape for recreation, or neceſsitie, yet it ſoone returns to his own element. This charge, by how much more ſacred it is, ſo much more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance it expecteth; Euen a day breakes ſquare vvith the conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                     <p>The Sunne is ready to lodge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; His ſeruant aduiſes him to ſhorten his iourney, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more fit to truſt an early In of the Iebuſites, then to the mercy of the night. And if that counſell had been followed, perhaps they, which found Iebuſites in Iſrael, might haue found Iſraelites in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> No wiſe man can hold good counſell diſparaged, by the meaneneſſe of the author: If wee
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3824:164"/>
be gladde to receiue any treaſure from our ſeruant, why not preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admonitions?</p>
                     <p>It was the zeale of this Leuite that ſhut him out of <hi>Iebus; We will not lodge in the City of ſtrangers.</hi> The Iebuſites were ſtrangers in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not ſtrangers enough in their habitation; The Leuite wil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue common curteſie from thoſe which were aliens fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, though home-borne in the hart of Iſrael. It is lawfull enough in tearmes of ciuilitie to deale with Infidels; the earth is the Lords, and wee may enioy it in the right of the Owner, while we proteſt againſt the wrong of the Vſurper; yet the leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Gods enemies, the more ſafety. If there were another
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:3824:164"/>
aire to breathe in from theirs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other earth to tread vpon, they ſhould haue their owne: Thoſe that affect a familiar intireneſſe with Iebuſites, in conuerſation, in leagues of amitie, in matrimoniall contracts, bewray either too much boldneſs, or too little conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Hee hath no bloud of an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, that delights to lodge in <hi>Iebus:</hi> It was the fault of Iſrael, that an heatheniſh towne ſtood yet in the nauell of the Tribes, and that <hi>Iebus</hi> was no ſooner turn'd to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Their lenitie and neglect, were guilty of this neighborhood, that now no man can paſſe from Bethlee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iuda, to mount Ephraim, but by the Citie of Iebuſites. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable iuſtice might preuent a

thouſand euills, which afterwards know no remedy but patience.</p>
                     <p>The way was not long betwixt <hi>Iebus</hi> and <hi>Gibeah:</hi> for the Sun was ſtooping when the Leuite was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt the firſt, &amp; is but now declined, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he comes to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

There is no perfume ſo ſweet to a Traueller, as his own ſmoake. Both expectation and feate, doe commonly diſappoint vs; for ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome euer do wee inioy the good we looke for, or ſmart with a feared euill. The poore Leuite could haue found but ſuch entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Iebuſites. Whither
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3824:165"/>
are the poſteritie of Beniamin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, that their <hi>Gibeah</hi> ſhold be no leſſe wicked then populous? The firſt ſigne of a ſettled godleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is, that a Leuite is ſuffered to lie without doores. If God had been in any of their houſes, his ſeruant had not been excluded: Where no reſpect is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gods meſſengers, there can be no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>This good old man of Gibeah, came home late from his work in the fields; the Sunne was ſette ere he gaue ouer; And now, ſeeing this man a ſtranger, an Iſraelite, a Leuite, an Ephraimite, and that in his way to the houſe of GOD, to take vp his lodging in the ſtreet, hee proffers him the kindneſs of his houſe-roome.

As a perplexed Mariner, that in a ſtorme muſt caſt away ſomething, although preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo this good Hoſt, rather will proſtitute his daughter, a virgin, together with the concubine, then this prodigious villany ſhould be offered to a man, much more to a man of God.</p>

The deteſtation of a foule ſinne drew him to ouer-reach in the motion of a leſſer; which if it had been accepted, how could he have eſcaped the partnerſhip of their vncleaneneſſe, and the guilt of his daughters rauiſhment? No man can waſh his hands of that ſinne, to which his will hath yeelded. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily violence may be inoffenſiue in the patient; voluntary inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to euill (tho out of feare) can neuer be excuſable: yet behold this wickedneſſe is too little to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie theſe monſters.</p>
                     <p>Who would haue looked for ſo extreame abhomination from the loynes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the wombe of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Beniamin?</hi> Could the very Iebuſites their neighbors

                     <p>Yet <hi>Lot</hi> ſped ſo much better in <hi>Sodom,</hi> then this Ephraimite did in <hi>Gibeah,</hi> by how much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſts hee entertained.

Oh the iuſt and euen courſe which the Almightie Iudge of the world holds in all his retributions! This woman had ſhamed the bed of a Leuite, by her former wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe; ſhee had thus farre gone ſmoothly away with her ſinne; her father harbourd her, her husband forgaue her, her owne hart found no cauſe to complaine, becauſe ſhee ſmarted not: now, vvhen the world had forgotten her offence, GOD calls her to reckoning and puniſhes her with her owne ſinne. She had voluntarily expoſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to luſt; now is expoſed force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. Adultery was her ſinne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery was her death.

                     <p>Surely, Iſrael had one Tribe too many: all Beniamin is turned into Gibeah, the ſonnes not of Beniamin, but of Belial. The abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of euill, is worſe then the commiſsion; This may bee vpon infirmitie, but that muſt be vpon reſolution: Eaſie puniſhment is too much fauour to ſinne: conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence is much worſe: but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it (and that vnto bloud) is intollerable.

diſpoſitions are hardly drawne to fight for innocence: yet theſe Beniaminites (as if they were in loue with villany, and out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with GOD) will be the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Champions of lewdneſs. How can Gibeah repent them of that wickedneſſe, which all Beniamin will make good; in ſpight of their conſciences? Euen where ſinne is ſuppreſſed, it will riſe; but, where it is incouraged, it inſults &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes.</p>
                     <p>It was more iuſt that Iſrael ſhold riſe againſt Beniamin, then that Beniamin ſhould riſe for Gibeah; by how much it is better to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh offenders, then to ſhelter the offenders from puniſhing; And yet the wickedneſs of Beniamin,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3824:172"/>
ſped better for the time, then the honeſtie of Iſrael; Twiſe was the better part foyled by the leſſe, and worſe; The good cauſe vvas ſent backe with ſhame: the euill retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with victory, and triumph. O GOD! their hand was for thee in the fight, and thy hand was with them in their fall; They had not fought for thee, but by thee; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they haue miſcarried in the fight, if thou hadſt not fought againſt them; Thou art iuſt &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in both. The cauſe was thine: the ſinne in managing of it, vvas their owne; They fought in an holy quarrell, but with confidence in themſelues; for, as preſuming of victorie, they aske of GOD, not what ſhould be their ſucceſs, but who ſhould be their Captaine.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3824:172"/>
Number &amp; innocence made them too ſecure; It was iuſt therefore with GOD, to let them feele, that euen good zeale cannot beare out preſumption: And that victory lyes not in the cauſe, but in the God that ownes it.</p>
                     <p>VVho cannot imagine hovv much the Beniaminites inſulted in their double field, and day? And now beganne to think, God was on their ſide; Thoſe ſwords which had bin taught the way into fortie thouſand bodies of their brethren, cannot feare a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.

The whole earth is the Lords, and in him, ours; It is lawfull for the owners to change their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, at pleaſure; Why ſhould we not make free vſe of any part of our owne poſſeſsions? <hi>Elimelech</hi> and his familie remoue from Bethleem Iuda vnto Moab; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but neceſsitie can diſpenſe with a locall relinquiſhing of Gods Church; Not pleaſure, not profit, not curioſitie; Thoſe which are famiſhed out, God calls, yea driues from thence.

                     <p>It was lawfull for <hi>Elimelech</hi> to make vſe of Pagans, and Idolaters,

                     <p>But I cannot ſee, how it could be lawful for his Sonnes to match with the daughters of Moab; Had theſe men heard how farre,

Yet if their wiues would have left their Idolatrie with their maiden-head, the match had been more ſafe; but now, euen at the laſt farewell, <hi>Naomi</hi> can ſay of <hi>Orpah,</hi> that ſhe is returned to her gods.

The two ſonnes of <hi>Elimelech</hi> are ſwept away childleſſe in the prime of their age, and in ſteed of their ſeed they leaue their carcaſſes in Moab; their wiues widdowes, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther childleſſe, and helpleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Infidels, in that age which moſt needed comfort.

The firſt good newes is, that God hath viſited his people with bread; now therefore, ſince her husband and ſonnes were vnrecouerable, ſhe will try to recouer her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and kinred; If wee can haue the ſame conditions in Iudah, that we haue in Moab, we are no Iſraelites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if wee returne not; Whiles her husband and ſonnes liued, I heare no motion of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring home, now theſe her earthly ſtayes are remoued, ſhee thinks

The next degree vnto goodneſſe is the loue of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: He is in a faire way to grace, that can value it; If ſhe had not been already a proſelite, ſhe could not haue ſet this price vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Naomies</hi> vertue.

                     <p>As ſome tight veſſell that holds out againſt winde and water, ſo did <hi>Ruth</hi> againſt all the powers of a mothers perſwaſions; The

God hath humbled her, deſires not to bee reſpected of men: Thoſe which are truely brought downe, make it not daintie, that the world ſhould thinke them ſo; but are ready to bee the firſt proclaimers of their owne vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

I cannot but admire the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and ſilence of theſe two women; <hi>Naomi</hi> had not ſo much as talked of her kinred in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem, nor till now, had ſhee told <hi>Ruth</hi> that ſhe had a wealthy kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; neither had <hi>Ruth</hi> inquired of her husbands great alliance; but both ſate downe meekly with their owne wants, and cared not to know any thing elſe ſaue that themſelues were poore: Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is euer the way to honor.</p>
                     <p>It is a diſcurteſie where we are beholden, to alter our dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; Like as men of trade take it ill, if cuſtomers which are in their bookes, goe for their wares to another ſhop; Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

doth <hi>Naomi</hi> aduiſe <hi>Ruth</hi> not to bee ſeene in any other field, whiles the harueſt laſted. The very taking of their fauours is a contentment to thoſe that haue already well deſerued; and it is quarrell enough that their curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is not receiued; How ſhall the God of heauen take it, that whiles he giues and proffers largely, wee runne to the world that can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford vs nothing but vanitie and vexation?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that can leaſt act, are oft-times the beſt to aduiſe: Good old <hi>Naomi</hi> ſits ſtill at home, and by her counſell payes <hi>Ruth</hi> all the loue ſhee owes her. The face of that action, to which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3824:197"/>
ſhee directs her, is the worſt peece of it; the heart was ſound; Perhaps, the aſſurance, which long tryall had giuen her of the good gouernment, and firme chaſtitie of her daughter in law, together with her perſwaſion of the religious grauitie of <hi>Boaz,</hi> made her thinke that deſigne ſafe, which to others had been perilous, if not deſperate; But beſides that, holding <hi>Boaz</hi> next of blood to <hi>Elimelech,</hi> ſhee made account of him, as the lawfull husband of <hi>Ruth;</hi> ſo as there wanted nothing but a challenge, and conſummation; Nothing was abated but ſome outward ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, which (tho expedient for the ſatisfaction of others)

                     <p>Theſe times were not delicate; This man (though great in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem) laies him downe to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pallet, in the floore of his barne; when hee awakes at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, no maruell if he were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to finde himſelfe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; yet, though his heart were cheared with wine, the place ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, the night ſilent, the perſon comely, the inuitation plauſible, could hee be drawne to a raſh act of luſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His appetite could not get the victorie of reaſon, tho it had wine and oportunitie to helpe it; Herein <hi>Boaz</hi> ſhowd himſelfe a great maſter of his

                     <p>In ſteed of touching her as a wanton, he bleſſes her as a father, incourageth her as a friend, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth her as a kinſman, rewards her as a patron, &amp; ſends hir away lade with hopes, &amp; gifts, no leſſe chaſte, more happy then ſhee came: Oh admirable temperance worthy the progenitor of him, in whoſe lips and heart was no guile.</p>

If <hi>Boaz</hi> had been the next kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the marriage had needed no protraction, but now that his conſcience told him, that <hi>Ruth</hi> was the right of another, it had not been more ſenſualitie then iniuſtice, to haue touched his kinſwoman; It was not any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily impotencie, but honeſtie and conſcience that reſtrained <hi>Boaz,</hi> for the very next night ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by him; that good man wiſhed his mariage bed holy, and durſt not lye downe in the doubt of a ſinne: Many a man is honeſt out of neceſſitie, and affects the praiſe of that, which hee could not auoide; but that mans minde is ſtill an adulterer, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced continence of his bodie;

                     <p>Thoſe which are fearefull of ſinning, are carefull not to bee thought to ſin; <hi>Boaz,</hi> though he knew himſelfe to be cleare, would not haue occaſion of ſuſpicion giuen to others; <hi>(Let no man know that a woman came into the floore:)</hi> A good heart is no leſſe afraide of a ſcandall, then of a ſin; whereas thoſe that are reſolued not to make any ſcruple of ſin, deſpiſe others conſtructions, not caring whom they offend, ſo that they may pleaſe themſelues.

Wealth ſhe had none, not ſo much as bread, but what ſhe gleaned out of his fielde: Friends ſhe had none, and thoſe ſhe had elſe where, <hi>Moabites;</hi> Beauty ſhe could not haue much, after that ſcorching in her trauell, in her gleanings, Himſelfe tells her what drew his heart to her, <hi>(All the Citie of my people doth know that thou art a vertuous woman:)</hi> Vertue in whomſoeuer it is found, is a great dowry, and where it meetes with an heart that knowes how to value it, is accounted greater riches then all that is hid in the bowels of the earth: The corne heape of <hi>Boaz</hi> was but chaffe to this, &amp; his mony, droſſe.</p>

As a man that had learned to ſquare all his actions to the law of God, <hi>Boaz</hi> proceeds legally with his riuall; and tells him of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Elimelecs</hi> land (which, it is like vpon his remouall to <hi>Moab,</hi> he had alienated;) which he (as the next kinſman) might haue power to redeeme; yet ſo, as he muſt purchaſe the wife of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, with the land; Euery kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not a <hi>Bonz,</hi> the man could liſten to the land, if it had beene free from the clog of a neceſſary marriage; but now he will rather leaue the land, then take the wife; Leaſt, whiles he ſhould preſerue <hi>Elimelecs</hi> inheritance, he ſhould deſtroy his owne; for the next ſeede, which he ſhould haue by

                        <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſhould not be his heire, but his deceaſed kinſmans; How knew he whether God might not by that wife, ſend heires enow for both their eſtates? rather had he therefore incurre a manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, then hazard the danger of his inheritance; The law of God bound him to raiſe vp ſeede to the next in blood; the care of his inheritance drawes him to a neglect of his duty, tho with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and reproch, and now he had rather his face ſhould bee ſpit vpon, and his name ſhould bee called, <hi>The houſe of him whoſe ſhooe was pull'd off,</hi> then to reſerue the honour of him, that did his brother right, to his owne preiudice; How many

                        <hi>Boaz</hi> is glad to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of his refuſall; and holds that ſhooe (which was the ſigne of his tenure) more worth then all the land of <hi>Elimelec.</hi> And whereas other Wiues purchaſe their husbands, with a large dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, this man purchaſeth his wife, at a deare rate, and thinkes his bargaine happy; All the ſubſtance

                     <p>The lights of the Temple were now dim, and almoſt ready to giue place to the morning, when God called <hi>Samuel;</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie perhaps, that thoſe which ſhould haue been the lights of Iſrael, burned no leſſe dimly, and were neere their going out, and ſhould be ſucceeded with one, ſo much more lightſome then they, as the Sunne was more bright then the lampes: God had good leaſure to haue deliuered this meſſage by day, but hee meant to make vſe of <hi>Samuels</hi> miſtaking; and therfore ſo ſpeaks, that <hi>Ely</hi> may bee asked for an anſwer, and perceiue himſelfe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3824:226"/>
both omitted, and cenſured; He that meant to vſe <hi>Samuels</hi> voice to <hi>Ely,</hi> imitates the voice of <hi>Ely</hi> to <hi>Samuel; Samuel</hi> had ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed himſelfe to obedience, and to anſwer the call of <hi>Ely,</hi> that lying in the further cells of the Leuites, hee is eaſily raiſed from his ſleep; and euen in the night runs for his meſſage, to him, who was rather to receiue it from him: Thrice is the old man diſquieted with the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his ſeruant, and, tho vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were rare in his daies, yet is hee not ſo vnacquainted with God, as not to attribute that voyce to him, which himſelfe heard not; Wherefore like a better Tutor then a Parent,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3824:227"/>
he teaches <hi>Samuel</hi> what hee ſhall anſwer, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It might haue pleaſed God at the firſt call to haue deliuered his meſſage to <hi>Samuel,</hi> not expecting the anſwer of a nouice vnſeene in the viſions of a God; yet doth he rather defer it till the fourth ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and will not ſpeake till <hi>Samuel</hi> confeſſed his audience: God loues euer to prepare his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for his imployments, and will not commit his errands, but to thoſe, whom he hath addreſſed both by wonder, and attention, and humilitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ely</hi> knew well the gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3824:227"/>
of God, that where hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a fauour, prorogation could be no hinderance; and therefore after the call of God, thrice anſwered with ſilence, he inſtructs <hi>Samuel</hi> to be ready for the fourth: If <hi>Samuels</hi> ſilence had been wilfull, I doubt whether he had been againe ſolicited; now God doth both pittie his error, and requite his diligence by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling his name at the laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Samuel</hi> had now many yeeres miniſtred before the Lord, but neuer till now heard his voice; and now heares it with much terror; for the firſt word that he heares God ſpeake, is threatning, and that of vengeance to his
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:3824:228"/>
maſter; What were theſe mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but ſo many premonitions to himſelfe that ſhould ſucceed <hi>Ely?</hi> God begins early to ſeaſon their harts with feare, whom he means to make eminent inſtruments of his glory; It is his mercie to make vs witneſſes of the iudgments of others, that wee may be forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ere we haue the occaſions of ſinning.</p>
                     <p>I do not heare God bid <hi>Samuel</hi> deliuer this meſſage to <hi>Ely;</hi> Hee that was but now made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, knowes, that the errands of God intend not ſilence; and that God would not haue ſpoken to him of another, if he had meant the newes ſhould be reſerued to himſelfe: Neither yet did he run
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:3824:228"/>
with open mouth vnto <hi>Ely,</hi> to tell him this viſion, vnasked; No wiſe man will be haſtie to bring ill tidings to the great; rather doth hee ſtay till the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his Maſter ſhould wring it from his vnwillingneſſe; and then, as his concealement ſhowd his loue, ſo his full relation ſhall approue his fidelitie: If the heart of <hi>Ely</hi> had not told him this newes, before God told it <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> hee had neuer been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with <hi>Samuel,</hi> not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it; His conſcience did well preſage that it concerned himſelfe; Guiltineſſe needs no Prophet to aſſure it of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The minde that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled proiecteth terrible things;
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:3824:229"/>
and though it cannot ſingle out the iudgment allotted to it, yet it is in a confuſed expectation of ſome grieuous euill: Surely, <hi>Ely</hi> could not thinke it worſe then it was; The ſentence was fearefull, and ſuch as I wonder the necke, or the heart of old <hi>Ely</hi> could hold out the report of; That God ſweares he will iudge <hi>Elyes</hi> houſe; and that with beggerie, with death, with deſolation; and that the wickednes of his houſe ſhall not be purged with ſacrifice, or offrings for euer; And yet, this which euery Iſraelites eare ſhould tingle to heare of, when it ſhould be done, old <hi>Ely</hi> heares with an vnmoued patience, and humble ſubmiſſion, <hi>It is the Lord, let him
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:3824:229"/>
doe what ſeemeth him good;</hi> Oh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable faith, and more then humane conſtancie and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worthy of the aged preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of Shiloh, worthy of an heart ſacrificed to that God, whoſe iuſtice had refuſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate his ſinne by ſacrifice: If Ely haue been an ill father to his ſonnes, yet he is a good ſonne to God, and is ready to kiſſe the very rod hee ſhall ſmart withall; It is the Lord, whom I haue euer found holy, and iuſt, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and hee cannot but be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Let him doe what ſeemeth him good; for whatſoeuer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to him, cannot but bee good; howſoeuer it ſeemes to me: Euery man can open
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:3824:230"/>
his hand to God while hee bleſſes; but to expoſe our ſelues willingly to the afflicting hand of our maker, and to kneele to him whiles he ſcourges vs, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar only to the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>If euer a good heart could haue freed a man, from temporall puniſhments, Ely muſt needs haue eſcaped; Gods anger was appeaſed by his humble repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but his iuſtice muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; Elyes ſinne and his ſons, was in the eye and mouth of all Iſrael, his glorie therefore ſhould haue been much wronged by their impunitie: Who would not haue made theſe ſpirituall guides an example of lawleſnes?
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:3824:230"/>
and haue ſaid; What care I how I liue, if Elyes ſonnes goe away vnpuniſhed? As not the teares of Ely, ſo not the words of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel may fall to the ground; Wee may not meaſure the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God by his ſtripes; many times, after the remiſſion of the ſinne, the very chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Almightie are dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; No repentance can aſſure vs that wee ſhall not ſmart with outward afflictions: That, can preuent the eternall diſpleaſure of God; but ſtill it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and good wee ſhould be corrected: Our care and ſuite muſt be, that the euills which ſhall not be auerted, may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>

                        <pb n="454" facs="tcp:3824:231"/>
If the prediction of theſe euils were fearefull, what ſhall the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution be? The preſumption of the ill-taught <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall giue occaſion to this iudgement; for being ſmitten before the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims,</hi> they ſend for the Arke into the field; Who gaue them authority to commaund the Arke of God at their pleaſure? Here was no conſulting with the Arke, which they would fetch; no inquiry of <hi>Samuel</hi> whether they ſhould fetch it; but an hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die reſolution of preſumptuous Elders to force God into the field, and to challenge ſucceſſe: If God were not with the Arke, why did they ſend for it, and reioyce in the comming of it?
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:3824:231"/>
If God were with it, why was not his allowance asked that it ſhould come? How can the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bee good where the Preiſts are wicked? When the Arke of the couenant of the Lord of hoſts that dwells betweene the Cherubims, was brought into the hoſt (tho with meane and wicked attendance) <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth, as it were, fill the heauen, and ſhake the earth with ſhoutes; as if the Arke and victory were no leſſe vnſeparable, then they and their ſinnes; Euen the leudeſt men will be looking for fauour from that God, whom they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to diſpleaſe, contrary to the conſcience of their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings; Preſumption doth the ſame
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:3824:232"/>
in wicked men, which faith doth in the holieſt; Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the God of the Arke, thinke themſelues ſafe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in the Arke of God; vaine men are tranſported with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the out-ſides of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not regarding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſoule of it, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can giue them true peace; But rather then God will humor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his owne Arke to fall into the handes of <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> Rather will he ſeeme to ſlacken his hand of protection, then hee will bee thought to haue his hands bound by a formall miſ-confidence. The ſlaughter of the Iſraelites was no plague to this; It was
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:3824:232"/>
a greater plague rather to them that ſhould ſuruiue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. The two ſonnes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which had helped to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their brethren, die by the handes of the vncircumciſed, and are now too late ſeparated from the Arke of God by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, which ſhould haue been before ſeparated by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; They had liued former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to bring Gods altar into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and now liue to carrie his Arke into captiuitie, and at laſt, as thoſe that had made vp the meaſure of their wickedneſſe are ſlayne in their ſinne.</p>

Ill newes doth euer either run, or flie; The man of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> which ran from the hoſt, hath ſoone filled the City with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries; and Elyes eares with the crie of the City; The good old man after ninety and eight yeares, ſits in the gate, as one that neuer thought himſelfe too aged to do God ſeruice; and heares the newes of <hi>Iſraels</hi> diſcomfiture, and his ſonnes death, though with ſorrow, yet with patience; but, when the meſſenger tells him of the Arke of God taken, he can liue no longer, that word ſtrikes him downe backward from his throne, and kills him in the fall; no ſword of a <hi>Philiſtim</hi> could haue ſlaine him more painefully, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Yea the very daughter in law of Ely, a woman, the wife of a lewd husband, when ſhe was at once trauelling (vpon that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) and in that trauell, dying (to make vp the full ſumme of Gods iudgement vpon that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked houſe) as one inſenſible of the death of her father, of her husband, of her ſelfe, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
