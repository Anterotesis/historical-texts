         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ſhortneſſe of the Time, and the inſufficiency
of my own Abilities, than the auſpicious fitneſſe
and readineſſe of this Text, ſo every way ſutable,
as I conceive; 1. To the Auditors. 2. To the
Times. 3. To the preſent Occaſion.</p>
            <p>1. To the Auditors; who are, or ſhould be all
<hi>Filii veritatis &amp; alumni pacis:</hi> Lovers of <hi>Truth,</hi>

<hi>Peace:</hi> being called together by his ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,

            <p>2. To the Genius of our Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing is
more needfull to be preached than the love of
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> The Winters diſtemper of our
age is ſuch, that the <hi>Love</hi> of many (if not moſt)
is grown cold to both: <hi>Truth</hi> much obſcured, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
blemiſhed, prejudiced, undermined, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced,
ſuppreſſed: <hi>Peace</hi> very crazy and
ſhaken: rumors of wars, preparations for wars,
ſtudy of ſides &amp; parts, great diviſion of thoughts,
pertinacy in opinions, breeding diſaffections; and
diſaffections flaming to open contention and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility;
ſo far, as from the ſtrife of pens and
tongues, writing, and diſputing, we are come to
the terror of war, to ſwords and arms; That if
the great God, who is the Father of Truth and

               <hi>Peace</hi> (who refraines the ſpirits of men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

inclined the heart of our King to Counſells of
Peace, you had not this day been Auditors, nor I
a Speaker of this Theam, but all of us miſerable
actors, or ſpectators of the contrary, the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Truth,</hi> and utter ſubverſion of our <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Text ſuits to the preſent occaſion of
the Sacrament: Your late faſting is this day hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
turned to a cheerfull feaſt: your Water
changed to Wine; the beſt viands, the beſt wine;
the ſoules proviſion for eternity, the body and
bloud of Chriſt. A ſoules feaſt, a feaſt of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joy, of eternall gladneſſe. A feaſt of love;
Gods love to us; Chriſts love for us; our love to
them, and to each other.</p>
            <p>A Feaſt of <hi>Truth;</hi> the ſealing and confirmation
of the higheſt, moſt neceſſary and comfortable
truth, which received by faith, is able to ſave our
ſoules. And a feaſt of <hi>Peace</hi> too; the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peace between God and our ſoules, between
Chriſt and his Church; between one another.</p>
            <p>So that nothing can come more ſeaſonably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your Faſt, and with this Feaſt of ſpirituall joy,
the holy Sacrament, then this divine exhortation,
moſt worthy of God to teach, and of us to learn,
as men, and as Chriſtians: both which names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a ſpeciall relation we have, above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
under heaven, to Truth and Peace, as we are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rationall and ſociall creatures;
as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, regenerate and ſanctified by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97043:6"/>
Spirit, which raiſeth our ſouls to the enjoyment
of the higheſt Truth and Peace, which is in God,
and from God, bringing the ſoul to God, and
uniting it ever with him.</p>
            <p>The three words in the Text (whereon I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to inſiſt) are a ſacred Trinity. Three preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Jewels; Truth, Peace, and Love; all eminent
in God, and from him: objects, and affections of
the higheſt capacity, uſe, and excellencie to our
ſouls; <hi>Truth,</hi> as the light of the Sunne; <hi>Peace</hi> as
the heat, which enlivens, foſters, quickens, makes
fruitfull all. <hi>Love</hi> makes us enjoy them both.
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are, <hi>Bona publica &amp; univerſalia. Truth</hi>
for the ſoule, <hi>Peace</hi> for the body and ſtate; every
one hath a ſhare and intereſt in them, Prince,
Peeres, and People.</p>
            <p>Of theſe I intend to ſpeak, not as a Statiſt or
Politician (to which I pretend not) but as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
a Meſſenger from the God of Truth and
Peace; ſeeking to kindle and inflame your hearts
to ſuch a love of them, as may be moſt happy to
your own ſouls, and moſt beneficiall to our
Church and State: in the good of both which,
you are all highly concerned: and in nothing can
you promote the proſperity of either or both of
them, more, then in your <hi>Love</hi> and advancement
of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May God the Fountain of Truth, Chriſt the
Saviour of Love, the holy Ghoſt the Spirit of
Peace, aſſiſt me in ſpeaking, you in hearing, all in
doing ſo, as we may ſhew a pure impartiall, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97043:6"/>
unpaſſionate love of Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>In the words conſider three things: Firſt, the
inference, <hi>Therefore:</hi> Secondly, the objects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
<hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Thirdly, the dutie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
<hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every word hath a weight, beauty and benefit
in it; ſo that they well merit and require your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the inference, <hi>Therefore:</hi> The greater
mercies God ſhewes to us, the ſtricter obligations
to love and obedience he hath upon us. When
our faſting and mourning are happily turned to
cheerfull feaſts, our feares and jealouſies cleered
up to joy and gladneſſe, to hopes of better eſtate
and times, what doth God require of us, but this?
<hi>Therefore to love the Truth and Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Gods infinite mercy and patience to
us hath beyond expectation, as well as deſert,
brought back our Church and State, from the
brink and precipice of warre, ruine, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which threatned our <hi>Peace.</hi> From the
ſpreading, and prevailings of errours, hereſies,
ſchiſmes, and ſuperſtition, which ſtrive to oppreſs
or eclipſe our Church and <hi>Truth:</hi> That there is a
breathing ſpace, a lengthning of our tranquillity,
put into our hands, What doth God require of us
by way of gratitude to him, of loyalty to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
of fidelitie to our Countrey, then to

               <head>1. Of Truth.</head>
               <p>That queſtion of <hi>Pilate</hi> to Chriſt, will here be
made: What is <hi>Truth?</hi> I anſwer. It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
agreeableneſſe, or anſwerableneſſe of
our mindes or things to their Ideas, patternes,
rules or meaſures; As that Copy is true, which
agrees with the Originall; That weight or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
true, which fits the Standard, That impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
true in waxe or paper, which exactly fits the
types and engravings, That notion or perception
true in the minde or ſenſe, which agrees with the
nature of the thing or object, whereto they are
applyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> is the increated light of the intellectaull
world, ſhining from God to Angels and Men.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Idea,</hi> rule, meaſure or Standard of
Truth, is God: his Will, which I call <hi>Veritas
Dei.</hi> Whereby he is, what he is, eſſentially, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
immutably: by which he wils all things to
be, what indeed they are, and knowes them to be,
ſuch as they are moſt certainly. This Sunne of
Truth is in God: never clouded, ſpotted, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97043:7"/>
eclipſed; never ſetting or changing. Eternall
light, day, noone, a conſtant ſerenity.</p>
               <p>From this is the eradiation of <hi>Truth;</hi> or ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
forth of the Divine will by his Works and
Word. Which we call <hi>Veritas Rei:</hi> and this is
firſt <hi>Entitatis,</hi> whereby things are ſuch as God
would have them to be, and ſo are true and good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Veritas mentis;</hi> whereby things are
known or believed by us to be ſuch, as indeed
they are, either made or revealed by God to us:
this is the <hi>truth</hi> of ſcience or faith;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hence flows <hi>Veritas ſermonis,</hi> of
<hi>dicti;</hi> when our words and orall expreſſions are
conformable to our knowledge, and belief or
things ſpeaking the truth. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Veritas facti &amp; Vitae;</hi> whereby our
actions are conformable to what we ſay, and
ſeem to know, judge, or believe of things, which
is the doing of the Truth. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 6. The <hi>Idea</hi>
or pattern of our actions are our words; of our
words, our minds and conceptions; of our minds
things themſelves; of all things the Divine will,
moſt wiſe, powerfull, and immutably good.
All Truth as being, is originally from God, as a
Sea and Sun derived, and muſt by a right beam
and clear ſtream be reduced to him again: and
ſo it is; when we do as we ſpeak: when we
ſpeak as we think, know or believe; when we
know or believe, as things are either made, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God: Then doth the ray or veyn of
<hi>truth</hi> flow aright from God to us, and reflect back
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97043:8"/>
again from us to him: When in any of theſe we
fail: there comes in hypocriſie and ſimulation in
our actions; lying in our words; error, falſity and
unbelief in our mindes, when our actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
our words, our words our mindes, our mindes
the nature and <hi>truth</hi> of things, made, or revealed
by God: whoſe will in his works and word, is
(as I ſaid) the rule of <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are divers manifeſtations of <hi>truth;</hi> though
it be but one, yet as light ſhining through divers
pores; or one Fountain derived in ſeverall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
for the benefit of rationall creatures.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is <hi>Truth,</hi> naturall or phyſicall in
the Works of God, which by ſenſe and diſcourſe,
by art and ſcience we learn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is <hi>Truth</hi> morall, politicall,
or civil; which is in the enacting, interpreting, and
executing of Laws according to the rules of
Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a truth Theologicall, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
or religious; which chiefly concerns
our Souls, and is immediately taught from
God.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in the Works of God and Nature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond in the laws and edicts of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to principles of reaſon.</p>
               <p>The third is in the ſacred Scriptures, the only
foundation and rule of faith and religion.</p>
               <p>The firſt concerns us as creatures ſeverally.</p>
               <p>The ſecond as ſociable creatures joyntly in a

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97043:8"/>
The third as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in a Church and neerer
call or relation to God.</p>
               <p>The firſt requires our love to it, as we love <hi>our
ſelves</hi> in a naturall way: the ſecond, as wee love
<hi>our Countrey,</hi> relations and liberties: the third as
we love <hi>our ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the firſt, the health and welfare of our <hi>bodies,</hi>
and pleaſure of our ſenſes, fancies, and minds, are
maintained, while we know and enjoy the true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
power, and uſe of creatures; able to apply fit
meanes to our ends.</p>
               <p>By the ſecond, the health of the ſtate, or <hi>body
politick</hi> is preſerved; while <hi>Lawes,</hi> which are the
<hi>nerves and ligaments</hi> of civil ſocieties, are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon innate, infallible and eternall principles
of <hi>equity, reaſon, and juſtice,</hi> to which all men agree;
and being ſo conſtituted, are truly interpreted and
executed; not wreſted, depraved, obſcured, or
violently broken: this is <hi>veritas juſtitiae &amp; deciſionis:
the truth in judicature,</hi> Zach. 8. 16. <hi>Execute the

               </p>
               <p>By the third, <hi>our ſoules health and happineſſe</hi>
are maintained; while we ſee, know, beleeve, and
reſt upon thoſe excellent and <hi>ſaving truths,</hi> which
God hath in his word revealed to us, in the plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſimplicity of the ſenſe, not denying or
doubting any thing, but humbly and willingly
embracing every <hi>truth</hi> revealed, as it agrees to the

               </p>
               <p>3. In the <hi>rationall World; Peace is that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe,</hi>

               </p>

               <p>5. In the <hi>Politicall</hi> or <hi>civill world,</hi> the State,

in the right <hi>skill</hi> of governing; and

in one maine end, the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the

the only foundation and pillars of <hi>Peace,</hi> in both
Church, and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond conſideration is <hi>the union of the

               <p>2 The <hi>lovelineſſe and benefit of Divine truth</hi>
revealed, whereon our Faith, our Religion, our

time or words ſerve to let it forth.</p>
               <p>By this light of <hi>ſacred truth, we know our ſelves</hi>
in our worſt, loſt, ſinfull, and damnable eſtate,
wherein elſe as heathen or beaſts we ſhould ſtupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and miſerably die and periſh. By this we <hi>know
God</hi> in his infinite mercies through <hi>Chriſt, which
is life eternall,</hi> Ioh. 17.3. By this we diſcover his
<hi>grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to us: for our free <hi>juſtification</hi> by
the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>truth</hi> the <hi>burthens</hi> of our ſinnes, our

<hi>light</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> wee have many ſweet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>promiſes</hi> to ſupport us in all ſtates, and all
tryals and temptions. But this as <hi>Moſes</hi> from
Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> we diſcover the pleaſant and happy
<hi>proſpect</hi> of heaven and eternity: the joyes, peace,
pleaſure, happineſſe, and ſecurity of that after-ſtate
wee expect in the other world: we ſee a full,
though future, <hi>victory</hi> over ſinne, fatan, fleſh,
world, men, death, hell, and all; a full <hi>tryumph</hi>
and <hi>crowning</hi> of the ſoule and body in <hi>eternall

               <p>3 The <hi>amiableneſſe of peace,</hi> publick and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall

               <q>
                  <l>—En quo diſcordia gentes</l>

               </q>
               <p>3 Wee come now to the <hi>third generall head:</hi>
having ſeene what <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are; how well
they <hi>agree,</hi> how much <hi>they merit our love;</hi> now
we goe on to the <hi>laſt part,</hi> which is <hi>our duty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
love them.</hi> Here wee will inquire two <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
1. <hi>What need</hi> there is that men ſhould
bee thus exhorted to <hi>love</hi> theſe, which have ſo
attractive a lovelineſſe in them. 2. <hi>Wherein</hi>
moſt effectually wee muſt expreſſe our <hi>love</hi> to
them.</p>
               <p>I Although nothing more deſerve <hi>our love:</hi>
yet ſuch is the ignorance, dulneſſe, or depravedneſſe
of mens mindes, affections, and manners, that
few there are, which truely <hi>love</hi> them. Firſt, ſome
<hi>love neither Truth nor Peace;</hi> of which temper
the <hi>Ieſuitick ſpirit</hi> ſeemes to be, which <hi>deceives</hi>
the Nations with the <hi>Cup of errour,</hi> and <hi>ſcatters
coales of fire</hi> and diſſention among men. Secondly,
ſome <hi>love truth, but not peace:</hi> zealouſly affected
to <hi>truth,</hi> but for want of ſound and ſteddy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or meeke and humble hearts, they are full
of violence and bitterneſſe; ſo prone to ſtrife and
contention, that from words and diſputes they
eaſily kindle to blowes: <hi>Some, when you ſpeak to
them of peace, prepare for war, Quia multis utile bellum;</hi>
their beſt fiſhing being in troubled waters. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſome <hi>love peace</hi> but <hi>not truth;</hi> as <hi>Iſhachar,</hi> ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly
<hi>couching between the burthens of Superſtition
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97043:13"/>
and Oppreſsion,</hi> rather than trouble their <hi>Peace,</hi> in a
land of <hi>plenty.</hi> Out of a lazie, groſſe, and ſenſuall
humour, ſo addicted to the <hi>enjoyments of peace,</hi> that
they care not what <hi>encroachments</hi> are made on
<hi>Truth.</hi> Fourthly, many <hi>ſeeme to love them,</hi> but not
<hi>ſimply, per ſe</hi> and <hi>propter ſe;</hi> but corruptly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
for by-ends and advantages to bee had by
them, of profit, preferment, applauſe, and the
like; as <hi>Demas</hi> did 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
It is <hi>neither truth nor peace</hi> ſo
much they love (though they ſtickle for both)
but their <hi>bellies,</hi> pleaſures, plenty, and ſelves, which
they enjoy under the <hi>wings of truth and peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Many <hi>love what they think truth</hi> (and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is ſo) yet not becauſe it is ſo, but becauſe they
think ſo; extreamely <hi>biaſed</hi> with ſelfe love and
pride; that they pertinaciouſly retaine, what ever
opinion they have once undertaken, though they
cannot maintaine it; only on this ground, <hi>Ne
videantur errâſſe;</hi> ſo hardly drawne by overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
themſelves to <hi>triumph</hi> over their <hi>errours. Ita
perit judicium, ubi res tranſit in affectum, &amp; noſtram

corrupt, and warpe our <hi>judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Many ſay they love truth; but not <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally;</hi>
not ſuch truthes as croſſe their credits, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ends, pleaſures, ſinnes and luſts; <hi>Nolunt id ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
videri, quod affectibus ſuis adverſatur. He loves
not any Truth, that loves not all;</hi> as he likes not the
light or Sun, who is offended with any beame of
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97043:14"/>
7. <hi>Veritas animae ſponſa; Truth is a pure Virgin,</hi>
which every ſoule ſhould wooe and ſeeke to <hi>wed</hi>
to it ſelfe; Many <hi>pretend to love it,</hi> but not <hi>caſto &amp;
honeſto amore ſed meretricio &amp; prudendo. Laſcivientia
ingenia,</hi> ſuch as fondly and <hi>wantonly</hi> out of a vanity
and curioſity only <hi>court</hi> that <hi>Truth,</hi> which they
ſee is countenanced and ſhined upon by publick
favour and authority; ready enough to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and forſake it, if the ſtreame of things
ſhould change: <hi>Venales animae,</hi> vile and mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſoules, that <hi>buy and ſell the truth, proſtituting</hi> it,
<hi>not</hi> intirely loving and <hi>wedding</hi> themſelves to it.</p>
               <p>8. Some to <hi>purchaſe their peace,</hi> are ready to ſell
the Truth, by flattering, complying and mancipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their judgements to other mens opinions and
errours, either diſcovered, which is very wicked, or
unſearched, which is very weak, <hi>Degenerate mindes</hi>
which ſo eaſily <hi>enſlave</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the nobleſt
and ſoveraigne faculty of the ſoule, which is the
<hi>underſtanding,</hi> to other mens errours never ſo great,
if their power be ſo too.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Veritas animae pabulum,</hi> there is as great an
aptitude and proportion betweene the <hi>minde</hi> of
man, and <hi>truth,</hi> as is betweene the <hi>eye</hi> and the <hi>object,
meat</hi> and the <hi>ſtomack:</hi> now we know, it muſt be
a pure and unblemiſhed <hi>eye,</hi> that ſees with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and conſtancie; a cleare, ſound, and undiſeaſed
<hi>ſtomack,</hi> that deſires, likes, and digeſts wholeſome
meats. Such muſt that minde bee which loves.

1. Many are ſo <hi>vitiated</hi> and diſtempered by ſin,
the World, their Luſts and Vanities, that they
wholely refuſe to take downe any <hi>truth;</hi> what the
eare may receive ſometime, their heart <hi>caſts</hi> up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
profanely and reproachfully, by their words
and actions. <hi>Ita veritas odium &amp; nauſeam parit.</hi>
The ſpeedieſt way to <hi>loſe</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of many is, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to tell them that <hi>truth,</hi> which might doe them
moſt good,<note place="margin">1 Kings 22.</note> for it ſeemes to them as <hi>Michaiahs</hi>
words to <hi>Ahab, odious</hi> and offenſive, although it
gave him warning of his danger, and ſhewed him
the only way for his ſafety.</p>
               <p>2. Many like choyſe and <hi>wanton ſtomacks,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and digeſt indeed, ſome <hi>truths</hi> in their minds
and memories; but it is <hi>morbum alere non hominem;</hi>
only thereby the better to nouriſh and ſtrengthen
their erroneous <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>conceits;</hi> and what ever
<hi>truth</hi> they meet with, is preſently <hi>ſwallowed without
chewing</hi> by ſome <hi>monſter of opinion,</hi> which they
maintaine. For <hi>errour</hi> is ſo <hi>feeble</hi> and unbottomed,
that it muſt have ſome buttreſſes and ſeeming <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
of <hi>truth</hi> to ſupport it. By this meanes <hi>detayning
the truth of God in unrighteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>3. Many are of ſo <hi>hot,</hi> unquiet and <hi>cholerick ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,</hi>
that they love not <hi>truth ſweetned with peace;</hi>
not calme and ſober truths. Afraid to be thought
<hi>coldly,</hi> if <hi>peaceably</hi> religious, even in matters of leſſer
moment. Interpreting that <hi>zeale,</hi> which is but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

praedatorious, not that holy, gentle, and propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

So that moſt men we ſee had neede to be called

which we ought to <hi>love</hi> and adhere unto?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, the <hi>Truth</hi> of God, like the light of the
Sunne, is beſt knowne and diſtinguiſhed from all
other, by the beauty and excellency of its <hi>effects,</hi>
of life, heate, and fertillity; that is infallibly the
<hi>ſaving and neceſſary truth of God,</hi> moſt deſerving our
love and ſtudy, which hath, and alwayes had the
greateſt and beſt <hi>influence</hi> on mens hearts and lives:
that is, <hi>Gods truth</hi> which makes men more <hi>godly,</hi>
more holy, pure, juſt, good, humble, peaceable,
charitable, ſelfe-denying, and conſciencious in all
their wayes: What brings us neareſt, and makes
us <hi>likeſt to God,</hi> which conformes us moſt to that
higheſt and divineſt patterne of <hi>Chriſts minde</hi> and

It hath beene alwayes the <hi>Seale of honour</hi> ſet upon
Chriſtian Religion: and that <hi>truth,</hi> whereon it is

Thoſe truths which have the greateſt operation
on mens mindes, conſciences, and lives, ſo as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them, are ſet beyond all queſtion and
diſputes: Theſe let us chiefely ſtudy, love, and
live by.</p>
               <p>2. If our <hi>love</hi> be thus rightly ſet to <hi>Gods truth,</hi>
he will take care to <hi>ſettle our peace:</hi> to which we
<hi>owe a love too,</hi> and muſt ſhew it in the ſecond place.

Thus ſeeke peace and purſue it;</hi> by purſuing thoſe that

you: 1. Such <hi>ſwerving</hi> from the <hi>forme of ſound
words</hi> uſed in the Primitive and pureſt times, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
and ſtrengthened after errours. 2. They were
not then <hi>ingaged</hi> to mainetaine Truth againſt ſuch

of the <hi>reformed Church:</hi> which Doctrines are now
eagerly maintained by a proud <hi>faction,</hi> who ſeeke
to abuſe antiquity, and patronize their owne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
by uſing thoſe names and words to other
intents, and things, than ever was dreamed of by
the Ancient Church. 3. By ſuch <hi>dangerous ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing</hi>

we doe but <hi>prepare</hi> our mindes, and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

wee complement our ſelves out of our Truth; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the adverſaries ſtrong hopes and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as they have diſcovered, that wee are inclining
towards them: To bee <hi>aſhamed</hi> of frequent, ſerious
and conſcientious <hi>preaching,</hi> which was the worke
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>holy Apoſtles;</hi> the honour and
chiefe imployment of the <hi>Primitive and beſt</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97043:21"/>
and Miniſters, in all ages, as that deſervedly
famous Biſhop <hi>Iewell</hi> in his Apologie prooves
out of the Fathers ſufficiently againſt the Popes,
and other idle bellyes; which count preaching as
a work below their greatneſſe, as indeede it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their goodneſſe. Is <hi>this to love the truth?</hi> To
<hi>preach</hi> ridiculous, impertinent, flattering or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
matter, which is the <hi>ſhame</hi> of the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and
<hi>fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> in good earneſt; ſo as to
bring an infinite <hi>contempt, odium</hi> and <hi>envie</hi> upon
the Sacred function of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> that men <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre</hi>
the Services of God, and daily <hi>ſeparate</hi> by
ſwarmes from our Church; are theſe the <hi>fruites of
our love of the Truth?—Pudet haec opprobria nobis,</hi> &amp;c.
Sure there is <hi>ſomething extreamely amiſſe</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to God as well as men, either in our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or manners, or hearts, or all. Elſe whence
ſhould that burthen of <hi>diſhonour,</hi> thoſe loades of
reproaches be caſt upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which makes
them drive ſo heavily: and this even among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and reformed Churches; whereas naturally
all men, though otherwiſe barbarous, and inſolent,
yet are prone to pay a ſpeciall reverence and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour to their holy men, ſuch as are in a
more immediate neereneſſe and relation to their
<hi>deitie</hi> or <hi>gods:</hi> Now <hi>truth</hi> carries a <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi>
and luſtre with it, caſting a glory on every <hi>Moſes</hi>
or <hi>Man</hi> of God, who converſeth with it. The

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97043:21"/>
they cannot ſcornefully <hi>neglect</hi> the other. God
