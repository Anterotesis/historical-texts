            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:21776:4"/>
            <p>Wherefore hauing receiued the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, I could not but be much mooued at it, when I ſaw it was done againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Law, againſt the ordinances of our Predeceſſors, and againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cuſtome, in a thing of ſuch weight, wherein a Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> Prince of the ſacred Empire, and perpetuall Vicary in Italie, was to be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked with the ſhamefull note of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Ban, vnleſſe he would diſmiſſe the Troups by him gathered; ſpecially when I obſerued that the date thereof ſhewed no certaine place, and that it wanted the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Imperiall hand.</p>
            <p>But what is this, how grieuous is it to reade, and harſh to heare, that being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your former Decrees, and of all your ſignifications and threatnings, I ſhould be ſo ſeuerely checked as diſobedient to the Imperiall iniunctions; &amp; that being bound to repreſſe the Gouernour of <hi>Millane,</hi> who theſe many moneths, with his great Troups of armed men, hath troubled the peaceable State of <hi>Italie,</hi> and attempted not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade, but alſo to ſpoile vtterly the Frontiers of my Dominions, you (as though you
<pb facs="tcp:21776:5"/>
were ignorant of what is knowne to all the World) ſhould wincke at his too bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and out of your abſolute Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, command me, who doe nothing elſe but moſt iuſtly challenge my owne right alone to lay downe the Armes, which I haue taken vp for the preſeruation of mine owne Dominions?</p>
            <p>What meaneth this, I pray you, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe my Troups againſt any man elſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſhould be intended, but onely (if thereby the Gouernor of <hi>Millane</hi> be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) to take from mee all meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in a moſt iuſt cauſe, which are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted by humane Lawes, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine alſo, to defraude me of the hope I haue in your Iuſtice, in this dangerous eſtate of my affaires, and willingly to arme the hand of mine enemie for the deſtruction of my ſelfe and my Countrey? All which (moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible <hi>Caeſar</hi>) ſhould I confeſſe, haue wounded my minde more deepely, if this cogitation of mine had not applyed ſome remedy vnto it, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Decree hath either beene made, your Maieſtie being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, or is ſlipt from your hands
<pb facs="tcp:21776:5"/>
through the deceit and fraud of ſome crafty and wicked men, to which it cannot haue been hard to deceiue your Maieſtie, being ignorant of the ſubtill fallacie of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I thinke, I ſhall doe well and fitly, briefly to ſhew your Maieſtie the ſtate of this controuerſie, repeating the ſame from the very beginning, that knowing the equitie of the matter, you may fully and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely iudge, not of my cauſe, but of yours.</p>
            <p>What mooued me firſt to take Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> your Maieſtie may eaſily haue knowne, both by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of my Writings, and by the generall ſpeech of all the World; neither do I thinke you are ignorant of my readineſſe, in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the deſires, both of your Maieſtie, and the King of Spaine, by my ſurrendring, at your onely nodde, thoſe Townes that by right belong to me, and which I had taken by force, in the Prouince of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> At which time, may it pleaſe you, but to call to minde, what great and diuers matters the Gouernour of <hi>Millane</hi> promiſed, though but
<pb facs="tcp:21776:6"/>
with a wauering faith. For hauing begun to ſatisfie on my ſide, and my mind expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome performance of his promiſes, he, without ſhame, hath broken his faith, which hee had obliged before ſo many witneſſes, denying, for the moſt part, his ſaid promiſes, lingering and delaying in thoſe, which hee can by no meanes denie, without ſhewing himſelfe willing to fulfill any thing. And not contented with that, hee hath not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enioyne me two things, in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> name: Firſt, that I ſhould diſmiſſe two thouſand <hi>Swiſsers,</hi> or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which I had been long a getting for the defence of my State, and which had been long bound vnto me, through their ſtipend they haue receiued, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſmall number, they could giue no iuſt ſuſpicion, ſpecially to his Royall Maieſtie. Secondly, that I ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to ioyne by marriage, the Infant my Daughter, heretofore Ducheſſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> with the now Duke of <hi>Mantua;</hi> promiſing that then he would procure, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhould be handled, which at that time could not be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21776:6"/>To which demaunds (as being againſt all reaſon) I let him vnderſtand, both by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by my Ambaſſadours, I could not ſatisfie, vnleſſe the controuerſies were firſt ended.</p>
            <p>And thus thinking to haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered the Kings will, the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millane</hi> found out a new tricke, to wit; that it would be a thing pleaſing vnto him, that the matter ſhould not be decided by Armes, but that the controuerſies ſhould be ended by friendly meanes; and therfore deſired I ſhould ſend certaine Deputies to <hi>Millane,</hi> which meeting with as many of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhould, in my name, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and compound all the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore hauing thought good to yeeld thereunto, not only to auoid the note of obſtinacie, but alſo to ſhew to the world by a moſt ſure teſtimony, how much I did loue both mine owne quiet, and the publike Peace of all <hi>Italy;</hi> I ſent to <hi>Millane</hi> three men skilfull in the Law; who hauing remained there a long time, to put an end to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie propounded often, and at diuers times, ſeuerall Articles, though with da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb facs="tcp:21776:7"/>
to my right, and much inferior to the goodneſſe of my cauſe.</p>
            <p>But what did heere the Gouernour, that man (forſooth) ſo deſirous to keepe peace, and ſo conſtant in his faith? Hee cauſed a great Armie, both of Horſe and Foote, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to be gathered, and enrowled in the Dukedome of <hi>Millane,</hi> and the Countries thereunto adioyning, and commanded my men to depart, without effecting any thing, and to tell me, that there was order come from the King, forbidding the handling of the compoſition of the controuerſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had diſcharged all my Troupes, and accompliſhed the marriage of my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yea, that he was inioyned by the King to haue a care, not onely to incline mee to thoſe things hee commanded, but alſo to conſtraine and force mee to the ſame by Armes.</p>
            <p>Vpon this ſo ſharpe and ſeuere Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what counſell I tooke, and what I did, not only my publiſhed writings may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, but alſo the Reuerend Lord <hi>Sauellus,</hi> Nuntius of our moſt holy Father, comming not long after, can be a moſt ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;

who, hauing inuited mee to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of Armes, (though it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, the ſame ſhould bee done by the mightier firſt) found me not only not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, but moſt readie thereunto; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only with this condition, that I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Gouernour of <hi>Millane</hi> ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege his Faith to our moſt gracious Lord, the moſt Chriſtian King, and the Illuſtrious Commonwealth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> that hee ſhould hereafter attempt nothing againſt my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and diſmiſſe his Army raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, hee ſaid flatly, hee would doe none of all this, and ſhewing himſelfe more ready for the deſtruction of my Countrey, then deſirous of the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at the ſame time with a great Army into the Prouince of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and ſpoiled, ouerthrew, and burnt in a moſt pittifull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome Townes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that I might procure ſome eaſe to my diſtreſſed Prouince, and diuerſe ſome whither elſe the moſt vehement and impetuous furie of the enemies, I led my Troupes to <hi>Nouarre,</hi> a Towne of the State
<pb facs="tcp:21776:8"/>
of <hi>Millane,</hi> where I ſhewed euidently, that I wanted no opportunitie to reuenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries done vnto mee. I could haue taken that Towne, I may ſay, with no difficultie at all, as being guarded by an vnſufficient Gariſon, and might alſo haue brought, if I had had the will, the whole ſtate of <hi>Millane</hi> into vtter danger; but that his Catholike Maieſtie might ſee my loue to publike peace, and my reſpect to him, I did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpare to ſatisfie to my griefe, but forbad alſo at my depart by a moſt ſtrict Edict, that none of my men ſhould, in any ſort, enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the People or Lands belonging to the ſaid Towne.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay more? when I was at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ercelles,</hi> the Popes Nuncius, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend <hi>Sauellus,</hi> and the moſt illuſtrious Marques of <hi>Rambouillet,</hi> Ambaſſadour of the moſt Chriſtian King, to preſerue the publike Peace of <hi>Italie,</hi> and mine, hauing propounded certaine Articles of agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I (though little aduantageous to me) aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto, and ſigned them with mine owne hand. Whereupon they hoping, that without any doubt, the Gouernour would
<pb facs="tcp:21776:8"/>
likewiſe approue and ſigne the ſame, and iudging that for my part I had ſatisfied to the ſame, and that no further thing was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in that buſineſſe, the peace was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by their owne mouth, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confirmed; but the vnlookt for euent deceiued, as in other matters, ſo in this, not onely their expectation, but their aſſured truſt: for the Gouernour refuſed to ſigne, and the King himſelfe, neglecting the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which we lookt for in few dayes, ſent word ſecretly to the Gouernour, that hee ſhould ſuddenly oppreſſe mee, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and miſtruſting nothing leſſe, and enter with all ſpeede into my Dominions, continuing the Warre vndertaken againſt me with all vehemency.</p>
            <p>Thus I make no doubt, but that it had beene already done with my eſtate, if thoſe Letters, whereof I haue cauſed a Copie to bee ſent to your Maieſtie, being diuinely come into my hands, as I may iuſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, had not giuen mee aſſurance of the whole buſineſſe. Wherefore, who can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde fault with me, if being ſtirred vp by ſo frequent a breach of faith, I haue recourſe
<pb facs="tcp:21776:9"/>
to Armes againſt my moſt hateful enemies, for the welfare of my ſelfe, my children, and my countrey; for the defence of my honor, and for the liberty and dignity of <hi>Italie,</hi> yea and of the holy Empire?</p>
            <p>How vnworthy a thing of your Maieſtie, how ſhamefull ſhould it be, if the Empire of <hi>Italie,</hi> which is committed to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as he is King of the Romanes, ſhould be ſaid by all the World, to haue onely, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Raigne, beene tranſlated, vnder a colour and falſe ſhaddow of Religion and publike Peace, to the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which acknowledgeth to hold of you the Dukedome of <hi>Millane, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> of the Pope?</p>
            <p>What ſhall we thinke the world will ſay, when it ſhall heare that the attempts of the Spaniards haue proceeded ſo farre vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as not onely to fright with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but alſo to dare to aſſault with armed hand, and to draw to an vnwilling warre a Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> moſt renowned through his Predeceſſours, and moſt famous through his affinitie and alliance of bloud with moſt Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> a Prince of the holy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb facs="tcp:21776:9"/>
and perpetuall Vicary in <hi>Italie,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his off-ſpring from the <hi>Saxonian</hi> ſtocke, hauing held large &amp; ample Dominions in <hi>Italie</hi> long before the Spaniards had any footing in the ſame, challenging his owne by a moſt iuſt right, &amp; attempting nothing at all againſt them?</p>
            <p>Moreouer, with what minde, doe wee thinke, ſhall the Germane Princes of the Empire giue hearing to Fame, when ſhee ſhall tell them, that they contend that the Citie of <hi>Aſty</hi> and Countie thereof, which I haue acknowledged to hold of the holy Empire by my Edict, ſet vp in a place neere the ſaid Citie, while I was in the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Ambaſſadors of diuers Princes, belongeth vnto them, as if, by my taking Armes againſt him, I had forfeited the ſame, which ſhould be now fallen and adioyned to his Dominions, and publiſh that the Subiects and Vaſſals of the ſaid Countrey, are freed from the Allegeance they haue ſworne to the Duke of Sauoy? For certainly thoſe great Princes could not but be much moued at the tidings of ſuch a thing, which by an Act of mine, publiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:21776:10"/>
in the publike places of the Dukedome of <hi>Millane,</hi> hath appeared to be idle and vaine, and which we know of a certaine, that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Millane</hi> themſelues ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thought to be friuolous and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>What will they ſay, when they ſhall heare at the ſame time, that the Marques of Sainct Croſſe vpon the coaſt of <hi>Genua,</hi> hauing cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the help of the Citie, hath with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Nauie ſeyzed vpon my vnarmed Towns of <hi>Vnelia, Macer,</hi> and <hi>Petra-Lata,</hi> which the moſt Illuſtrious Duke <hi>Emanuel</hi> my Father, hauing bought of the Lords thereof, had ſubiected to the power of the holy Empire, and in the Inueſtiture cauſed the ſame to be named, together with his other Dominions, which are yet at this day detayned by him? I doubt much, they will confirme therewith the opinion they haue of the Spaniards too greedie deſire of getting.</p>
            <p>Hence your Maieſtie may coniecture, to what end I haue cauſed certaine ſmall Townes belonging to the Empire, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within the bowels of my Dominions, to be ſeyzed vpon, which hath beene onely to ſaue them from being taken and ſpoyled
<pb facs="tcp:21776:10"/>
by the Spaniards, and the better and with leſſe danger, to defend my poſſeſſions from their attempts: For I haue thought, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of thoſe places to belong to him, who hath promiſed by a publike Act, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pacified, to reſtore the ſame vnto your Maieſtie, and to one that is called perpetual Vicary of the Empire, the onely Prince of the ſame now left in <hi>Italie,</hi> &amp; Vaſſall of your Maieſtie; by whom your ſacred Perſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe into the ſaid Countrey, either to take the Imperiall Crowne, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, ſhall be accompanied and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For ſhall wee thinke, that the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who playeth the Emperour in <hi>Italie,</hi> will follow after your pompe? May we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Common-wealth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> that of <hi>Genua,</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> will by duty celebrate your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with their companie? Nay, they doe boaſt to be freed from the Empire.</p>
            <p>What of the Duke of Mantua himſelfe? Who is ignorant that he dependeth onely, and altogether vpon the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth his nods, hath committed himſelfe to his protection, and hath vowed himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:21776:11"/>
and all hee hath very ſtrictly to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?</p>
            <p>And the other Princes, What? Are they not almoſt all ſubiect to the See of Rome, and do they not al receiue their Dignitie of the ſame? I am then reſerued alone for the Splendor and Dignitie of your Maieſtie, who acknowledge my ſelfe a <hi>Germane</hi> Prince, and my Poſſeſſions, and of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, to haue proceeded from the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of the Emperours; and ſhall the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, with the knowledge of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, dare to aſſault, and warre againſt me? Shall the Title of <hi>King of the Romanes,</hi> which you beare, reſtrained within the moſt ſtrict limits of my Poſſeſſions, be ſuffered to bee violated and cut off, in the perſon of your Subiect and Vaſſall? Shall your Maieſtie iudge it to bee fit, that a man, whom you ought to helpe and defend with all your forces, yea, againſt thoſe of your owne Nation, if neede required, ſhould not onely bee ſuffered to bee oppreſſed by the Armes of the Spaniards, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily vſed like a ſlaue by the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millane,</hi> but alſo eſteemed worthy
<pb facs="tcp:21776:11"/>
to be puniſhed by the ſeuere Proclamation of an Imperiall Ban? What ſo grieuous, and ſo hainous a thing ſhould haue moued the Spaniards to take Armes againſt my Countrey, and your Maieſtie, to decree an Imperiall Edict againſt me? Is it becauſe, the King bidding mee to lay downe my Armes, I haue not preſently obeyed? But whence haue the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> this new Authoritie ouer the Princes of the Empire? Whence this altogether new power? By what ſigne can they proue the ſame? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing the King doth not acknowledge the voluntarie obſeruance, which hee hath receiued from the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from my ſelfe, not out of dutie, or as due, but out of good will, and of our alliance of bloud, he deſerueth with good right, to haue the ſame no more yeelded vnto him heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Beſides, after I had promiſed to the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Ambaſſadours, to lay downe my Armes, why did he not, as I requeſted, free me from the feare and danger I ſtood in, leſt hee would attempt ſome thing againſt me? Was it, becauſe I had entred with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:21776:12"/>
hand into the Dukedome of <hi>Millane?</hi> But he firſt had not onely inuaded my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, but alſo by his Souldiers wickedly raged in the ſame. But what hurt, what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage can hee ſhew I haue done to his? I haue things inow to ſhew moſt vilely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his men, as ſpoyling of houſes, whole Heards carryed away, and Townes burnt.</p>
            <p>Is it, becauſe I haue reſtored the golden Fleece? But if the Spaniards bee wiſe, they will rather attribute this to my reſpect to the King, becauſe I durſt not defend my ſelfe by Armes againſt him, afore I had ſent back the Coller of the Order; deeming it an vnfit thing, if being a Knight of the Kings Order, I ſhould with the ſame fight againſt his Armes, though in defence of mine owne.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly, is it, becauſe the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours wife, after the depart of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, hath been ill dealt withall, which was not ſuffered to goe out of <hi>Turin,</hi> before ſhe had payed whatſoeuer ſhee owed in the Towne for daily houſhold prouiſions? But how fooliſh and ridiculous a thing is it, to
<pb facs="tcp:21776:12"/>
taxe me with what hath beene done altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without my knowledge, whileſt I was in the Campe at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ercelles?</hi> For if I had been preſent, I would haue payed the ſaid debts with mine owne money.</p>
            <p>Wherein did the Magiſtrate offend? Should they haue denyed Iuſtice, to ſuch as demanded their owne by order of Law? How often did they admoniſh that Lady, after a friendly manner, to giue ſatisfaction to thoſe poore men, and to remoue that ſhame from her ſelfe? But ſhee refuſing to pay, they were at laſt conſtrained againſt their will, to grant a Sequeſtration of ſome ſmall houſhold ſtuffe of hers, which not long after they releaſed. But grant we that they offended in ſome thing, in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; muſt Armes be taken vp therefore? Muſt a ſmall iniurie bee reuenged with ſo much eagerneſſe? Muſt the Duke therefore be ſet in the Ban of the Empire? There was more reaſon, that a laying downe of Armes ſhould haue beene enioyned to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> which had taken them vp without any cauſe, onely vnder a falſe colour of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Peace. It was vpon them, that the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt of the Ban was to be throwne, not
<pb facs="tcp:21776:13"/>
on me, whom ſo many times breaking their faith, they haue deceiued, whoſe ſubiects they haue gone about to draw from their ſworne allegeance, whoſe Dominions they had entred &amp; occupied by maine ſtrength.</p>
            <p>I haue taken vp Armes; I doe not denie it: but I was thereunto conſtrained. I haue inuaded the Dukedome of <hi>Millane,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt prouoked. But what haue done thoſe moſt glorious Dukes my Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours? Haue they not for the ſpace of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſixe hundred yeeres made warres in <hi>Italie?</hi> What poſſeſſions haue they brought vnder their authority by Armes? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Neighbour Princes haue they conſtrained to do homage vnto them? And yet we ſhall not find, that euer any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror did check them with the Imperiall Ban.</p>
            <p>Shall I be then the onely Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> amongſt ſo many, whom the Prince of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillion</hi> (a Miniſter not ſo much of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of whom hee hath receiued the golden Fleece, and an yeerely entertainement) ſhall haue accuſed by his ſaid Edict? Will hee not bluſh for ſhame, to bring againſt me the ſentence of the Imperiall Ban, by him receiued (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<pb facs="tcp:21776:13"/>
from the Gouernour of <hi>Millane?</hi> For I will neuer bee perſwaded to beleeue, that ſuch a Decree, dated at no place, vnſigned by the Imperiall hand, as was requiſite, ſhould haue proceeded from your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, rather will I euer conſtantly affirme it, either altogether falſe, or at the leaſt gotten by ſtealth from your Maieſties Miniſters by the Gouernour of <hi>Millane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then being the matter, nothing elſe ſeemeth to remaine, but that the equitie of my cauſe being knowne, I ſhould requeſt your Maieſtie out of your ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, of which, as of an Oracle, not my ſelfe onely, but all the world beſides, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, to declare the ſaid Edict granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me (ſince it was made without the knowledge and conſent of your Maieſtie) to be void, &amp; of no worth, to make knowne to all the world my innocencie, and ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to puniſh thoſe Miniſters of yours that haue ſubſcribed therevnto.</p>
            <p>It will bee your Maieſties part likewiſe, out of your full power, to command the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as Duke of <hi>Millane,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Vaſſall of the Empire, to diſmiſſe with all ſpeede, the Troupes he hath leuyed
<pb facs="tcp:21776:14"/>
without any cauſe, for to harme me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme with his owne hand the Articles of Peace, to which I haue already ſubſcribed, and to free all <hi>Italy,</hi> troubled with the ging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spaniſh Armes, from further feare, as likewiſe to check and chaſtiſe, as he deſerueth, the Gouernour of <hi>Millane,</hi> who with a madde and furious mind, carrieth the fire-brand of warres in his hands, only to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his greedy deſire of money, filling with his whiſpering the Kings eares with many falſe things againſt me. And ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I hope your Maieſtie will, with more glorie, maintayne your owne, and the holy Empires authority in <hi>Italie,</hi> which otherwiſe will be transferred to the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>As for mine owne part, your Maieſtie ſhall euer finde me moſt ready, not only to lay down the Armes which I haue taken vp for mine owne ſafetie, but alſo (after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my fore-fathers) to hazard all I haue, &amp; mine owne life at your only nodde. In the meane time, hoping to haue your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and fauourable clemency and equity, in theſe my hard controuerſies againſt the Spaniards, I will earneſtly pray God, the only giuer of all things, long to preſerue your Maieſty in full proſperity.</p>
