            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>If Chriſt be at Gods right hand in a body of fleſh and bones, after that manner, as you ſay he is, then this is to make God to be a body of fleſh, and bones alſo, and ſuch a one as your ſelfe, that muſt be confined to a locall place, when the Scripture ſaith, he is unconfined to any time, place, or perſon, but fills Heaven and earth with his fulneſs, therefore when you ſpeak of God and Chriſt, you ſhould declare what they are, and what his right hand is, but becauſe you know not, I will tell you.</p>
                     <p>God and Chriſt is one and the ſame in Spirit and glory, and Chriſt being in Heaven at Gods right hand, is his being in God <note place="margin">Iohn 10. 30.</note> far above all Heavens or created things, injoying the ſame ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">Coll. 2. 9.</note> of God, as one whom God cannot be without, he being that eternal wiſdome and power by which he doth all things, and <note place="margin">1 Coll. 16. 17.</note> by whom all things conſiſt, therefore if any blaſphemy hath been ſpoke, 'tis you that hath ſpoke it, and not I.</p>

                     <speaker>Roſewell.</speaker>
                     <p>You ſaid, I had no more the other day, but you ſhall find I have enough now; what my Brother <hi>French</hi> ſpake the other day, I had no knowledg of, but I think it was unſeaſonable at that time, and it had been better let alone.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, he that from Scripture ſhall labour to perſwade people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt was a ſinner, and that his humane nature was tainted with original ſin, he is a perverter of Scripture, a blaſphemer of Chriſt, and a venter of damnable errors and hereſies, and on this I do deſire to build the future ſtructure, but then there was ſome things hinted for the undermining of this Propoſition. Now if Chriſt be polluted with ſins, then is our preaching vain, and your faith in vain, therefore if I do make this my main Propoſition, it will not be impertinent to the buſineſſe, therefore let every one turn to the Bible, they may all ſee to how little purpoſe thoſe Scriptures was brought by him the other day: Firſt, this is to pull the Crown from the head of Chriſt, to ſay he was a ſinner: Secondly, I ſay it is a perverting of Scripture, and a ſeting Scripture in oppoſition againſt Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. He bear our ſins, Heb. 4. 15. He was in all things like us, ſin onlie excepted, John 14. 30. The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</hi> If there had been ſin in Chriſt, he could not have withſtood the temptation of the devil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. But you ſee Jeſus Chriſt was made ſin for us, that is, he was made a Sin-offering for us; I will appeal to all that's skilled in Tongues, for the ſame word which is here tranſlated ſin, is in <hi>Exodus</hi> 40. Sin-offering;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31743:18"/>
where there is a dark ſaying in the body of the Text, there is a remedy in the ſide, for it is ſaid, <hi>He was made ſin for us, which knew no ſin in himſelf:</hi> And where Chriſt is ſaid to bear our ſins in his body, it is not in a proper ſenſe, for ſin cannot be, and not be, in one and the ſame perſon, at one and the ſame time, as you ſay, in 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. He bear our ſins, Iſa. 53. 6. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquitie of us all:</hi> I will grant you in a ſound Orthodox ſenſe he may be ſaid to bear our ſins, and as his righteouſneſſe is imputed to us, ſo is our ſins imputed to him: And now I hope I have abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied all that are intelligible in making good this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Then I will tell you what it is.</p>
                     <p>Friends and Brethren, I do own a Reſurrection according to the Scriptures, and ſuch a Reſurrection as you all muſt partake of before ye can ſee the Kingdome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. There is a Reſurrection ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, which is the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, and of our riſing in and with him, from the ſtate of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to the ſtate of the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> but there were ſome then, as well as now, that did think the Apoſtle had meant carnallie the riſing again of the ſame bodie of fleſh and bones, and therefore did ask the queſtion, with what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they ſhall ariſe, not knowing what the Dead was, nor the life it ſhould be raiſed to, and how God giveth it a bodie as pleaſeth him. Now to prove this Reſurrection, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am he which was alive, and was dead, and am alive again, and lives for evermore.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roſewell.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you hear, he ſaith Chriſt was alive, and dead.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Coppin.</speaker>
                     <p>There is nothing can be ſaid to die, but firſt it muſt be alive, nor made to live, but it muſt firſt die: Now Chriſt is he which was alive, was dead, and is alive again; the firſt that was living, and the laſt that lives. <note place="margin">Revel. 1. 17: 18</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>John 11. 21. Martha</hi> comes to Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, if thou had'ſt been here, my Brother had not died: Chriſt ſaid, Thy Brother ſhall riſe againe: I know, ſaid</hi> Martha, <hi>he ſhall riſe at the Reſurrection, on the laſt day: Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the Life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, and he that lives and believes in me ſhall never die, Believeſt thou this?</hi> Now ſhe had Faith to believe that he was Chriſt, the Son of God, but could not believe the truth of her Brothers Reſurrection in Chriſt: therefore did-Chriſt blame her, ſaying, <hi>Had'ſt thou but believed, thou ſhould'ſt have ſeen the glory of God, John</hi> 11. 40.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:31743:22"/>
Now if Chriſt be the Reſurrection, and the Life, then there is nothing in this Reſurrection, but what is himſelf, for he is the dead raiſed, the raiſer of this dead, and the life raiſed too, as he ſaith, <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the Life.</hi> Now take notice that I do not denie any thing of Chriſt all this while, but do advance him, and alſo our Reſurrection in him, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are raiſed up together with him, to ſit in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and this is the myſterie of the Reſurrection, which you ſay is a great myſterie.</p>
                     <p>Now ſaith the Apoſtle to thoſe carnal enquirers that knew not this myſterie of the Reſurrection, but asked with what bodies they ſhould ariſe, <hi>Thou fool,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that which thou ſowest is not quickned, except it die, and thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or ſome other grain, ſo it is not, ſaith be, the ſame body which thou ſoweſt that is raiſed, but God giveth it a body as pleaſeth him.</hi> And why then, ſay you, that the ſame bodie ſhall be raiſed again?</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> to prove this ſpiritual Reſurrection, tells us, that there is one glorie of the Sun, another glorie of the Moon, and another of the Stars, and one Star differs from another Star in glorie; ſo alſo is the Reſurrection of the dead, it is ſown in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; 'tis ſown in diſhonor, it is raiſed in glorie; it is ſown in weakneſſe, it is raiſed in power, and all in us, that I may know him, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable to his death, if by any means I might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the Reſurrection of the dead, for which I preſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10: 11.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> So that this Reſurrection is to be within you, and you are to know it while you live in this bodie, for it is your riſing from faith to faith, from glorie to glorie, as from one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of God to another, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, I ſhew you</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31743:22"/>
earthly, and as is the heavenly, ſo are they that are heavenly;</hi> wherefore examine your ſelves, and you will now find it ſo, for you are all of you either in the ſtate of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or in the ſtate of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and your change is from the firſt to the ſecond, that as you have born the image of the earthly, ſo you ſhall bear the image of the heavenlie, for there is a bodie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and a bodie ſpiritual, all which are proper to us in this life: And thus <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of the Reſurrection in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
                     <p>Now take notice that I do not denie any Reſurrection in all this, which by any man may be proved, but I do declare to you the myſterie of this ſpiritual Reſurrection, which I know, and which you ſay is a myſterie: Secondly, conſider the death you are to be raiſed from, and that is the death that all men died in the ſtate of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and do ſtill die, by reaſon of ſin, from which death all ſhall be raiſed to life in Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> Now the wages of ſin is death, and that death which ſin doth bring on man, is the ſame death that Chriſt doth raiſe him from, <hi>For you who were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ: 2: 1: Coll: 3: 1:</note> 
                        <hi>and if ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where Chriſt ſiteth at the right hand of God,</hi> which is ſpoken in the Preſentence, and not in the Future, and cannot be meant of the riſing of our corporal bodies, after laid in the grave, which I queſtion whether thoſe that talk ſo much of that, do yet know this <hi>ſpiritual Reſurrection,</hi> which I hereby declare to you all; and if any one can tell us of another Reſurrection of the ſame body of fleſh, blood, and bones again as it was, let him declare that, as I have declared this, for I denie nothing which by any other can be proved, but the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That fleſh and blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, neither doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption inherit incorruption; therefore bleſſed and happy are all they</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As there is a bodie to be raiſed, ſo there is alſo a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be deſtroyed, and that is the bodie of ſin and death, which is to die, and no more to live, <hi>For if Chriſt be in you, the body is</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31743:23"/>
ſin, to newneſſe of life, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, by the glorie of the Father, even ſo ſhould we walk before him in newneſſe of life; for if we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his Reſurrection, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the bodie of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</p>

Firſt, there is God the Father that did create all things, and in whom all things live, when yet unknown to man, and that men might know him that is true, he did appear as a ſon amongſt men, to manifeſt himſelf <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5: 20:</note> to men, and ſo he is ſaid to be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God withus, which is alſo Chriſt in us the hope of glory: Thirdly, there is the Holy Spirit, and that is the compleat manifeſtation of the fulneſs of all things brought home to mans underſtanding, wherein God, Chriſt, and man appears, all but one in one God, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that we all may be made perfect in one;</hi> and <note place="margin">Iohn 17: 23: Iohn 14: 26:</note> ſaith he, <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall come, and teach you all things.</hi>

I ſay, Reprobation is the not knowing of God to be in you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. for becauſe they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind; but where there is God manifeſt in fleſh to the knowledge of any, there is Chriſt, and that man is no longer a reprobate, for then is God ſaid to walk in him, as being no longer ſtill and ſilent, but is ſeen and known to him; as when a man dwells in a houſe, ſhuting the windows to him, and will not be ſeen; ſo when God doth not only dwell in man, but alſo walk in man, diſcovering himſelf to man, by opening and leting in the light through the underſtanding of man, then is Father, Son, and Spirit, all three as one God, dwelling, walking, and manifeſting himſelf in man, <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will dwell amongſt you, and I will walk amongſt you, I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31743:29"/>
then man is not all wicked, nor all righteous, but part of both, as the Apoſtle was, in his firſt converſion, and ſo long there is a warfare in man, till the old man be wholly ſubdued, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Scripture, he that is in Chriſt is a new crature, old things are paſt away, and all things are become new.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Iſaiah 11: 9:</note> 2. doe ſay they are under wrath, you doe not from thence prove that it ſhall abide on them, for ever and ever; now I ſay, that that man which is under wrath muſt there remaine, till the Lord Jeſus doth come to him, to manifeſt himſelfe in him, to turne his wrath away from him, and ſo judg that in him for wrath, which is for wrath, and that for mercy which is for mercy; but becauſe you <note place="margin">Iſaiah 57: 16:</note> have not declared what this day of wrath and judgment is, I will, for a day of judgment there is, in which all men ſhall be judged, and receive according to their deeds, and if there be more then one day of judgment which I ſhall ſhew you, then doe you declare it, for I denie nothing which can be proved by any man from Scriptute.</p>
                     <p>Now the Scripture ſaith there is judgment appointed for all men, as 'tis written, <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment;</hi> and this death is adying into ſin and treſpaſſes, for the wages of ſin is death, which none can be delivered from, but by judgment, and the Lord Jeſus is to be the Judg of all, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath commited all judgment to the</hi>

                        <hi>Son, who will not judg by the ſight of the eye, nor hearing of the eare, but will judg righteous judgment; and Chriſt ſaith, for judgment am I come into this world, and now, ſaith he, is the judgment of this world is come; now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out;</hi> and as it began then, ſo it is not ended yet, but goeth on ſtill, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31743:32"/>
ſhall continue ſo long as there is any ſin, death, hell, or devill, to be judged, or condemned in man; And that every eare and eye, that heares and ſees any thing beſides Chriſt, ſhall be made deafe and blind, and every mouth that ſpeaks any thing beſides Chriſt the truth, ſhall be ſtopped, that ſo the Lord himſelf may be all in all, and ſaith <hi>Peter, The time is come that judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God, and if it begin at us, what ſhall the end be of them</hi>

                     <p>And this is not a viſible temporal Judgement on the bodies of men, but inviſible in the hearts of men, which is the Temple unto which God will come and dwell in, for the Lord, whom you ſeek, will ſuddainly come to his Temple, and there ſit as a Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1. 2: 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

later Ages, in which we have ſhuffled our ſelves out of a Church-form, Epiſcopacy to Presbytery, from thence to Independency, from Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency to Anabaptiſme, from Anabaptiſme to Seeking, from Seeking to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Liberty, and ſo we have loſt our ſelves we know not where: 1. We will ſee what is meant by Damnation, and that is in the Word, ſignified to be either temporal or eternal: 2. What is the evil ſpirit, and that is in oppoſition to the good ſpirit, that is the devil: 3. Conſider the perſons which he doth ſay are evil, and they are the Prieſts; now this word Prieſts was put into the Original Copy, thoſe are the Miniſters of the Goſpel lawfully called by God and men, and ſetled, by laying on of hands, and the Spirit, into a Congregation. Now that Propoſition that doth affirm, that the Miniſters which do tell people of damnation are evil spirits, he muſt of neceſſity be a Blasphemer; That Propoſition that doth ſay Chriſt is an evil ſpirit, that is blaſphemy, <hi>ergo:</hi> For Chriſt did preach this Doctrine, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, he that believes not, ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

                     <p>Your queſtion is far fetcht, and to little purpoſe, and I ſhall anſwer you thus, That thoſe Miniſters that do preach the Doctrine of Damnation, telling people they are eternallie damned, are no Goſpel Miniſters, and do preach from an evil Spirit; but Chriſt did not preach this Doctrine of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to any, for he did preach ſalvation to all men, and the <note place="margin">Luke 4: 18: Iohn 3. 17:</note> acceptable year of the Lord, <hi>For he came not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi>

For we muſt needs die, and are as water ſpilt upon the ground, which cannot be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up again, neither doth God reſpect any perſon, yet doth he deviſe means that his baniſhed be not expel'd from him; and this way and means is the Lord Jeſus, who was ſet up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, to be the way, the truth, and the light, yea, a witneſſe, <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.

               <p>The Allegorie is in this,, <hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſons, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-woman, the Bond-maid is the Law, or firſt Covenant, the Free-woman is the Goſpel, or ſecond Covenant in a myſterie; and theſe alſo are the two <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems, Sina</hi> and <hi>Sion;</hi> the one which is below, as in bondage, <note place="margin">Gall. 4. 21. <hi>end</hi>
