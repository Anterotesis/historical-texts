            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I May say of these words, as <hi>Simonides</hi> did of <hi>God,</hi> that when he had required but one day to resolue what GOD was; when the day was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he was more vnable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, then at the first. The more I thinke of the admirable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3219:7"/>
greatnesse of <hi>Gods</hi> loue toward vs, the more I may meditate of it, but the lesse able am I to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it; for mee thinkes I am enclosed in such a labyrinth, that I can neither by art nor nature extricate my selfe, like the sunne, which keepes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall motion, and yet neuer comes to an end. And indeede no meruaile, seeing that diuine loue which is in <hi>God</hi> differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from himselfe, for <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in Deo est, est ipse Deus</hi>: Whatsoeuer is in <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God himselfe.</hi> It is therefore as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for me fully to declare, and for you exactly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, what this loue of God is in it selfe, as to declare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what <hi>God</hi> himselfe is, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the one is infinite, so is the other; <hi>God</hi> is infinite in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3219:7"/>
essence, therefore not finite in his properties, therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueable by any finite creature. But as <hi>God</hi> himselfe cannot be expressed as he is in his diuine essence, but as he hath reuealed himselfe in his word and workes, so his loue seeing it is <hi>de escentia diuina,</hi> essentiall vnto him that is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, can onely be conceiued <hi>per nebulam,</hi> somewhat infirme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of vs, euen as he hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it in his word and workes toward his creatures.</p>
            <p>This verse mee thinkes may not vnfitly be compared vnto the two <hi>Cherubims</hi> which were on the mercy seate,<note place="margin">Exod. 37.9.</note> the one loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward the other: for <hi>God</hi> out of his meere fauour mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing his loue toward vs, first, hath begotten in vs a holy loue

                  <hi>Context.</hi>
               </note>The Apostle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in this Epistle, doth exhort vnto three graces especially; Faith, Loue, and Obedience; and these duties he doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably mixe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but Loue is the grace hee doth chiefly insist vpon, and oftnest exhort vnto. And this loue he sheweth hath two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3219:8"/>
The one more principall which is God: The other lesse principall which is man. <hi>God</hi> we must loue simply for him selfe, Man for <hi>God; God</hi> because he is <hi>God,</hi> Man because hee is <hi>Gods.</hi> Thus as the obiects of our Loue are diuers, so are their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet not so diuers as that they are contrary, but onely subordinate as the inferiour to the superiour.</p>
            <p>The words of my Text do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide themselues into these two branches:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Parts.</hi>
               </note> First, an affirmation of an effect wrought. Secondly, a declaration of the cause wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The effect wrought in these words. <hi>We loue him</hi>; wherin obserue three things. 1. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, <hi>Wee.</hi> 2. The action of this subiect, <hi>Loue.</hi> 3. The obiect of this action, <hi>Him.</hi> In the cause
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3219:9"/>
obserue foure things. 1. The efficient, <hi>God.</hi> 2. His affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Loue.</hi> 3. The obiect, <hi>Vs.</hi> 4. The extent. <hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Metaphrase</hi> of the words is this: True indeede it is, that all those which know <hi>God</hi> truely, and are begotten againe by the immortall seede of his diuine Word, and are indewed with the heauenly graces of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed spirit, doe intirely, and with ardent affection loue <hi>God</hi> their father who hath begot them: But whence proceeds this loue? is it from themselues? or haue they it radically or naturally growing in them? No questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse. <hi>God</hi> is as a fountaine of loue, who louing them first, hath so conueyed his loue into their hearts by the powerfull operation of his holy Spirit,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3219:9"/>
that the streame returnes vnto himselfe againe: and as the Sunne by his power, with the motion of the heauens, is the cause of all naturall heate in these sublunary creatures: So is <hi>God</hi> by the motion of his owne diuine loue, the efficient cause that worketh the heate of loue in all that feare him: We loue him indeed but not of our selues, but <hi>we loue him, because he loued vs first.</hi> Thus much for the meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>Seeing by order of nature the cause is before the effect, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is not so conuenient to handle the words as they lie in the Text, for it seemes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what preposterous: but I will rather begin with those words which are last in place, but first in nature; and so shall I shew,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3219:10"/>
first the loue of <hi>God</hi> to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being the cause, then our loue backe againe to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effect.</p>
            <p>Touching the loue of <hi>God</hi> I lay downe this <hi>Doctrine</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>That God before the foundation of the world hath, doth, and will loue those that are his elect.</hi> For so must wee vnderstand the text; the word <hi>vs,</hi> implying the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of <hi>Gods</hi> loue is not generall to all men, but particularly to be restrayned vnto those who doe rightly know <hi>God,</hi> and in knowing him doe truely and faithfully serue him. For as touching the wicked, I may say of them as <hi>Peter</hi> said of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> 
               <hi>They haue no part nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship in this matter,</hi> that is, in the inheritance of <hi>Gods</hi> loue; and till such time as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3219:10"/>
and effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, <hi>they are in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, and the bond of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is confirmed: First, by Scripture: Secondly, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. By scripture,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.2.</note> see <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I haue loued yee, saith the Lord, yet ye say wherein hast thou loued vs? Was not Esau Iacobs brother, saith the Lord, yet I loued Iacob. And I hated Esau, and laid his mountaines and heritage wast, for the dragons of the wildernes.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> contest with <hi>God,</hi> hee affirmeth he hath loued them, but they being (as they alwaies were) an vngrateful and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull nation, with bolde and impudent faces, doe not sticke to deny that euer <hi>God</hi> did testifie any loue to them; yea, they will not take <hi>Gods</hi> bare

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3219:11"/>
by no means be ignorant of the great loue that <hi>God</hi> had shewed vnto them. And a most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able place is that of <hi>Ieremie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31.3.</note> 
               <hi>I haue loued thee with an euerlasting loue, therefore with mercies haue I drawn thee.</hi> Where the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the greatnesse of his loue by the word <hi>euerlasting,</hi> which shewes that it is eternall, both <hi>a parte ante, et a parte post</hi> (as the Schooles speake) that is, both before the world was made, and after the world shall be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; now whatsoeuer was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, was eternall, and whatsoeuer shall be after the world, shall be eternall.</p>
            <p>Many other testimonies might be alledged for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this point; but let vs a little see what this loue of <hi>God</hi> is.<note place="margin">The loue of God.</note> Loue is nothing else but a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3219:12"/>
strong affection and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the thing beloued, with a contenting of the minde in the thing obtained. And so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie; <hi>Non solum aliquid velle, verum etiam in eo iam compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquiescere;</hi> not onely to loue &amp; desire, but also to rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the fruition of the thing desired. So the Greeke word in the text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to loue, signifies as much as to be content, for so <hi>Cicero</hi> turnes it. <hi>Phauorinus</hi> deriues it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, altogether, and with his whole minde to affect and giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the thing beloued. But others (and that I thinke more fitly) deriue it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>quod est, valde perfecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in re amata acquiescere</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3219:12"/>
greatly and perfectly to rest contented in the inioyment of the thing beloued.<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> So <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe pronounced from heauen touching <hi>Christ, Hic est filius meus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: This is my welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Sonne</hi>; and immediately as though he would giue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or etymologie of the word, he addes, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>in quo acquiesco; in whom I rest, or am well pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then there are in loue three things. 1. An affection or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereby we are enclined vnto the thing beloued. 2. There is a desire, whereby wee are strongly carryed to the inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the thing beloued. 3. A great ioy, whereby we rest our selues contented in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the thing desired. In these three things doth <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:3219:13"/>
in his booke <hi>De substantia delectionis,</hi> make loue to consist. Hence then we may easily see what loue is. <hi>It is an ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the mind, wherby the heart is moued towards that which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is truely or seemingly good, desiring to draw that good vnto it selfe, that it might enioy it, and in the fruition of it rest contented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loue doth vnite and knit two things together, that they become one; and from this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariseth a sympathie, that the louer doth not lesse feele the griefes and afflictions of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued then he himselfe, and the good and prosperity of the thing beloued, is not more its, then the louers.</p>
            <p>But the loue of <hi>God</hi> is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde, and of another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for loue in <hi>God</hi> is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3219:13"/>
for that he is perfection it selfe; but in vs loue is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being not without some passion and weaknes of minde. But such a loue is not in <hi>God,</hi> for he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, impatible, and cannot be moued, there being nothing in <hi>God</hi> that is seruile or base, or that argues any the least imperfection: but he is a diuine Maiesty, most glorious, most holy, most absolute in perfection, most free from any the least inclination to weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And howsoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him in the Scripture to compare his loue to the loue of a <hi>Mother</hi> toward her <hi>Childe,</hi> of a <hi>Henne</hi> toward her <hi>Chickens,</hi> of a <hi>Pastour</hi> toward his <hi>Sheepe,</hi> yea, of a <hi>Father</hi> grieuing at the misery of his <hi>Sonnes,</hi> and the like: yet this is but onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3219:14"/>
after the manner of men, that we may conceiue it; <hi>idque ob nostram vtilitatem,</hi> for our benefit (as <hi>Zanchius</hi> speaks) that we may be verily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the loue of <hi>God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, is most feruent, most sincere, and that from thence we may conceiue confidence to flye vnto him and to call vpon him.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note>But we must note that the loue of God consists in three things, which are absolutely perfect without any passion or motion of the minde. First, in his eternall <hi>beneuolence,</hi> that is, his eternall good-will vnto his Elect, and his euerlasting purpose of commiserating, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, preseruing, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his children: For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of Saint
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3219:14"/>
               <hi>Paul) before the children did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, yea, before they were borne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.11.</note> 
               <hi>God hated</hi> Esau, <hi>and loued</hi> Iacob. What was this loue that <hi>God</hi> bare vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> before he was borne? Euen his good-will that hee had toward him, whereby he had decreed the good and saluation of his soule. The second thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Gods</hi> loue doth consist, is his <hi>actuall beneficence,</hi> that is, in the outward effects of his inward loue; whether it be in things temporall, and belonging to this life, or eternall, respecting the life to come.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> And herein <hi>Gods</hi> loue is more excellent then Mans loue, and more pure then the loue of any creature; for <hi>God</hi> doth good to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not thereby to doe good to himselfe; whereas the loue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3219:15"/>
of man is not so much for the things sake beloued, as for the profit, pleasure, or content it bringeth with it. So that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing wherein the loue of <hi>God</hi> consisteth, is his readinesse to doe all things hee thinketh good for his children, and that not so much for his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit as for theirs:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Aristot.</hi>
               </note> for so the Phylosopher defines true loue. The third thing wherein the loue of <hi>God</hi> consists, is that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, oblectation,</hi> delight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and well-pleasingnesse that <hi>God</hi> findes in his elect: and in this sense wee finde it vsed.<note place="margin">Prou. 15.9.</note> 
               <hi>The way of the wicked is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to the Lord, but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him that followeth after righteousnesse.</hi> Here we see that the loue of <hi>God</hi> is taken neither for his <hi>beneuolence,</hi> nor <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:3219:15"/>
but for his approbation and delectation, his delight he takes in those that worke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; and on the contrary he hates, disalowes of, and is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at the wicked wayes of the vngodly. Thus wee see what the loue of <hi>God</hi> to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is; <hi>Euen his eternall purpose and decree of doing good vnto them, and the expressing of this inward and secret loue, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward euident testimonies of grace and fauour, and that freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in them, vniting himselfe vnto them, not for his owne good, but for theirs, euen to make them partakers of his goodnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we are to obserue,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> that there is a double loue in <hi>God.</hi> First, a generall loue, wherewith hee loueth all his creatures, and whereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is a speciall loue of <hi>God,</hi> wherewith hee loueth his Elect in <hi>Christ,</hi> not <hi>prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3219:16"/>
pleasure, and from the desire he had to doe good vnto them. And from hence it is, that he is neuer called the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> or of <hi>Esau,</hi> or of <hi>Saul</hi>: but the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>;<note place="margin">Exod. 3.6.</note> the God of the faithfull, whom he loueth for euer.

it by this definition. <hi>Amor erga Deum est gratia infusa in cordibus sanctorum per spiritum sanctum, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniens ab amore Dei erga ipsos; qua summa cum affectu Deum cognitum diligunt propter seipsum, &amp; in ipsius fruitione tanquam in summo bono ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescunt.</hi> Our loue toward <hi>God</hi> is a spirituall grace infused into the hearts of the faithfull by the holy spirit, flowing from <hi>Gods</hi> loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs; whereby wee knowing <hi>God,</hi> do loue him with al our might, with all our soule, and that for his owne sake, and in the enioyment of him doe rest contented. First I say it is a supernaturall or a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace infused, to teach vs that it is not naturally or habitually bred in vs; for we are by nature as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was before the promise, runne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes from <hi>God,</hi> neither desiring to see him, nor to heare him,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> till the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> worke this loue in vs by

Secondly, I say it is onely in the hearts of the faithfull, for it is limited and restrained to them, as to its proper subiect, no wicked man partaking with them in that worke; for hee that loues <hi>God</hi> must transcend nature and haue iustifying faith. Hee onely loues <hi>God</hi> that keepes his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hee onely keepes <hi>Gods</hi> Commandements whose heart is enriched with a true faith, for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impossible to please God.</hi>

               </gap>irst wee beleeue, and being knit vnto <hi>Christ</hi> by faith, then our hearts are knit vnto <hi>God</hi> by loue. Thirdly, I say it proceedes from <hi>Gods</hi> loue toward vs. <hi>Zanchius</hi> calls it, <hi>radius amoris Dei erga nos, in Deum reflesux</hi>; a beame of <hi>Gods</hi> loue toward vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected backe to him againe: <hi>Gods</hi> loue like a loade-stone drawes our hearts to loue him.

               </gap>monly among men, an easie matter to loue <hi>God,</hi> &amp; euery man abhors to be counted such a monster, as not to loue <hi>God,</hi> but they are much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, no man can loue <hi>God,</hi> but hee that is beloued of him with a sauing loue. <hi>Amor Dei, animae parit amorem. Gods</hi> eternall loue of vs, begets in our soules a loue of him: he is the <hi>Ocean</hi> of Diuine loue, from whence we deriue, and into which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the streames of our loue. Fourthly, I say we must know <hi>God</hi> before we can loue him. <hi>Quod latet ignotu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, ignoti nulla cupido</hi>:<note place="margin">Ouidius.</note> Things vnknowne are vnaffected, and loue is according to a mans acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: a man cannot loue <hi>God</hi> before he know what <hi>God</hi> is, and that he is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3219:43"/>
good, and worthy to be beloued; and such as is our knowledge, such is our loue; our knowledge of him in this world is not so perfect, as it shall be in the world to come; no more is our loue on earth so perfect as it shall be in the heauens.</p>
            <p>And this is the reason why wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men loue not <hi>God,</hi> because they know him not; did we but know <hi>God</hi> in his excellent goodnesse, wee would be rauished with desire to loue him; but the mistes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vapours doe so interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they darken our eyes, and ouer-cloude this Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that we see not, we think not of his glory, we desire not to know the perfection of his Maiesty: Things vnknown, are not beloued; loue neuer shoots at a blind marke: Let vs first labour rightly to know <hi>God,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal we be sure truly to loue <hi>God.</hi> Fiftly, if we loue <hi>God</hi> truly, I say

Thus many wicked men seeme to loue <hi>God,</hi> not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but for his benefits. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by <hi>Sathan</hi> against <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 1.9.</note> but falsely, <hi>that he serued God for his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>: But <hi>Iob</hi> manifested himselfe to be a true louer of <hi>God,</hi> for then when he was depriued of all earthly comforts which <hi>God</hi> had giuen him, yet did the loue of <hi>God</hi> continue in him.

It is true loue to loue <hi>God</hi> simply for his own sake; let vs loue his glory more then our owne benefit, least we be found louers of our selues more then of <hi>God</hi>: This is the reason why the loue of the godly is constant in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity; though their riches and friends be gone, yet <hi>God</hi> remaines, and so long as the obiect remaines,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3219:45"/>
the action of their loue shall not cease; if wee loue <hi>God</hi> wee must loue him for himselfe. Lastly, whereas I saide true loue doth rest contented in the enioyment of <hi>God</hi> whom it loueth: It sheweth the delight and sufficiency it findes in <hi>God</hi>; it cannot rest till it enioy him, and he being enioyed, it rests contented. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>De substantia dilectionis.</hi> Cap. 2. layes down this definition of <hi>Loue,</hi> which containes in it the two forenamed properties. <hi>Amor est affectio cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis ad aliquid, cum desiderio in appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo, et gaudio in perfruendo, per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderium currens, per gaudium requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arly be affirmed of the <hi>Loue of God.</hi> First, there is a desire whereby we are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> for as hatred doth disioyne and segregate, so loue doth vnite and knit the desire
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3219:46"/>
of the louer to the thing beloued. Secondly, in the fruition there is rest and content: hatred breeds dislike; auersation and discontentednesse, loue causeth ioy, delight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; when loue hath once possessed <hi>God,</hi> it mooues the soule to ioy in <hi>God,</hi> and to account him her chiefest happinesse, so that it wil cry out with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25.26.</note> 
               <hi>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and whom haue I desired in earth with thee? God is my strength and my portion for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I laide downe briefly as I could in this definition, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall properties of our loue of <hi>God,</hi> which are in number seauen. 1. It is a Diuine grace wrought by the Spirit. 2. It is onely proper to the regenerate. 3. It is an effect of <hi>Gods</hi> loue to vs. 4. It is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with the knowledge of <hi>God.</hi> 5. It is constant in <hi>vnity</hi> and in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity.</hi> 6. It is not mercenary, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3219:46"/>
free. 7. It is eager for the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and content in the fruition.</p>
            <p>The second thing considerable is the markes and effects of our loue of <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Markes of the loue of GOD.</note> whereby we may truely try as by a touchstone, whether our loue be sincere or adulterate; the effects are many for number, but I will onely recite those which are most principall, and they are sixe. First, the loue of <hi>God</hi> doth quench all vnchast loues. There are 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sorts of loue. One is alwayes good, the 2. is alwayes bad: the 3. is good in it selfe, but bad through our bad disposition. That which is alwaies good, is the loue of <hi>God,</hi> in which it is impossible to sinne through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, for we cannot loue <hi>God</hi> too much, the measure of louing him is to loue him without measure. That loue which is alwaies bad, is the loue of that which is absolutely euill: <hi>Actus distinguitur per obiectum,</hi> an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3219:47"/>
euill obiect makes an euill action, and this is the loue of murder, theft vnchast pleasures, these haue no mediocrity, for the least inclination to them is a sinne. The loue which is good by nature, and becommeth euill by accident, is the loue of meate, drinke, riches, honour, and the like; the loue of these things is made euill by the excesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of the louer. Now the former of these, which is the loue of <hi>God,</hi> doth quite extirpate and roote out the second, which is the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue; and it doth rectifie that loue which may be bad through our euill disposition; for in meates, drinkes, and apparrell the loue of <hi>God</hi> moueth vs to satisfie our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, not our curiosity; in riches to labour for sufficiency, not for superfluity. Search therefore thine owne heart with an vndazeled and vndissembling eye, and if vpon the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3219:47"/>
inquiry thou finde all adulterate and vnchaste loue rooted out of thy heart, and thy heart to be so wedded and marryed to the <hi>Lord</hi> that nothing can a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The first helpe to purchase this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> loue of <hi>God</hi> is Prayer.
