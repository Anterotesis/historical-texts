            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Math. 10.40.</note> thou art troubled about many things, but one thing is necessarie. That which troubleth vs <hi>Salomon</hi> calles vanytie; that which is necessarie he calles the feare of God: From that to this should be euerye mans pilgrimage in this worlde. We begin all vanitie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

knowe perfectlye, that we are vaine, vntill we repent with <hi>Salomon.</hi> Therefore this is his first greeting and lesson to all after his conuersion, to warne them that all is vanitie: as if God had saide to him as he saide to Ezek. <hi>Cause Ierusalem to knowe her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominations</hi>;<note place="margin">Exe. 16.2.</note> as though men did not know their sinnes how vaine they are,<note place="margin">Iob. 15.31.</note> (as <hi>Eliphar</hi> saith) he beleeueth not that he is vaine, which makes euerye man defer his repentance, vntill the houre come that sinne will leaue him, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is vnwilling to departe because he is not ready. Therefore I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen this sentence, which speakes of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanitie, to shewe how we take the way to miserie, for the waye to happines, and turne the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to the day of vanytie. Let euery man thinke as I go why he should loue that which <hi>Salomon</hi> repented, if we thinke <hi>Salomon</hi> happier now then he was before.

               <hi>Salomon</hi> begins with it and endes with it, as if he should say, first this is the matter which I will proue, &amp; after this is the matter which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: now ye see whether I tolde you true that all is vanitie, I may call it <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamons</hi> Theame: or the Fardell of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which when he hath bound in a bundell, he bids vs cast it into the fire: for after he hath done with them in his last Chap: and 13. ver. as though he would haue no more thought of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he turnes away from them as if he had buried them, and goes to another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saying: now let vs heare the end of all: Feare God and keep his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, for this is the whole duetie of man. As though he were exceeding glad, that after so many da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers through the roote of vanitie, yet God let him see the hauen of rest, and brought him to the right end, and set him vpon the shore, where he might see all his vany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: as <hi>Moses</hi> looked backe vpon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, &amp; sawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drowned behinde

him. The whole narration doth shew, that <hi>Salomon</hi> wrote this book after his fall, when he had th'experience of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyties, and had seene the sollie of the worlde, what euill comes of pleasure, and what frute growes of sinne, he was bolde to say <hi>Vanitie of vanities, &amp;c.</hi> which he auoucheth with such prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, as though he would iustifie it against many Aduersaries, for all the worlde is in loue with that which he calles vanitie. Therfore he puts to his name in the middest of his sentence, as if he would defend it against all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aske who broched this strange Doctrine, the Preacher (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>:) to testifie his hartie conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, he calles himselffe a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, besides all the titles he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: as a witnes of his vnf<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>Salomon</hi> left this book a monument to all ages of his conuersion. Therfore they which write thar <hi>Salomon</hi> died in his sinne, and that such a famous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of God went to the damned, do great wrong to the worthie King, which giues them such an example to repent, and would correct their rashe Iudgement, if they considered, Firste,<note place="margin">Psa. 45.7.</note> that he was the cleerest figure of christ (except <hi>Melchisedech</hi>) which passed all prosperitie and all men in wisedome. Secondlye, that he was inspired with the holy Ghost like the prophets,<note place="margin">1. Cro. 17.13.</note> to be one of the Pens of God to write his holy word, the word of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was not fit for a reprobate. Thirdlye: that God promised to his Father, that he would not take his trueth and his mercie from him, as he did from <hi>Saule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24</note> nor forsake him as he did <hi>Saule,</hi> but correct him in an other sorte. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Nehe. 13.6</note> that God is saide to loue him,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Paule</hi> concludes, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was elected, because God saith, <hi>Jacob haue
<pb facs="tcp:13812:5"/>
I loued</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> so we may conclude that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was elected, because he saith, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon haue I loued.</hi> Lastly, we may gather out of the seuenth Chaptet of this Booke, and 30. verse, and out of the 5. of the Prouerbes 14. verse, that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had left his concubines and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before he wrote these bookes.</p>
            <p>Therefore to saye that the figure of Christ, the pen of the holye Scriptures, the man whom God loued, the wisest man that euer was died a reprobate, is presumption against the word, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie against god, and wrong to the dead: although because of his greeuous fall, in Idolatrie &amp; vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, God left him in disgrace, and makes no mencion of repentance, where he speakes of his deathe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.12.</note> that they which stande may take heede least they fall, and see how easie it is to slip, by the example of him that was wiser then they.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing found as it were the myne, now let vs dig for the treasure. <hi>Vanitie of vanities, &amp;c.</hi> This is <hi>Salomons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13812:5"/>
conclusion when he had giuen ouer the worlde, and tryed all things like a spie sent into a strange Countrie, as if he were now come home from his pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; they gather about him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what he hath heard, and seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, &amp; what he thinks of the world, and those things which are so loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men: like a man in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which he had seene, and not able to expresse partitularlye one after another, he contractes his newes into a word, you aske me what I haue seene, and what I haue heard, <hi>Vanytie</hi> saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> and what els, <hi>Vanytie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and what els, <hi>all is vanytie</hi>: this is the historie of my voyage, I haue seene nothing but vanitie ouer the worlde, carrye this for the newes from the Preacher, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, Vanitie of vanities,</hi> all is <hi>vanitie,</hi> and more then <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> So the further he did goe, the more vanitie he did see? &amp; the neerer he looked, the greater it seemed, till at the last he could see nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
<pb facs="tcp:13812:6"/>
when he was come to this that he did see all things vaine, vpon which men set their hartes, he was mooued with compassion and could be silent no longer, but needes he must write to them which seeke felicitie (as he did) in transitorye thinges, to warne them that they seeke not any longer in these foolish things which haue no stabilitie nor contentation, but flye from them to the fear of God which hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of this life and the life to come. Therfore he begins with all is vanitie; as if he should say, loue not the worlde nor the the things of the worlde, for I haue tryed that there is no certaintye nor contentation in them.<note place="margin">Eccle. 12.13.</note> Thus he drawes them first fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrong way, and then sets them in the right way to happynes, which he desineth at last to be, feare God &amp; keep his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When he had gone through a thousand vanityes, then that comes in at the end: euen like our repentaunce which staies till death. So his driste is
<pb facs="tcp:13812:6"/>
to showe that mans happynes is not in these thinges which we counte of: but in those thinges which we deferre. His reason is, they are all vanitye; his proof is because there is no stabilitye in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor contentation of minde, his coclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, therfore contemne the worlde, and looke vp to heauen from whence ye came and whether ye goe. This is the scope which <hi>Salomon</hi> aymes at, as though we did seeke happynes, but we goe a wrong way vnto it, therfore he sounds a retyre, showing that if we goe on as we haue begun, we shall not find happynes but miserye, because we goe by vanityes: therfore to fright vs out of this way, he breaks forth into an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>Vanitie of vanities &amp;c.</hi> Now, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> full of wisdome &amp; schooled with experience,<note place="margin">1.

               </note> is licenced to giue his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the whole world. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man iudgeth all things, his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so certain, that it runnes before the euidence, and condemns all for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye, before he conuince them to be
<pb facs="tcp:13812:7"/>
vaine. Neuer any Iudge did condemne so many togither. <hi>Salomon</hi> resolued all the doubts of the Queen of <hi>Shaeba,</hi> yet <hi>Salomon</hi> neuer answered so many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions at once, as now: for what can ye inquire, but here you haue an answere? aske him as the soldiars or harlots, or Publicanes asked Iohn, <hi>Maister what is sinne? vanitye</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> what is ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? <hi>vanitye</hi> too. what is beauty? <hi>vanity</hi> too. what is riches? <hi>vanitye</hi> too. what is honour? <hi>vanitye</hi> too. what is longe life? <hi>vanitye</hi> too. This is the state of things after the fall, all turned to vanitye. This is no reproch to the things, but a shame to him, which so abused them, that all thinges should be called vaine for him. What a testimony is this of him which should be the onely seruant of God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, whome he created in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and righteousnes, whom he framed to his owne image, whom he placed in Paradice, &amp; would haue raysed to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to heare that he hath so poluted him selfe with euerye sinne, that now

that place &amp; citie which should be best in the world, (that all men in the Citie were vaine) calles it the citie of vanitie: so we may say the world of vanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she hath an interest in euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it.

O that we might heare kings speake so again, for it is a speech which had need to haue some to countenance it: for none are counted vaine now, but they that speake against vanitie.

When they shoulde perfourme they play <hi>Laban,</hi> which gaue <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel.</hi> If they be lying <hi>vanities,</hi> and deceitfull <hi>vanities,</hi> then are they wilful and miserable <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> Therefore if we be not come to <hi>Salomons</hi> conclusion, to thinke that all is <hi>vanitie,</hi> it is because our vanitie will not suffer vs to see the vanitie of other things. When wee haue prooued like <hi>Salomon,</hi> as fast as euery man groweth
<pb facs="tcp:13812:18"/>
in knowledge and experience, so he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins to crie <hi>vanitie,</hi> and after that <hi>vanity of vanities,</hi> and at last, <hi>all is vanitie</hi>: so we contemne not al at once, but one sinne after another, one lust after another, one pleasure after another, til at last we count all vanitie: and then we are come home with <hi>Salomon,</hi> and may be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers vnto other. Thus I haue shewed you, as it were, a line of vanity, you may look about you and see the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for if she be any where in this land, this is her Pontificall sea, where shee is neuer non resident. Now I will leaue you to examin this saying, whether all thinges haue not been vaine vnto you yet: if they haue bin vaine to you, and yet are good in their own nature, then think you how vain you are, who haue turned so many good things to vanity. Yet to set you in the way before I end, I will answere them which aske if all things be vanitie (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) tell vs what we shall chuse that we be not vaine. Christ saith that one thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.
<pb facs="tcp:13812:19"/>
Is <hi>Salomon</hi> contrary to Christ? No: therefore one thing. <hi>Salo,</hi> excepts two, <hi>Feare God, and keep his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>: this doth extoll godlines, that al things are put vnder her feet, and coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vaine besides her. Therefore if all be vaine but this, let the tempter take thee vp againe, and shew thee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, when he saith, All these will I geue thee: thou mayst say, all these I contemne, for all is vanitie. What then? turne away mine eyes saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> and mine eares, and my hart too from vanitie. Trie and proue thou no longer, for <hi>Sal.</hi> hath prooued for thee, it is better to beleeue him, then trye with him. Therfore now it remaineth that as they brought foorth their vaine bookes after <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, and caste them into the fire: so ye should cast out al your vanities this day, &amp; sacrifice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, for they haue been your idols, therfore bury them as <hi>Iacob</hi> did the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, that neuer man see them after: and as God gaue <hi>Iob</hi> other children, so hee
<pb facs="tcp:13812:19"/>
wil geue you other pleasures. Feare not that your ioyes will go away with your vanities, as many think they shal neuer be mery againe, if they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to religion, but as <hi>Dauid</hi> daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the arke, as merely as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> daunced before the king: so know vndoubtedly, that the righteous finde more ioy in goodnesse, then euer the wicked founde in filthines: nay saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> more then they can finde in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or honors, when their wheate and wine abound. As a horse is a vain thing to saue a man, so al these things are too vaine to make a man happy. I appeale to your selues, if ye haue tried the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of vanitie already, as I know you haue, whether ye may say with <hi>Paul,</hi> what profit haue wee of those thinges wherof we are ashamed? no profit, but shame, and griefe, and guilt, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full execution of iudgement. As <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calles folly the inheritance of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> so vanitie is al the inheritance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Tenne times <hi>Laban</hi> changed <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13812:20"/>
wages, but ten thousand times sin hath changed your wages, &amp; deceiued you with other successe then you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for,<note place="margin">Esa. 22</note> like <hi>Shebna,</hi> which built his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre in one countrie, &amp; was buried in another: and yet how many changes are behind you know not, for if ye did, you would make inquisition, &amp; banish them at first, for whensoeuer you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cast them out, they will say stil like the deuils, that thou tormentest them before the time. It seemes that many are touched with compassion of this, and therfore repriue their vanities and slack th' execution, as though they were afraid to offend the deuill. Euen we perhaps are yet in the trace of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hunting with <hi>Salomon</hi> to finde that which we loue, and find it not, because we seek out of the way, what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie? so run; saith <hi>Paul,</hi> that yee may obteine, you haue tried the euill way to happines, now trie the good way, &amp; then that which ye loue now, shall not only seem vain, but vanitie of vanities,
<pb facs="tcp:13812:20"/>
that ye wil maruell how ye could loue them so long, and would not be in that dotage againe with them for all the world: vntil these earthly things seem vain, no heauenly thing shal seem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, therefore lose no more time, the day comes when vanitie of vanities shalbe turned into miserie of miseries, and al is vanitie too, all is miserie: there is a certain place called hel, there God keepes generall sessions, there Iustice shal sit to examine vanitie, who hath imbraced her, and who hath forsaken her for God, and hee which made his pleasure of sinne, so soone as he heares this doome, depart ye wicked, shall go downe by a blacke way, with many a sigh and sob, from God, from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, from the Saintes, from ioy, from glorie, from blisse; with the fiendes of hell, to sup in the pallace of darckenes, with the princes of horror, at the table of vengeance, in the chaire of calamity, with the crowne of death vppon his head, and he which tempted him to sin
<pb facs="tcp:13812:21"/>
shall plague him for sinning, vntill hee crie with <hi>Cain,</hi> my punishment is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I can beare. <hi>Gen. 4.13.</hi> for al the griefs, and feares, and thralles, &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which fed vpon him while hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, shall meet in an houre, and exceed them so farre, that he shall thinke that he suffers for all; and maruell how anie torment can be leste for other. What faith or feare haue they which goe dauncing and leaping to this fire, like a foole which ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth to the stocks? how happy were it for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we liue in these daies, if there were no iudgement at all? what wil we answere when he who made <hi>Salomon</hi> to write this, shall aske why we would not beleue it? what shal we say when hee which came from his kingdome to bring vs vnto it, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds why we did turne the day of saluation into the day of vanitie? If ye cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it here, how wil ye defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it there? we were born in vanitie, we liue in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but we would not die in vanity, because no man lookes for any good
<pb facs="tcp:13812:21"/>
of his sinnes, after he is past this world: therefore let vs remember, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vaine men are gone, thether vaine men shal goe: there be not two ends for sinners, but one; what a woful bargain will it seem then to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that thou didst sell thy soule for vanity. If any thing wil reclaime vs, this wil be a terror in our hearts, to think that we shall geue account vnto him that will measure to vs as much miserie, as wee haue taken vanitie. Therfore as <hi>Abner</hi> said to <hi>Joab,</hi> knowest thou not that it will be bitternes in the later end,<note place="margin">Sa. 11.26</note> so let euery man consider with himselfe, though his vanitie be sweete now, yet they will be bitter in the end. As <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> after he had fulfilled his lust, did hate <hi>Thamar</hi> (which defiled him) more then he loued her before: so when the spurt is past, and death lookes vs in the face, wee shall hate our vanities more, then we loue them now. All this doeth conclude that which our Sauiour said
<pb facs="tcp:13812:22"/>
to <hi>Martha,</hi> but one thing is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which God grant we may chuse for his sonne Iesus Christ, and then we haue learned this lesson.</p>
