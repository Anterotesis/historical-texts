         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Hitherto <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agaynſt the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi>: who doth therin ſo playnly reaſon agaynſt Pope <hi>Gregorie, Alexand.</hi> the other Popiſhe Canons, and <hi>D.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1685:24"/>
But ſyth they ſay to marry, and man and woman therein to ioyne, is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vncleaneneſſe: which if it were vnpure in nature, yet, for that God hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame, it is then ſanctified: therefore the fathers conclude, that the <hi>Tatianiſts</hi> deny God (whoſe wil can not be vncleane) to be the authour therof, and ſay it is of the Diuell, who is the roote of all impureneſſe.

Thus far <hi>Origen</hi>: by whoſe wordes it may euidently appeare, that it is a doctrine contrary to the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an heauy burthen and doctrine of wicked ſpirites and tirannes to forbid mariage, or reſtrayne it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all men, but in any man that can not abſtayne. When as certayne in the generall councell at <hi>Nice,</hi> which beganne <hi>Anno. 315.</hi> woulde haue mariage for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the cleargie men alone, as vncleane: then <hi>Paphnutius</hi> (as <hi>Sozo. li. 1. cap. 23.</hi> ſayth) ſtart vp ſaying, <hi>Concubitium cum propria vxore caſtitatem eſse.</hi> that it is chaſtitie for a man to accompany with his owne wife: wherevnto the whole counſell agréed. <hi>Eaque in re nihil ſtatuit, ſed eam in vniuſcuiuſque arbitrium, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſsitatem reiecit.</hi> And determined nothing thereof, but left it indifferent to euery mans owne wil. <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo leaueth it frée and reſtrayneth no man there from: onely he ſayth to the woman, <hi>quae nubat, in Domino nubat</hi> ſhe that marrieth, let her marry in the Lorde. Wherefore the true doctrine is, to let matrimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in al men indifferently, that thoſe that wil, may marry, euen of the cleargie. And ſo it ſhoulde ſéeme it was practized. As in <hi>.56. Diſtinct. c. Oſius.</hi> There is <hi>.7.</hi>

Therefore the fyrſt poynte is playne,<note place="margin">Mariage muſt be free</note> that matrimonie is to be lefte indifferent. And that it is doctrine (as beforeſayd) of erronious ſpirits, to reſtrayne the ſame in any wiſe.</p>
               <p>This notwithſtanding, all the Popes kingdome, that is his cleargie, (for they are his proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſubiects) as the Monks, Chanons, Nunnes, with all ſeculare Prieſtes and Regularies, could not be to their orders and rules admitted, vnleſſe matrimonie contracted and now and then ſolemnized, were broken and alſo forbydden and reſtrayned, as <hi>in libr. 6. c. quod votum</hi>: and in the Decretalls <hi>de conuerſ. coniug. per totum,</hi> may appeare. Of theſe the very Church and kingdome of the Pope, immediatly conſiſted. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men whome he could peruert with his error, were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye admitted to his immediate iuriſdiction. And yet though this curſed Cowes hornes were ſo ſhorte, that he coulde not ſequeſter all men, but onely thoſe ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, from matrimonie, is he therefore of any better minde, yea holier or ſounder, than <hi>Tatian</hi> was, who admitted none to his ſpeciall ſorte, but ſuch as would not marrie? Pardie his will was ſo. For if a married man was choſen a byſhop, he muſt put away his wife, ſweare continencie, &amp; his wife muſt become a Nunne, though ſhe were his firſt wife. I woulde aſke this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: whether they counted them not the holier that vowed chaſtitie and abſtayned matrimonie. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſayth yea, Then whether they wiſhed not, yea &amp; taught all men to purſue the ſame holy eſtate as beſte: which if they did, then they condemned matrimonie.

<pb facs="tcp:1685:31"/>
as ſpoken. Which if it was not then ſo meant, at the time of pronouncing, as at the time of ſwearing, then (as before I ſayde) he is wylfully periured: bycauſe he promiſed to contract matrimonie, which is not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vnleſſe his hearte meane the pronouncing of hys mouth.<note place="margin">In addi. ad <hi>3.</hi> q. <hi>45.</hi> ar. <hi>4.</hi>

Which the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſay they) admitteth not, as alſo here the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſéemeth to meane. And therfore will conclude, the <hi>Montaniſtes</hi> had mariage bycauſe of copulation: But in this caſe there is no matrimonie, bicauſe there is no copulation.

For it is proued before in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrée chapters alleaged, that aſſone as the parties haue conſented, to hold and to haue eche other, they then from that time, are huſband and wife: though copulation followe not. By reaſon wherof, thei can not conclude: thei haue not coupled their bodies togither: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not man and wife: no more than if the <hi>Paſquil</hi> ſhould ſay: Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> hath coupled hir body with hir Cardinall or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, or horſe keper: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are man and wife.

<pb facs="tcp:1685:33"/>
matrimonie doth onely and eſſentially conſiſt, though there were neuer copulation had therin. So that if we graunt that the elder <hi>Montaniſtes</hi> had carnall copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their mariages, and that the caſe of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall had none: yet bycauſe mariage is the conſent and not the acte of. &amp;c. by the which conſent once giuen, the right of their bodies is tranſferred to eche other: yea though there followe no copulation: therefore Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> for vowe of religion ſeuering them that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (as are the conſenters, though abſtayners) muſt be a <hi>Montaniſt.</hi> And the moſt ſhift is, to ſay that he is not with the vulgare people, ſo open &amp; manifeſt, as the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who is more gentler of the twayne.

The which notwithſtanding, he afterward might enter into religion and vowe if he woulde. The clauſe, <hi>Si tamen,</hi> which therevpon followeth, is then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1685:33"/>
onely added, bycauſe he thereby ſhould declare, that he ſtarteth not from that purpoſe: and as they call it <hi>(non conuolat ad vota directè contraria continentiae,)</hi> did not eſtabliſh himſelfe in the ſtate of matrimony: which is direct contrary to their <hi>Tatian</hi> rules and religion, as <hi>S.

That a mans will preuented of God, by loue of the ende, can in matters of fayth gouerne and rule the inquiſition and ſearching out of the meanes, finde out what is moſt méeteſt, &amp; chooſe that which he ſhall iudge moſt commodious.

               <p>Thus haſt thou heard (gentle reader) how <hi>Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Byſhop and father of the counſell, indicteth, yea and conuicteth <hi>Dominicus Sotto,</hi> by his owne wordes a felon.

               <p>Yet that notwithſtanding, I thought it my parte gentle reader, before I ende this poynt, to make thée priuy to two things. One is, that although the ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, that man of his owne frée will, can worke &amp; do that which is good: Yet for al that, ſome of them wil not graunt, but man for the entraunce into heauen, muſt obtayne grace.<note place="margin">Euen wyth the Pelagians</note> Bycauſe, though his déede is <hi>(bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tamen non meritoriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> good, yet it is not meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In this they go iuſt togither with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as out of the ſame authoritie of <hi>Hierome, ad Cteſiphon.</hi> appeareth. But this is talked of, vppon the poynte of ſhame: and as I may ſay at a deade lifte. The ſeconde is,<note place="margin">More than the Pelagians</note> howe that they goe beyonde the olde <hi>Pelagian,</hi> who ſayth, that a man hath néede, and is to be ayded and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1685:41"/>
inſtructed, by the law, as is before in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame authority of <hi>Hierome</hi> alleaged.

As if thou mark, (to let others for briefeneſſe paſſe,) <hi>Roffenſis</hi> in the laſt authoritie, thou ſhalt well perceiue.</p>
               <p>The firſt braunch of this roote is now to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: that is, their error and ignoraunce of originall ſinne, which muſt nedes be in the Church of both theſe <hi>Pelagians</hi>: bycauſe that they erre in, and be ignorant of the doctrine of man, his abilitie, and vnabilitie, as I may ſay, his pouertie and wealth. Wherout muſt née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des come and procéede, the doctrine and knoweledge of his originall ſinne and debte. This therefore is their error.</p>

In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which wordes, well mayſte thou (gentle reader) ſée, that he is ignoraunt of originall ſinne: bycauſe he erreth in the effect that followeth the ſame, the want of willes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:1685:42"/>
falſely teach the ſoule his frée will to remaine.

The ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me therfore of their doctrine which I meane here to note) is: that originall ſinne, is not any thing in any of vs: but in <hi>Adam</hi>: (as touching the empairing of the power of mans ſoule) &amp; yet they graunte, that we haue a blemiſhe or hindraunce thereby, which according to their true meaning,<note place="margin">Hilar.

                  </note> had tried by foure yeares ſpace the life in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, as alſo the prowling life of beggers, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to finde (among all) ſome maner of life whereby he might attayne to the holieſt, was admoniſhed to liue and be contented with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rule of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: the Goſpell of the Lord Ieſus. For in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <hi>S.

As if Chriſt ſhould ſay. <hi>Frauncis,</hi> diſtract not thy mind to this or that eſtate of life, thinke not ſometimes to become a <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> ſomtime a <hi>Bernhardine,</hi> or ſuch like. For the rule of righteouſneſſe conſiſteth in the Goſpell, the common rule and religion of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. After the like ſorte <hi>Antonius Heremita</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, aboute <hi>Anno Domini. 350.</hi> &amp; perſuaded (as <hi>Petrus Pariſsie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ.

And therefore when any Monkes came to hym for rule of life, he offred the ſame Goſpell to be onely folowed by them: &amp; infecting them therewith, thought (as I iudge <hi>S.

But this good zeale of <hi>Frauncis</hi> toke ſmall effect, for it ſared therwith, as it doth wyth good hearbes, that ſette in a dry ſommer and deawleſſe dayes, ſone wyther. I ſo ſay, bycauſe that the Popes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1685:77"/>
holyneſſe ſtrayght way caught it by the ende, pearced the roote, and by expounding the purpoſe of <hi>Frauncis</hi> peruerted the religion. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the .ix. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third, and <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, eche in his time began to approue, expounde, and ordayne <hi>Frauncis:</hi> or rather miſforme him: as by the example of the vnnaturall chaungelings of theſe late yeares appeareth. Where <hi>Frauncis</hi> would haue obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God in Ieſus Chriſt ſworne, there muſt they ſweare obedience to <hi>Francis.</hi> In place of folowing the rule of the goſpel, they muſt folowe the Popes explication. In ſteade of ſuch edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pure Sermons, they muſte preach Legende lies, <hi>Ouidius Metamorphoſis,</hi> an ouerworne Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell or Epiſtle in Latine, and Canonicall houres. And for working for their liuing, they muſte loyter. For a poore Couent or Cloyſter, a Kings palace and wealth. Finally, in ſteade of the putting out of one pore hand for a pennie, holde a hoode of a pecke. Well, thereby declared they (to the wiſe man) their couetous hearts and larger conſciences. Wherefore I dare aduouch if <hi>Frauncis</hi> ſawe thoſe that chalenge his name, in theſe dayes, he woulde, marking their fatte chéekes &amp; ſofte handes, ſay they are no <hi>Franciſcanes,</hi> but <hi>Pſallians.</hi> And marking their continual pratling, and ſmal prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, alſo ſay they are no <hi>Franciſcans</hi> but <hi>Pſallians.</hi> But for all their deformities, he would laſt of all, ſay they are <hi>Cerberus</hi> whelpes: and their Couent a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell for the ſame. If the <hi>Franciſcanes</hi> of our dayes are myſſeſhapened: If that godly be ſo peruerted, that they are become rather the Heretiques of their founders than folowers, what ought a man then to iudge of the reſt: if the ſame rule of <hi>Frauncis</hi> or any other more were good. And as touching ſuch orders whoſe rule &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:1685:78"/>

As he alſo hath done <hi>Mahomet</hi> the eronious trée without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, which both are nouriſhed with the water of ignoraunce. Euen as ſo to be, is the maner of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. For if either <hi>Simon</hi> had wel receyued the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the holy ghoſt, or <hi>Iudas</hi> of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> it is not to be thought that they would haue departed from the Church: Falling when they ſéemed to ſtand, deceyued by arrogancie, which I may properly call ignorance. The which ſith it was ſo néedeful for the beginning of this trée, is by the aforeſayd <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the Popiſts, vſed as a no leſſe neceſſary pollicie, and licoure for the maintayning and watering of the ſame. Neyther doe the Popiſtes miſſereſemble their brother <hi>Mahomete</hi> whoſe religion writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the olde <hi>Arabical</hi> tong, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of not interpreting &amp; expounding the ſame, beyonde the literall ſenſe, hath vnder mighty and thundering termes, being otherwiſe ſenſeleſſe and ſpiritleſſe, ruled the poore ſely ſoules, as <hi>Iupiters</hi> blocke amongſt a number of frogges.

Surely the Romiſhe cleargies ignoraunce was ſuch, that within theſe fiftie yeares (as common reporte is) they ſayd in the vniuerſitie ſcholes, when gréeke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hapned to hand, It is Gréeke and can not be read. And what Latin they did vnderſtand, write or ſpeake, it is to common nowe to minde. And yet were they proude in this their ignoraunce. But I may not let paſſe to remember what gréeuous and haynous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques they were counted that did read, &amp; much more that expounded or talked of the ſcriptures, in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tong. Wherefore ſithens they were wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéene in all good letters, language, and learning, (as wel ſhéepe as ſhepheard) it is no maruell though they fell into error, no more than if blinde guides or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers in the dark, ſhuld do into the pit. For whereas none can giue good counſell, the citie decayeth, as it did in the dayes of <hi>Roboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
