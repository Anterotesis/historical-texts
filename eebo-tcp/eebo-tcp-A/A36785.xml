            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Moſt Excellent PRINCE
JAMES
Duke of Monmouth, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have often wondered that the Cruelties as
well as Villanies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church have
not long ere this provoked Almighty God to
avenge upon her all the Blood of his Saints, which
ſhe hath every where as ſo much Water, ſpilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the whole Earth; but reflecting upon
the many Sins of Gods own people (which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been the only cauſe of the withholding of
his moſt juſt and expected Judgments from being
poured forth upon her from the fulleſt Vials of his
Wrath) I have again conſidered of the Juſtice as
well as Goodneſs of God herein; Juſtice to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven upon her, when the Fulneſs
of her Abominations ſhall be accompliſhed; and
his Goodneſs and Mercy to his People, in purging
them by theſe his Chaſtiſements from the Droſs
and Tin of their Iniquities. Here we have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the great God in two of his greateſt and
moſt glorious Attributes, his Mercy and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to their reſpective Objects. The
Holy King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> wondred no leſs
than he grieved at this matter, till he went into the
Sanctuary of God, where he <hi>underſtood the End of
wicked men, and that verily there is a Reward for
the Righteous, and a God that Judgeth in the Earth.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:48988:3"/>
With what <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> no leſs than <hi>Inhumane
Cruelty</hi> ſhe hath behaved her ſelf towards the <hi>Saints
and Servants of God,,</hi> whom ſhe calls <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
this ſmall Hiſtory will ſufficiently acquaint Your
Grace, and will, <hi>I</hi> hope, prove a ſufficient Alarm
to the Nation, to rowſe her up as one Man, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and hinder the Rooting or Springing of her
vile Superſtitions here for the time to come. No,
<hi>Sir,</hi> the People of <hi>England</hi> are doubtleſs ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cautioned and fortified againſt any ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
however it may not perhaps be unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to remind them, and fully ſet before them the
<hi>barbarous Cruelties</hi> &amp; <hi>unchriſtian Severities</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

is to the ſhame and ſorrow of the beſt amongſt
them in Foreign Countreys, where it is ſuffered in

hope ſo great is the Goodneſs of God both towards
our Prince and People, that 'tis paſt not only the
ſtrength, but Malice of our <hi>Romiſh Adverſaries</hi> to
hurt either his <hi>Sacred Perſon</hi> or the <hi>Government.</hi>
May <hi>the Good Will of him that dwelt in the Buſh</hi>
preſerve and ever keep Your Grace from any of
their wicked Attempts upon Your Excellencies
Perſon, from dividing you from Your Princes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;

            <p>WHen King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Inquiſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> had expelled the <hi>Turks</hi>
out of the City and Territories of <hi>Granata,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of <hi>Spain;</hi> who had lived there Seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſeventy and eight years; they ſet upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion, and the Conquered <hi>Moors</hi> Liberty to ſtay
and to enjoy all their Goods, provided they would turn Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
And whereas alſo, there were many <hi>Jews,</hi> who had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, ſince <hi>Titus</hi> conquered <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> they gave them leave
to ſtay upon the ſame condition; but all ſuch as refuſed were
commanded preſently to depart out of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet afterwards find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that thoſe Perſons were Chriſtans, only in Name, and had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
only to ſave their Eſtates; inſtead of providing godly
Miniſters with meekneſs to inſtruct them, and to them for their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors:
<note place="margin">Invented by <hi>Dominicans</hi>
               </note> (by the advice of the <hi>Dominican Friers)</hi> they erected the
Inquiſition; wherein the poor Wretches inſtead of Inſtruction,
were robbed of all their Eſtates; and either put to moſt cruel
Deaths, or elſe ſuffered moſt intollerable Torments, by whipping,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And leading the reſt of their Lives in Ignominy and Poverty:
Neither was this inflicted only upon ſuch as Blasphemed Chriſt,
but for the Obſervation of the leaſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Ceremony,
or the ſmalleſt Error in the Chriſtian Religion. But this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
at firſt erected againſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> was afterwards
turned againſt the faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt; and for the
ſuppreſſing of the Goſpel, and the Profeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Information is given in againſt any one, though but for
a very ſmall matter; they do not preſently cite the Perſon to appear
before them, but they ſuborn one of their own Officers, called a
Familiar to inſinuate himſelf into his company, who taking occaſion
to meet the Party thus accuſed, uſed, thus to greet him. Sir,
I was yeſterday by accident at my Lords Inquiſitors, who ſaid that they
had occaſion to ſpeak with you, about certain of their affairs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they commanded me to Summon you to appear before them to
Morrow at ſuch an hour: The Party daring not to refuſe, goes to the
place, ſends in word that he is come to attend them; and ſo
when he is called in, they ask him, what Suit he hath to them?
And when he anſwers that he comes upon Summons, they enquire
his Name: for ſay they, we know not whether you are the ſame
man or not, but ſince you are come, if you have any thing
to inform this Court of, either concerning your ſelf or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you may let us hear it, for the diſcharge of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
The Parties ſafeſt way, is conſtantly to deny that he hath
any thing to declare to them; but if through ſimplicity, he doth
accuſe himſelf or any other; they rejoyce, as having attained their
deſires, and ſo preſently commit him to Priſon: If nothing be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48988:4"/>
they diſmiſs him; pretending that for the preſent they
know not whether he be the Party or no: After his departure
they let him alone for ſome ſpace, and then ſend for him again,
exhorting him, that if he know or hath heard any thing, that
concerns their Holy Court, to diſcloſe it to them, for (ſay they)
we know that you have had dealings with ſome Perſon ſuſpected
in Religion;<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> and therefore remember your ſelf well; If you confeſs,
you ſhall fare the better, and you ſhall but do therein as a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ought to do: If ſtill he refuſe, they threaten, and ſo diſmiſs
him.</p>
            <p>Yet they have always one or other to keep him Company, to
creep into his Boſome, and grope his Conſcience; who under
the colour of Friendſhip, ſhall viſit him daily, and have an eye
to all his dealings; obſerve what Company he keepeth, with
whom he conferrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that without Gods ſpecial aſſiſtance,
it is not poſſible to eſcape their Snares. The Inquiſitors alſo, if
they meet him, ſpeak courteouſly to him, promiſe to befriend
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all to make him more careleſs of himſelf, that
they may undo him before he be aware: But if the Party be a
Stranger, or one that is like to make an eſcape, or that they hope
to gain any thing by his confeſſion,<note place="margin">Their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Strangers.</note> they preſently clap him up
in Priſon, in which Priſon great Numbers die, either ſtarved with
hunger, or by extremity of racking of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one that is accuſed, chance to make an eſcape, they
have many devices to find and fetch him in again; they have Store
of Searchers to whom beſides the common Signs, they give his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Picture, whereby they may eaſily know him, An <hi>Italian,</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars.</note> having wounded an Apparitor, fled to <hi>Sevil;</hi> the Familiars were
ſent to ſeek him, and when they had found him, though they had his
Counterfeit, yet by reaſon that he had altered his Habit, they were
doubtful whether it was he or no, the rather becauſe he had
changed his Name, whereupon they followed him only upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion;
but one Day as he was walking, and earneſtly talking
with ſome Gentlemen, two of thoſe Familiars ſuddenly called
him by his old Name: The Party earneſt in talk, and not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, looked behind him, and made anſwer, whereupon they
preſently apprehended him, clapt him in Irons for a long time,
then whipt him, and condemned him to the Gallies, during his
Life. So ſoon as any is arreſted by the Familiars, they take from
him all the Keys of his Locks, or Cheſts whatſoever: and then
they take an Inventory of all his goods, leaving them to ſome man
that will undertake to be accountable for them. But in the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring,
<note place="margin">Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or rifling the Houſes, if they have any Gold, Silver, or
Jewels: theſe Familiars, which are uſually, Bauds, Theives, Shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the vileſt of People, will be ſure to filch ſome of it; and
the reaſon of this Sequeſtration, is, that if the Party be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the holy Inquiſition may enjoy his whole Eſtate.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Priſoner is entred within the firſt Gate of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the Gaoler asketh him, If he hath a Knife about him, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or Rings, or Jewels? and if a woman, whether ſhe hath
Knives,<note place="margin">Stript of all In priſon.</note> Rings, Chains, Bracelets, or other Ornaments; and all
theſe the Gaoler ſtrips them of, as his Fee, and this is done, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48988:4"/>
the Poor Priſoners may have nothing to relieve themſelves with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
during their Impriſonment: They ſearch them alſo, to ſee whether
they have any Writing, or Book about them, which likewiſe they
take from them; then they ſhut them up in a Cabin, like to
a <hi>Little-Eaſe,</hi> where they have little Room for cleanlineſs and but
little light.</p>
            <p>Some are thus kept all alone for two or three Months, ſome as long
as they live; others have company, as the Lords Inquiſitors pleaſe.
When the party hath been in priſon a week or two, the Gaoler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
him to petition for a day of hearing, telling him, the ſooner the
better; and that it will much further his Cauſe, and bring it to ſome
good effect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas it were far beter for him to ſtay till he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for; for then he hath nothing to do but to anſwer their Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But the poor Priſoner not knowing this Myſtery, is uſually ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by his Keeper,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> intreating him to ſtand his Friend to procure him a
day of hearing; whoſe Suit is eaſily heard, and the Priſoner is brought
into the Conſiſtory; then the Inquiſitors ask him, What is his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt?
The Priſoner anſwereth, That he would gladly have his Matter
heard: Then they labour by threatning him with worſe uſage if he
conceal the Truth, to cauſe him to confeſs the thing whereof he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed;
and if they can but draw him to this, they have their deſires;
for uſually they draw more from him than they could have proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.<note place="margin">How Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors deal with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</note> Then they adviſe him to let him come from himſelf; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
that if he acknowledge his faults, he ſhall preſently be releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſent home; if yet he ſtands mute, they then charge him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
his Conſcience, and in the mean time to return to his Priſon,
till he hath better bethought himſelf, and then he may ſue for a new
day of hearing, and ſo they diſmiſs him. And ſome days after,
they call for him again; asking him whether he be yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to tell ought? But whether he plead his Innocency, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
ſome little, they ſtill urge him to disburthen his Conſcience, and
perſwading him, that they adviſe him for the beſt, and in love and
compaſſion to him, but if he now refuſe the Favour proffered, he
ſhall find them afterwards ſharp Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſend him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to priſon.</p>
            <p>The third time he is called for, they uſe the like Subtilty, to draw
him to Confeſſion; telling him, that if he refuſe, they muſt uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
and do what they can by Law; by which word, they mean
extream tormenting and mangling of him. Then if the party confeſs
any thing, Nay, ſay they, we are not yet ſatisfied, we have not all
you can ſay, you keep back ſomething on purpoſe, and ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to priſon.</p>
            <p>Having thus excruciated him day by day, if they can yet get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of him, they then require an Oath of him, and hold a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix
or Croſs before him, whereby the poor Chriſtian muſt at laſt
needs ſhew himſelf; for knowing that he ought to ſwear by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
who hath reſerved this Honour to himſelf, he muſt refuſe the
Oath; which if he do, then they read a large Indictment againſt
him, wherein they lay to his Charge things that never any man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
him of, and which, it may be, himſelf never thought of; and this
they do to amaze him, and ſo to try if he will confeſs any of theſe
miſdemeanors; or if they can trip him in his Anſwers, and ſo catch him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48988:5"/>
in their net. Then they put him to anſwer to every Article particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>extempore,</hi> without any time of deliberation; then they give him
Pen, Ink and Paper, requiring him to ſet down his Anſwer in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to ſee if they can find any difference betwixt his former Anſwer
and this: And if the party chance to confeſs ought, then they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of whom he learned it, and whether he hath ſpoken of it before
others, and who they are, and hereby many are brought into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for whether they liked it or not, they are ſure to be queſtioned,
becauſe they did not come and declare it to the Fathers Inquiſitors.
Then pretending to ſhew him favour, they appoint him an Advocate,
to blind the Peoples Eyes, as if they proceeded according to the Rules
of Juſtice; but this Advocate dares not tell his Client any point of
Law that may do him good, for fear of angring the Inquiſitors; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may he ſpeak privately with his Client, but either before an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor
or a Notary.</p>
            <p>Two or three days after the party hath had the Copy of his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
he is called into the Court, where his Advocate is, as if he
intended to defend his Cauſe; but indeed he dares ſay nothing to the
purpoſe, for fear of angring the Inquiſitors; only he chears up his
Client, and bids him tell the Truth in any caſe, as the only way to
prevail in that Court, and then is the Priſoner ſent back again; who
hopes that now his Caſe will be heard, and his Buſineſs diſpatched;
whereas uſually theſe good Fathers let him lie two, or three, or four
years in priſon, without ever calling for him again: And if through
Loathſomneſs and Intolerableneſs of the Priſon, any ſute to come to
Hearing, it may be, with much ado he obtains it; but uſually that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is denied them, yet at length, when they pleaſe, they call for
him to hear the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes againſt him, which yet
is not done till the poor Priſoner, by his grievous impriſonment, is
brought ſo low, as that they think he will rather chuſe Death, than
ſuch a Life, and therefore will be willing to tell all, that ſo he may
be rid out of his Miſery: then between rebuking and a gentle admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
they tell him, that though he hath ſtood out ſo long, yet at
length they would have him wiſer, to confeſs the Truth; but if he
yet refuſe to be his own Accuſer, then the <hi>Fiſcal</hi> produceth the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
which are deliverd to the Priſoner; but they are drawn up
ſo intricately and ambiguouſly, that he knows not what to make of
them; and this they do to conceal the Witneſſes, leſt he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
againſt them; and ſo to ſet him on gueſſing, that ſo, if he chance
to reckon up any others, to whom he ſpake any thing about any of
thoſe Matters, they may thereby get more Griſt to their Mill; for
they preſently Outlaw ſuch perſons, as Favourers of Hereticks, for
ſuffering an Heretick to ſow ſuch peſtilent Seed amongſt them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
complaining thereof to the Inquiſitors.</p>
            <p>The Keeper of the Priſon alſo is examined what he hath ſeen and
obſerved of him in the Priſon; and his Teſtimony is as good as two
Teſtimonies to take away the Priſoners Life.</p>
            <p>They have alſo promoters to bring in Accuſations, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
though Frantick <hi>Bedlams,</hi> or the verieſt Varlets that be, and
if in their Informations, they chance to want words of weight, the
Inquiſitors will help them out, and prompt them, word by word. Then
after three or four daies, the Priſoner is called again, to put in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48988:5"/>
Anſwer to the Depoſitions; But in the <hi>Interim,</hi> his Advocate never
comes at him, to aſſiſt or direct him; but he is left to himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any help, ſave of God alone. His anſwer being viewed, he is
remanded to Priſon again with this <hi>Item,</hi> that if he confeſs not the
truth, they will extort it out of him by extremity.</p>
            <p>After two or three Months more he is called for once again, and
required to ſpake what he hath for himſelf, or elſe they muſt draw
to an end. And if he ſtill ſhrinks not, but ſtands firm in his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
they proceed to other Dealings, in compariſon of which,
all their former dealings are not only ſufferable, but ſeem
reaſonable and full of gentleneſs; for their future Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all Barbarouſneſs; the Devil himſelf being not able to go
beyond them in their monſtrous Cruelty and Tyranny: for not
long after, the Priſoner is called in before the Inquiſitors, who tell
him, they have deeply conſidered his whole Caſe, and found out that he
doth not declare the whole truth; and therefore they are reſolved that
he ſhall be racked; that by force they may draw from him, what by fair
means he will not acknowledge; and therefore they adviſe him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do it voluntarily, and thereby to avoid the Pain and Peril,
that yet attends him: yet whether he confeſs, or not confeſs, all is
one;<note place="margin">They proceed to the Rank.</note> to the Rack he muſt go; Then is he lead into the place; where
the Rack ſtandeth; which is a deep and dark Dungeon, under ground,
with many Doors to paſs through, ere a man come to it; becauſe the
Shrieks and Cries of the tormented ſhould not be heard. Then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
ſeat themſelves upon a Scaffold, hard by the Rack; and the
Torches being lighted, the Executioner comes in, all arrayed
from Top to Toe, in a Suit of Black Canvas; his head is covered
with a long Black Hood, that covereth all his Face, having only two
Peepholes for his Eyes; which ſight doth more affright the poor Soul,
to ſee one in the likeneſs of a Devil to be his Tormentor. The Lords
being ſet in their Places, they begin again to exhort him to ſpeak
the truth freely and voluntarily; then with ſharp words, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to be ſtripped ſtart naked, yea, though the modeſteſt Maid,
the chaſteſt Matron in the City; whoſe grief in regard of the Rack, is not
ſo great, as to be ſeen naked in the preſence of ſuch manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
For theſe wicked Villains, without any regard of Modeſty, will
not by any Praiers of godly Matrons, or chaſt Maidens forbear one
jot of that Barbarous Impudence; as if a ſhirt or ſmock could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the violence of the Rack, from ſufficiently tormenting them.</p>
            <p>The Party being thus ſtripped; the Inquiſitors ſignifie to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor,
how they would have him or her ordered. The firſt kind of
Torment, is the Gibbet or Pully; but firſt one comes behind him, and
binds his Hands with a Cord, eight or ten times about; the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
calling upon him, to ſtrain each harder than other: they cauſe
alſo his Thumbs to be bound extream hard with a ſmall Line; and ſo
both Hands and Thumbs are faſtned to a Pully, which hangs on the
Gibbet; then they put great and heavy Bolts on his Heels, and
hang upon thoſe Bolts betwen his Feet certain weights of Iron,<note place="margin">The Gibbet:</note> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48988:6"/>
ſo hoiſe him or her up from the ground; and while the poor Wretch
hangs in this plight, they begin to exhort him again to accuſe himſelf
and as many others as he knows of; then they command him, to be
hoiſed up higher,<note place="margin">Inhumane Cruelty.</note> to the very Beam, till his headtouch the Pullie;
having hung thus agood while, they command him to be let down,
and twice ſo much weight to be faſtned to his Heels, and ſo hoiſed
up again, and one Inch higher, if it may be; then they command the
Hangman to let him up and down, that the weights of the Irons
hanging at his Heels may rent every joint in his Body a funder; with
which Intolerable Pains, if the party ſhreek or cry out, they roar
out a loud to him, to confeſs the truth, or elſe he ſhall come down
with a Vengeance: then they bid the Hangman ſuddenly to ſlip the
Rope, that he may fall down with a ſway, and in the midway to ſtop;
thus they give him the <hi>Strappado,</hi> which being as ſoon done, it rends
all his Body out of joint; Arms, Shoulders, Back, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
reaſon of the ſudden jerk, and the weights hanging at his Heels; If
yet he remain conſtant, they ad more weight to his Heels the third
time; and the poor Wretch already half dead, is hoiſed up the third
time,<note place="margin">Railings.</note> and to increaſe his miſery, they rail at him, calling him
Dog and Heretick, telling him that there he is like to make his end:
If the poor Creature in his Pangs call upon Chriſt, entreating that
he would vouchſafe to aid and aſſiſt him, thus miſerably tormented
for his ſake;<note place="margin">Scoffs.</note> then they fall to mocking and deriding him, ſaying,
why calleſt thou on Jeſus Chriſt? Let Jeſus alone, and tell us the
truth; what a crying out upon Chriſt makeſt thou? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the
Party deſire to be let down, promiſing to tell ſome what; that is the
ready way to make him be worſe uſed; for now they think that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
only to broach the matter, for when he hath don, they command
him to be halled up again, and to be let down as before; ſo that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
theſe Torments are exerciſed upon him, for three hours together;
Then they ask the Gaoler if his other Torments are ready, to affright
the poor Soul; The Gaoler anſwereth, that they are ready, but he
hath not brought them with him: Then the Inquiſitors bid him to
bring them again the morrow, for ſay they, we will try other
ways to get the truth out of this Fellow: and ſo turning to
him that lies in miſerable pain, having all his joints out; how now,
Sirrah, ſay they, how like you this Geer? have you enough of it
yet? well, ſee that you call your wits to morrow, or look to die then,
for what you have felt is but a Flea-Biting,<note place="margin">Threats.</note> in compariſon of what is
behind. And ſo they depart.</p>
            <p>Then the Gaoler plays the Bone-Setter, ſo well as he can, ſetting his
Joints, and ſo carries him back again to Priſon, or drags him by the
Arms or Legs moſt pitifully: and if they mean to rack him no more,
after two or three days they ſend for him again, and cauſe him to
be brought by the Rack; where the Hangman ſtands in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Devil, as before, the more to affright him: when he
comes before the Inquiſitors, they fall perſwading him to confeſs
the truth at laſt; and if he confeſs any thing, he may chance to
to go to the Rack again, whereby they hope to extort more; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48988:6"/>
when indeed they intend to rack the Party again, then at three
days end, when the Ach in his Joints is moſt grievous and painful
to him, they ſend for him, requiring him to declare all his Hereſies, and
to Impeach all ſuch as he hath had conference with about them; and
all ſuch as he knows to be of that mind, or elſe he muſt prepare
himſelf for the Rack; and if he continue conſtant, he is again ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of his Clothes,<note place="margin">Another cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Torment.</note> and hoiſed up with weights at his Heels,
as before; beſides which, as he hangs at the Pullie, they bind
his Thighs together, and Legs about the Calf with a ſmall ſtrong
Cord, and with a ſhort piece of wood they twiſt the Cord till
it be ſhrunk ſo deep in the fleſh that it is paſt ſight, which is
extream and terrible torment, worſe than any he hath yet endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and in this plight they let the poor Soul lie two or three
hours, the Inquiſitors in the mean time not ceaſing to exhort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
threaten and ſcoff at him.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſometimes they proceed to another kind of Torture, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Aſelli,</hi> which is after this manner; There is a piece of
Timber ſomewhat hollowed on the top like a Trough,<note place="margin">The Trough.</note> about the
middle whereof there is a ſharp Bar going acroſs, whereon a
mans back reſteth, that it cannot go to the bottom; it is alſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſo, that his Heels ſhall lie higher than his Head; then is the
naked party laid thereon, his Arms, Thighs and Legs bound with
ſtrong ſmall Cords, and wreſted with ſhort Truncheons, till the
Cords pierce almoſt to the very Bone; then they take a thick fine
Lawn Cloth, laying it over the parties Mouth as he lies upright
on his back, ſo that it may ſtop his Noſtrils alſo; then taking a
quantity of Water, they pour it in a long ſtream like a Thred,
which falling from on high, drives the Cloth down into his
Throat; which puts the poor wretch into as great an Agony as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
endure in the pains of death; for in this Torture he hath not
liberty to draw his Breath, the Water ſtopping his Mouth, and
the Cloth his Noſtrils; ſo that when the Cloth is drawn out of the
bottom of his Throat, it draws forth Blood with it, and a man
would think that it tore out his very Bowels; this is iterated
as often as the Inquiſitors pleaſe, and yet they threaten him with
worſe Torments, if he confeſs not; and ſo he is returned to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
again: Yet many times, after he hath lain there a Month or two,
he is brought again to the Rack, and uſed as before; yea ſometimes
five or ſix times, even as oft as they pleaſe; for their Luſt is their Law:
and yet they have another Torment with Fire, which is no whit
inferior to the former:<note place="margin">Torment with fire.</note> They take a Pan of burning Charcole, and
ſet it juſt over againſt the Soles of the parties feet, juſt before he
goes to the Rack; and that the Fire may have the more force
upon them, they baſte them with Lard or Bacon: But if all Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Torments will not force him to confeſs what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
nor to deny the Truth; they uſe other means, by ſubtil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories
and frequent Queſtionings, to draw him into ſome
Snare or other: Yea, if yet they cannot prevail, then ſome one of
the Inquiſitors comes to him in private, and ſhews himſelf much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48988:7"/>
affected with his Miſery,<note place="margin">Subtilty.</note> weeps with him, comforts him, gives
him Advice, ſeems to impart ſuch a Secret to him, as he would
ſcarce impart to his Father, or deareſt Friend alive; and this
they uſe moſt with Women; whereas they are but fair Baits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deadly Hooks, whereby they ſeek to deſtroy them: whereof
we have this Example.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sivil</hi> there were apprehended a godly Matron,<note place="margin">A woman &amp; her 2 daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and her Niece.</note> two of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and her Niece, who all of them underwent the forementioned
Torments with manly Courage, and Chriſtian Conſtancy, becauſe
they would not betray each other, nor other godly perſons in that City.
The one of the Inquiſitors ſent for the youngeſt Maid oft to his
Chamber,<note place="margin">A Judas.</note> pretended much compaſſion towards her, ſpake much
to comfort her, told her what a grief it was to him to ſee her
Torments, and then he uſed familiar and pleaſant communication
to her; and told her he would adviſe her the beſt way to free
her ſelf, Mother, and Siſter from theſe Troubles, that he would
undertake the ordering of their Buſineſs, and then perſwaded her
to tell the whole Truth to him, and he bound himſelf with an
Oath that he would ſtop all further proceedings againſt them, and
procure their diſmiſſion; having thus out-witted the poor Maid,
who gave too much credit to him, ſhe told him of ſome points
of Religion which they had wont to confer of amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and ſo when he had gotten out of her what poſſibly he
could,<note place="margin">Perjury.</note> like a perfidious Villain, contrary to his Vows, Promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Oath, he cauſed her to be racked again, to get more out of
her; yea, they put her alſo to the intolerable pain of the Trough,
and through extremity of Pangs and Torments, they at laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from her a betraying of her own Mother, Siſter, and divers
others, which were immediately apprehended, tortured, and at laſt
burnt with Fire. But when they were brought with great pomp
upon the Scaffold, and had the Sentence of Death paſt upon them,
this Maid went to her Aunt, who had inſtructed her in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion, and boldly, without change of countenance, gave
her hearty thanks for the great benefit which ſhe had received
by her means, entreating her to pardon her for what ſhe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
her at any time, for that ſhe was now to depart out of this
Life; her Aunt comforted her ſtoutly, bid her be of good cheer,
for that now ere long they ſhould be with Chriſt: This Woman
was openly whipt, and kept in priſon during her Life, the reſt
were all preſently burned.</p>
            <p>Another Device they have is this; When they think that Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
which are together do talk together of Religion, exhorting
and comforting one another, as they have occaſion or opportunity;
the Inquiſitors commit to priſon, under a colour, a crafty Knave,
whom they call a <hi>Fly,</hi> who after two or three days, will cunningly
inſinuate himſelf into the boſom of the other priſoners, and then
pretending a great deal of Zeal to Religion, he will proffer Diſcourſe
to them, and by degrees get out of their Mouths ſomething where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48988:7"/>
of he may accuſe them: Then doth he move for a day of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſo getting to the Inquiſitors, impeaches the Priſoners,
who ſhall be ſure afterwards to hear of it to their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; yea,
theſe <hi>Flies</hi> aſſoon as they are out of one Priſon, for the hope of gain,
will be content preſently to be put into another, and then into a
third, where they will lie in Chains, as the other Priſoners do, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
Hunger, Cold, Stink, and the Loathſomneſs of the Priſon,
and all to betray others; and this mans Accuſation, is as ſtrong
and valid as the Teſtimony of any other Witneſs whatſoever. Other
<hi>Flies</hi> alſo there be that ſerve the <hi>Holy Inquiſition</hi> abroad, ſlily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
themſelves into the Company of the Common people,
who are ſuſpected to be <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and when they can pump any
thing out of them, they preſently betray them. They I have yet
this other Device, when they can catch any man that is noted for
Religion, or a Miniſter that hath inſtructed others, after he hath
been in priſon a while, they give it out, that he upon the Rack
hath diſcovered all his Diſciples and Acquaintance, and they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn
others to aver that they heard it: And this they do to draw
the ſimple people to come of their own accord, and to confeſs
their faults to the Inquiſitors, and to crave pardon, whereupon
they promiſe them favour.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors and their Officers uſe to call their Priſoners
Dogs and Hereticks, and indeed they uſe them much worſe than
moſt men do their Dogs; for firſt, the place where uſually each of
them is laid,<note place="margin">Their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concealed.</note> by reaſon of the ſtraightneſs, ill Air, and dampneſs of
of the Earth, is liker a Grave than a Priſon; and if it be aloft, in
the hot weather, it is like a hot Oven or Furnace, and in each of
theſe Holes uſually two or three are thronged together, ſo that
they have no more room than to lie down in. In one Corner is a
Stool of eaſement, and a Pitcher of Water to quench their Thirſt;
in theſe Cells they have no Light, but what comes in at the
Key-hole, or ſome ſmall Cranney; other-ſome there are much
worſe, not being long enough for a man to lie in; ſo that ſuch as
are put into them, never likely come out till they be half rotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
or die of a Conſumption.</p>
            <p>Their Diet is anſwerable to their Lodging; the Rich pay large
Fees to the <hi>Holy Houſe,</hi> and every Priſoner is rated as the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
pleaſe; but ſuch as are poor, the King allows Three pence
a day, out of which the Steward, Landreſs and ſome other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Charges are deducted, ſo that not one half of it comes to
the Priſoners ſhare; and if any be moved with compaſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, it is counted ſuch an hainous Offence, that it will
coſt him a ſcourging till blood come at leaſt. It once hapened
that there was Keeper appointed for their Priſon in the Caſtle of
<hi>Triana</hi> in <hi>Sivil,</hi> that was of a courteous diſpoſition by Nature,
who uſed the Priſoners well, and cloſely, for fear of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors,
ſhewed them ſome favour; at which time there was a
godly Matron and her two Daughters committed to priſon, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48988:8"/>
being put into ſeveral Rooms, had a great deſire to ſee each other for
their mutual comfort in their diſtreſs; whereupon they beſought the
Keeper to ſuffer them to come together, if it were but for one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour; the Keeper yielded, and ſo they were together about
half an hour, and then returned to their former Priſons; within a
few days after, theſe women being racked in a terrible manner, the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fearing leſt they would confeſs that little favour which he had
ſhewed them, of his own accord went to the Inquiſitors, confeſſed
his Fact,<note place="margin">All pity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them.</note> and craved pardon; but they deemed this ſo hainous an
offence, that they preſently commanded him to be haled to priſon,
where, by reaſon of the extremity ſhewed him, he fell mad; yet
this procured him no favour; for after he had been a whole year
in a vile Priſon, they brought him upon their Triumphant Stage,
with a <hi>Sambenito</hi> upon him, and a Rope about his Neck, and there
they cenſured him to be whipt about the City, and to have two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſtripes, and then to ſerve in the Gallies for ſix years. The next
day one of his mad Fits coming upon him as he was ſet on an Aſſes
back to be ſcourged, he threw himſelf off, ſnatched a Sword out of
the Officers hand, and had ſlain him if the people had not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
laid hold on him; whereupon he was bound faſter on the Aſſes
back, had his two hundred ſtripes, and was for this offence condemned
four years longer to the Gallies.</p>
            <p>Another Keeper at another time had a Maid, who ſeeing how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
the Priſoners were uſed, pitying their diſtreſſed condition,
who were hunger-ſtarved and almoſt pined, ſhe would ſometimes
ſpeak to them at the Grate, exhort and comfort them as well as ſhe
could, and ſometimes would help them to ſome good and wholeſom
Food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea by her means the Priſoners came to underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
condition, which was a great comfort to them; but this at laſt
coming to the Inquiſitors ears,<note place="margin">A Maid whipt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> they enjoined her to wear the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benito;</hi>
to be whipped about the Streets, to receive two hundred
Stripes, and to be baniſhed the City for ten years, with this Writing
on her Head, <hi>A Favourer and Aider of Hereticks.</hi> And whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forts of perſons in priſon and bondage are allowed to recreate and
refreſh themſelves with Singing at their pleaſure, theſe poor Souls
are forbidden this ſmall Solace in their great miſery;<note place="margin">The Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers denied leave to ſing Pſlams.</note> for if any of
them ſing a Pſalm, or openly recite any Portion of Scripture, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors
take it very hainouſly, and preſently ſend to them, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them to be ſilent upon the pain of Excommunication; and if
the Priſoner make light of this Warning, he ſhall have a Bit ſet on
his Tongue to teach him Obedience; and this they do both to deprive
the poor Souls of all kind of Solace, and to keep other Priſoners from
knowing how their Friends do; ſo that it often falls out that a man
and his Friend, the Father and Son, yea, the Husband and Wife ſhall
be in one Priſon-houſe two or three years together, and not know
of each others being there, till they meet upon the Scaffold, upon the
great day of Triumph:</p>
            <p>By reaſon of this cruel uſage, many of the Priſoners die, ſome of
their Torments, others of the ſtink of the Priſon, and others of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
contracted by Hunger, Cold, ill Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have alſo an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48988:8"/>
unto which they remove ſuch as fall ſick in their Priſons, where
yet they are not dealt more gently with in any thing,<note place="margin">Their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital.</note> ſave that they
have Phyſick allowed them for their healths ſake; but none are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to come to them but the Phyſitian and the Servants of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital;
and aſſoon as the Patient is on the mending hand, he is carried
back to the place from whence he came.</p>
            <p>If the Priſoner be half naked, or want ſomething to lie on, and
thereupon pray the Inquiſitors that his neceſſity may be conſidered;
the Anſwer which he receives is this, well, now the Weather is
warm, you may live full well without either Cloaths or Couch; and
if it be the Winter-time, his Anſwer is, True, it hath been a great
Froſt of late, but now the Cold is come down again, and it will be
more ſeaſonable weather; care you for the Garments wherewithal
you ſhould cloath your Soul, which conſiſteth in uttering the Truth,
and diſcharging your Conſcience before this <hi>Holy Houſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cruel Mercy.</note> and if the
Priſoner deſire to have ſome good Book, or the Holy Bible, to enable
him to paſs that troubleſom and careful time to ſome profit, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
anſwer him, That the true Book is to ſpeak the Truth, and to
diſcharge his Conſcience to that Holy Court, and that he ought to be
occupied in laying open his wounds to their Lordſhips, who are ready
to give him a Plaiſter, whereby it appears that all their care and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is, that the poor Priſoner may have nothing to look on or think
on but his preſent miſerable ſtate, that the grief thereof grating upon
him, may force him to ſatisfie the Requeſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt Act of the Tragedy remaineth,<note place="margin">Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> wherein both Parties
are pleaſed and have their deſire; The Inquiſitors in obteining
their Prey; the Priſoners in finding ſome end of their miſerable
uſage; But two or three days before the Solemnity, they uſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
to call before them all ſuch whoſe Eſtates are confiſcated,
examining them what Lands or Goods they have; where they
lie, charging them upon great penalties, not to conceal one jot;
telling them that if any thing be afterwards found, Felony ſhall be laid
to their Charge, and he with whom it is found ſhall pay ſoundly
for it, and when all is Confeſſed, they are returned to Priſon
again.</p>
            <p>The night before the Feſtival, they cauſe all the Priſoners to be
brought into a large Room, where they are informed of the ſeveral
times of Penances that they are to do the next day: The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very early the Familiars come, and attire the Priſoners in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Habits,<note place="margin">Their Habit</note> in which they are to appear before the people: Some in
<hi>Sambenitoes,</hi> which is a long Garment painted all over with ugly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
on his head he hath an High Crown'd Hat, whereon a man is
Painted Burning in the Fire with many Devils about him, plying him
with Fire and Faggots; beſides their Tongues have a cleft piece of
wood put upon them, which nips and pincheth them that they cannot
ſpeak, they have alſo about their Necks Cords, and their hands
faſt bound behind them. On this ſort come theſe conſtant
Martyrs Diſguiſed firſt to the Stage, and then to the Stake, and in the
like ſort do all the reſt come forth arrayed as the others and ſet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48988:9"/>
forthwith the like notes of Infamy, either more or leſs, as the
Inquiſitors pleaſe to diſgrace them in the ſight of the People: on
each hand of every Priſoner, goeth a Familiar all armed to guard
him; as alſo two <hi>Friers,</hi> with every one that is to die, who
perſwade him tooth and nail to deny that Doctrine that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hath profeſſed, now at the going out of this world; which
wicked Importunity is a grief to the poor Servants of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Inquiſitors alſo paſs in great Pomp from the Caſtle of
<hi>Triana</hi> to their Scaffold; and when all are ſet in their places, a
Sermon begins, framed on purpoſe in Commendation of the Holy
Houſe, and in confutation of ſuch Hereticks as are preſently to
ſuffer; but the greateſt part is ſpent in ſtanderous reproachs,
wherewith they vilifie and diſgrace the truth, and the profeſſion
of it. The Sermon being ended, the Sentence againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are read firſt againſt ſuch as have eaſieſt puniſhment, and
ſo in order to the greater; which ſentences are commonly theſe,
Death without mercy, whipping in ſuch extremity, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſeldom eſcape with their Lives, Condemnation to the Gally,
forfeiture of all their Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then doth the chief Inquiſitor abſolve all ſuch as have forſaken
Chriſt, and are come home to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from all
the Errors for which they ſhewed themſelves penitent; but though
hereby they are abſolved from the fault, yet not from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
for notwithſtanding their Recantation, they muſt abide
the puniſhment without mercy.</p>
            <p>And whereas multitudes of People reſort to this ſpectacle, ſome
coming twenty Leagues to ſee it, the Inquiſitors have this trick
to uphold their Kingdom, they cauſe all the People preſent to
take an Oath to live and die in the ſervice of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> hazarding both Lives and Goods againſt any that ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it,<note place="margin">A wicked Oath.</note> as alſo to their Power, to uphold and maintain the holy
Inquiſition, and to defend all the Officers thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then if there be any amongſt the Priſoners to be degraded,<note place="margin">Degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
they proceed after this manner. Firſt they apparell him in his
Maſſing Robes, then they deſpoil him again of every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
then are his Hands, Lips, and the Crown of his Head ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with a piece of glaſs, or ſharp Knife till they bleed again,
to ſcrape off the holy Oyl wherewith he was annointed at his
Ordination. In the end of their Sentence, which is pronounced
upon ſuch as are to be burned, they uſe this abominable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:
They bequeath him to the Secular Power, with this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
requeſt to them,<note place="margin">Hipocriſie.</note> to ſhew the priſoner as much favour as may
be, and neither to break any Bone, nor pierce the skin of the Body;
This ſhews their great Impudence, that having already given ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on him to be burned, they yet ſhould pretend ſuch Mercy
and Clemency towards him, whom all along themſelves have
uſed with ſuch extream Cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48988:9"/>
They uſe alſo this Trick further; that in reading the Crimes, for
which he is condemned; they do not only miſreport ſuch things as he
confeſsed upon his Examination; but they deviliſhly father upon him
ſuch things as he never ſpake, or thought of in all his Life; and this
they do to diſgrace him, and to make him and his Opinions more
abhorred of all men; and to encreaſe their own Eſtimation and
Credit, as being neceſſary Officers to rid the world of ſuch peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſons; and all this while the Priſoners tongue hath a cleft
peice of wood upon it to his intolerable pain and grief, that he
cannot anſwer for himſelf, nor gainſay that they charge him with.</p>
            <p>All theſe things being finiſhed, the Magiſtrate takes them into
his hand, and conveys them preſently to the place of Execution,
with divers Inſtruments of Satan about them, calling and crying
to them,<note place="margin">Abominable Lies.</note> to forſake the truth; and when they cannot prevail,
after the Priſoner is tyed to the ſtake, they break his Neck in a
trice, and then they report amongſt the common People, that they
recanted their Hereſies at the laſt hour, and ſo came home to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore they felt no pain in the
Fire at all.</p>
            <p>Such as are not condemned to die, are carried back, and the
next day brought up to be whipt; after which ſome of them are
ſent to the Gallies;<note place="margin">Their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concealed.</note> others kept in Priſon all their Life time.
But all have this ſpecial charge given them, that they never ſpeak of any
thing that they have heard, ſeen, or felt, during their Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Inquiſition; for if the contrary be ever proved againſt
them, and that they utter any of their ſecrets, they ſhall be
taken for perſons relapſed, and be puniſhed with greateſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
their Judgment being Death without Redemption; and
hereby they keep in all their Knavery and Tyranny cloſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to themſelves: and if any of them be releaſed, becauſe their
faults were but ſmall; they are yet ſo careful, leſt their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
ſhould come to light, that they inhibit him the company
and conference with any other, than ſuch as they ſhall appoint
and allow him: neither will they ſuffer him to write to any
Friends, except they firſt have the peruſing of the Letters.</p>
            <p>Sometimes alſo, after they have impriſoned men in ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtate for a year or two, and can extort nothing out of
them by their torments, nor prove any thing againſt them
by witneſs, ſo that they muſt neceſſarily diſmiſs them, they then
call them into the Court, begin to flatter them, and tell them
what a good opinion they have of them; and that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſend them home, for the which fatherly favour extended
toward them in ſaving their Lives and Goods, they are to account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much beholding to their Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo at laſt they diſmiſs
him with ſpecial charge of ſilence, and when he is gone they have ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Spies abroad, to ſee how he takes the matter, and if they find that he
complains of his puniſhments, or diſcloſes their ſecrets, they preſently
commence a new Suit againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48988:10"/>
On a time,<note place="margin">A Lady Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</note> the Inquiſitors at <hi>Sivil</hi> apprehended a Noble
Lady, the cauſe was for that a Siſter of hers, a very Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Virgin; who afterwards was burned for Religion had
confeſſed in the extremity of her Torments; that ſhe had
ſometimes had conference with this her Siſter about matters
of Religion: This Lady when ſhe was firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
was gone with Child about ſix Months, in reſpect
whereof they did not ſhut her up ſo cloſe at, nor
deal ſo ſeverely with her, as they did with others; but
within four days after ſhe was brought to Bed; they took
the Child from her,<note place="margin">Their Cruel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of her.</note> and the ſeventh day after they ſhut
her up in cloſe Priſon, and uſed her in all things as they
did other Priſoners; the only wordly comfort ſhe had in
her miſery, was that they lodged her with a Virtuous
Maiden, that was her Fellow Priſoner for a time, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
burned at the Stake: This Maid whilſt they were
together was carried to the Rack, and ſo ſore ſtrained and
tore thereon, that ſhe was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> almoſt pulled in peices, then
was ſhe brought back and thrown upon a Bed of
Flags, that ſerved both to lie on: The good Lady was not
able to help her, yet ſhewed ſingular tokens of love and
compaſſion towards her,</p>
            <p>The Maid was ſcarce recovered, when the Lady was
carried out to be ſerved with the ſame Sauce, and was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
tormented in the Trough,<note place="margin">They torment her in the Trough.</note> that by reaſon of the
ſtreight ſtraining of the Strings piercing to the very Bones
of her Arms, Thighs, and Shins; ſhe was brought back
half dead to her Priſon, the Blood guſhing out of her Mouth
abundantly, which ſhewed that ſomething was broken
within her;<note place="margin">She died.</note> but after eight days the Lord delivered her
from theſe cruel Tygers, by taking her mercifully to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Upon one of their days of Triumph,<note place="margin">John Pontio</note> there was brought
out one <hi>John Pontio;</hi> of a Noble Family, a Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of the Truth, and one of an holy and blameleſs
Life, and well learned; he was eminent alſo in works of
charity, in which he had ſpent a great part of his Eſtate;
being apprehended for the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, he was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48988:10"/>
caſt into Priſon where he manfully maintained the truth in the,
midſt of all their cruel dealings with; at laſt they; caſt
into Priſon to him on of their Flies, who by his Subtilty
and Craft ſo wrought upon him, that he drew from him
a Promiſe to yield obedience to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Human Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilty.</note> But
though God ſuffered him to fall a while, to ſhew him his
Frailty, yet afterwards in much mercy he raiſed him up
again with double ſtrength, to that which he had before,
and before his Execution he manfully defended the truth
againſt a Subtle <hi>Frier.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Recovery.</note> The things which he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for, were theſe; that he ſhould ſay, that from his
heart he abhorred the Idolatry, which was committed in
worſhipping the Hoſt; that he removed his Houſhould
from place to place, that he might ſhun coming to Maſs;
That the Juſtification of a Chriſtian reſteth only in the
Merits of Jeſus Chriſt apprehended by Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there
was no Purgatory; that the Popes pardon were of no value:
And for my ſelf (ſaith he) I am not only willing, but
deſirous to die,<note place="margin">His Speech at Death.</note> and ready to ſuffer any puniſhment, for
the truth which I have profeſſed: I eſteem not of this
World, nor of the Treaſures of it, more than for my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
uſe; and the reſt to beſtow in the Propagation
and Maintenance of the Goſpel, and I beſeech God daily
upon my Knees, for my Wife and Children, that they
may always continue in this quarrel even unto death; and
when he came to his Execution, he patiently and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſlept in the Lord.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time,<note place="margin">John Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvo.</note> there was alſo brought forth one
<hi>John Gonſalvo,</hi> formerly a Prieſt; but by his diligent ſtudy
of the Scripture, it pleaſed God to reveal his truth to him,
ſo that he became a Zealous Preacher of it, labouring in all
his Sermons to beat into mens minds, the truth and means
of our Juſtification, to conſiſt in Chriſt alone, and in
ſtedfaſt Faith in him; for which he was apprehended and
caſt into Priſon, where he endured all their cruelty with
Chriſtian Courage:<note place="margin">Tormented in Priſon.</note> at laſt with two of his Siſters he was
condemned; his Mother alſo and one of his Brothers
were impriſoned with him for the truth, and executed
ſhortly after; when he with his Siſters went out at the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48988:11"/>
Caſtle-Gate; having his Tongue at liberty, he began to
ſing the 106 <hi>Pſalm</hi> before all the People; who had often
heard him make many godly Sermons; he condemned all
Hypocrites as the worſt of People; whereupon they ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his tongue. Upon the Stage he never changed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
nor was at all daunted: when they all came to
the Stake, they had their Tongues looſed, and were
commanded to ſay their Creed, which they did carefully:
when they came to thoſe words, the Holy Catholick
Church, they were commanded to add, <hi>of Rome,</hi> but
that they all refuſed; whereupon their Necks were
broken in a trice, and then 'twas noiſed abroad, that they
added thoſe words and died, confeſſing the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Church in <hi>Sivil.</hi>
               </note> to be the true Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Sivil</hi> a Private Congregation of Gods
People, moſt of which the Inquiſitors conſumed in the Fire,
as they could diſcover any of them: amongſt others that
were apprehended, they took four women, famous
above the reſt, for their Holy and Godly Converſation,
but eſpecially the youngeſt of them, who was not above
one and twenty years old; who by her diligent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
reading of the Scriptures, and by conference with Godly
and learned Men, had attained to a very great meaſure of
knowledge, ſo that whilſt ſhe was in Priſon, ſhe non-pluſs'd
and put to ſhame many of thoſe <hi>Friers</hi> that came
to ſeduce her.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe Women was a Grave Matron, whoſe
Houſe was a School of Virtue; and a place where the
Saints uſed to meet and ſerve God day and night:<note place="margin">Some of them caſt into Priſon.</note> But
the time being come wherein they were ripe for God, they
together with other of their Neighbours were apprehended
and caſt into Priſon; where they were kept in dark Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
and forced to endure all the cruel and extream
torments before mentioned; at laſt they were condemned,
and brought forth to the Scaffold amongſt other Priſoners:
The young Maid eſpecially came with a merry and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Countenance, as it were triumphing over the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<note place="margin">A Cleft-Stick.</note> and having her tongue at liberty, ſhe began to ſing
<hi>Pſalms</hi> to God, whereupon the Inquiſitors cauſed her tongue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48988:11"/>
to be nipped, by ſetting a Burnacle upon it: after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was read, they were carried to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
<note place="margin">Their death</note> where with much Conſtancy and Courage they
ended their Lives; yet the Inquiſitors not ſatisfied here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
cauſed the Houſe of the Matron (where the Church
uſed to meet) to be pulled down,<note place="margin">Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> and the ground to be
laied waſt, and a Pillar to be erected upon it, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
ſhewing the cauſe.</p>
            <p>There was alſo apprehended another worthy Member
of the ſame Congregation,<note place="margin">Ferdinando</note> called <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> he was of
a Fervent Spirit, and very zealous in doing good; a young
Man, but for his integrity of Life very famous: he had
ſpent 8 years in educating of Youth, and had endeavoured
to ſow the Seed of Piety in the hearts of his Scholars, as
much as lay in him to do in a time of ſo great Perſecution,
and Tyranny; being at laſt apprehended for a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> he
was caſt into priſon and terribly tormented upon the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
<note place="margin">His Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and in the Trough, whereby he was ſo ſhaken in
every joint, that when he was taken down, he was not
able to move any part of his Body; yet did thoſe cruel
Tormentors drag him by the Heels into his priſon, as if
he had been a dead Dog; but notwithſtanding all his
torments he anſwered the Inquiſitors very ſtoutly, and
would not yeild to them one jot. During his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
God uſed him as an Inſtrument, to recal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
a <hi>Monk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A fpecial Providence.</note> who had been caſt into Priſon for confeſſing
the Goſpel openly: But by means of the Inquiſitors Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and fair Promiſes, he had ſomewhat relented: Gods
providence ſo ordering it, that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was caſt into the
ſame Priſon, and finding the <hi>Monk</hi> wavering, he rebuked
him ſharply;<note place="margin">Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermity.</note> and afterwards having drawn him to a ſight
of, and ſorrow for his ſin, he at laſt ſtrengthened him in
the promiſe of Free Grace and Mercy. Herereupon the
<hi>Monk</hi> deſired a day of hearing, where before the Inquiſitors he
ſolemnly renounced his recantation, deſiring that his former
Confeſſion might ſtand, whereupon a Sentence of Death paſſed
upon them both;<note place="margin">Recovery.</note> after which the Inquiſitors asked <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
whether he would revolt from his former Hereſies? To
which he anſwered, that he had profeſſed nothing but what
was agreable to the pure and perfect word of God,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48988:12"/>
and ought to be profeſſed of every Chriſtian-Man, and
therefore he would ſtick to it to his death; then they did clap
a Barnacle upon his Tongue, and ſo they were burned
together.<note place="margin">Execution.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo one <hi>Juliano</hi> called the little,<note place="margin">Juliano.</note> becauſe he
was of a ſmall and weak Body; who going into <hi>Germany,</hi>
was there converſant with divers learned and godly men,
by which means he attained to the knowledge of the truth,
and became a zealous Profeſſor of it, and earneſtly longing
after the ſalvation of his Country-Men,<note place="margin">Zeal.</note> he undertook a very
dangerous work, wihch was to convey two great dry Fats, full
of Bibles, printed in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> into his own Country: In the
attempt he had much cauſe of fear, the Inquiſitors had ſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
every Port, and kept ſuch ſtrict Watch to prevent the
coming in of all ſuch Commodities; but through Gods migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Protection,<note place="margin">A ſpecial Providence.</note> he brought his burden ſafely thither, and
which was alſo miraculous, he conveyed them ſafe into <hi>Sivil,</hi>
notwithſtanding the buſie Searchers, and Catchpoles that
watched in every corner; theſe Bibles being diſperſed, were
moſt joyfully and thankfully received; and through Gods
Bleſſing wrought wonderfully amongſt Gods people to ripen
them againſt the time of Harveſt: But at laſt the matter
broke out by the means of a falſe Brother, who going to the
Inquiſitors played the <hi>Judas,</hi> and betrayed the whole Church
to them,<note place="margin">A falſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> ſo that there were taken at <hi>Sivil</hi> at one time,
eight hundred Chriſtians, whereof twenty of them were
afterwards roſted at one fire.<note place="margin">20 Roſted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe, this <hi>Juliano</hi> was one of the firſt that was
apprehended and ſent to priſon, where he lay without any
company, laden with Irons above three years, yet was his
conſtancy ſo great and wonderful, that the Tormentors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were ſooner wearied in inflicting, than he in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Torments; and notwithſtanding his weak and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryiſh
Body, yet he remained undanted in mind in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
of all their Tyrannies, ſo that he departed from
the Rack leſs dejected than he came to it; neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
nor pains, nor torments made him ſhrink or yeild
one jot to them; but when he was drawn back to his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48988:12"/>
priſon, he would tell his Fellows how he had conquered and
confounded his Enemies, ſaying they depart vanquiſhed;
the Wolves flie with ſhame, they flie with ſhame.</p>
            <p>In the Day of their Triumph, when he was brought out
apparelled (with his other Fellow-Priſoners) in all their
ſhameful Habits, he exhorted them with a chearful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
ſaying, <hi>My Brethren, be of good Chear, this is the hour
wherein we muſt be faithful Witneſſes unto God and his Truth before
men, as becomes the true ſervants and Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, and
ere long we ſhall have him to witneſs with us again; and within a few
hours we ſhall Triumph with him in Heaven for ever;</hi> but hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they preſently clapt a Barnacle upon his Tongue, that he
ſhould ſpeak no more, and ſo he was led to his Execution;
but though he could not ſpeak, yet by his Countenance and
Geſtures,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> he ſhewed his chearful and quiet mind; then kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, he kiſſed the Step whereon he ſtood, and being
tied to the Stake, he endeavoured by his Looks and Geſtures
to encourage his fellow-Martyrs in their Sufferings, and ſo
they quietly and patiently reſigned up their Spirits unto
God.</p>
            <p>There was alſo one <hi>John Leon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John Leon.</note> a <hi>Taylor</hi> by trade, who out
of a blind Deovotion to ſerve God, reſolved to enter into a
Monaſtery; but by Gods Providence it ſo fell out that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a Cloiſter at <hi>Sivil,</hi> wherein moſt of the Monks
were well affected to the true Religion, amongſt whom in
two or three years ſpace he was ſo grounded in the Principles
of Religion, that he reſolved to leave that kind of Life, which
accordingly he did, and went into the Countrey; yet after a
time, he had a great mind to confer with his former School-maſters;
but when he came back to the Cloiſter, he found
that they were all fled into <hi>Germany;</hi> hereupon he reſolved
to follow them, and through many Dangers and Perils it
pleaſed God at laſt, after a long and tedious Journey, to

Exiles who lived in thoſe parts, were called home; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
divers <hi>Spaniards</hi> that ſojourned at <hi>Geneva,</hi> thinking
<hi>England</hi> a fitter place for their Congregation, reſolved to
acompany the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and for this end they diſperſed

travel with the more ſafety. The Inquiſitors took
the departure of theſe <hi>Monks</hi> ſo ill, that not ſparing any
coſt, they ſent Flies abroad to apprehend them, who way-laid
them, eſpecially at <hi>Colen, Francfort, Antwerp,</hi> and in
all the ways that led from <hi>Geneva:</hi> This <hi>John Leon</hi> had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

               <hi>John Leon</hi> took his arreſt very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly,
never changing countenance at it: they were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried back into the Town, where they were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
racked to diſcover their Fellows, and not long after were
ſhipped for <hi>Spain;</hi>

               </note> having great Irons wrought like a Net
that covered both head and feet, within which alſo was
another peice of Iron made like a tongue, which being
thruſt into their mouths took away their ſpeech; they were
alſo loaden with other Engines and Fetters of Iron, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were bound hand and foot, and in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
pains and torments they lay a Ship-board till they
came into <hi>Spain,</hi> and then <hi>John Leon</hi> was ſent to <hi>Sivil,</hi> and his
Companion to <hi>Validolid,</hi> where afterwards in defence of the
truth he ſuffered Martyrdom; but <hi>John</hi> remained long in priſon,
where he taſted of the Inquiſitors Tyranny, ſuffering both
hunger and cold,<note place="margin">Tormented.</note> and enduring all their torments one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, and at laſt was brought out in their ſolemn ſhew,
arraied after the uſual manner: It was a ſad ſight to ſee
ſuch a Ghoſt as he was; his Hair ſo grown, his Body
ſo lean, that he had nothing but Skin and Bones left on
him, and his pain much encreaſed by having a Barnacle
upon his Tongue. After Sentence of Death pronounced
upon him, they ſet his Tongue at liberty, hoping that he
would have recanted, but he made a ſtout and godly
confeſſion of his Faith, and ſo quietly ended his Life in
the flames.<note place="margin">Martyred.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48988:13"/>
There was alſo burned at the ſame time a Godly Virgin,
that had formerly been a <hi>Nun,</hi> but being through Gods Grace
converted, ſhe left her Cloiſter, and joyned her ſelf to
the Church of Chriſt; being apprehended by the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſhe was treated as others had been before her; and
at laſt was brought on the Scaffold,<note place="margin">A Maids Sufferings.</note> where wirh Manly Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

calling them Dumb Dogs, a Generation of Vipers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Being brought to the ſtake, with a chearful Countenance ſhe
underwent the pains of Death, and ſo quietly ſlept in
the Lord.</p>
            <p>There was alſo one <hi>Chriſtopher Loſada,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtopher Loſada.</note> a Phyſitian, a
Learned Man and very well ſtudied in the Scriptures; as
alſo of a very holy Converſation, inſomuch as he was
choſen Superintendent of the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Sivil,</hi>
which at this time was very great, though diſperſed into
Corners. At laſt he was apprehended by the Inquiſitors,
before whom he had made good Confeſſion of his Faith,
for which he endured hard and ſharp Impriſonment with
moſt cruel Torments, and the open Infamy of their
ſolemn Shew: And laſtly was adjudged to the Fire. As
he ſtood at the ſtake, the Barnacle being taken from his
Tongue, hd diſputed notably with ſome <hi>Monks</hi> that came
to ſeduce him; and when they ſpake <hi>Latine,</hi> that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People might not underſtand them; <hi>Loſada</hi> alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſpeak in <hi>Latin</hi> ſo copiouſly &amp; eloquently,<note place="margin">His Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> as was ſtrange
to hear that he ſhould have his wits ſo freſh when he was
ready to be burned,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> after which he patiently reſigned up
his ſpirit to God in the Fire.</p>
            <p>There was alſo in <hi>Sivil</hi> one <hi>Arias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arias.</note> a man of a ſharp
wit, and well ſtudied in Divinity, but withall of a Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Wit and Inconſtant Nature, which Vices he yet cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a Cloak of Religion; whereby he deceived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
About this time there were alſo in this City two ſorts
of Preachers, and both had a great number of Auditors;
the one taught School-Divinity, and were continually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their Hearers to often Faſtings, Mortification, Self-denial,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48988:14"/>
Frequency of Prayer, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But themſelves
practiſed nothing leſs than theſe things: And indeed all
their Religion conſiſted in Words and Bodily Exerciſes, as
running to <hi>Maſſes,</hi> Hallowed Places, Shrift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort dealt more ſincerely with the Holy Scriptures,
out of which they declared what was true Righteouſneſs and
perfect Holineſs; By means whereof that City above all others
in <hi>Spain,</hi> bore the name for juſt and true Dealing, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God that the brightneſs of this Light did diſcover all the
Counterfeit Holineſs, and Phariſaical Devotion of the other
Party: The chief Labourers in this Harveſt, were <hi>Constantine,
Aegidius,</hi> and <hi>Varguius,</hi> all Doctors, and ſober, wiſe and
learned Men, who by this kind of Preaching procured to
themſelves many Enemies, but above all others, <hi>Arias</hi> was
the moſt ſpightful and malicious, yet he carried it ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he ſtill kept up his Reputation with theſe men, but it
was not long before he diſcovered himſelf, and that upon this
occaſion. There was one <hi>Ruzius,</hi> a Learned Man, queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before the Inquiſitors for ſomething that he delivered in a
Sermon about the Controverſies in Religion; the Inquiſitors
appointed him a day of hearing; and two or three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Arias</hi> met him, ſaluted him courteouſly, and diſcourſed
familiarly with him: then did he pump out of him all thoſe
Arguments wherewith he intended to defend himſelf before the
Inquiſitors. When the day came, and <hi>Ruzius</hi> appeared, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
went on that ſide where his Opponents were, which much
amazed <hi>Ruzius,</hi> and in the Diſputation, <hi>Arias</hi> being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
did ſo wittily enervate all his Arguments, that <hi>Ruzius</hi> had
nothing to ſay for himſelf, and ſo was fain to yield the Cauſe,
and <hi>Arias</hi> went away with the Honour of the Field, though he
got it by Treachery. Yet did this <hi>Arias,</hi> being of St. <hi>Iſidores</hi>'s
Monaſtery, Preach ſo practically, that a great Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to dawn in that dark place; for the whole Scope of his
Sermons was to overthrow their Profeſſion; he taught them,
that ſinging and ſaying of heir Prayers night and day was
no Service of God, that the Holy Scriptures were to be
read and ſtudied with diligence, whence alone the true
Service of God could be drawn, and which alone tells us
the true obedience to his will, to the obtaining whereof we
muſt uſe Prayer as a Means, proceeding as well from a ſenſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48988:14"/>
and feeling of our own Infirmities, as grounded upon a
perfect truſt and confidence in God.</p>
            <p>By laying theſe Foundations, through Gods Bleſſing, he
began to make them out of Love with their <hi>Monkiſh</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and much provoked them to the ſtudy of the
Holy Scriptures; beſides alſo his Sermons, he read daily
a Lecture upon <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs very learnedly, and made
application thereof with good Judgment and Diſcretion;
alſo in private conference he did much good: the Lord
alſo ſo ordered it in his wiſdom, that he met with Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that were very tractable, ſuch as were not greatly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their Superſtitions. And ſuch was the force and
might of Gods Election, that theſe few good Seeds ſo fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that in the end they brought forth a great encreaſe
of Godlineſs; for divers of the <hi>Monks</hi> that hereby had their
Conſciences awakened and cleared, to ſee their former Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
and Idolatry, ſought out for further Inſtruction,
and through Gods mercy, they light upon thoſe Preachers
which taught the truth with more ſincerity, of whom
they learned the Principles of pure and perfect Religion,
ſo that by degrees they left that evil Opinion which they
had formerly conceived againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to read their Books: and God miraculouſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them, they had all ſorts of Books brought them,
that were extant at that time, either in <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi>
whereby it came to paſs, that there were very few in all
that Cloiſter, but they had ſome taſt of true Religion
and Godlineſs; ſo that inſtead of mumbling their Mattens,
they brought in Divinity-Lectures, and Vain Faſting
was turned into Chriſtian Sobriety; neither were any
taught to be <hi>Monkiſh,</hi> but to be ſincerely and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
            <p>But conſidering, that when this ſhould be once known,
they could not live in any ſafety, they reſolved among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to forſake their Neſt, and to flie into <hi>Germany,</hi> where
they might enjoy more ſafety of their Lives, and freedom of
their Conſciences; but how to get thither, was all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
if one or two ſhould go firſt, the reſt would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48988:15"/>
to danger; if many ſhould go together, a thouſand to
one but they would be taken again, being to travel from the
furtheſt part of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Germany:</hi> yet upon Debate they
concluded that they muſt all either ſpeedily depart, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be apprehended by the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> who now had got ſome
inckling of the matter; and God ſeeing them in this Diſtreſs,
ſhewed them a means how, under an honeſt pretence, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of them might depart together within a Month, and each
of them betake himſelf a ſeveral way to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where they
appointed, by Gods aſſiſtance, all to meet within a Twelve-month:
the reſt, which were but young Novices, were left
behind; who yet not long after were ſo ſtrengthened by God,
that they endured the Brunt of Perſecution when it came,
three of them being burned, and divers others diverſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>The aforementioned Servants of Jeſus Chriſt forſook that
place where they lived in honour, eaſe, and plenty; and by
undertaking for Chriſt's ſake a voluntary Exile, expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Shame, Ignominy, Wants, yea, and were in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
danger of their Lives alſo. And under God <hi>Arias</hi> was a
great means of this, who by his Miniſtry had firſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them with the Knowledge of the Truth; for which
he was often complained of to the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
before them; where he ſo cunningly anſwered the
Matter, that he was ſtill diſcharged: but this laſt Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(through the Mercy of God) brought forth in him the
Fruits of true Repentance;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arias</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</note> for he did ſo deeply and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
bewail and repent of his former withholding of the
Truth in unrighteouſneſs, that whereas he uſed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fearful of the Rack, he being brought to it, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, with a marvellous conſtancy withſtood the enemies of
of Gods Truth, and took up the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> roundly, withal
telling them that he was heartily ſorry,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> and did moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
repent him, for that he had wittingly and willingly in
their preſence impugned the Truth, againſt the godly Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the ſame; many other ſharp Rebukes he gave to the
<hi>Inquiſitors</hi> ſo often as he came to his Anſwer: But at laſt
he was brought forth arrayed in their accuſtomed manner,
upon their Day of Triumph; at which time, he alſo made
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48988:15"/>
a notable Profeſſion of his Faith, and ſo was led from the
Stage to the Stake with a merry and chearful countenance,
where, by the notable Example of his Repentance at his
Death, he made ſatisfaction to the Church of Chriſt for all
his former unfaithful and hypocritical dealing with it; and ſo
quietly ſlept in the Lord.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee what hath been the Lot and Portion
of the Church and People of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>through many Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
they ſhould enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Here you have a
certain and infallible Mark of the true Church of Chriſt, <hi>viz.
To be hated and perſecuted by the Devil and his Instruments.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

of the Church of Chriſt, by reaſon of that cruel
<hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, let us conſider, if that Religion ſhould

            <p>THe Inſtitution of this <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> at firſt was not
only neceſſary (as the condition of affairs then was)
but exceeding laudable, had it been kept within the bounds
at firſt intended; but inſtead of being uſed on the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Moors,</hi> it hath been turned on the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and that with
ſuch violence and extremity of Torture, that it is counted the
greateſt Tyranny, and ſevereſt kind of Perſecution under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
inſomuch that many <hi>Papists</hi> who would willingly die
for their Religion, abhor the very name and mention of it, and
to the death withſtand the bringing in of this Slavery amongſt
them; this was it which cauſed the irremediable Revolt of the
<hi>Low-Countries;</hi> the greateſt part of that Nation, at the time of
their taking Arms, being <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; yet it is planted
and eſtabliſhed in <hi>Spain</hi> and all <hi>Italy (Naples</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
the management thereof committed to the moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rigorous <hi>Friers</hi> in the whole Pack; the leaſt ſuſpicion of
Hereſy, (as they call it) Affinity or Commerce with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
reproving the Lives of the Clergy, keeping any
Books or Editions of Books prohibited, or diſcourſing in
matters of Religion, are Offences ſufficient; nay they will
charge Mens Conſciences under the pains of Damnation,
to detect their neareſt and deareſt Friends, if they do but
ſuſpect them to be herein culpabl. Their proceedings are with
great ſecrecy and ſeverity; for, 1. The parties accuſed ſhall
never know their Accuſer, but ſhall be conſtrain'd to reveal
their own thoughts and affections. 2. If they be but convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of any Errour in any of their Opinions, or be gainſayed
by two Witneſſes, they are immediately condemned. 3. If
nothing can be proved againſt them, yet ſhall they with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
tortures and miſeries be kept in the houſe divers years, for
a terrour unto others. And laſtly, If they eſcape the firſt
Brunt with many torments and much anguiſh, yet the ſecond
Queſtion or Suſpition brings Death remedileſs. And as for
torments and kinds of Death, <hi>Phalaris</hi> and his Fellow-Tyrants
came far ſhort of theſe Blood-hounds.</p>

The Adminiſtration of this Office, for the more orderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
and diſpatch thereof, is diſtributed into 12 Courts or
<hi>Supream Tribunals</hi> for the ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> no one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon another, but in ſort ſubordinate to the <hi>General
Inquiſition,</hi> remaining in the Court near the King's Perſon, which
hath a kind of Superintendency over thoſe Tribunals. In all
which, thoſe of the Secular Clergy ſit as Judges, the Friers being
only uſed as Promoters, to inform the Court, and bring more
Griſt unto the Mill of theſe <hi>Inquiſitors:</hi> every one hath the title
of Lord, and are a great terrour to the Neigbouring Peaſants;
certain it is, that by this means the people of this Kingdom are
ſo kept under, that they dare not hearken after any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
than what their Prieſts and Friers ſhall be pleaſed to
teach them; or entertain the Truth, if it comes amongſt
them, or call in queſtion any of thoſe palpable and groſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures
which every day are put upon them: for by this
means the People of this Kingdom have been, and ſtill are,
punctual Followers of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that too in
the very errors and corruptions of it, taking up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
on the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, and therein ſo tenacious or
pertinacious, that the King doth ſuffer none to live in his
Dominions which profeſs not the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion;
of which they have been, ſince the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> ſuch
avowed Patrons, that one of the late Popes being ſick, and
hearing divers men to bemoan his approaching end, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome words to this effect; My Life, ſaid he, can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
benefit the Church, but pray for the Proſperity of
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as its chief Supporter. And thus you
