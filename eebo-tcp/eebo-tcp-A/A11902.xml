            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

now intoo the Court ageine
after long discontinewaunce,
attendyng as an interpreter
vpon the worthy Phlosopher
<hi>Seneca,</hi> sometyme a Courtyer,
and also a Counseller of the
greatest state in the worlde. The matter whiche
he is too speake of, is the true maner of benefityng
or doyng of good turnes; a thing of all others most
profitable for mans life, and whiche maketh men
like vntoo God. In the declaration whereof, he
sheweth what a Benefite is; why, how, when, too
what ende, and on whom it is too bee bestowed;
what reward is too bee looked for in the dooing
of it, and what frute it yeeldeth again. Likewise at
whose hande, with what mynde, and when a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
is too bee receiued: how and when wee should
requite it, or remaine still detters for it; and by
what meanes a man maie bee either beneficiall or
<pb facs="tcp:17645:3"/>
thankfull, euen without cost or peine. His princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and preceptes are, in substaunce, Diuine; in
forme, Philosophicall; in effect, frutefull. His sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are short, quick, and full of matter; his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
sharpe, piththie, and vnaffected; his whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of writyng graue, deepe, and seuere; fitted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to the reforming of mennes myndes, and
not too the delyghting of their eares. But great
is the libertie of truthe emong wise menne, and yet
greater is the prerogatiue therof emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g good men.
For wise men knowe that the wholsemost meates
are not alwaies best in tast, nor the moste souerein
medcines alwaies pleasauntest. And good menne
being desirous too haue their faultes rather cured
than couered, doo finde as well in infirmities of
mynde, as of bodie, that the first step to helth is too
discerne the diseaze, and the next is too receiue the
right Medicine for it: Onely too the vnwise and
wicked sorte, truthe is troublesome and odious;
because they cannot abyde the bryghtnesse of her
countenance, nor the power and maiestie of her
presence. I haue therefore thought this woorke
not vnmeete too bee put intoo our Moothertung,
that the mo myght take benefyte by it; nor yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient
too comme in Courtyers handes, who
shalbe so muche the greater Ornament too them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and too the place whereof they take their
name, as their Courtesies and Benefytes bee mo
and greater towardes others. And how woorthie
it is too bee embrased of Counsellers; I referre
mee too the iudgement of suche as shall voutsafe

will thinke it a verie fit present for mee too offer
vnto you in respect of the place wherintoo you are

my duetyfull good will towards you. And thus

of conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the good

for vs too complayn, forasmucheas thei were lost in the verie
bestowing of them. And it is no maruell that among so many
and so greate vyces, there is none more ryfe than vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
I see many causes thereof.</p>
               <p>The first is, that wee choose not worthie persones too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
vpon. But if wee mynde too put out money too interest,
wée make diligent inquirie of the landes and substaunce of our

as for our benefites (without any choycemaking) wee rather
throwe them away, than bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say, whether it bée more shame too deny a man a benefite, or too
claime it ageine. For this is suche a kynde of credit, as a man
must receiue no more of it, that is frankly offered hym. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

whiche suspecting that somewhat should bee requested of him,
hath not knit the browes, turned awaie his face, feyned buzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

from how greate miseries they were deliuered, and the feare
that went before, is an aduauncing of the good turne that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seweth.
Yet notwithstanding, wee must not therefore vse the
lesse haste in sauing of a man, than wee can, too the ende that

theis, are the thinges without whiche wee may in deede liue:

Of this sort is monnye, not superfluous, but orderly prepared

hath looked what maner a one a Father ought too bee; he shall

                  </gap>e certein
dewties requisite in the Husbond; and no lesse is looked for in
the wife. As much as these doe require one of another, so much
also doo they owe one another; and are to bee measured all by
one rule, which (as <hi>Hecaton</hi> sayeth) is hard. For al honest thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are hard too atteine vntoo, and so are the thinges that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
neere too honestie. For they must not only bee doone,
but they must bee doone with reason. Shee must be our guyde
too followe all our lyfe. All thinges both small and great must
bee doone by her aduyce: according as shee counselleth, so must
wee giue. The first thing that shee will teache vs, is that wee
must not take at all mennes handes. Of whom then shall wee
take? Too answer thee in feawe wordes, of them too whom it
may beseeme vs too giue. For certesse wee ought too bee more
precyse in seeking too whom wee may make ourselues det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
than on whom wee may bestowe. For although there fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
none other discommoditie; (as there folowe verie many)
Yet is it a greate corzie too bee in daunger too such a one as
thou wouldest not. Contrariwise it is the greatest pleasure in
the world, too haue receyued a good turne at such a mannes
hand, as thou couldest fynd in thyne harte too loue, euen after
he hath doon thee wrong. But for a man too be driuen too haue
him of whom he hath no liking; it is too an honest and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17645:23"/>
mynde, the greatest miserie that can bee. I must alwayes
put you in remembraunce, that I speake not of perfect wyse
men: which lyke whatsoeuer they ought too doo, which haue
their willes at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, which bynd themselues wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vntoo
they liste, and performe whatsoeuer they haue bounde
themselues vnto: but of vnperfect men, which haue a desyre too
folowe honestie, but their affections are stubborne in obeying.
Therfore he must bee a chozen man, at whose hand I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a benefyte. And truely I ought too bee more heedfull
too whom I indette my self for a benefyte, than for monie. For
too him that lendes mee monny, I must paye no more than I
haue taken: and when I haue payd it, I am free and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
But vntoo the other I must pay more: and when I haue
requyted him, yet neuerthelesse I am still beholden to hym.
For when I haue requyted I must begin new agein, &amp; freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
warneth mee too admit no vnworthie persone. So is the
Law of benefites a most holy law, wherout of sprinketh frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Some man will say, It lyes not alwayes in myne owne
power too refuse: I must sommetyme take a good turne whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I will or no. A cruell and testie Tyraunt profers mee a
gift, &amp; if I refuse it, he wil thinke I hold skorne of hym. Shal
I not take it? Put the same cace of a Murderer or a Pyrate,
as of a Tyrant that hath a murdering and theeuish hart: what
shall I doo? He is not worthie that I should bee beholden too
him. When I say thou must make choyce too whom thou wilt
bee beholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; I except force and feare, in whose presence choyce
hath no place. If it bee free for thee, if it bee at thine owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
too take or refuze: then aduize thyselfe what to doo.
But if constreint barre thee of thy libertie, thou must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that thou dooste not receiue, but obey. Noman is bound
by the receyuing of that which he might not refuse. Wilt thou
know whither I bee willing or no? then set mee at liberty too
bee vnwilling if I list. But what and if he haue giuen thee lyfe?
It makes no matter what it bée that is giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except it bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

that were freshe in mynd with them, while they were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doon, dooe weare out of remembraunce in processe of tyme.
Concerning whiche sort of men, I remember I haue had hard
hold with you, bycause you termed them not vnthankfull, but
forgetfull. As who would say, that that thing should excuse an
vnthankfull persone, which made him vnthankfull: or els that
because some man happeneth too bee forgetfull, he should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not bee counted vnthankfull, whereas noman happeneth
too bee forgetfull, but the vnthankfull. There are many kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of vnthankfull persones, as Théeues and Murtherers: of
whom the fault is all one, but there is greate diuersitie in the
circumstances. Unthankfull is he that denieth the receiuyng
of a good turne whiche he hath receiued. Unthankfull is he
that dissembleth it. Unthankfull is he that requiteth it not.
But moste vnthankfull of all, is he that hath forgotten it. For
although the rest discharge not themselues; yet are they det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

their ease. But neuer can he become thankfull, that hath vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

woorse, in whom the thanke of a good turne is loste, or him in
whom the verie remembraunce of it is loste also? Faultie are
those eyes that cannot awaye with the lyght: but starke blynde
are those that see not at all. Not too loue ones Parentes is a

Who is so thanklesse as he, whiche hauyng suche a thing

not too bee made a matter in Lawe. Firste
of all, the beste part of the benefite or good
turne perisheth, if a manne should haue his
Action for it, as he vseth too haue for len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of monnie, or for bargaines of hyring
and letting out. For the greatest grace of
a good turne, is that wée haue doon it, euen though wee should
lose it, so as wee haue put the matter wholly too the courtesie
of the receiuers. But if I arrest him: If I call him before a
Iudge: It beginneth too bee a dette, and not a benefite. Agein
whereas it is a moste commendable thing too requite: It cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
too bée commendable, if it comme too bée of necessitie. For
noman will commend a thankfull persone, more than him that
hath restored a thing that was deliuered him too keepe, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his dette without being sewed. So shall wee marre
twoo thinges at once, that is too witte, a thankfull man, and a
beneficiall man; than whiche, there are not any goodlier thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in mannes life. For what greate point of excellencie is
there, either in the one if he bestowe not his good turne freely,
but lende it: or in the other if he requite, not because he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but because he needes must? It deserueth no praise too bée
thankfull, except a man may safely bee vnthankfull. Moreouer
this inconuenience would insewe: that all Courtes would bee
too little for this Lawe. Who is he that myght not sewe; who
is he that might not bee sued? All men extoll their owne doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
all men inlarge the thynges that they haue bestowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
others, bee they neuer so small. Furthermor, whatsoeuer
thinges doo fall within the compasse of examination, may bee
determined without giuing the Iudge infinite libertie. And
therefore the state of a good cace, séemeth better if it bee putte
too a Iudge, than if it bée put too an vmper; because the Iudge
is bounde too an order, and hath his certeine boundes set him,
whiche he may not passe: But the vmpers conscience beeyng
<pb facs="tcp:17645:35"/>
frée, and tyde too no boundes, may bothe adde and take awaye,
and directe his sentence, not accordyng as Lawe and Iustice
counsell him, but accordyng as humanitie and pitie shall moue
him. An Action of vnkyndnesse would not bynde the Iudge.
but sette him at libertie too rule thinges as he listed. For it is
not certein what a benefite should bee. Agein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how greate soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it bee, it were muche too the matter, how fauourably the
Iudge would conster it. No Lawe defineth what an vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
persone is. Oftentymes he that hath rendered as muche
as he receiued, is vnthankfull: and he that hath not rendered, is
thankfull. Also there bee somme matters, whiche euen an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
Iudge maye dismisse the Court of: as in caces where
the parties must confesse a deede, or no deede. Where the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Euidence dispatcheth all doutes: where verie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

must bee coniectured of; when a thing commeth in question,

take one that is meete for thee and helpe him. In bringing vp

I reskwe a man beset with theeues, so as he is suffered too go
away safely. I defend an accused persone that is in daunger to
bee oppressed by parcialitie, and purchace the displeasure of
greate men for my labour: so as they charge mee with mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
and the miserie that I dispatched him out of, lighteth
perchaunce vpon myself, whereas I might haue gone ageinst
him, or safely haue sitten still as a looker on in another mans
matter. Yea I vndertake for him when iudgement is past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
him, and suffer not execution to go out vpon his goods,
but offer too bee bound for him too his creditors: and too the
intent I may saue him from outlawing. I ronne in daunger to
be outlawed myself. Noman being redy too purchace the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur

himself in it in the sommer season, will stand debating for
what yeeres he shall buye it: when he hath bought it, he muste
hold him too it. The like reason is in benefyting. For if yee

after the constitutions of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi>

For a foole is hee that is euill; but he that is euill, is voyd of

all euill men are heddie, couetouse, lecherous, and malicious.

To that thanklesse persone which hath the vyce
of thankfulnesse, none otherwise but as he hath al other vyces,
a good man must doo good turnes. For if he should withhold
from suche: he should doo good too noman. But affor the other
thanklesse persone, too whom all is fish that comes too Nette,
and whiche makes no conscience at all of the matter: he shall
nomore bestowe a good turne vppon him, than vppon a Theef.
Who will put an vnthrift in trust with his Monie, or leaue a
Pledge in the hande of him that hath forsworne many men
their Pledges before? Wee call him fearefull whiche is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and led by naughtipackes that are beset with all kynd of
vyces without exception. Also he is properly called fearefull
by nature, which is frighted at euery tryfling noyze. The foole
hath all vyces, yet is he not naturally giuen to them all. One
is giuen too Nigardship, another too Lechery, and another

menne) he thought rather too saye him naye cunningly, than
stoutly and proudly. He saied he would receiue no benefites at

Perchaunce he feared least he might haue bin compelled too

not, he might haue refuzed. But then should he haue prouoked

he doeth it alway and without ceassing. He cannot keepe a iust

for how should a man discerne, whither he doe himself a good

should twoo contraries cloze in one; so as giuing and taking
should bee al one thing. But there is great difference betwixt
giuing and taking. And good cause why: considering how
those woordes are matched fullbutte one ageinste another. I
sayd a little afore, how some woordes haue relation too other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes,
and are of suche nature, that the whole signification of
them departeth from ourselues. I am a brother, howbeeit too
anotherman: for noman is brother too himself. I am a peere;
but too anotherman: for noman is peere too himselfe. The
thing that is compared, is not vnderstoode without his
match: and the thing that is cuppled is not without a felowe.
So also, the thing that is giuen, is not without a receyuer:
neither is a Benefite without another too bee benefited by it.
The same thing appeereth by the verie Terme wherein this
benefiting is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined. But noman benefiteth himself, nomore
than hee fauoureth himself or taketh part with himself. Wee
may prosecute this matter yet longer and with mo examples.

is an honest and allowable thing: but an honest and allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing cannot bee fastned vppon an euill man: neyther then
can a benefite be fastened vppon an euill man. But, if he cannot
receyue it, then ought he not too requyte it: and so is he not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull.
On the other sade, (as you say) a good man dooth althinges
aright: But if he doo all thinges aright, then can hee
not bee vnthankfull: <hi>Ergo</hi> inasmuche as a good man requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and an euill man taketh not: it followeth that there is
neyther good man nor euill man vnthankfull: and so, vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

without signification.</p>
               <p>There is but one good thing among vs, and that is hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.
This cannot light vppon an euill man. For he ceasseth too
bee euill, assone as vertue entereth into him. But as long as he
is euill, noman can fasten a good turn vpon him, because good
<pb facs="tcp:17645:78"/>
thinges and euill thinges are at discorde among themselues,
and cannot cloze in one. The same also is the reason why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
can profite him, because that whatsoeuer commeth too
him, he marreth it by abusing it. For like as the stomacke that
is infected with sicknesse and accloyed with choler, chaungeth
all the meates that it receyueth, and turneth all foode intoo the
nurrishment of his disease: Euen so a blynded mynd, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

bee verie goodly and profitable if they were bestowed vppon a

no good, (for what had it skilled him after what maner

had he thereby?</p>
               <p>I will tell thee what the Sonne gotte. By mee he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a reuerend and necessarie dutie. I haue doone that thing
for his father, whiche hee himself both would and should haue
doone. Now, if I did it not for comon pitie and manners sake
onely, as I might haue buried any other dead mans bodie: but
knewe the carkesse, and thought vppon the Sonne at the same
tyme, and did it for his sake: then is it a Benefite. But if I cast
earth vppon an vnknowen persone: I haue no detter for this
courtesie, because it was but a poynt of Publik humanitie.</p>
               <p>Some man will say why make you suche a question on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you bestowe your benefite, as though you ment too clayme it

               <p>There are that thincke it ought neuer too bee claymed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geine,
and they alledge these causes. He that is vnworthie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

render of his owne accorde. Moreouer if thou haue bestowed
vppon a good man, take heede thou doo him not wrong in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vppon him, as though he would not haue requyted of his
owne free will. And if thou haue bestowed vppon an euil man,
bee sory for thy so dooyng: but disgrace not thy benefite with
thyne owne woords, by making it a Det. Furthermore, looke,
what the Law of benefiting hath not commaunded to bee clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

can bee taken awaye from a man.
Somme say it can not, because it is
not a substance, but a déede. For like
as a present is one thing, &amp; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
of it is another: and like as
he that sayleth is one thing, and the
sayling itself is another: And albée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
that a sicke man bee not without
sicknes: yet is not the sicke man and his sicknesse alone thing:
So likewise the benefite itself is one thing, and the thing that
commeth too eche of vs with the Benefite, is another thing.
The benefite itself is a bodilesse thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot bee made
<pb facs="tcp:17645:87"/>
voyd: but the matter of it is tossed too and fro, and chaungeth
his Mayster. Therefore although thou take it awaye, yet can
not nature call backe that which shee hath giuen. Nature may
breake of hir benefites, but shee cannot reuoke them. He that
is dead, hath bin alyue: and he that hath lost his eyes, hath also
seene. It may bee brought too passe that the thinges whiche
are come too vs, may cease too bee: but that they may not haue
bin, it is impossible. A part of a benefite, yea and the surest part
of a benefite, is that whiche hath bin. Diuerse tymes wee bee
letted too inioye the vse of a benefite anie long tyme: but the
benefite itself cannot bee razed out. Although nature should
call all her powers about hir too doo it, yet should she not bee
able too vndoo that whiche is once doone. Houses, Monnye,
Bondmen, and whatsoeuer else the name of a benefite cleaueth
vntoo, may bee taken away. But the Benefite itself is stedfast
and vnmouable. No force can bring too passe, that the one shal
not haue giuen, and the other receyued.</p>

taketh awaie the commendacion of all their former kyndnesse.
The benefite is not taken awaie, but the thank of the benefite:
and it commeth too passe, not that I haue it not, but that I am

Manie tymes also the benefite remayneth, and yet is not the

Therefore a Benefite cannot bee bestowed vppon a wise

               <p>Nothyng letteth, but that a thyng maye bee bothe a wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes,
and also his that possesseth it, too whom the gifte and

howbeeit in suchewise, as euery manne neuerthelesse
hath his peculiar ownershippe in the thing that is his. By the
Ciuill Lawe, all thynges are the kynges. And yet the same
thynges whereof the vniuersall possession perteineth too the
kyng, are lefte too seuerall owners, and euery thyng hath his
peculiar proprietarie. Therefore wee maye giue the Kyng,
bothe House, and Villaynes, and Monnie, and yet not bee
saied too giue hym of his owne gooddes. For the prerogatiue
of all thynges belongeth too Kynges, and the propertie too
eche seuerall persone. Wee terme it the territorie of <hi>Athens,</hi>
or <hi>Campaine,</hi> whiche otherwise the neighbours parte emong
themselues by priuate boundes: and yet is all the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie

Is there any doute but a bondman, and all that he hath is
his Lordes? Yet maye he giue his Lorde a presente. For the
Bondman hath not therefore nothyng because hee should haue
nothyng if his Landlorde lifted. Neither is it therefore the
lesse a gifte, when he hath presented it willyngly, because it
might haue bin taken from hym whither he would or no.
What should wee stande prouyng of all thynges? For it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie
agreed betwixte vs, that all thynges are a wisemannes.
Lette vs gather that whiche is in question: namely how there
maye remaine matter of liberalitie towardes hym, whom wee
haue graunted too bee owner of all thynges. All thynges that
Children possesse, are their Fathers: and yet who knoweth not
that the Sonne maye giue somewhat too the Father? All thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are the Goddes: yet offer wee giftes too the Goddes, and
cast offerynges intoo their boxe. That whiche I haue is not

And therfore there is no cause why thou shouldest thinke thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

foole, thou discernest not the tymes
of thy losse. Thou hast lost it in déed:
but that was at thy first bestowing
of it, and now it is come too light.
Discretion hath greatly preuayled
euen in those thinges that seemed
as good as lost. As the diseases of
the bodie are too bée handled softly,
so are the diseases of the mynd also. Oftentymes the thing
that would haue bin vnwound with leysure, is broken of by
the roughnesse of him that pulles it out. What neede euill
woordes? what needes complaint? what needeth brawling?
Why doost thou discharge him? Why doost thou let him go?
If he bee vnthankfull, now oweth he thee nothing. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is it too set him on a chafe, vppon whom thou hast bestowed
manie thinges, that of a doutfull freend hee may beecome an
