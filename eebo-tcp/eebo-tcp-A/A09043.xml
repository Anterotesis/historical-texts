            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when they had thus past the bounds of Hetruria, they trauelled with greater ease and lesse care, yet very pensiue to be exempt of such cares, and so to be eased, as counting them happie that had valiantly solde their liues in defence of their countrey and common wealth, who breathing their last, (hauing their speares-point in their enemyes bosome) liued honourably, and dyed valiantly: whose liues were as full of vertues as their deathes were of valure. Afflicted thus with treble griefes, that he liued after so many worthie and resolute men, he wandered certaine dayes in the desertes of Liguria, yet nothing dismayde with these londe Alarums of cruell Fortune, setting her at defiance with <hi>Byas,</hi> as knowing her mutable weakenesse to be vnable to robbe him of his patience, which was a strong towre against her bitter frownes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For euen as a dwarffe standing vpon the battlements of the highest Towre, is but of a small stature: and a Gyant in the depth of a dungeon, is of a huge bignesse: So a wise man, in what chaunge soeuer of Fortune, is euer the same. Thus not greatly waying his owne misfortunes, being so well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in worldly accidents, that he knewe the highest type of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie (sometimes) to be the first steppe to a perduring miserie: but neuertheles maruellous sorrowfull and heauie, for his faithfull spouse and louing infant, who vnacquainted with such hard travels, and not so animated by nature as he, to sustaine the weltring waues of such desperate accidentes, were nowe become very weake and feeble, greatly distressed for want of reliefe: and their distresse procuring his vnmeasurable woe, his woe their despaire, their despaire his prouident care to prouide for their safetie, supposing it a greater pollicie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble his owne griefe, thereby to mollifie the extremitie of their violent passions, then by any further relation of his myseries, to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate the same.

               <p>The mount Apenninus (which nowe they had recouered) being thus filled with the Ecchoes of their dolorous complaints, metaphisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally as it seemed, (mooued thereunto with a kinde of pitie) repeated againe their sorrowes in such wise, that the sound thereof redoubling in the aire, could haue resolued a tirant his stony breast to compassion, and a heart made of flint, vnto teares. These mirrours of patient and confident mindes, though off-castes of Fortune, hauing worne out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes wrapped in this intricate laberinth, wishing rather for death to determine their hard destinies, then for any longer time to liue to increase their infortunate miseries. <hi>Ianus</hi> double faced daughter now cloyed with their calamities, began to flatter them a little, turning her late frownes vnto smiles, her stormes vnto calmes, clearing her clowdy countenance with a fresh preparatiue of some better successe, &amp; couering the furrowes of her angrie forhead, with a smooth promise of some present relief. For thus it fel out: the noble <hi>Florentine,</hi> seeing no other refuge left, armed himself with the best weapons he had, and leauing his wife &amp; child at a point to famish for hunger in a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant groue in the wildernes of Apenninus neere the Thuscan sea, he posted vp &amp; downe the Forrest to seeke some vittailes, to relent and asswage the greedie desire of their perishing and hungrie iawes: and in the end wearyed with trauell, and missing of his purpose, calling to memorie the multitude of his misfortunes, he began with dolefull complaintes to breathe into the aire, the summe of all his miseries.</p>
               <p>Not farre hence, the great Citie Albigena stood in the verie nooke betweene the Thuscan sea and this Forrest, wherein the noble Duke <hi>Deuasco</hi> (who was Prince and Gouernor ouer this country of <hi>Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>) seated his Princely habitation, a man very vertuous and endued with great welth, being no lesse a <hi>Cressus</hi> then a <hi>Numa,</hi> who at this time together with certen of his nobles were a hunting in this forest, where the afflicted <hi>Perduratus</hi> lay thus wrapped in his immoderate passions: and this noble Duke being now in hot pursuit of his game, &amp; singled from all his traine, hearing a very pitifull noise, drew nere the place, where this perplexed <hi>Perduratus</hi> began to renew his former

<pb facs="tcp:21041:10"/>
was wholly to bestow his time in the seruice of this Semi-goddesse, to obtaine the which, (by reason of the enmitie betweene the King his Father and <hi>Deuasco</hi>) seemed vnto him a labour so endlesse, as with <hi>Dedalus</hi> to search out the bottome of the Laberinth, or to rowle the stone <hi>with Sisiphus</hi>: wherefore he was so quatted in his former determination, that <hi>Venus</hi> had lost one champion, had not the fierie God so boyled his sences in the furnace of fancie, that hee was perforce constrained to yeelde vnto affection. And breathing thus hee fedde him selfe with hope that opprtunitie woulde be a good plea in this suite, soothing his owne vaine and foolishe humour, with such friuolous circumstances, and fonde deuices of his newe troubled braine, that hee weighed the daunger (though neuer so desperate) but small: and the enterprise (though neuer so great) but meane, to haue once a sight of this rare Saint, counting it a life to dye in the demaunde of such a Iewell, and an honour to bestowe the flowre of his youth in the seruice of such a peerelesse Parragon: Wherefore, resting vpon this conclusiue Periode, first, he breathed foorth manie sealding sighes for sacrifice vnto <hi>Venus</hi>: and manie bitter teares for offeringes vnto <hi>Cupid,</hi> to bee Mediatours to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his newe entertained fancies, and therewithall taking his leaue of all the <hi>boun companions,</hi> and gentle swaynes, leauing them to their pastimes, hee bequeathed him selfe to his passions: for in his returne from the plaines to his Fathers Pallace (making no great haste to come where he might be knowen, before it should be late in the euening, least he should be descried in those homelie attires) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to tosse in his braine manie odde shiftes to effect his purpose, the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the end after that he had long deliberated vpon this matter, he purposed in disguised manner to giue his attendance vpon the Duke her Father, and so by that meanes to espie opportunitie to reueale his minde vnto her: which verie shortly he brought to passe, by the helpe of a <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> a verie neere kinsman to <hi>Perduratus,</hi> who willing to pleasure his young Lord and Master, (requesting his furtherance, and opening him selfe vnto him, as assured of secrecie at his handes, whose
<pb facs="tcp:21041:11"/>
faith had affoorded him a thousand pledges of faithfull and true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) did write his letters with <hi>Priscus</hi> to his cousin <hi>Perduratus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to place that noble Gentleman in the Dukes seruice, to whome and his friendes, he, in curtesie, helde him selfe much bound. <hi>Byndon,</hi> for so the <hi>Florentine</hi> was called, hauing finished his letters, deliuered them to his young Master, and wished him <hi>bone fortune</hi> in his affayres. Whereupon <hi>Priscus</hi> faining some other occasion of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to the King his father, departed him selfe with one alone Page cowardes Albigena, (for there the Court of <hi>Deuasco</hi> Prince of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria was) to put his purpose in practise, thinking euery minute a Moneth, and euery howre a yeere, till he came to his iourneyes end, verifying this onely Adage, <hi>Cupienti caeleritas mora est.</hi> In this sort his thoughtes building Castels in the ayre, at last, he arriued at Albigena, where deliuering his letters of commendations to the Prince his high Steward, he had verie good entertainment of him, &amp; made him the best welcome his late reuiued Fortune could affoord. And verie shortly placed him in the Dukes seruice: for <hi>Priscus</hi> was such a one, whose owne person might warrant him so much fauour, being a man as rare in his qualities, as excellent in his personage, whose countenance was adorned with the beautie of youth, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour furnished with the grauitie of age, so that verie thankefull was this proffer to the Duke, who alwayes had in estimation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde all such toward youthes. This being finished, <hi>Perduratus</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to shewe him selfe euery way bountifull to young <hi>Priscus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate some part of his kinsman his receiued good turnes, called vnto him his sonne <hi>Moderatus,</hi> (who was in good credite in the Court, and generally welbeloued, for his affabilitie and gentlenesse) commaunding him to be acquainted with <hi>Priscus,</hi> and withall not to omit any occasion that might procure his good, declaring the kindnes he had shewed vnto his Unckle <hi>Byndon,</hi> to induce him faithfully to doe the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moderatus,</hi> of duetie obedient to his Fathers commaund, and of Nature passing gentle, Nurture hauing also instructed him to be Patron vnto Strangers, especially to such as had in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree merited the same, endeuoured not onely to entertaine <hi>Priscus</hi> with common curteste, but also to vnite him selfe in friendship with
<pb facs="tcp:21041:11"/>
him (if the sequell of his life prooued so vertuous, as it seemed in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparance) and great reason he had so to do: for that they were both Straungers, much of the same age, the constitution of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were alike, and the disposition of their mindes without difference. So, as nothing is to be respected in amitie and friendship, more then equalitie: euen so could none more fitly be ioyned in amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe (by reason of the sympathie of their natures) then this couple, who so much resembled each other in proportion and condition, that scant could the one be knowen from the other. Thus both these faire buddes flourishing in the beautifull prime of their yeeres, hauing in some reasonable quantitie of time, sufficiently experienced each others vertuous disposition, grew so familiar in speech and conuersation, that the consent of the one was a constraint to the other: if <hi>Priscus</hi> smiled, <hi>Moderatus</hi> reioyced: if <hi>Moderatus</hi> lowred, <hi>Priscus</hi> laughed not: in so much that they were neuer found different in opinion or action: for one chamber was common vnto them both, one bed serued them both, they both euer vsed one boord, they had but one purse indifferent betweene them: and last of all, their seuerall and distinct bodyes had but one minde: either of them with their affable and curteous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, endeuouring to gaine the good will of the people: and both of them in a verie short space did in the highest degree of good liking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priscus</hi> all this while applying him selfe very diligently in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his mistresse, no where seeming pleasant, but in her presence, her lookes hauing fettered him in the prison o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

successe of this enterprise: neuerthelesse, he could not disswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the same: for as <hi>Ouid</hi> said,

               <p>Thus <hi>Priscus</hi> applying him selfe in his aptest habite to please his Mistresse, counting that no conquest which might be easilie wonne, and deeming the enterprise but base, which had not in it some daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, beholding with the fish <hi>Mugra</hi> the bare hooke, swallowed vp his owne bane, and with the Hartes of Calabria, fedde on <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> knowing it to bee deadly poyson: for albeit that hee did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ken the perill, yet hee was so blinded with affection, that hee coulde not auoyde the preiudice. Hee was sober and wise, yet all that was too slender a defence against the pearcing beames of beautie, which had so benummed his spirites, that hee seemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee a ghost, then a liuing creature: and no maruell, though his wisedome could not withstande such a sweete encounter: for euen as the fleetest fish swalloweth the delicatest bayte, and the highest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Hawke is soonest reclaimed to the lure: so the sharpest witte hath his wanton will, which verie often is inueagled with the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned sightes of alluring vanities. And albeit he endeuoured all that euer he coulde to couer his passions with a merie countenance (least anie of the Dukes Court espying his feruencie, might ayme at his affection, and so preuent his purpose,) yet hee could not hyde a padde in strawe, nor so closelie couer his flame, but that <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> well perceiued that there was some fire, where so great a smoke appeared: not a little marueiling, that his friend concealed his griefe from him, carrying a more ielous eye ouer him then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the ende to discouer the cause of his passions, that (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the duetie of a friende) hee might minister a medicine, to cure the Melancholie maladie of his friendes maie contented minde.</p>
               <p>In this sorte <hi>Priscus</hi> a verie long time houered betweene hope and despaire, fortune offering him no opportunitie (nor yet daring, though she had) to make his griefes knowen vnto <hi>Florida,</hi> the which albeit it pearced him to the quicke, and strayned euery string of his heart to the highest note of sorrowe, yet he dissembled the same, in hope that the storme could not last so long, but that in the ende it must

                  <hi>Priscus,</hi> coueting nothing so much as to be alone and in solitarie places, whereby to feede his melancholie humour with friuolous and vaine thoughtes, in a fayre graye morning walked foorth to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon garden, adioyning to the Pallace, in the vtter parte whereof, there was an entrance to goe vnto a priuie Orchard, wherein sprung a verie pleasant spring, the delectable murmure of whose Christaline streame, falling ouer the pebble stones, made such musicall harmony, that it might haue delighted a verie sorrowfull man, and the whole platt couered with the pleasant shades of mightie Cedars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pine-apple trees, greene Bay trees, sine Cherrie trees, the sweete Briar, and the stalkes of Roses growing plentifully in the ende of euery Alley, and on the side of euery banke, the ground checkered all ouer with choyce of finest flowers, as Uiolets, and Camamell: the one, the more it is chafed, the better sent it will yeelde: and the other, the more it is troden, the thicker and finer it will growe. There was also the Dasie, Primrose, Cowslippe, and the rest, euery flower hauing his secrete operation to procure delight: and euery tree and plant growing in such order, that there you might beholde the curious workemanship of Nature, most liuely pourtrayed and set foorth: for the flowers did yeelde a verie pleasant and sweete sent to comfort the braine, and the tender grasse a soft pillowe to ease the wearyed bodie, the mightie and braunch-spreading trees affoording shade to keepe off the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching beames of fierie <hi>Phoebus,</hi> the musicall byrdes (not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their partes to set out this earthlie Paradise) accorded their notes with such daintie harmonie and sweetnesse, that it might haue lulled a-sleepe the most wakefull and watching <hi>Argus</hi> in the worlde:

the fine order obserued, with so artificiall a proportion, in framing of this platt, so rauished the minde of sorrowfull <hi>Priscus,</hi> (hauing espyed the same as he ascended a steppe or two, to see by a horologe, that was set vp vpon a pillar in a corner of the Garden, what a clocke it was) with desire of solacing him selfe in this place, that he stood a long while deuising with him selfe, howe to compasse an entrance thereto, (wherein to powre foorth his passionate complaintes, supposing it to be the Bowre of pitie, the sweetnesse thereof inducing him to beleeue, that mercie lay lurking vnder euery flower) in the ende, seeing there was no other remedie left, he skipt from the pillar where the horro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge was, ouer a verie high wall of bricke, vnto this priuie orchard, hauing his Lute with him which he brought of purpose to solace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with: where being come, he curiously surueyed ouer that pleasant platt, not a litle wondering at the fine order of the trees, which grew, scituated diamond-wise, keeping so good a <hi>decorum</hi> in their growth, that one leafe was not seene to outgrow another: and being wearyed in tracing vp and downe amongest the pleasant groues, he rested him selfe in a fine Arbour, seated in a close thicket, neere that murmuring fountaine, where he beganne to powre foorth his complaintes in this manner.</p>

hauing discouered so great a priuitie: least, as <hi>Acteon</hi> (for such like offence) was of <hi>Diana</hi> turned into a Stagge, whose owne whelpes hunted him to the death: so he, for so great and vnaduised an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, should be transformed to some newe shape, his continuall passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being the deuouring houndes, which should persecute him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. So long remained <hi>Priscus</hi> in this traunce, that <hi>Florida</hi> had recouered her feete, and like <hi>Iuno</hi> with her pompous trayne, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing so maiestically towardes him, that she did put the poore Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a great admiration of her loftie and Princelie demeanour, and being come vnto him, she beganne thus to reprehend him for his boldnesse, in presuming to enter vnto that place, that was onely for her recreation.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Priscus</hi>? whether was it folly or presumption that mooued thee thus vnaduisedly to intrude thy selfe vnto this place, without my knowledge, forbidden to all but <hi>Florida,</hi> and licenced to none but <hi>Florida.</hi> Why hast thou bene so bolde, to offer thy selfe to so great a secrecie? doest thou not knowe howe <hi>Acteon</hi> was handled, for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the secretes of <hi>Diana</hi>? and why oughtest thou to hope for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fortune then he? thy discent is lesse, and thy offence as great, it may be, because I fauoured thee, for the shewe of vertue that was in thee, that wresting my meaning to another text, seruing thine owne purpose, thou hast thus presumed to trie my patience: well, now I see that the richest Sepulchre hath but rotten bones within, and a fine scabbard sometimes a rustie blade: and dissembling hypocrites, fayre and smoothe countenances, but rough and deceitfull heartes, much like the hearbe <hi>Phanaces,</hi> that hath a sweete budde and a bitter fruit, or the Bathes of <hi>Calicut,</hi> that be as cleere as <hi>Padus,</hi> and as pestlient as <hi>Orme</hi>: so thou, couering thy malitious minde with counterfetting modestie, and thy Wolfes paunch with a Lambes skinne, staying only for opportunitie to put in execution some mischieuous determination.

               <p>Why how nowe <hi>Priscus,</hi> hath the gloriousnesse of the place made such a metamorphosis of you, that it bereaued you of your sences, and driuen you vnto a frenzie? or some other vaine humour hammered in your head so high a determination? take heede, least with the people <hi>Hyperborei,</hi> you gaze so long vpon the sunne, till you become blinde, or soothing your selfe in the sweetenesse of your follie, you resemble the Leopards that feed on Margeram, knowing it to be their owne bane.

               <p>HErewithall <hi>Priscus</hi> ended his song, his musicke preuailing no more to moderate his melancholy, then oile to quench the flame: and therefore in a verie frantike moode, he threw away his lute, &amp; began a-fresh to tosse himselfe vpon his bed, resting as wearie in his bodie, as he was afflicted in his mind: and thus perplexed in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet passions, tormenting him selfe with his ceaselesse complaintes, his friend <hi>Moderatus,</hi> by chance ouer-hearing his secret passions, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed open the doore, and entred the chamber: whereat <hi>Priscus</hi> start vp, looking so pale, as if he had bene newe risen from his graue, his swelling heart, remooued from her naturall place, was now ascended to the straight passage betweene the bodie and the head, and there kept the same so close, that he (for want of breath) was vnable to vtter any one worde: whereupon <hi>Moderatus,</hi> his heart bleeding for very griefe of his friendes distresse, began thus mildely to reprehend him, both for that he had concealed his fancies from him, and also because he did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him selfe to be so ouer-mastred with follyes.</p>
               <p>My deare <hi>Priscus,</hi> if the faithfull league of true friendship, knit vp betweene vs, had not sufficiently authorised, nay rather commanded me (to preuent your further harme) to be thus bolde with you, I would scant haue presumed to interrupt your muses with my presence at this time: for hauing long sithence perceiued in you some alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and disquietnes of mind, wrought by the effect of some strange pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, I could not chuse but be verie sorie, in that I perceiued you to be vnwilling to disclose the same vnto me: who to discharge the office and dutie of a friend, was by the lawe of friendship bound, not onely to counsell you the best I could to comfort your misfortunes, but also to be copartner of your paine, to quallifie the rigor of your extreeme pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: wheresore I can not sufficiently admire, that you would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any vnto friendship, whome, either you deemed not worthie of your secrets, or els (for feare to be disclosed) durst not commit the trust thereof vnto: without that the occasion of your griefe depended vpon
<pb facs="tcp:21041:18"/>
an vnlawful acte. And therefore doubted, least that I would not yeeld my consent thereunto, because it should be rather my part to dehorte you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same, then any wise to further you therein. What <hi>Priscus,</hi> if as the Swallowes, nestling in houses, yet mistrust the inhabitants thereof, so you, conuersing my society, durst not acquaint me with your secrets: you should haue done, as they do in trying of vessels, whereinto they powre water, not wine: in like maner, you might haue tryed my fidelitie in some friuolous matter, that if I had chaunced not to bee close, there had bene no danger of spilling any good licour. But I tell you <hi>Priscus,</hi> friendship is like hony, that is sweet and pleasant in taste to the sound, but sharpe and purging in operation, to him that is infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a canker, and therefore finding in you this weaknes, that is more pertinent to feminine seruilitie, then to manly fortitude: I can not chuse but endeuor my selfe to comprehend the nature of the honie, whereby to purge you of the corrupt humors, that haue alredy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your nature: for now I find the old Adage true, that the Minow, that is euer nibling at the bait, is at last hanged on the hooke: and the flie so long dallyes with the flame, that shee is in the ende consumed therein: wherefore deare friend, leaue these fond cogitations, &amp; let not the flilie baits of alluring vanities so intangle you in the net of follie, that in the ende you may haue cause to say, that you haue bought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at an vnreasonable rate: at least-wise, if it be so strongly roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in you, that reason can not easily shake it away, conceale not the same from me, least in so doing, the cure would not prooue so effectual, wanting the true knowledge of the cause of the disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priscus,</hi> now seeing that it was no time to dissemble with his friend, knowing it impossible to couer the smoke, that was alreadie burst into a flame, vnlockt the closset of his thoughtes, and discouered him selfe vnto him in this manner. Sweete <hi>Moderatus,</hi> I wonder not a litle, that you would thus fraudulently (by ouer-hearing my complaintes) endeuour to compasse my secrets, whereas you might haue ben assured (though that the reuealing thereof had both impaired my substance, &amp; preiudiced my person) that you could no sooner haue requested the knowledge thereof, but that most willingly I would haue imparted the same vnto you. And in that I haue so long concealed it, it was to my most vehement and great griefe: for fire suppressed, burneth more vehement, &amp; water stopped, bursteth out with a greater force: so

                  </gap>at the fewe brandes, whereat I latelie warmed my fancie, is nowe growen to so great a fire, that it hath almost burned vp, and consumed vnto cynders my poore flectible heart. And assure your selfe <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> I was not so suspitious as to misdeeme of your fidelitie, whose faithfull dealing had assured me many wayes of your loyaltie: and therefore needed no further tryall, being perswaded that I had layde my foundation vpon a sure rocke. Yet neuerthelesse, as you haue very fitly compared friendship to honie, so I finde your friendly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be so bitter and biting, that the verie name thereof, hath almost ouercharged my queasie stomacke: for the counsell, howsoeuer whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, is neuer plausible, when it feedeth not the humour of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled. And for my maladie, I am vnlike to be purged thereof, without that the worker of my preiudice minister a remedie, no more then <hi>Telephus</hi> could be cured of the wounde, he receiued of fierce <hi>Achilles</hi> launce, before a plaister of the rust thereof was put thereunto, to salue the same: and to leaue off all ambiguities, I am so infected with the venime of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> that I am almost consumed in the suddes of mine owne pleasure. Wherefore, deare friend, seeke not (in hope of my recouerie) to minister any thing vnto me, which can worke no other effect, but onely the diminishing of that little ease and rest I haue: but rather suffer thy vnfortunate <hi>Priscus</hi> to dye: yea die <hi>Priscus,</hi> and why liuest thou to procure thine owne torment, an exile to thy countrey, a heart-sore to thy friendes, and a vassall to thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, resting thus metamorphosed in perpetuall daunger of thine owne person: nay, but where wander I, pardon me, good <hi>Moderatus,</hi> in that I haue thus fantastically breathed foorth my dreaming ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: for herein shall you rather finde a sencelesse truth, then a sensible tale: and albeit hope forbiddeth me to put any confidence in her, by reuealing my passions: neuerthelesse, both to disburthen somewhat my thrauled minde, and also to make amendes for the fault alreadie committed, in concealing the secretes of my breast thus long from you: attend the whole circumstance of this my Tragicall discourse, and with the conclusion thereof, a violent expulsion of my vital breath, from this carefull and distressed carkasse, if no hope be left of releeuing my wearyed agonyes.</p>
               <p>Had I prouidently pondered that worthie sentence of the famous
<pb facs="tcp:21041:19"/>
and renowmed Philosopher <hi>Thales Miletius,</hi> who, being by one of his friendes demaunded, how much difference there was betweene a Lye and Trueth answered, asmuch as there is betweene thine eare and thine eye: meaning thereby, that those things are not euer true, which by common report are spread abroad. For as <hi>Maro</hi> saith of Fame, <hi>Mobilitate viget, viresque acquirit eundo,</hi> so passing through the mouthes of many, euery one adding a little thereunto, it is in the end growen to an intollerable errour: howbeit the Philosopher admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth vs to beleeue those thinges for trueths, which we see with our eyes, and not to be credulous of those thinges which are blazed by common report. Had I aduisedly weighed this notable saying of <hi>Thales,</hi> the bare report (bare I may well call it, the croppe being not worth the seede) of <hi>Floridas</hi> beautie, had not mooued me, being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate of my state and person, thus fondly from a Prince of <hi>Aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> to become a vassall and a slaue to the Gouernour of <hi>Liguria,</hi> no better man then my selfe, and my Fathers mortall enemie: wherein, like an obstinate and vntoward youth, I layd reason in water to stiepe, being too salt for my taste, and followed vnbrideled affection, which was pleasant and toothsome in the mouth, though poysoned venome in the mawe. And my Parents, which affoorded me coyne and libertie in my youth, to worke mine owne preiudice, will be sorie to see mee want both wealth and wisedome in mine age. O fonde <hi>Priscus,</hi> why doest thou inueigh against thy selfe? it is an ill birde that defileth his owne nest and it were thy part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather to amend what is amisse, then to aggrauate thy offence by reuealing thy absurd fantasies, making thereby thy name more odious, but nothing helping to bring thee to a better forme of liuing. Oh, but vnto what an heresie am I fallen? wherein should I reforme my selfe? haue I not sustained all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, being thereunto enioyned by beautie, which is a thing deuine, and which the gods them selues obeyed. What, is not this the same, that <hi>Salomon</hi> with his wisedome could not resist: <hi>Hercules</hi> with his strength could not withstand: and <hi>Alexander,</hi> with other mightie Monarches of the worlde, with all their forces and power could not subdue? what then, should I thinke my selfe wiser then <hi>Salomon</hi>? stronger then <hi>Hercules</hi>? or mightier then <hi>Alexander</hi>? No, no, <hi>Priscus,</hi> beautie commaunded thee, and therefore thou must obey, and
<pb facs="tcp:21041:20"/>
wherefore <hi>Priscus,</hi> since thou must obey, summon thy sences to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and arme thy selfe with courage, to goe through with so notable a victorie, and be not dismayde, to haue one repulse at a womans hands: for womens three nayes be but one yea: resolue thy selfe once more to plead for thy selfe, &amp; to abide the censure of thy deerest mistresse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it include life or death. Now then, sweet <hi>Moderatus,</hi> that I may lay open vnto your vnderstanding this most strange and rare strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme, knowe that thine vnfortunate, but euer constant friend, is the same <hi>Priscus,</hi> sonne and heire apparant to the mightie <hi>Lothus</hi> King of <hi>Aemulia,</hi> who vndertooke this newe shape for the loue of fayre <hi>Florida,</hi> faire, but yet cruell <hi>Florida,</hi> whose sharpe cutting answers, euen this day, (had I not manfullie withstoode the violent attemptes of hote burning loue) had bene sufficient to giue me my deaths wound: for her bitter and contemptible reprehensions, ministred rather oyle then water to my flame, and feruent loue, rather then could disdaine vnto my fancie: loe, here beholde the figure and shape of him, that latelie thursting for honour, had more confidence in a speares poynt; then in a Schollers penne: the one, threatning bluntly his foe with reuenge: the other, flattering his friend with a fewe fine cowthed wordes, shrowding his malice vnder the habite of friendshippe: then a sturdie Morglay fitting his humour, rather then a sillie wall-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing paultrie pensile: and the managing of a good horse in the fields, more pleasing vnto him, then the courting of a fayre Ladie in a chamber. But nowe altogether vanquished and ouercome by Loue, a bond-slaue of blinde <hi>Cupid,</hi> and from a professed Souldiour of warlike <hi>Mars,</hi> become a vowed seruant of wanton <hi>Venus,</hi> a sweete Laberinth, wherein being entred, a man may sooner loose him selfe, then finde reason of him selfe: wherefore gentle and assured friend <hi>Moderatus,</hi> leaue off all perswasions, sith they be but corrisiues to eate vp olde soares, and no lenitiues to asswage newe swellings, and sharpe rasers to cut and launce olde festered vlcers, and ill-cured skarres, which procure treble paine, but seldome or neuer bring ease to the Patient.</p>
               <p>Here sighing sobbes stopping the passage of his speech, the fire of his true affection enflaming his heart, and his enflamed heart dissolued into vncessant teares, hee languished, burning in loue, and
<pb facs="tcp:21041:20"/>
bathed in griefe, reposing all his confidence in <hi>Moderatus</hi> his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and louing aduice, the gates of reason and vnderstanding quite denying any passage vnto such impossibilities, and therefore wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in continuall stormes of fresh imployed griefes, he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether dead in spirite, though little moouing of life appeared in his bodie, vntill true-hearted <hi>Moderatus</hi> awaked him out of his dumpe, in this manner.</p>
               <p>Oh my good, though infortunate friend, <hi>Priscus,</hi> howe falleth it out, that you haue this long time concealed this your secrete flame from your friend, and thus obscured the bright beames, not onely of your birth and honour, but also of your wisedome and vertue, which so shined in your life and conuersation, that it dazeled the eyes of the beholders, rauished the sences of the hearers, and stroke into admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all such as heard but the report thereof, nowe eclipsed with such a clowde of dishonour, as to descend from a mightie Prince, to the base office of a seruant, and which is more seruile, to imbase your selfe thus for the loue of a woman, and not onely to soothe your selfe in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but also to exclude the counsell &amp; comfort of a trustie friend, which would haue bene partaker of all your miseries. But as it seemed, you made still a doubt of mine vndoubted fidelitie, supposing that as the hearbe <hi>Ambubeia,</hi> doeth close at the going downe of the Sunne, and spread abroad at the rising thereof againe: so I should be a friend in Sunne-shine prosperitie, and not in the darke cloude of extremitie: but not so sweete friend, the operation consistes in the matter, not in forme: and surely, if I omitted any thing that belonged to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a friend, it was ignorantly done, and not willingly, or of set purpose: for I vtterly detest and abhorre those flattering and fained friendes, who, resembling the Amber stone, burne outwardly, and freeze inwardly: or the barke of the Myrtle tree in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which is as hote as fire in taste, and as colde as yce in operation. And rather, with the hearbe <hi>Amaranthus,</hi> which beginneth to flourish in the winter, when all other hearbes doe decay: so I in the winter of your extremities, purpose to shewe my selfe, not onely a friend, but a bright Sunne through the thickest and darkest cloud, being then assured that you doe loue me, if you repose any trust and confidence in mine actions: wherefore, sith the alarums of loue haue
<pb facs="tcp:21041:21"/>
made such a breach in your minde, your greatest pollicie were to study to be master againe of the forte, which you haue (with so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment) alreadie lost: and to compasse the same, you ought like a good and carefull Captaine, endeuour to remooue the siege, then might you boldly affirme with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that <hi>Sublata causa tollitur effectus,</hi> which although at the first it should seeme difficult and almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, yet hauing resolutely determined the same, you should finde therein great ease, and daily would your forces increase, and your enemies strength diminish: and albeit the taste thereof would like <hi>Aloyes</hi> seeme bitter in the mouth, yet the operation would no doubt prooue medicinable &amp; veri holesom in the maw. And if hauing swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the bayte, there be no other remedie, but to yeeld your selfe to the mercie of the fisher, rather then so, doe as the fish <hi>Alopex marina,</hi> who, perceiuing the hooke to be fastened in his bellie, biteth off the line aboue the tackling, and so escapeth. What, remember you not the preceptes of <hi>Phocas</hi> vnto Louers, who sayd, they should proceede in their amours, as the Crabbe in going, whose pace is euer backwards, that though loue haue force like the Adamant, to drawe the tender heartes of young Nouices, yet they should be sprinkled with Goates blood, that resisteth the operation, and if you haue not the vertue to be chaste, carrie about you the hearbe <hi>Lupinar,</hi> or the <hi>Topaze</hi> stone, which cooleth desire. Weigh aduisedly, what great calamities and ouerthrowes haue happened in former ages, not only to the person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, but also to whole Prouinces and Countreyes, by reason of the ouer-raging flames of Loue, then shal you see how <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> the one being the Metropolitane and most sumptuous Citie of all <hi>Asia,</hi> the other, the renowmed fountaine, and sacred wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of arte and learning throughout al Greece, which therefore was called the Muses habitation, were vtterly ouerthrowen and quite consumed, for the wanton and libidinous desire borne onely to one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Infinite more examples I could produce, but that I thinke this sufficient, to make a considerate wise man forsake the most beautifull and entising <hi>Lays,</hi> and the coyest and moste curious <hi>Florida</hi> that euer was. Nowe hauing touched some generalities bounding vpon reason, of great effect to dissuade you from this dangerous Laberinth, yet let vs goe neerer to the matter and speake particularlie: is it not
<pb facs="tcp:21041:21"/>
                  <hi>Florida</hi> that you ayme at? whose disdainefull and coye countenance, fenced with the hatefull trench of ambition and pride, doeth put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the brauest Lordes of all Italie, fearing to speake, where they haue so little hope to speede: and will you then, while you continue the habite of a hireling, and remaine as you seeme vnto her, an attendant of her Fathers, attempt to craue the same? which the flowre of all the gallaunts in the worlde durst not once make motion for: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me in so doing, you are voyd of all hope. If then you make your state knowen vnto her, howe can she finde in her heart to affect her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mortall enemie: and howe can you hope to remaine in safetie, your life lying in the mercie and power of your deadly foe. And as <hi>Moderatus</hi> would haue gone forwardes in his perswasions, <hi>Priscus,</hi> who could scarce suffer him to come to a Pertod, his ardent desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminishing by these disswasions of <hi>Moderatus,</hi> but rather like the small current stopped, encreasing more and more in such sort, that from a male contented man, he grewe almost lunatike, and then like a desperate forlorne burst foorth in these tearmes.</p>
               <p>Oh good <hi>Moderatus,</hi> if thou hast no other salue for my sore, nor canst affoorde me any other comfort, suffer me by death to ende this wretched life, or if thou dislikest therewith, cease to cloye me with such prescriptions, the verie name whereof torments me more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand deathes together.</p>
               <p>And whereas you alledge of the ouerthrow of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Troy,</hi> proceeding from the loue of a woman, true it is, but <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> iustly made their friendes their foes, by the rape of <hi>Helen,</hi> who was the wife of another man, seducing her to infringe her faith and honestie to her loyal husband, and therefore deseruedly plagued for the same: but I doe indeuour by my vertuous and chaste loue, borne to <hi>Florida,</hi> to make my mortall enemies my deerest friendes: and I goe about to seeke nothing, but that (of right) which should be mine owne. For if he, which should bye a thing deerest, should best deserue to haue it, I am sure, you would iudge me worthie of <hi>Florida,</hi> who, not onely am thus tormented in minde for her sake, but also am daily in continuall daunger of my person: wherefore, sweete friend, if thou louest my life, helpe me to the possession of that most rare Iewell, I meane <hi>Florida,</hi> whose presence is the preseruation of my life, and
<pb facs="tcp:21041:22"/>
without the which my carkasse is but a denne of dolours, and my life hatefull and loathsome vnto me.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Priscus</hi> concluded, (verie griefe stopping the passage of his voyce) so that teares standing in his eyes, his wordes chocking in his throate, he sent foorth great gustes of scalding and heauie sighes, and withall distilled from his eyes, (eyes the often messengers of his griefes) great floods of salt and brynish teares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moderatus</hi> seeing him so impatiently to beare his carelesse cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, was verie sorie, and comforted him all that euer he could, promising his endeuour to effect his desires, who accepted thereof with thankes, and hauing by this spent a good quantitie of time in debating of these matters, they left the chamber and went abroad, to see if good fortue would offer them any opportunitie to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise their determinate purpose.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21041:22"/>
without Reason: alwayes endeauouring to creepe into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the ripest and readyest mindes, taking the greater glorie and pride in his victories and conquestes, by so much as they are gotten ouer the mightyer Potentates and nobler Personages: thus minding that his Knightes shoulde not obtaine any pleasure without some smacke of paine, meaning thereby to trye their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, thinking him not worthie of a good Bootie, that woulde giue ouer the pursuite for one sharpe skirmidge. And albeit that <hi>Florida</hi> despised <hi>Priscus,</hi> languishing in loue, by reason of his meane estate and birth, as she tooke it, yet that mightie god (though blinde) <hi>Cupid,</hi> determining to reuenge the quarrell of his Champion, that had lost the victorie, ceased not daily to deuise meanes, to make her taste of that sharpe sweete, and pleasing euill, that so oft is wont, not onely to torment, but also to ouerwhelme and vanquish poore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Louers, with his inuestigable force of feruent and boyling heate.

for me, knowing me too weake for one of you, much more for three, that all in good time, he hath brought here my Ladie <hi>Florida,</hi> and mistresse <hi>Verosa,</hi> with whose ayde I doubt not, but to make my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie good against you all. <hi>Priscus,</hi> hearing the Ladie and Mistresse of his thoughtes named, stood as mute, as if with <hi>Perseus</hi> shield he had bene turned into a stone: and I doubt not, if <hi>Pandarina</hi> had then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the chase hard, and taken the benefite of her good Fortune, but she might easily haue ouercome <hi>Priscus</hi> at that instant. But she ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desirous to make <hi>Florida</hi> acquainted with the matter, tooke no heede to his countenauce, which was verie pase, feare hauing banished all the blood from his visage, which <hi>Moderatus</hi> well noted, and least his friend should be taken tardie, being driuen to a <hi>non plus,</hi> (if he had bene enioyned to answere any demaund) he interrupted <hi>Pandarina</hi> in her speeches, and craued leaue to make report of their controuersie, which being obtained, he stood so long in opening the matter, till <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> had taken breath, and somewhat recouered him selfe: for in this sort <hi>Moderatus</hi> addressed his speech to <hi>Florida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madame, you came in verie good season to succour a distressed Gentlewoman, who being so hardie and valiant, as it seemeth by this bolde enterprise, in attempting alone to encounter with three, who thinke them selues to be no cowardes at armes) it were great pitie she should miscarrie, being charged with an ouer-number. But for my Lord <hi>Cornelius</hi> and my selfe, Mistresse <hi>Pandarina</hi> alone shall be the Iudge, if we played not fayre, suffering her without interruption (except it were a little laughing, which we could not forbeare, to see their eagernesse in the cause) to combate it out with her first cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, but she might hardly haue trusted vs (to you I confesse) if <hi>Priscus</hi> had lost the victorie. And sith you are come in such good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, you haue ransomed a worthie warriour with your onely presence: for I thinke no man here so hardie, as to enterprise the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this quarrell, if you tooke the contrarie part.

of Nature, the efficient of so goodly a thing, welcomming in our thoughtes the flourishing Ladie of <hi>Spring,</hi> that lately was arrriued from the boisterous stormes of sturdie <hi>Hyems</hi>: delighted thus to see her spread abroad her ensigne, so trimly garnished with littely greene, we heartily wished to march vnder so worthie colours, which be the tokens and badges of hope, (hope the onely refuge of amorous concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gentlemen) as I say, we stoode thus in a Dilemma, as it were viewing these fayre flourishing flowers, which yeelded foorth not only a sweete and odoriferous sent, after a pleasant Aprill shower, but also a rare and glorious sight, when <hi>Phoebus,</hi> hauing past the Equinoctial, pearceth the breast of cholericke <hi>Aries</hi> with his shining beames, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to drie vp the siluer dewe from the gentle Gilliflower, and sweete Roses, that it so rauished our mindes with contemplation thereof, that, I thinke, had not mistresse <hi>Pandarina</hi> awaked vs of this sweete and delightfull vision, we had (at least-wise wished in desire to haue) vnited our earthly bodies, with our mindes, that be of lighter substance and celestiall, to the euer-beholding of that heauenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine spectacle, and there withall haue become humble peticioners to the Architector of that great engine, that we might become attenders on the daughter of <hi>Inachus,</hi> whome <hi>Iupiter,</hi> after that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an escape with, placed a starre in the heauens, to saue her from the wrath of <hi>Iuno.

               <p>My Lordes, it seemeth that you are either verie lazie, or loosely giuen, if you haue neither hawke on fist abroad to procure your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, nor Ladie in Court, vnder whose fauour to shrowd your selues, from these vncouth and melancholie passions: for me thinketh, it ill fitteth young Gentlemen to be thus like Anchorites, still in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, altogether exempt from Uenerie, and Chiualrie, which be the two principall recreations for heroicall mindes, both which, doe so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the idle liuers, that as the Bees hunt the Drones from their hiue, as vnfit members of their common wealth: so <hi>Mars,</hi> neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth for his souldier, nor <hi>Venus</hi> for her seruant, any one that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not howe to finde him selfe occupyed, either with warlike exercise,

               <p>My Lord <hi>Cornelius</hi> awaked with this hot skirmidge, out of his pleasant meditation, answered her thus: Gentle <hi>Pandarina,</hi> I pray you, when you play with your little dogs, for then you are not idle, to whom do you bequeath your seruice, to <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi>? whereat we all fell to such a laughter, that we made mistres <hi>Pandarina</hi> verie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie: and because my Lord proceeded no further in this argument, which I thinke, was with that one word fully finished, M. <hi>Priscus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good tennise-player, tooke it at a rebound, &amp; then went forward with it, thus: I maruel very much, mistres <hi>Pandarina,</hi> that one of so good a iudgement as you be, should be so farre ouershot in a matter so pertinent to your sex, as the seruice of so honorable a Ladie as <hi>Venus</hi> is, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that because we were idle, therfore we were not in loue, when as onely in being idle, we bequeath our selues wholly thereunto, being then in contemplation of the hie mysteries of so great a Deitie, imprinting in our thoughtes the <hi>Idea</hi> of our mistresse liuely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and reuoluing in our minds the happie successe of our desired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, where as otherwise, being as you would haue vs occupied, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in parling with our best beloued, yet do not we loue so feruently: for that then our eyes is occupied with that office, which being absent and solitarie, our minds &amp; hearts do execute: therefore the fruitful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of loue, being either in the eyes or heart, I referre to your own iudgement, in which of these two parts of the bodie true loue doeth consist. If in the eies or tongue, as it seemeth you would haue it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I am in an error: but if otherwise, true loue lieth in the heart, as it doeth indeed, then in being solitarie, the mind is most occupied, and so the person exempt from labors, or idle, (as you terme it) is alwayes most in loue.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moderatus</hi> hauing thus finished his speaches, I referre to your iudgements, amorous gentlemen, who haue wel experienced the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of languishing louers, whether <hi>Florida</hi> was not in an extasie for ioy to heare him, that she loued as her owne soule, thus clarkly discy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering of the qualities and nature of Loue.: hoping that he could not be so perfect in the arte, but that experience had taught him his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and that <hi>probatum est</hi> had bene his guide, directing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe by so good a leuel, being assured also, that if euer he had tasted of the rinde of the tree, he would reach at the fruite. And therefore hoped that she should not need to be the plaintife in this sute, wherein being a defendant, she meant to suffer a recouerie before he could haue time to be non sute in his action. And you must imagine gentlemen, that <hi>Priscus</hi> was not idle all this while: for albeit his tongue walked not, yet his minde neuer eeased from thinking, his heart from panting, his eyes onely executing the office of the tongue, so that I thinke no part of <hi>Floridas</hi> bodie was vnuiewed and looked ouer a million of times, presenting euery looke with a sigh, and euerie sigh ministring a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand doubtfull Dilemmas, what the sequell of his attempted enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise would prooue, so that thus bathing him selfe in a sea of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thoughtes, betweene hope and despaire he rested speechlesse for the time to attende the conclusion of their begunne talke. <hi>Cornelius,

Pandarina</hi> and <hi>Verosa</hi> were not at this time altogether a sleepe: for <hi>Cornelius</hi> had an eye to the gallant beautie of young <hi>Verosa,</hi> who in respect thereof, was matchlesse, and almost of an incomparable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, her vertuous and modest conuersations being ornaments to decke the rest with a most gracious fauour, that this young.

And after that <hi>Moderatus</hi> had concluded his begunne speeches, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> sweetely smiling, descanted somewhat vpon the matter, allowing the venterous courage of <hi>Pandarina,</hi> not disallowing the subtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings of <hi>Priscus,</hi> referring the equitie of the cause to them that had better skil in the arte, then her selfe. And hauing thus spent some part of time in reasoning <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> at last they agreed betweene them selues, to passe the rest of the time in some merie exercise, to recreate their mindes withall. <hi>Cornelius</hi> brake silence thus: because we be three men, and you so many women, we will, either of vs by lot, see which of you will happen to be each of our Ladies, and as it then falleth, so shall it continue for this yeere: that is, the woman shall call the man seruant, and the man shall call the woman Ladie and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse. And when they had all consented to this, the three Gentlemen separated them selues from the rest of the companie, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> chose to him selfe for a fained name, (to take his chaunce in this lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie) <hi>Troylus</hi>: and <hi>Priscus</hi> named him selfe <hi>Hector,</hi> and <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> tooke to name <hi>Vlysses</hi>: and so returning againe to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, they discouered their borrowed names: and then <hi>Verosa,</hi> because she was youngest, was appointed to haue the first choyce, who hauing heard their names, she said thus vnto them. My Lord <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and the rest of the gentlemen, you haue chosen names worthie your selues:
<pb facs="tcp:21041:27"/>
the first, being the flower of all Knighthood in the world: the second, a perfect myrrour of a true and faithfull Louer: and the third, the true lantherne of all Ciuill pollicie: and for wisedome, <hi>Mercuries</hi> own sweet sucking Babe. Wherfore, my selfe being yong, the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est best agreeth with my yeeres: and so I chuse for my seruant, (sith it is your owne pleasures so to tearme your selues) <hi>Troylus. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> who had taken that name, sayd then, Ladie and Mistresse, you must kisse me for earnest, or else the bargaine is not bound: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after a little modest bashfulnesse, that part was finished. And then <hi>Florida,</hi> who was assented to haue the second place, beganne thus: <hi>Vlysses</hi> by his wit and pollicie, did more benefit the <hi>Grecians</hi> in their tenne yeeres siege to the Citie of <hi>Troy,</hi> then <hi>Achilles</hi> with all his manhoode, and helpe of his <hi>Myrmidones,</hi> and I had rather that my seruant should keepe him selfe out of the daunger, as <hi>Vlysses</hi>: and though vsing his tongue oftner then his Target. yet doing more good therewith, then others the stoutest warriours did with their shields and launces. And were I assured of my chance in this my choyce, I would say with the daughter of <hi>Icarus, Penelope coniux semper Vlyssis ero</hi>: and therfore let my Seruant be <hi>Vlysses.</hi> And when herewith she had concluded, <hi>Moderatus</hi> with good grace said thus: Madame, your happe was the worse to make so bad a choyce, but sith it was your lot, if it be your pleasure to assent thereunto, let me kisse your royall hand in token of your entertainment: to which demande she willingly assented, being glad of her chance, and well pleased with her choyce, though modestie forbade her publikly to discouer the same. Then quoth <hi>Pandarina,</hi> (allotted last to make choyce, because she was eldest) you haue so pollitikely vsed the matter, that I could not take my fortune, in choosing my selfe which should be my seruant, but I am contented, sith it was my chaunce to light vpon one, without any industrie of mine owne, to giue him the best entertainment I can. And I am glad I haue met with one so valiant as <hi>Hector</hi>: for when all shifts faile, he wil not stick to combat for his Mistresse: and I wil assure you, my Ladie <hi>Florida,</hi> if you had heard his pollitike and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till reasonings ere-whiles, you would haue iudged him to be a second <hi>Vlysses</hi>: but howsoeuer pollitike or valiant, or though neither, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose none to be displeased with his chaunce, without that <hi>Priscus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained discontented for that he had not obtained <hi>Florida</hi> for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Mistresse, in whose handes lay the sentence of his life or death, but neuerthelesse he was well satisfied, his friend hauing that roome which he desired him selfe, hoping nowe that <hi>Moderatus</hi> vpon this newe accident, should haue a more conuenient opportunitie, to open the matter at large vnto <hi>Florida</hi> in his behalfe, and by that meanes he might the rather obtaine some comfort in his proceedings.

And albeit that it is a greater discommendation then praise, to bee commended of an ill Oratour, yet pardon me, for that I do my good will, and trueth neuer deserueth blame: and therewithall not staying for any replie, he began with a slow and soft voyce, to measure ouer this Cansong.</p>

Wherefore, Gentlemen and friendes, all we haue yeelded our censures thereof, and the wisest Philosopher could doe no more, without a Metaphisicall meane to vnderstand more then Nature euer taught, or the Goddes them selues had the gift to doe: thus to be briefe, in my opinion you haue done all well, hauing diuersely yeelded your iudgements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the thing it selfe being of nature so diuerse. And therefore I thinke it conuenient, that (seeing we haue for the most part spent this day in pleasant recreations) that we should end the same with some exercise, that would bring us to some naturall heate after this colde confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tosome appetites to our supper again, after our surfet in amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous discourses. And therewithall, the company with silence seeming to agree, <hi>Florida</hi> called for musicke, which being readie, she willed her brother <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Mistresse to lead the rest: for as they had their turne first in other exercise, so likewise to beginne with this, and she and her seruant would censure of their good skill in Carpet trade, and afterwardes yeelde their cunning therein, to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So presently they fell all a-dauncing, sauing <hi>Florida,</hi> and <hi>Moderatus,</hi> who withdrewe them selues to a Bay windowe, where
<pb facs="tcp:21041:35"/>
                  <hi>Moderatus</hi> thought it not best to slippe so good an opportunitie, once to breake a staffe in his friends behalfe, and so after a long preamble, (she attentiuely giuing eare thereunto, supposing it had bene for him selfe) imparted vnto her, vpon a firme and sure promise of secrecie, the whole circumstance of his friendes cause, his birth, Countrey, and friendes, his trauaile past, and the continuance of his present care, the worthinesse of the man, and the feruencie of his loue: omitting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which he thought might induce her to affect and fancie him. But hereupon <hi>Florida</hi> perceiuing his drift, could scant suffer him so long a Period: for that very angerly and with bending browes, she commanded him to proceede no further in that sute: and, quoth she, if my friendly countenance hath made you so pieuish, as to abuse my curcesie so much, I will (albeit much vnwilling) plucke away from you the fauor of a friendly affection, which peraduenture might haue kindled in me some fancie towards you, if you had taken in hand that office for your selfe, which so earnestly you prosecute for another. Whereupon <hi>Moderatus</hi> excusing him selfe with his owne vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, neuerthelesse commending the desert of his friend, and vrging for him all that he could, was by <hi>Florida</hi> absolutely commanded to silence, and no more to speake for <hi>Priscus,</hi> nor to presume to enter her presence, if he seemed to disdaine of her friendly curtesie so frankely offered him. And therewithall not staying for a further replie, flung away in great choller, without any manner of salutation to the rest of the company: whereupon they all dissolued, not a little admiring the cause of <hi>Floridas</hi> so sudden departure. <hi>Moderatus,</hi> to auoide suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affirmed that <hi>Florida</hi> was not well at ease, all seemed to holde them selues satisfied with this excuse, poore <hi>Priscus</hi> onely excepted, whose heart was wel-nie sundred for verie griefe, misdeeming the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true occasion of that accident, yet dissembling his paine as much as he could, with a merrie countenance in outward semblance past ouer the matter for that time, till he might finde opportunitie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with his friend therein.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, here may you plainly behold a very actuall Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of a confused Metamorphosis, wherein <hi>Cupid</hi> sheweth the force of his power: for first, he so inflamed <hi>Priscus</hi> with the loue of <hi>Florida,</hi> (their Parents being mortall foes,) that he came from his Fathers

The young Gentleman, who had neuer bene a long wayter in Lady <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Court, measuring the affection of <hi>Florida</hi> after his owne fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent fancie, thought euery smyle a fauour, and euery looke the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender of true loue: much like the Swallowes, that thinke euery Sunne-shine to be a fayre Summers day, such is the desired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of this blinde god, that he maketh the beloued little to esteeme the faithfull and vnfayned zeale of the passionate, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting louer, that daily offered his humble seruice for the pleasing of his Ladie, which taketh no effect, but rather breedeth contempt and disdayne in her skornefull and proude minde, a too too vnkinde rewarde to so louing a friend. In like manner this <hi>Cyprian</hi> boy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in nothing but extremities, contrariwise so inflamed the minde of the young Ladie with the loue of <hi>Moderatus,</hi> that not onely her affection to him was match-able to <hi>Priscus</hi> fancie towards her, but also did exceede her patient in loue towardes him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet mooued with the violent passions of seruent desire, did little regarde the same, though contrarie to <hi>Decorum</hi> in feminine sexe, she by her owne mouth had giuen him to vnderstand thereof.

and vertuous resolution, so long coulde you not haue with-helde your eye of pitty from him, that so often, yea, euen within your viewe languished with such pure tormenting payne and griefe, that his onely hope of release was, to haue his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall dayes ended by the pearcing and deadly darte of death. Happily you will say, that I pronounce a sharpe sentence against mine owne selfe, and iudge me as arrogant in denying your most curteous offer, as you were vnkynd in not graunting my request. True it is, if eyther the force of lawlesse loue, or the ouer-liberal curtesie (farre aboue my desart) of a royall and beautifull Lady, had bene (of a vertuous and honest mynde) more to be respected and regarded, then the sacred league and inuiolable bond of true and faythfull friendshippe, which vnited Priscus minde and mine together, much more had I ouer-shot my selfe to deny your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and to refuse the thing I most of all desired: but seeing the Imperiall lawes of sacred societie did will and commaund the contrary, I thinke therein that I haue done but my duety: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowe fayre Florida, that sith your doome was so dyre, as absolutely to forbid me your presence, without I vndertooke so much for my selfe, as I did then prosecute for my friend, rather then I would falsifie my fayth, I meane (though to my no small griefe) to fulfill the tenor of your sentence, by absenting my selfe not only from your presence, but also from your fathers Court, &amp; faithfully bequeath my selfe to a pilgrimes life, to assay if by my penance I may release my friend from his martyrdom. Wherfore receiue this my last adewe, and credite me, the refusing of your gentle offer proceeded of a firme zeale towards my friend, &amp; not of a coy disdaine towardes you: assuring you, but to preiudice Priscus, I am euery way at your commaund: &amp; so intending not to returne againe, till either Florida hateth Moderatus, or loueth priscus. I beseech you, if euer you affected me, you attribute the same vnto him as his due, who as Cicero said, est quasi alter idem, and therfore may iustly challenge all that were due vnto me. I am so quaint in my pilgrims habite, that I forget the reuerence due to so royal a lady. Wherfore I pray for pardon, &amp; wish you (if the prayer of a pilgrime may take effect) to commend me to Priscus.
<pb facs="tcp:21041:39"/>
And thus, with tears in mine eyes, &amp; grief in my heart, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend you to your pleasure, and bequeath my selfe to my trauell.</p>

                  <hi>MOderatus</hi> hauing finished this letter, repaired to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Baleto,</hi> to see howe things were in a readinesse, (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it long till he were departed from <hi>Albigena</hi>) and to deale with him for the conueying of the letter to <hi>Florida,</hi> where by chaunce he found <hi>Priscus</hi> page, who had bene foorth so late the night before, that for feare to disquiet his Master, he had taken vp his lodging there, (as often he vsed to doe) whereupon <hi>Moderatus</hi> did consider with him selfe, that he would be a verie fitte messenger for that purpose, and therefore he tooke him the letter closely sealed, and wished him with conuenient speede to deliuer the same vnto his sister <hi>Verosa,</hi> wishing her in his name to deliuer it ouer to <hi>Florida,</hi> according to the direction thereof: Further desiring the page not to make it knowen to any that he had seene him, and the rather to haue him to accomplish his request, he clapt him in the fist with a brace of angels, and tolde him that he was to goe vpon some serious businesse, which he would not haue any to vnderstand thereof. And thus hauing schooled the Page what he had to doe, he bade him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily farewell, and returned to his owne chamber againe, where hee found <hi>Baleto</hi> readie with all thinges that he lacked for his iourney, wherewith he presently furnished himselfe, and hauing left order with him to excuse his absence to his Parents, and for the doing of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
<pb facs="tcp:21041:39"/>
which he left vnperfect, he rewarded him well for his labour, and so departed with <hi>Auroraes</hi> first blush, that he might not be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed of any, passing through gardens and vineyardes (a way verie secret) till he came to the forrest, where we will leaue him as yet not fully determined, which way from thence to bende the course of his trauell. And nowe returne to <hi>Priscus,</hi> who all the night before had taken very little rest: for that no disquietnesse may be compared to the griefe of minde, wherewith he was continually vexed, and nowe much more then euer before, supposing that <hi>Floridas</hi> sudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was a Kalender of his ensuing calamities: for hauing his barge tossed amids the weltring waues of Fortunes euer-changing surges, <hi>Floridas</hi> lookes onely guided the sterne, so that for euery wrinckle in her browe, and frowne in her face, he was in daunger of present ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke. The absence of his friend <hi>Moderatus</hi> also greatly troubled him, both for that he longed to vnderstand his successe with <hi>Florida,</hi> and also much maruelled, why he came not to bed vnto him the night before, as his manner was: and as thus he studyed vpon these and such other contingents, his Page came in: whereupon he addressed him selfe to be stirring, and the Page busie helping to make ready his Master, the letter sent by him to be deliuered to <hi>Florida,</hi> fel from his bosome, the which <hi>Priscus</hi> presently espying, demaunded what it was: the Page lothe (by reason of the charge giuen him by <hi>Moderatus</hi>) to confesse the trueth, fayned some excuse, (what vpon a sudden came to his head) but neuerthelesse <hi>Priscus,</hi> by the indorsement thereof, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it to be his friend <hi>Moderatus</hi> hand-writing, and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was to <hi>Florida,</hi> which sight made him very blancke, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remembring him selfe, he straightly examined his Page howe he came by the same letter, and what he had in charge to doe therewith, who seeing his Master in some choller, thought it nowe no time to dallie with him, and thereupon presently confessed the trueth. <hi>Priscus</hi> nowe maruelling what was become of his friend, being great with childe till he might viewe the contentes of his letter, in the ende after long studie, he bethought him of the print of <hi>Moderatus</hi> signet, which he had in yuorie, and therefore might well open the same without knowledge, whereupon presently vnripping the seale, he perused his friendes lines to <hi>Florida,</hi> wherein perceiuing the fidelitie of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi>

to fonde affection, as to loue thy Fathers mortall foe? hast thou none to fancie, but the sonne of <hi>Lothus</hi> King of <hi>Aemulia,</hi> that so often hath vexed thy father and his subiectes? and haply vnder colour of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing loue vnto thee, pretendeth some treason vnto thy father, seeking rather to drawe some of his subiectes from their allegiance, then to match with his daughter in marriage. Ah, but where rouest thou fond <hi>Florida,</hi> thou doest measure his inwarde intencion by thy suspicious cogitation, and is it not a Maxime in the Ciuill lawe, that suspition is no proofe, where it is said, <hi>Factum consistit in externo &amp; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali actu, animus in tacito &amp; incorporali intellectu, vnde in animi effectus non potest cadere facti euidentia</hi>: &amp; thou deemest <hi>Priscus</hi> to circumuent treason, who not onely assureth trueth in his wordes, but also manifesteth the same in action: for if he had thought to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise thy father with treacherie, he would not haue suffered him selfe to bee discouered vnto thee. And what though his father and mine were and are still foes, might we not neuerthelesse be friendes? yea, and our friendshippe be an occasion of amitie betweene our Parents? seeing their hate is not deadly, but growen of vnkindnesse, and some ostentation and desire of superioritie. And by this match both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces might be vnited together, that it might not onely preserue the liues of a number of their subiectes, but also arme them selues with such strength, that no stormie blast of sinister Fortune might shake the foundation of any of them both. Loue then <hi>Florida,</hi> for the worthines of the man willeth thee so to doe: his birth and Parentage are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pledges of honourable patrimonie, and his personage and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour are liuelie portratures and perfect Mappes of true Nobilitie: his merite is farre aboue thy desart, and his faithful heart (tryed with the touchstone of trueth) excellethall: so that I thinke nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him, that might be wished for in an honourable Gentleman, or a loyall louer. Heere fetching a deepe sigh, <hi>Florida</hi> made a verie long Period: <hi>Cupid</hi> nowe hauing founde her as a wanton playing the trewand, had whipped her with nettles to requite all her former coynesse, and therefore she began to forget her deerest <hi>Moderatus,</hi> and to imprint in her thoughtes the liuely <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Priscus</hi> perfect shape, verifying the olde Addage,
<q>

                  <pb facs="tcp:21041:41"/>
Thus making a vertue of necessitie, hauing none other at this time worthie entertaining, she resolued to frame her countenance so mildly towardes <hi>Priscus,</hi> that (if heretofore shee had giuen him a cooling carde for his hote desire, which might driue him to despaire) now hope might giue him comfort, that opportunitie would be a good plea to further his action: deuising with her selfe by what meanes she might best giue <hi>Priscus</hi> to vnderstand of her newe conceiued affection, who being in this solemne meditation, came in some of her gentlewomen, with whome she passed the time away, remaining in a kinde of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desire, till good fortune should bring them once together: <hi>Priscus</hi> all this while kept his bed, his ague being so extreeme, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof was publikely knowen, and the absence of <hi>Moderatus</hi> vnderstoode, which caused great heauinesse throughout al the Dukes Court in general: for that he was verie curteous and bountifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, and therefore greatly beloued of all: his Parents and friendes greatly grieued therewith, especially because they knewe not the cause of his departure, nor where to send in quest of him. The Duke and the Duchesse tooke it also very heauily, for that they entirely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Moderatus</hi> for his Gentlemanly qualities, vertuous conditions, sober life, and diligent seruice. Thus a good space was his departure greatly bewayled throughout the whole Citie of <hi>Albigena,</hi> all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting <hi>Priscus,</hi> supposing the losse of his friend to be the cause of his disease, the which <hi>Moderatus</hi> Parents noted in him presently: for being verie often with him, sometimes hee would raue, and be as it were franticke, and then he neuer ceased to call vpon his friend <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratus,</hi> the which being vnderstood, they tooke verie great care of him, and gaue in charge to <hi>Verosa</hi> tenderly to looke vnto him, and to cherish him in his sickenesse, which the Phisicians helde daungerous, though not mortall. <hi>Verosa</hi> for her brothers sake, that was his friend, (his owne curteous and gentle behauiour deseruing no lesse) willingly assented so to doe, in perfourmance of her Parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, and of good will vnto him: and amongest other times, <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Pandarina</hi> once did beare her companie: for that both of them indeed could haue bene contented to haue comforted him in the best sort they could, although in outward shewe they dissembled: who being come to the Patients chamber, they found him very sicke, yet
<pb facs="tcp:21041:42"/>
at the latter ende of his fitte, which made them offer them selues a while to keepe him chat, to beguile the tediousnesse of the time. <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> faynt as he was, very heartily gaue them thankes, who espying <hi>Florida,</hi> (being very neere his bed, and taking him by the wrist to feele his pulse, and asking him whether the day of his <hi>Crisis</hi> was past) was almost in a sounde to beholde her, that had thus wrought all his preiudice: the which <hi>Florida</hi> perceiuing, gaue him verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable wordes, and cherished him verie tenderly, and bade him take heart, for that a valiant minde is neuer knowen but in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the pure golde in the furnace. <hi>Priscus</hi> well noted her wordes, which somewhat did lighten his heart, albeit hee much maruelled, from whence this sudden kindnesse had proceeded, after so cruell a sentence pronounced against him, holding it for authenticall, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fire and water coulde not agree in one substance, nor yet loue and hate so to concurre in one person, that so suddenly the one should expulse the ether: experience hauing taught him, that the lowest shrubbe groweth not to his full height in a moment, that flaxe will not burne at the sight of the fire, and that <hi>Floridas</hi> deadly hatred could not so soone be conuerted to loue and affection: yet he called to minde howe the tallest blade of <hi>Spattania</hi> groweth to his full height in an instant, that the hard stone <hi>Calcire,</hi> which can be bruised with no mettall, is resolued into liquor with the heate of the Sunne, and that a womans heart is like waxe, which is apt for euery impression, and therefore (forgetting that <hi>Ouid</hi> said, <hi>Spes dea sed fallax</hi>) hee nowe builded a-fresh vpon hope, and iudged all to the best. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Florida</hi> perceiuing his colour something to mend, his pulses moderately to mooue, and he somewhat to rouse him selfe in bed, told him how his Mistresse <hi>Pandarina</hi> came to visite him, who presently tooke <hi>Floridas</hi> tale by the end, excusing her selfe, in that she had not oftener comforted him in his sicknes, alleadging till then, that she was ignorant thereof: interchanged curtesie to and fro past between them. <hi>Priscus</hi> nowe prettily well recouered, and very iocund, as it were, with the gentlewomen, <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Dukes sonne, with other Courtiers his companions and friends, came to visite <hi>Priscus,</hi> who said that he was glad to see him so well: then quoth <hi>Priscus,</hi> I pray you thanke the Gentlewomen, whose presence hath made me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb facs="tcp:21041:42"/>
my passionate ague: well, quoth <hi>Cornelius,</hi> sith (Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) you haue begun to be pleasing to <hi>Priscus,</hi> I would you would so continue, and we would giue you our assistance therein, and I doe thinke some discourse to beguile the time would doe well, to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his minde a little, which is greatly wearyed with the violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his long sickenesse. Then quoth <hi>Pandarina,</hi> seeing you do appoint the pastime, you will giue vs leaue to make choyce of the matter: if you be opponent, (quoth <hi>Cornelius</hi>) on Gods name pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your question, and you shall see, though we be old trewandes, that we haue not forgotten all our sophistrie. No, quoth <hi>Florida,</hi> we must not hold the diseased patient with such long ambages, which wil cleane tyre him, and so augment his griefe, but rather with some short discourse to make him sharpe and hungry, and not to cloy him with too much, to procure surfet. Hereunto they all agreed, and that <hi>Florida</hi> should appoint the text, and then all they to draw cutts, who should discourse thereupon. Then (quoth <hi>Florida</hi>) let the proposition be: <hi>Whether outward Beautie, or inward Bountie deserueth most praise, or is of greatest force to procure loue.</hi> The theame being giuen, it fell to <hi>Cornelius</hi> lot to be the Orator, who was of a verie sharpe and quicke wit, and withall, verie desirous to shew his cunning before <hi>Verosa,</hi> whom he had so viewed with the eye of fancie, that the respect of his honour could not hinder him from entring a plea in <hi>Venus</hi> court: &amp; framing him selfe to the performance of his charge, lending an amorous glaunce to <hi>Verosa,</hi> which she presently noting, died her cheeks with such vermilion taint, that <hi>Aurora</hi> blushing at the sight of vnacquainted <hi>Phaeton,</hi> seemed not so glorious of hue: and so proceeded to his matter thus. Well, gentle friendes, you may see how vniust the fates be in their fauors, &amp; the destinies in their dooms, alwaies laying the greatest burthen on him that is least able, working all things by extremities, keeping a mean in nothing but being out of measure, alwaies spurring that horse which had most need of a bridle: nor contented with any thing but impossibilities, taking delite to haue vs seeke to reach aboue <hi>Ela,</hi> when skant we can attaine vnto <hi>Solfa</hi>: for if they had not bene iniurious in their constellations, they had not amongst so many (far better skilled then my selfe) haue allotted me (which for the most part am ignorant in <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

distinction in loue betweene Beautie and Bountie, a matter too high for my meane capacitie: but neuerthelesse, seeing Fortune hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it to bee so, and that you doe expect the same, I will neither contrarie her in her absolute commaundes, nor deceiue you in your wished expectation, condicionally you take in good part, what vpon the sudden my simple skill may affoorde: thus not doubting but the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen will either quite fall a-sleepe, or else play with their little dogges, when first they shall heare my rude methode, I will to the matter, least I should shape <hi>Hercules</hi> shooe for a childes foote, and so be iustly rather condemned for my follie, then indifferently thought of for my curiositie.</p>
               <p>First therefore, because the principall matter in this case to bee considered, is loue: we must knowe both the nature and seate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, before we can proporcion our compasse to leuell at our desire: the which, as some Philosophers haue decyphered, is but a secret inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the soule, inducing a man to affect and fancie such things, as nature hath metaphysically ingraffed in the minde to delight thereof: for otherwise we should not see some one to fancie the beautie of the bodie, another the vertue of the minde, another to fancie for riches sake, though neuer beautifull nor wise: thus as loue proceedeth by these, and by manifolde and sundrie other wayes and meanes, so I thinke euery one to affect most of all those qualities in another, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are them selues furnished: for as the Rauen and the Ape thinke their yong ones fayrest, so euery one naturally valueth his owne giftes and qualities most singular and of greatest estimation, so much they are blinded with the loue thereof. Semblably in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, true and perfect loue can not bee but betweene equales, at least wise in disposition and consent of minde, according as the Prouerbe is, <hi>Similis gaudet simili,</hi> so that the nature of the person entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the consent to fancie, and the ratifying of affection. Moreouer, loue might bee well compared to the shadowe vpon a Horologe, or to the grasse vpon the earth: for the one, you may perceiue it to haue mooued, and the other to haue growen, but you can not see and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the one moouing, nor the other growing: so of loue, well may you feele the smart beeing once snared therewith, and so secretly doth he take possession in the minde, that better you may perceiue him to
<pb facs="tcp:21041:43"/>
haue entred, then take him with the manner: for first it swimmeth in the eye, and then secretly stealeth into the heart, being of nature so subtill, that perfectly to decypher the nature thereof, is a thing meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisicall and aboue nature. The reasons therefore that should induce vs to loue, should be things like it selfe, that is, rare, singular, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and as it is a thing heauenly and diuine: so in humane creatures, we should fancie and affect those giftes which are seated in the minde, which is immortall and heauenly, &amp; not in the body, which is brittle and transitorie: <hi>Beautie</hi> is a gift much to be commended, but <hi>Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> is a vertue more to be respected: <hi>Beautie</hi> pleaseth the eye for a moment, which like the dayes in Aprill begin with a Sunne-shine, and end with a showre: but <hi>Bountie</hi> is an ornament of the minde, which, like the Camomell, the more it is trodden the thicker and better it groweth: or to the pomander, that yeeldeth the sweetest sent, when it is most of all chafed. Yet neuerthelesse, was it not the Beautie of <hi>Helen</hi> that mooued <hi>Paris</hi> so to fancie her, that he coulde not liue without her? was it not likewise the comelinesse of <hi>Aeneas</hi> personage, that caused <hi>Dido</hi> to loue him so much, that she killed her selfe by reason of his absence? and was it not also the Beautie of <hi>Cresed,</hi> which made <hi>Troilus</hi> so to languish for her, that he was at the point of death? Infinite more examples I could produce, where Beautie alone without the helpe of Bountie, haue inueagled the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders thereof vnaduisedly to intertaine fancie: for as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more pleasing and precious to the eye, so there is nothing more brittle and fading, being but a pleasant bayte to intrappe the minde, which well might be compared to a bauens blaze, the which as it is violent, can not be permanent: or to the apples in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to rot before they be halfe ripe. Wherefore, by howe much the minde doeth excell, and is of greater estimate then the bodie, by so much is the vertue of the one to be preferred before the beautie of the other, which made <hi>Diogenes</hi> to say to a beautifull youth, much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for his faire complexion, O fond yong man, why doest thou not studie to conuert the louers of thy bodie, to be louers of thy minde. <hi>Aristotle</hi> being demaunded, howe happened it that we held commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication longer, and more willing with a beautifull bodie then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, answered, that blinde persons vsed so to doe: for that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:21041:44"/>
not the brittlenesse of the beauty, but the forme and grace of the colour. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in another place calleth beautie, the spurre of fame. <hi>Diogenes</hi> said it to be a great gift of nature: <hi>Socrates,</hi> the violence of a short time: <hi>Plato,</hi> the prerogatiue of nature, which happeneth but to a fewe: <hi>Theophrastus</hi> tearmeth it a silent fraud, which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth without wordes: <hi>Theocritus,</hi> a glistering miserie, which is ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the sight, but the cause of many inconueniences: <hi>Carneades,</hi> a kingdome without gouernour, for that the beautifull commaunde what they will, without compulsion or force. Thus you may see the opinion of diuerse philosophers touching beautie, which neuerthelesse I will assure you, is of great force to procure loue, and that made <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> the philosopher to say, that the gods them selues in framing thereof, went beyond their skill: for that the maker was subiect to the thing made: and true it is, for what made <hi>Iupiter</hi> to transforme him-selfe into the likenesse of a Swanne to beguile <hi>Leda,</hi> and into a Bull to rauish <hi>Europa</hi>: what transformed <hi>Neptune</hi> vnto a horse, and <hi>Mercurie</hi> vnto a Goate, but beautie? what meoued <hi>Apollo</hi> to be in loue with <hi>Daphne</hi>? what caused <hi>Bacchus</hi> to fauour <hi>Gnosida,</hi> but beautie? well then, if beautie was of such force to stirre the mindes of the Gaddes to affection, what maruell is it, if mortall wightes and humane creatures had not the power, for to withstande the sharpe assaultes of his piercing beames: for who so lookes vpon the Sunne, if he be not Eagle eyed, becommeth stone blinde, and he that gazeth on beautie, vnlesse his heart be as hard as Adamant, will presently be inueagled therewith. So that as I thinke, beautie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the minde to affection, and bountie bindeth vp the match with the consent of the heart: Beautie winneth, and Bountie conserueth, but either of them by it selfe, though for a small time it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liking, yet in the ende it would growe to loathing: wherefore, that loue that should be founded vpon beautie alone without vertue, would with that glorious hewe and fading gloze vanish away: for what loue should remaine, when the thing beloued were lost? againe, the loue grounded vpon bountie without beautie, although for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it might be conserued with the habite of vertue, yet in the ende would it growe lothesome, much like a feast stored with plentie of fine eates and daintie dishes, and all these serued in vncleane vessels, the
<pb facs="tcp:21041:44"/>
place of repast being also a dungeon full of stentch and filthinesse: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Beauty might well be compared to the wieke of a candle, and Bountie to the tallowe: for the wieke by it selfe being lighted, is but a flash, and will presently out againe: and the tallowe put in the fire, will make a flame, yet quench immediatly: but the tallowe and the wieke wrought together, will euer holde light while the substance doeth last. Thus you may see that Beauty by it selfe is fading, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by it selfe is vnpleasant, and so neither without other durable: wherefore I thinke both very requisite to obtaine and preserue loue. Thus to be briefe, my conclusion is that Beautie is a rare gift, but Bountie a singular vertue: Beautie for a small time garnisheth the bodie, but Bountie perpetually adorneth the minde. Wherefore as <hi>Acops</hi> an hearbe not fayre to the sight, nor pleasant to the smell, yet of a singular and secret vertue, is much preferred before the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet infectious <hi>Aconitum</hi>: so Bountie, though in neuer so hard a complection, being of such a precious operation, is to be preferred before the royall apparicion of Beautie, which is but fading and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie: but this I allowe, that Bountie and vertue, by howe much as it is in the more beautifull complection, by so much it is the more commendable. And therefore to conclude. I say, that Beauty encreaseth fancie, and Bounty nourisheth affection, but both ioyned together be both rare and singular, which may procure the most wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering <hi>Cresed</hi> and dissembling <hi>Aeneas</hi> to be faithfull and constant.</p>

               <p>AFter that she had perused this fancie, she felt her heate to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and her selfe altogether ouercome with the cunning sleightes of <hi>Aphrodites</hi> little wanton, that secretly had nowe stollen into her minde, and bended the same to stoupe to affection: for being young and tender, she was apt for any forme or impression. And thus feeling her minde boyling in the furnace of feruencie, she began to consider more aduisedly of the matter, supposing <hi>Cornelius</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of youth, to lust after her beautie, and not to

meane any trueth or honestie, knowing well, that vnder the fayrest flowers did often lye the most deadlyest poyson, and that the <hi>Panther</hi> hath a noysome breath, though a painted skinne. Euen so the fayrest speaches many times did containe the greatest fraud and deceite: one while she called to minde her meane estate and his high calling, which was such a cooling carde to her hote ague, that she was voyde of hope to finde any thing but dissimulation in him: another while, wayghing how vnlikely her hope was to take effect, though <hi>Cornelius</hi> had for his part meant all things faithfully and truely, being right assured the Duke his father would neuer assent thereunto. And finally shee considered, what great discommoditie it was to sustaine the yoke of marriage: and the great ease, quietnes of minde, and due merite of a single and sole life, preferring the quiet state of the most simple and poorest virgine, before the rich robes, dainty dishes, sumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and all the ambicious ostentation of the stateliest matrone in the worlde. And when she had breathed a little vpon this Period, she began againe to peruse <hi>Cornelius</hi> fancie, making a full point at euery word, and at euery point a sigh interlaced with some brinish teares, that like orient pearles trilled ouer the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sweete mistresse, thinke it not strange to see me thus long silent, for that with the sudden viewe of your presence I was so metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed, that I had bene like (with <hi>Acteon</hi>) to be transformed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:21041:46"/>
some newe shape: and if I faile in deliuering my mind, it is the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my passion that procureth the same, being as fearefull to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please, as I am feruent and desirous to attempt: it is said, that loue doeth make men Oratours, but it seemeth vnto me otherwise, for that (in my opinion) the sight of the obiect which a man so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, robbeth him of the sence of the minde: and this is it, that made <hi>Mars</hi> to be mute, when he wrung <hi>Venus</hi> by the hand. Wherefore, sweete <hi>Verosa,</hi> thinke the feruencie of my fancie to supplie the lacke I haue in vttering the same. I could with long ambages discourse of my loue, but seeing in many words lyeth mistrust, &amp; that the trueth is bare, &amp; needeth no glorious shewes to garnish it selfe: let this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Cornelius</hi> loueth <hi>Verosa,</hi> &amp; his hart can fancie none but <hi>Verosa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Albeit that this pleased <hi>Verosa</hi> very well, yet stood she in great doubt, least this his protestation was but a fayned glose to couer his fraudulent intention, and not a settled loyaltie grounded vpon any faithful resolucion: yet notwithstanding thinking it no pollicie to driue him away with repulse: least by her coynesse she should procure her owne discontent, and being in this minde betweene feare and hope, she framed him this answere. Honorable seruant, (if the law-maker do not him selfe breake the law, I may without offence so call you) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am a maiden, and therefore of no great capacity, &amp; also <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosa,</hi> whose innocent simplicitie can not search forth the intricate qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of sophistry, yet am I not so voide of all vnderstanding, as to swallow the hooke because it hath a painted baite, and to sup poyson because it is tempered with hony: for they which do think euery look to be loue, euery smile to be a fauor, &amp; euery word which the amorous louer speaketh, to be an oracle, shall no doubt for euery dram they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of sweet content (while thus they blinde them selues with selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit) reape whole tunnes of sorrowful mishaps, blaming their own credulitie, &amp; cursing the poysoned entisements of alluring vanity, who hauing forgotten <hi>Ciceroes</hi> principle. <hi>Deliberandum est diu quod statuendum est semel,</hi> run headlong to do that in haste, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they may haue iust cause to repent at leisure.

the operation is pestilent and monstrous. Wherefore when such mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke is plaid, we had neede to stoppe our eares, least the melodie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would animate vs to follie, and so by suspecting little and trusting much, we should wholly cast our selues away: yet pardon me, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> in that I do suspect, for thereby I do feare, but not condemne. You would make me beleeue that <hi>Cornelius</hi> is in loue with <hi>Verosa,</hi> he is a Prince of great renowne, she a meane and exiled Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose base fortunes maketh her ashamed to enter parlie with <hi>Cornelius</hi>: he an heire of great patrimonie, &amp; she allotted to a poore and simple dowrie. Can loue be shrowded vnder the habite of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties? will the Eagle nestle with the Owle? or the Lyon harbour in the same denne with the wolfe? or can there be any simpathie of affection betweene a royall Prince and a homelie and simple mayde? And howe can I beleeue, that (when fortune hath allotted such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene our degrees) our thoughtes could be vnited in loue, sith in the knitting of affection, <hi>Aurum est causa sine qua non</hi>: for loue without wealth is like the Cedar tree without fruite, or fire without fewell: suppose then you fancie my beauty, wherewith you will be shortly so glutted, that taking a surfet thereon, you will vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite it vp with repentance, and so that which earst seemed most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delectable, will become odious and lothsome, especially to such as loue with euery looke, who like the <hi>Pirte</hi> stone freeze inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they seeme outwardly to burne, and like the serpentine pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that will quickely take fire, but presently be quenched, verifying the Prouerbe, Soone ripe soone rotten. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to cut her off from this inuectiue, thought it fitter to ioyne issue with her, then to let her proceed any further therein, began thus.</p>
               <p>It were very absurd, <hi>Verosa,</hi> of particular instances to inferre a conclusion generall: what though some did like for profite sake, and doeth it therefore argue, that all should tye their affections to wealth and riches? are <hi>Venus</hi> shrines to be furnished with coyne, or her deity to be adored with a loyall and louing heart? is <hi>Cupid</hi> to be feed with golde, or to be obeyed in his absolute commaund with constancie? thinke you <hi>Verosa,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius</hi> the sonne of renowmed <hi>Deuasco,</hi> will harbour such base thoughtes and seruile conceites? as to prize substance more then honour, and to measure his amours by fading
<pb facs="tcp:21041:47"/>
pelfe, not by lasting vertue? no, no <hi>Verosa,</hi> thinke not so, but rather beleeue this Maxime to be true, that <hi>in loue there is no laeke</hi>: for it brooketh no exception of want: and where affection is Generall of the field, there alwayes either Plentie pitcheth his pauilion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent so tempereth lacke with reason, that the defect of the one is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the vertue of the other. Why then, what doubt, sweete <hi>Verosa,</hi> if of my constancie, suspect not before you haue cause: for I will assure you, no straggling <hi>Aeneas</hi> shall prooue me fleeting, nor any false <hi>Iason</hi> conclude me fraudulent: what though the <hi>Pirte</hi> stone burne outwardly and freeze inwardly, that argueth not my heart to be of that operacion: and albeit the <hi>Serpentine</hi> powder (as you say) will presently kindle, and quickely out againe, yet the <hi>Salamanders</hi> stone once set on sire will neuer be quenched: and of this make bolde, <hi>Verosa,</hi> that no disaster Fortune shall driue me to make a shipwrack of my affection, nor yet the bitter frownes of hard aduersitie cause me to alter fancie: wherefore, deare Mistresse, yeeld me not chaffe for pure corne, drosse for tryed mettall, and to conclude, repay not my ardent and loyall loue with colde and coye disdaine: for beleeue me, and let this word conclude all, I loue <hi>Verosa,</hi> and I hate my life if I be not loued againe of <hi>Verosa</hi>: with this conclusion, <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> sealing his Plea with a deepe sigh, expected answere, and <hi>Verosa</hi> supposing that his passion proceeded of pure loue, and not of wanton lust, desirous to driue him out of doubt with assurance of her fidelity, briefely returned him this answer.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the iuyce of <hi>Selandine</hi> is sweete, but it fretteth deadly, and your wordes be pleasant but they might pretend a preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: yet neuerthelesse, I am neither so faint hearted as not to dare to beleeue, nor yet so curious to mistrust, but that I may promise to loue <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and also faithfully perfourme the same, so it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disparagement of mine honour, which is the onely Iewell I haue in this my declining estate.

And if these straying passions proceed of my gentlenesse vnto you, I am sorie to haue bene so ouer-liberall of mine honour, in entertaining you with such kindnesse: if your griefe be for your friend, then reason doubtlesse may well satisfie a reasonable man to be reformed in such an error: for ought you more to regard a little trauell which your friend endureth in forren and strange countryes, (where he gayneth more honour by the title and name of a traueller, besides knowledge and experience, which be two so rare and speciall iewels, then would many thousand times counteruaile the labour or daunger of his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage) then the loue of <hi>Florida,</hi> which once you seemed to prize of greater value then your owne life. Sure I must thinke if you doe so, that either you did then counterfet, or nowe dissemble, either of which are two too base qualities for an honourable minde. And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratus,</hi> no doubt, will returne hither againe, when he may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all goeth well with you, which daily he may heare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he is commorant, being inquisitiue (as you may assure your selfe he is) of the state of my fathers Court, and then your ioy will be double, his wished presence repaying with vsurie your late penance for his absence.</p>

               <p>The fayre Lady <hi>Modesta,</hi> daughter to the King, was of malice by Countie <hi>Delamure</hi> accused of fornication, with a <hi>Florentine</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Byndon,</hi> a Gentleman very much beloued: yet because he was a stranger, the bloody minded <hi>Delamure</hi> could not so boldely forge such treacherie, and commit such mercilesse massacre against any, as towardes him: this accusation proceeded not of any enmitie betweene him and <hi>Byndon,</hi> but of meere malice to vertuous <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desta,</hi> in whose life and conuersation (as it is credibly reported) there is liuely pourtrayed out a perfect Mappe of modest chastitie, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous humanitie: wherefore the hardest heart would be dissolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to teares, for pure compassion of such crueltie. Then quoth <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> how know you that she is innocent, and if this proceedeth but of your coniecture, you may very well be in a wrong boxe: for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be wily cattell, and sometimes vnder the habite of counterfet grauitie, they hyde a most vnchaste and wanton desire, and so blinde and deceiue the simple and plaine meaning man in his coniectures, and indeede I tell you, I much maruell that one of your yeeres and experience, should without some speciall knowledge iudge so well of

the Feminine gender, without that it was your fortune neuer in all your life to haue dealings with any, or that the Planets were in such fauourable aspects at the time of your birth, that they assured you of truth where you committed any trust. And as <hi>Moderatus</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proceed further in this matter, the olde Hermite did cut him off with this replie.</p>
               <p>My sonne, thou art much to blame to iudge so hard of women, or to thinke me so credulous: for as the one is not alwayes bad, so in the other I would not be lightly carryed either to like or mislike, without reason should induce me thereunto: and therefore, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the case in generall touching all women, I will speake in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of this matter, assuring you that all which I speake, grewe vpon a probable reason, being informed of the trueth by one of the parties priuie to the conspiracie: so now marke, and you shall heare the discourse thereof.</p>
               <p>County <hi>Delamure,</hi> being a gallant and braue Courtier, fell in loue with the Lady <hi>Modesta,</hi> whose beauty and conuersation moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to extreme heate, that he might truly say,

                     <l>Sed scio quisquis amat vritur igne graui:</l>
                  </q>
And being in this extremitie of passion, he prosecuted his loue vnto her very earnestly, by all wayes and meanes that possibly he could, which neuerthelesse grew to small effect: for that <hi>Modesta</hi> was not yet resolued to entertaine or fancie any, and if she had, hardly could she haue bene contented to like of him, because he was so perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that it seemed he rather expected for it by commaund, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to merite it by desert. Wherefore the chaste <hi>Modesta</hi> suspected his fancie to be but fayned, proceeding rather of lust, then of any pure and vnspotted loue, and therefore gaue him an absolute answere, no further to prosecute his suite vnto her: and in the ende (driuen thereunto by importunitie) she gaue him straight warning not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Countie <hi>Delamure</hi> taking this repulse very grieuously, with great rancor and malice in his minde, neuer, ceased to inuent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise

First, he compacted with one of <hi>Modestas</hi> Gentlewomen, which was neere about her called <hi>Ambideza,</hi> and hauing corrupted her partly with gifts, partly with promise of marriage, to keepe his counsell and to further his enterprise, interchangeable othes for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of eyther of their promises past betweene them: <hi>Delamure</hi> hauing the plat ready in his head, said vnto her thus, then (my sweet <hi>Ambideza</hi>) must thou in thy Mistresse name repaire to <hi>Byndon</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> who, as I thinke, is somewhat fauoured of her, and tell him, that thy Mistresse willeth him soone this euening, to repaire to her chamber when they are at supper, and that thou wilt be there ready to let him in, where he shal stay til thy mistres come vnto him, to commune of some speciall matters, she would haue none priuie but them both: that done, if he commeth, (as I am sure he will) watch for him there, and bring him to the little closet hard b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Byndon,</hi> vnwitting what banquet was prepared for him, faithfully giuing credite to the messenger, knowing her of some trust with her Mistresse, repayred at the time appointed, through a strange gallery he well knew, to <hi>Modestas</hi> chamber, where <hi>Ambideza</hi> watched his comming, and brought him to that little Closset, from the which there was an entrance both to <hi>Modestas</hi> chamber, and also to the gallerie, through the which <hi>Byndon</hi> had thither repayred, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing shut him in, she presently gaue the watch-worde to County <hi>Delamure,</hi> who being very glad, that his purpose was brought to so good a passe, made one or two of his vassals and bond-flaues priuie of his pretence, whome he had well aduanced for such a purpose: and when he had well schooled them, what they had to say when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should come in question, he watched the time of <hi>Modestas</hi> going to prayer, which alwayes she vsed to do by her selfe alone, an hower or two before bed time: and when he had espyed her to forsake the presence, and all alone to depart, he thought it his fittest time to

worke his mischieuous intent, and so togither with those that he had dealt with therein, he secretly came to <hi>Modestas</hi> chamber, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made her selfe ready to prayer, was opening the closset doore, where <hi>Byndon</hi> was, (God knoweth, ignorant that any body was within) County <hi>Delamure</hi> vnseene of her was hard at her heele, and assoone as she had opened the dore of the closet, entred in with her, and presently <hi>Bindon,</hi> who was within, seeing more then <hi>Modesta</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the chamber, suspected presently some treason, &amp; sought in al haste to conuay him selfe at the backe doore which entred to the gallery, there had the County appointed one of his men to watch, &amp; had giuen him instructions, if <hi>Byndon</hi> sought that way to escape, that he would presently thrust him in with his rapier, which accordingly took effect, and so very villanously was <hi>Byndon</hi> murthered by his direction: to coulor which diuilish practise, and to the full consuming of his wicked intent, he repaired forthwith to the King, and infourmed him that he, and some others passing through a strange gallery in his Highnesse Court, had discouered a great crime committed in his royal Pallace, which was no lesse then the deflowring of his owne natural daughter, and shewed him further the manner of the apprehension, and how <hi>Byndon</hi> being the offendor would haue made escape, so that his man to saue his owne life, was forced to kill him: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King hearing what <hi>Delamure</hi> said, so chaunged colour, that he seemed rather a ghost then a liuing creture, being at the first ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, induced so to thinke, because <hi>Byndon</hi> was in such a place, the secresie whereof was of sufficient authoritie to forbid any the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereunto, but to such as <hi>Modesta</hi> specially licensed, griefe &amp; anger striuing for superiority, in great rage &amp; without examining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further of the matter, very vnnaturally did command his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be imprisoned: who finding the malice of her aduersary to haue ouercome her innocency, submitted her selfe, according to the necessity of the time, to the stormy blastes of double faced fortune: yet not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

increased the ielousie of suspition against her, whose cleare conscience waighed not of any vniust disparagement, so that in answering this false accusation, she shewed so resolute a determination, that argued a valarous and noble minde in one of the female sexe, which had bene sufficient arguments to repulse this scandalous and false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the credite of her accuser had not bene of such great estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet neuerthelesse she was admitted to haue her champion, so that any, or as many as would come within three moneths, should be lycensed out of what Countrey so euer he come, to vndertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Modestas</hi> good name, impeached by that tirannous County: and in default of accomplishment thereof, <hi>Modesta</hi> should according to the law, suffer the paines of death.

taking the murthering of <hi>Byndon</hi> his vnkle verie heauily: yet like a braue minded warriour, resoluing rather to reuenge an iniurie committed, then to mourne for the losse of his friend, meant to take opportunitie by the foote, and either to free <hi>Modesta</hi> from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent daunger she was in, or els to offer his carkasse as a sacrifice, to finish the obsequies of his beloued kinsman, and innocent <hi>Modesta</hi>: and therefore made great moane to the Hermite, for horse and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to attempt this combate, making no doubt but shortly to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the arrogancie of that blood-sucking traitour. The Hermite noting the honourable resolution of his minde, iudged him to be a man of some great bountie. And thereupon calling to memorie, how that walking to take the benefite of the ayre, he had espyed hanging vpon a Pine tree fine blacke armour, and therefore nowe he brought <hi>Moderatus</hi> where the same was, who beholding the same, espyed this poesie ingrauen in the barke of the tree in <hi>Italian</hi> letters, and to this effect</p>

I bare to the parties it doeth represent, and for a remembrance of mine owne miserie I haue brought with me: rest thee contented with thus much knowledge thereof at this time, for that to discourse thereof at large, requireth longer time then at this time we may conueniently enioy, so great a necessitie summoning you to offer your selfe in the defence of innocencie, which opportunitie being neglected, your trauaile might come too late, either to enlarge <hi>Modestas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, or finish your owne desire. And therefore relinquish that request for this time, and when againe you happen to trauel this way, (which I wish and expect may be shortly with some good newes, and happy end to these new begun tragedies) I will cyte all the whole discourse thereof vnto you, fully to satisfie your longing desire, in the meane time you want not wherewith to imploy your selfe in, and nowe for that it is requisite that you be stirring the next morning, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh our selues with such poore cates, as many Hermitage will yeeld vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Well, repast being ended, they walked together to take the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ayre, yet they stayed litle abroad, for that the waightinesse of <hi>Moderatus</hi> charge gaue him gentle summons to take his rest, and to make his helmet his pillow for that night, which accordingly (hauing reuerently saluted his gentle hoast) he did: and all this night could <hi>Moderatus</hi> take no naturall rest, so that no sooner had <hi>Aurora</hi> put off her mourning mantle of darknesse, and discouered her blushing countenance, but that he (with a kinde of longing desire to be doing with his new implements) had forsaken the poore cowtch he lay in all night, and busying him selfe very diligently to set him selfe in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, the Hermites assistance was not wanting, who seeing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratus</hi> so well fitted and furnished with horse and armour, noting in him an honourable and bountifull disposition, who mannaged his horse with such good grace, that the olde Hermite (who in his dayes had bene as much beholding to <hi>Mars</hi> for courage, as to <hi>Pallas</hi> for wisedome) conceiued that he was one alone worthie of so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an enterprise as that was, which he went about: and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him to his fortunes, and him selfe to his Orisons, he left <hi>Moderatus</hi> making some haste to recouer <hi>Spoletum,</hi> who in short time arriued at a little village about halfe a league distant from the
<pb facs="tcp:21041:57"/>
same, there he began to be inquisitiue of newes from the Court, where he was told that the contagiousnesse of the time affoorded none other, then the very worst newes that euer <hi>Aemulia</hi> possessed, which was the imprisonment of the Kings daughter vpon <hi>Delamures</hi> accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which all seemed greatly to pitty, accusing the County of too too great cruelty. Here did he also learne of one County <hi>Pallamount,</hi> which inhabited in this village, who was <hi>Modestas</hi> vnkle, vnto whom he repayred, praying his aduise, and shewing his whole intent vnto him, <hi>Pallamount</hi> returned many kinde thankes vnto him for his good will, albeit that the great prowesse of <hi>Delamure</hi> did forbid him as much as once to hope of any good speed therein: yet accepting his franke offer, being the only comfort left for the safegard of <hi>Modestas</hi> credite, yea her life also depending thereupon: for that was the very last day of respite. And therefore accompanied of <hi>Pallamount</hi> and some fewe of his followers, <hi>Moderatus</hi> calling him selfe by the name of the blacke Knight, repayred to the Kings Court, where being come, the scaffolde and all things was prepared for the execution of the Kings daughter, and <hi>Delamure</hi> remained mounted and armed in the field, to see if any competitour durst withstand his auerrement. The blacke Knight being within view of all, thought it not best to protract the time any longer, and therefore stepped foorth, stirring his goodly steede with good grace, till he came before the presence of the King, and then lifting vp the beuer of his helmet, and bowing him selfe with reuerence to his Maiestie, he saluted him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Worthy and victorious Prince, the great fame of thy high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne is so dispersed abroad in the world, that any accident which might pertaine to thy noble Person or the state of thy Subiectes, can not be obscure in straunge and forren countreyes, much lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thy neighbour Princes, or within thine owne territories and Dominions, which hath made <hi>Modesta,</hi> yea vertuous <hi>Modestas</hi> pitifull and lamentable case better knowen abroad in forren landes, then in thy kingdome or in thy Court, yea or to thine owne person: if there were no other reason to induce thee to relinquish this ielousie, thou hast conceiued of thy daughter, her vertuous life and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conuersation so well knowen, yea aswell abroad as at home, and
<pb facs="tcp:21041:58"/>
in forren Countreyes more then in her owne natiue soyle, (so that her modestie was a mirrour to all <hi>Aemulia,</hi> or to speake more truly a lantherne to all the grauest matrones in the worlde) might haue bene sufficient shelters to excuse a slender offence, much rather a manifest and apparant innocencie: wherefore I being (as all true Knightes ought to be) bound by the oath of Knighthood, to relieue the distressed and defend the innocent, and hauing (I hope) by good hap, knowledge of the false accusation of thy daughter, (false it must be, vnlesse my fancie deceiueth me, and needes must I fancie her, in whome such royall apparition of vertue appeareth) by the treacherous murtherer <hi>Delamure,</hi> whose bloody groomes corrupted with auarice, haue vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanously martyred and murthered giltlesse and innocent <hi>Byndon,</hi> whose blood cryeth vnto the Goddes for reuenge, and whose death I hope to quite with the cruell traytors life that dispoyled him of his. And to that end (shrowding my selfe vnder the habite of thy safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, heretofore by thy Highnesse proclamation graunted to any that would attempt the Combate in defence of thy daughter) I am hither arriued with hazard of my life, and price of my blood to deliuer <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desta</hi> from her imminent daunger: wherefore I craue thy Highnes royall pardon for this mine enterprise, and then I doubt not by the power of the Goddes, but this day in all your presence to bring her wicked accusers to confusion.</p>
               <p>Here the blacke Knight ended his speach, and the King in words and countenance allowed his pretence, much maruelling at his great boldnesse, that durst vtter so hard speeches against the County <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,</hi> whose very name was so much feared: wherefore he iudged him a man of no meane thoughtes nor base birth, that carryed so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and valiant a resolution. County <hi>Delamure</hi> being not far off, ouer-heard all that he spake vnto the King, which mooued him to choller and anger, that like a rauening Tiger he would presently haue fallen to blowes, had he not bene commaunded to the contrarie by the Iudges of the listes: whereupon he stayed, and so with great insolencie he tooke vp the blacke Knight with such vehemencie of speach, that it seemed rather to proceed of a mad and wilde frenzie, then of any valiant and resolute magnanimitie. The blacke Knight replyed very litle, smiling rather at his folly, then studying howe to
<pb facs="tcp:21041:58"/>
make an answere to his arrogancie, and so not taking any great heed to any further speach of <hi>Delamure,</hi> he stirred his horse before the seate of <hi>Modesta,</hi> and demaunded her allowance of him to defend her innocencie, who willingly gaue her consent thereunto: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he was presently answered his demaund, beautie nowe made him forget him selfe: for so long stood he at gaze on <hi>Modesta,</hi> till the Countie <hi>Delamure</hi> shakt him out of his dumpe after this manner.</p>
               <p>Nowe faint-hearted coward, doest thou forecast by Astronomie, or calculate by the course of the heauens, what shall fall of this thy foolish and rash enterprize. No, no, I tell thee, it is too late so to doe: for no submission shall nowe serue thy turne, neither shall all the friendes thou hast be able to redeeme thee from my handes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make thee readie and defend thy selfe, for longer shalt thou not pause vpon the matter. The <hi>blacke Knight</hi> not a litle mooued with his so great insolencie, first with a glaunce discouered his newe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained affection to his Mistresse, and then casting downe the beuer of his helme, he turned his horse about with great dexteritie, the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his body very well agreeing with the readinesse of his horse: and <hi>Delamure</hi> in like sorte was ready to the combate, whereupon their pages brought them speares, <hi>Perio</hi> serued the <hi>blacke knight,</hi> for so he was called, that County <hi>Pallamount</hi> commaunded to giue attendance vpon him. And nowe both the combatants being readie, the trumpetters sounded, and then hauing taken their full compasse, they so spurred their light and strong horses, that they ranne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the winde, and presently they met in the middest of the race with such a strong encounter, that the splinters of their migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie speares whistling and making a noyse in the ayre, did driue the beholders to wonderfull great admiration: more speares were brought vnto them, among which they made choyse of the best and strongest they coulde finde. Countie <hi>Delamure,</hi> hauing by this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great strength of his aduersarie, thought it not best to dallie with him, least in trifling away the time, he might purchase disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and blemish his credite, in that a strange and an vnknowen Knight should holde battell there so long with him: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> remembring that he had in hand the
<pb facs="tcp:21041:59"/>
murtherer of his deare kinsman, and the false accuser of <hi>Priscus</hi> sister (his dearest friend liuing) redoubling his force in such sort, that he thought it no conquest if his aduersary held out any long time. Thus on either side being stirred with great indignation and choller, they pricked their furious steades to runne with great swiftnesse, and the blacke Knight so well behaued him selfe in this meeting, that he burst his speare in small shiuers, and gaue <hi>Delamure</hi> so strong an incounter, that both horse and man fell to the ground, him selfe also feeling the great force of his mighty aduersarie: for that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued such a counter-buffe of <hi>Delamure</hi> vpon his visor, that he was quite out of all remembrance, and fell downe vpon the saddle bowe, his horse carrying him all about the field as dead: <hi>Delamure</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued small dammage by this incounter, but onely the disgrace of his fall wherein his horse shoulder was broken, which was very good hap to the blacke Knight: for if <hi>Delamure</hi> had had his horse to followe him when he was in this traunce, he had quickely ended the battell, and albeit he was a-foote, and his body corpulent, he made so great haste to follow him, that he came within reach of him, and as he was ready to handfast a blow vpon to finish that labour, the blacke Knight recouered him selfe, and perceiuing that he was so disgraced before the Prince of <hi>Aemulia,</hi> where he well hoped to gaine honour, not knowing of the fall of his aduersarie, he turned his horse with great furie, where espying <hi>Delamure,</hi> and on foote so nigh him, with a trice he lighted from his horse, and drewe out his sworde, which was one of the best that euer had bene forged of steele: for that it had bene wrought by wisedome and arte) and so the County did the like: then began the battell very bloody and stout, either endeauouring with all his force to endammage his foe. The good Lady <hi>Modesta</hi> nowe somewhat recouered of a traunce, (although she was yet doubtfull of the successe of the battell) wherein she had fallen in this great danger of her champion, whose death had bene a small iudgement of her life. In this sort they continued the space of a good howre, without any aduantage perceiued of any side, to the great wonder of all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who iudged it impossible for any humane strength to sustaine so long and hard a trauell: all greatly admiring at the great bountie of the blacke Knight, for that as it grew further in the day, the heat of
<pb facs="tcp:21041:59"/>
his choller being kindled, his force and strength also increased, and his aduersary was perceiued to become more slowe and fainty, yet for his credite sake he encouraged him selfe, and redoubled his blowes with such force, that he had greatly endaungered the blacke Knight, had it not bene for the goodnesse of his armour, which no weapon could pearce: yet the blowes lighting vpon his armour as thicke as vpon an anduill in a Smythes forge, greatly bruised his body, the blood issuing out at his Beuer, and in many other places through the ioyntes of his armour, the which the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> perceiuing, and seeing that it grewe late, thought it not his best course so to trifle the time, and no good done, least a new day must be taken and to end the fame, and so his labour but then beginne: and thus resolued at this time, (as it is said) to winne the spurres or loose the horse, he tooke his sworde in both his handes, and lent <hi>Delamure</hi> such a mightie blowe vpon the visor of his helmet, that he brought him quite out of his remembrance, and doubling the same with more force, afore he recouered out of his traunce, he ouerthrewe him to the ground, and then laid his foote vpon his breast, and vnlaced his helmet to see if there were any hope of life in him, and perceiuing by the moouing of his carkasse that he was not yet dead, in a litle space he brought him to him selfe againe, and thereupon the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him thus:</p>
               <p>Nowe treacherous murtherer, and false accuser of innocencie, thou maist see, the iust reward of falshood and treason is to receiue a defamed death for so vicious a life, or rather a perpetuall torment, for so villanous an intent. Nowe thy life is in my handes, and in me lyeth either to giue thee that which thou hast not deserued, that is, to depart hence with thy head: or els in executing of Iustice, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same to the innocent <hi>Modesta,</hi> which is too slender a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for so great a villenie. And assuredly, in case thou doe not here publikely confesse the trueth, to auoyd the ielousie which might be conceiued of <hi>Modestas</hi> honour, vpon my Knighthood I will euen execute the very vttermost extremitie, that honour and armes will allowe to be done against thee.</p>

               <p>In this meane time <hi>Modesta</hi> with all her traine of Ladyes and Gentlewomen were not meanly glad, hope hauing cleane banished away feare, yet feare but newly defaced with hope, in so much that the vertue of the one rooting out the infection of the other, caused such a sudden alteration in her body, that her wan and pale countenance was conuerted to a very faire and beautifull complection, and to be briefe, so louely and amiable she was, that the people had bene like to haue runne into an heresie, in derogating the dignitie and honour due vnto the Queene of Loue, and arrogating the same vnto her as a new <hi>Venus,</hi> more worthie then the olde goddesse, supposing that by her there might be borne a young <hi>Cupid,</hi> in whome the want of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (who was blinde) might be supplyed: who being full furnished
<pb facs="tcp:21041:60"/>
with all his senses, would (no doubt) be more gentle and lesse cruell. Great reason they had to haue this opinion of her, for that in maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie she excelled <hi>Iuno,</hi> in beautie <hi>Helen,</hi> in modestie <hi>Diana,</hi> in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pollicie <hi>Cassandra,</hi> so that hereafter none meant to goe a pilgrimage to <hi>Citharea,</hi> nor yet to adorne <hi>Aphrodite</hi> her shrine at <hi>Paphos</hi> with flowers, where now might be found only the dead cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where old sacrifices had bene, but no signe of fresh fires and new burnt offerings. <hi>Venus</hi> perceiuing the people in such an heresie, in making an earthly creature copartner of her Deitie, began to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angrie, deuising with her selfe howe she might vtterly subuert and bring in obliuion the great fame of this newe Goddesse, in the ende perceiuing no way to compasse the same, but onely in extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the very cause it selfe: and as all desperate causes require des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate remedies, so vpon the sudden <hi>Venus</hi> be thought her of a drift to requite this iniurie, which was thus. First, she sollicited her deare darling <hi>Cupid</hi> to vndertake the reuenge of his mothers wrong, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that there was no meane to effect the same, but onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate her with the loue of this newe Champion, wherewith she was already something mooued, and being once skortched therewith, no doubt their purpose would take good effect: for that the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> meant presently to depart to the Forrest of <hi>Esina,</hi> to bring (according to his promes) tydings to the Hermite, of his good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his late atchieued enterprise, and then his sudden departure would be so great a griefe to her heart, that in a short space her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing loue would so alter her heauenly hew, (for the absence of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers breedeth such a corrasiue vnto the minde, that it impayreth the beautie of the bodie) that the multitude would nowe thinke it but a blaze, which vanisheth away with euery blast: and by this meane conuert the heate and feruencie of their desires, honouring her nowe as a Goddesse) to a loathsome and colde disdaine, then (despising her as an abiect) in the meane time while <hi>Venus</hi> schooled her little wanton wagge, to worke a reuenge against the vertuous and fayre <hi>Modesta,</hi> the <hi>blacke knight</hi> hauing obtained the victorie, thought it would be more honourable if he vsed it with clemencie: and nowe after that County <hi>Delamure</hi> had confessed all the matter, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance thereof, the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> lifted vp the beuer of his
<pb facs="tcp:21041:61"/>
helme, (whose countenance garnished with the excellencie of beauty, his long trauell hauing added a singular grace to his louely and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able complection) offering with great reuerence to the vertuous <hi>Modesta,</hi> the disposing of County <hi>Delamures</hi> life or death: for hers was the wrong, and in her hand should the sword of Iustice nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, therefore he heartily requested her to pronounce the sentence against him. <hi>Modesta</hi> rauished as well with ioy of her sudden deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as also with delight in beholding the beauty of him, that now had taken fast roote in her minde, refused to accept of the <hi>blacke Knights</hi> offer, excusing her selfe with a kinde of care, least in being a Iudge in her owne cause, she might runne into the ignominie of the popular speaches: and so either be condempned of follie, for sauing his life that sought her death, or otherwise be accounted cruell, in not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the offendours submission: for that it is a great inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to deny compassion to a man in miserie. Upon these reasons she desired the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> to hold her excused, giuing him innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thankes, aswell for her safe deliuerie by his valour and bounty, as also for this his curteous offer, which to satisfie his minde, she would willingly haue accepted of, but feare of disparragement to her honour commaunding her to the contrary.

and after he had thus instructed <hi>Perio</hi> what he should doe, and had well rewarded him to make him the more willing to effect the same, he hastened him towardes the Forrest, and <hi>Perio</hi> (although more willing to followe his newe Master,) returned to the Court, where he founde a great tumult, the King being very inquisitiue of the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> which could not be heard of, the which when it came to the Ladie <hi>Modestas</hi> eares, she was very much grieued and disquieted, for that she was nowe out of hope euer to haue any sight of him that she so entirely beloued: and as she was in this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came in <hi>Perio,</hi> who hauing reuerently saluted her, presented her with that skrowle from the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> which when she had perused, she was verie well pleased, hoping he would not be long absent, (being sicke) from the Phisitian which could cure his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease: yet she questioned with <hi>Perio</hi> about him, who vpon her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, deliuered her his message by worde of mouth: whose entire and faithfull affection choosing rather to wander in vnknowen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sartes in great miserie, then to stay in her fathers Court to reueale his fancie vnto her, for feare of offending her which he loued so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, her loue towardes him began to encrease, so that in the ende vnable to conceale the extreme heate of her passions, she confessed vnto <hi>Perio</hi> howe greatly she affected him, earnestly intreating him to take the paines to returne againe in quest of the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> and she would well rewarde him for his trauell. <hi>Perio</hi> well pleased with these newes, willingly offered him selfe at her commaund es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially therein: for that he desired nothing so much, as to shewe him selfe willing, though not able to pleasure the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> so bountifull he had bene vnto him. Well, <hi>Modesta</hi> perceiuing the willing minde of <hi>Perio</hi> to carrie her message, presently framed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hauing sealed the same, she deliuered it to <hi>Perio,</hi> as being assured of his fidelitie, whome she had often tryed to be faithfull, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing him with all speede to finde out the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi>, and to deliuer the same vnto him. <hi>Perio</hi> presently departed, whome wee will leaue preparing him selfe for his iourney to goe in quest of the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> which we left trauelling in great haste towardes the Hermites Cell in the Forrest of <hi>Esina,</hi> who hauing at the last recouered the Forrest, began to thinke of his forepassed daungerous

aduentures, and the remembrance of his dearest <hi>Modesta,</hi> nowe penetrating his minde with fresh woundes, which brought him to a great agonie tormenting him the more, because he had bene but seldome acquainted with such strange motions, being in a great rage with him selfe, that his minde should be ouercome with such effeminate passions, so that he thus striuing to suppresse the fire, (which was yet but a sparke) it rather increased and waxed more and more, that in the ende it did burst foorth into a vehement and outragious flame, which so aggrauated his cares, that if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the torture of <hi>Perillus</hi> Bull, he could not haue bene more mangled in his minde, nor by any meanes racked to a higher note of sorrowe and griefe, remembring howe vnpossible it was for him to enioy that vertuous and rare Parragon, whose fauour he tendered more then his owne life. And being thus metamorphosed from a free man to a thrawled captiue, from a professed souldiour of warlicke <hi>Mars,</hi> to a vowed seruant of wanton <hi>Venus,</hi> taking no heede to his way, (these busie cogitations boyling so within his braine, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the sence of vnderstanding was quite perished in him) in so much that in this furie, his horse carryed him farre out of his way, before he came to him selfe againe. In this sort the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> (for so we will call him yet) wandered these wilde desarts for tenne or twelue dayes, till in the end wearyed with his day labours, and his small nightes rest, espying a fayre fountaine with fine greene banks, round about diapered with the pride of <hi>Vestas</hi> choyse flowers, and couered with the shade of a tall Beech tree, <hi>Zephirus</hi> tenderly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foorth soft and coole winde, which made a pleasant murmure amongest the parched leaues of that pleasant harbour, and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed part of <hi>Phoebus</hi> extreme heate, here he went and bathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the fountaine, and afterwardes reposed his wearie limmes vpon the tender grasse, which was verie pleasing vnto him, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his wonted passions still disquieting him, that he could take no rest, whereupon he warbled out this ensuing Dittie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the notes of the musicall birdes, that sweetely chattered vpon the hangings ouer that cleare and Christalline spring.</p>

               <p>WHen the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> had perused ouer this letter, and had read it againe and againe, he could skant withdrawe his eyes from the same, so vnspeakable were the ioyes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued therein: but in the end, seeking to deferre the time in reading her skrowle, (being in good hope not onely to behold, but also to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her owne person) was with the idle house-wife to be catching of fleas, when her businesse should be in doing. Therefore he plucked vp his spirits, and rewarding well the messenger, he resolued to leaue his first determination to visite the good old hermite, (til that he had first returned to <hi>Modesta</hi>) faithfully determining neuerthelesse, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie would giue him leaue, to repaire vnto him againe, to heare his British discourse, and to bring him newes of <hi>Modestas</hi> enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to promes. And now being pricked forwards with the sting of a more longing desire then before, he returned with <hi>Perio</hi> back againe, &amp; such haste they made, that within few dayes they were come to a village very nere to the kings Court, where they lodged al night. The <hi>blacke knight</hi> being (after his maner) very inquisitiue of newes: his hoast told him of a great triumph of Iust and Turnament, which was holden at the kings court, and the occasion thereof had growen in this sort. First the King, after the deliuerie of his daughter, caused a proclamation to be made, that whosoeuer could bring notice of him, that had by his valor preserued her honour and life, he should be verie highly rewarded for the same, &amp; when no news could be heard of him, he caused another proclamation to be made, that a solemne feast should be kept in his Court for one whole moneth, during which time, he graunted a safe-conduct to all forren Princes, and Knightes of what country soeuer, to passe &amp; repasse: and that during the time appointed, all commers, aswell within his owne principalitie and dominions, as strangers, should trie their marciall prowesse, and Knightly actiuitie
<pb facs="tcp:21041:65"/>
at Iuste and Turnament, and he which should obtaine the honour of that Feast with martiall manhood, should haue for his reward his onely daughter <hi>Modesta</hi> in marriage, with this condition that he would defend her beautie for one whole moneth at <hi>Florence,</hi> which nowe flourished againe, being but lately by <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the possession of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and the worthie <hi>Perduratus</hi> the valiant Gouernour thereof, who (at the time when the <hi>Gothes</hi> sacked the same, hauing narrowly escaped the furie of their blood-thirsting blades) had euer liued in exile in the desertes of <hi>Liguria,</hi> and nowe was called backe againe, and restored to his former posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and liuings, where he not onely erected stately and sumptuous Temples, to worship and deifie the Goddes, magnificent and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous buildings to harbour his people: but also prescribed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Lawes to keepe his subiectes in good order of liuing: these were the reasons which moued the King to make choice of <hi>Florence,</hi> knowing that greater company would assemble there, in respect that the fame thereof so lately began to flourish. And the reason (as it is reported) quoth <hi>Calimacko,</hi> (for so the hoast of the house was called) which mooued the King to take this course, was to finde againe that Knight, which victoriousty had vanquished <hi>Modestas</hi> false accuser. These triumphes haue continued these three weekes and more, and nowe they draw towards an end: many worthy Knightes and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Champions came there out of all Countreyes, and amongest the rest, one came, which is rather a diuell or a monster, then a man, a Giant he is, which came (vpon report of this triumph) from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sartes of the mountaine <hi>Taurus,</hi> and as yet sithence he came none ran with him twice, for that he vnhorsed euery one at the first incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and this is like to carrie her away, much against her fathers will, and nowe the King is sorie to haue graunted any such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the victor: but sith there is no remedie, he caused to be made a triumphant charriot to carrie them to <hi>Florence,</hi> being out of all hope to be rid of this perillous and terrible monster, without that the fresh fame of that newe erected Citie, together with the hope of so precious a reward, should make the nomber of worthy Martialistes to be greater, and their resolution to be more peremptorie, whereby some one might (by good happe) in the end weary that diuelish feend,
<pb facs="tcp:21041:65"/>
thereby once againe to recouer his <hi>Modesta</hi> from captiuitie. When <hi>Calimacko</hi> had thus discoursed, the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> was the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest man in the worlde, both because he heard of his Fathers happie returne to <hi>Florence</hi> againe, with the great fame and renowne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and also to be offered so good an opportunitie, once againe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat for his Lady: and withall, that before his Father in <hi>Florence</hi> he sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter that he had discoursed a while with <hi>Calimacko</hi> vpon these newes, he caused his Page to light him to his chamber, where being come, he began to commune with him thus. Nowe <hi>Perio,</hi> howe likest thou these tydings of thy Mistresse, and of that handsome groome that must haue her? very ill, my Lord, quoth he, and worse will my Lady and Mistresse fare, if she heare not shortly from you. Nay <hi>Perio,</hi> quoth the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> thou mistakest the matter: for women be wilie cattell, they can counterfet sorrowe when they are nothing sad, and lowre when they haue list to laugh, and smyle when they feele most smart: dissimulation is a common practise amongest them, yea and though they should loue entirely, yet are they like the timely blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms that are nipped with euery frost, they change their hew with the <hi>Cameleon,</hi> and alter their shapes with <hi>Proteus,</hi> so voluble is the wheele of their vnsettled resolucion. Quoth <hi>Perio,</hi> you may assure you, my Lord, <hi>Modesta</hi> is none of those that is wonne with a Nut, and lost with the shell: for as without great desart she will not affect, so without a manifest occasion she will not dislike: and for you, my Lord, you may be well assured, she will neuer be false vnto you, and if you finde it otherwise, neuer beleeue <hi>Perio</hi> againe. Well, quoth the <hi>black Knight,</hi> I will trie if it be so, let vs take our rest this night, and in the morning you shall knowe more of my minde. Little sleepe satisfied the <hi>blacke Knight,</hi> deuising with him selfe in what sort he might attempt this enterprise, vnknowen of any: in the end he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with him selfe, to send <hi>Perio</hi> the next morning to the Kinges Court, to learne what time, and which way <hi>Modesta</hi> should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed towardes <hi>Florence,</hi> and gaue him great charge not to shewe him selfe vnto her, before such time as he should put in practise what he had determined, for the enlarging of her from the custodie of that great Giant. <hi>Perio</hi> very readily and closely conuayed him selfe to
<pb facs="tcp:21041:66"/>
Court, and he stayed not long, but he came to the knowledge of all: the time of the Turnament being now expired, and <hi>Bergamo</hi> (for so the Gyant was called) ready within those two dayes to set forwardes with <hi>Modesta</hi> towardes Florence: whereby (according to the kings Proclamation) to finish his begun enterprise. When <hi>Perio</hi> had heard this, and had learned which way they would goe, without any carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he returned to his Master againe: and when he had declared the whole circumstance vnto him, the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> was very glad, that they did so quickely set forwardes with <hi>Modesta,</hi> and that <hi>Bergamo</hi> was to passe with her through the Forrest of <hi>Mountalto,</hi> wherein was a very narrow passage at the issuing out thereof, and adioyning thereunto a verie sine and plaine greene, furnished with two rowes of Poplars, (which were sometimes the sisters of proud <hi>Phaeton,</hi> so transformed, because they sorrowed for their brothers fall) along the same standing in such order, as though they had taken their places there, to behold the rare and strange sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shortly was to passe that way. Then he caused to be made a Cassocke, and Basses of redde Satten to couer his blacke armour, least he should be descryed before he had brought his purpose to some ende: and caused also a straunge attire to be made for his Page, and when he had giuen order howe thinges should be done, he betooke him to his rest. The next day, when <hi>Aurora</hi> began to clothe her selfe with her gray gowne, and to blush for shame that <hi>Phoebus</hi> should be seene to dislodge him selfe from her bower, and that <hi>Titan</hi> had no sooner set foote in his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and his trampling steedes with foaming mouthes began to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and with their lightes to discouer such things that were in the inferiour regions, obscured with the vale of darknesse, but the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> armed at all assayes, and couered with that red vesture, his Crest plumed with a great bunch of white feathers, mounted vpon his stately white courser. Thus <hi>Perio</hi> carrying his Target, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon a fine Iennet which he had bought for him, trauelled a round pace towardes the Forrest of <hi>Mountalto,</hi> and before <hi>Phoebus</hi> had passed in his course the meridionall line, they had recouered the same, and drawing neerer the plaine, to the which the narrow Angle was adioyning, the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> lighted off his horse, gaue it vnto <hi>Perio,</hi> and tooke <hi>Modestas</hi> picture (that he had procured to be made
<pb facs="tcp:21041:66"/>
for that purpose) and hanged it on a mighty Poplar, which stoode in the very nooke betweene the plaine and the Forrest, where no bodie could passe but must needes see it: vnderneath this picture he caused to be ingrauen in golden letters this sentence.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And when he had placed the same to his liking, he walked aside to watch the comming of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> who within three howers after, was come within kenne of the <hi>blacke knight,</hi> who tearmeth him selfe the <hi>Knight of the Forrest</hi>: then presently he called to his Page for his horse, and mounting to his saddle with a trice, did ride a soft pace till he came to the entrance of the plaine, and there he stayed still, till the charriot came right against him, and then stepped foth, and wished the charriot man to stay, who maruelling to see one alone man so boldly will him to stay, thought skorne thereof and held on his course. The <hi>knight of the Forrest</hi> full of choller to see the skornfull demeanor of that proud cartesman, spurred his horse till he came within reach of him, &amp; then with his armed fist he lent him such a blow vpon his face, that he crushed his skull in pieces, at the noyse of whose fal those which were already past turned backe againe, &amp; those which followed, haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned forwards. <hi>Bergamo</hi> being within glutting himself with the view of the faire <hi>Modesta,</hi> hard al this bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>knight of the forrest</hi> smiling answered, I haue vowed to keepe this passage, &amp; here thou maist see the cause (pointing to the picture) and I wished thy man to stay that I might speake with thee, who would not, and this is the cause: now reade this inscription, and answere my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. <hi>Bergamo</hi> kindled with wrath, was readie to runne vpon him with his Faulchion, but remembring him selfe better, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towardes the picture, yet tooke small heede thereunto, but reade ouer the skrowle which was vnderwritten, &amp; then foaming at
<pb facs="tcp:21041:67"/>
his mouth like a Bore, and fretting with a deadly furie, that any should presume to braue him in such order, he thundered out with his hollowe and bellowing voyce, (his eyes burning like a flashing torch) as followeth.</p>
               <p>Proud stripling and foolish yonker, howe darest thou presume to challenge me the combat, that haue terrified so many braue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Knightes with the maiestie of my sterne countenance, and thou sawcie Princkockes, art so arrogant to set vp skrowles of challenge to me, or arrogate to any woman liuing the beautie incomparable of my Lady, yea and though the trueth were of thy side, yet would I not confesse the same, being so peremptorily required thereunto: for resolute men at armes are sooner wonne with entreaty, then ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with force. But I pray thee, whose picture doest thou carrie abroad, thus to her defame and thy dishonour. Quoth the Knight of the Forrest, care thou not, arrogant Monster, whose it is, onely knowe she is the Lady of my loue, and Mistresse of my thoughtes, in defending of whose right, I hope to disinherite thee of thy rest, and therefore make thee readie to the combate: if I ouercome thee, I must be master of thy prize, more fitter for a man then a monster: if thou doest ouercome me, I will be thy prisoner, and confesse (that which I can not denie) that she, for whome thou doest vndertake this enterprise, is the very pride of beautie, and flowre of all the worlde. Although <hi>Bergamo</hi> might well haue vnderstood by his wordes, that his pretence was to winne his praye, yet he neither tooke any heed to what he said: onely thus much he replyed vnto him.</p>
               <p>Thou vnfortunate wretch, I will not sticke to graunt thee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a combate, because I would be thorowly reuenged on thee, and then mayest thou thinke thy selfe happy, to haue so honourable an end, as to perish by my weapons: but tell who thou art, that I may knowe the spoyle of whose honour I shall gaine by the conquest. I am the Knight of the Forrest, quoth he, that will shortly quallifie those insolent bragges of thine: but as the Beetle nestleth her selfe in the Sunne all day, and descending thence with a murmuring noyse, is contented with a Cowshard for shelter in the night: so thy proude and mighty threates, which nowe is stretched aboue <hi>Ela,</hi> will ere long be contented to decline, and to deskant vpon <hi>Solfa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21041:67"/>Hereupon <hi>Bergamo</hi> called for his horse and armour, and while two of his squiers made him readie, the <hi>Knight of the Forrest</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his horse round, and mannaged him with very good grace, and the rest of the company which gaue their attendance on the charriot did set them selues in order in two rowes, the followers of <hi>Bergamo</hi> on the one side, and those which were <hi>Modestas</hi> seruants on the other side: they all mused vpon the successe of this stratageme. All <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stas</hi> followers heartily wishing the <hi>Knight of the Forrest</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that their deare Ladie and Mistresse should not be combred with such a diuilish Hell-hound, the sight of whome tormented her more then Hell it selfe. Thus all being attentiue and standing in good order, <hi>Bergamo</hi> hauing armed him selfe, and being mounted vpon a huge and mightie courser, carrying a speare in his hand as bigge in a manner as a Pine tree, and stretching his vnweldy limmes in his saddle, that one would haue thought it had bene a mountaine that miraculously mooued towardes him: but neuerthelesse it daunted nothing of the courage of that good Knight, but rather encreased his force and doubled his desire to be dealing with him. And thus both parties being ready to the battell, the angrie sounding trumpets summoned them to that bloody conflict, the which no sooner being heard, then these two champions turned about their neighing horses, and pacing them till they were a competent distance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then giuing them the libertie of the raynes, spurred them on to runne like the whirlewinde, and meeting in the middest of the race, they shiuered both their speares so that the encounter was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for the <hi>Knight of the Forrest</hi> was so shaken therewith, that he was glad to embrace his horse necke to saue him selfe from falling: and <hi>Bergamo</hi> with the force of his enemies launce was pushed vpon his horse crupper, so that he had much a doe to recouer his saddle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And both of them hauing well settled them selues, drewe out their swordes, and then the battell began to be bloodie on both sides: but to be short, long and perillous was the fight betweene them, yet in the end, the <hi>Knight of the Forrest</hi> with great losse of his blood, and daunger of his life, was Master of the field: for no humane power could endure the terrible and deadly strokes of that good Knight, so that being nowe in the presence of <hi>Modesta,</hi> whole legions of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb facs="tcp:21041:68"/>
could not haue vanquished his inuincible minde. <hi>Bergamo</hi> nowe left groning his last breath, and blaspheming against Goddes and men, renting the bowels of the ayre with his clamorous and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe bellowing, his owne seruants flocked about him to lend him such succour as they could, all the rest ranne to the <hi>Knight of the Forrest,</hi> and submitted them selues vnto him, who hauing dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his horse, entertained them all very louingly, and wished one of them (which seemed vnto him to be chiefe of all the rest) to conduct him to their Ladie and Mistresse: for that nowe it stood him vpon, to perfourme the enterprise begun by <hi>Bergamo</hi>: the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man verie willingly did leade him towardes the charriot. <hi>Modesta</hi> all this while stood viewing of this stratageme, and was very glad to be rid of that diuelish monster, although she knew not who it was that had ventured so farre, to gaine an interest in her, and to whome she must yeeld a possession in her selfe: but whosoeuer he was, she liked well the chaunge, and therefore stood readie with a chearefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to entertaine him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hauing ascended to the charriot, lifted vp the beuer of his helmet, and humbly prayed her handes to kisse.

               <p>Noble Heroyes, and the flower of all Cheualrie, I hold it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to mourne when the daunger is past, but rather to reioyce in that it is so happily past: but yet to recount of our expired labours, can be no lesse then pleasing vnto vs, for that valiant <hi>Troian Aeneas</hi> vsed to comfort his distressed mates in their greatest extremities, saying vnto them, <hi>Olim haec meminisse iuuabit</hi>: so haue you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated vnto me the daunger you sustained in working my deliuerie: and surely thus much I must needes say, that as your valour hath purchased my freedome, so hath it also eternized your fame with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall renowne and highest title of honour. I confesse my libertie consisted in your bountie, and sith the same relyes vpon my beautie, euen the very same which you haue freed from perpetual infamie, shal in like sort gratifie you with vnfayned loyaltie, which is the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it can affoord for all your sustained trauailes. It is an ill Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener that toyleth in his garden all day, and can not haue a few roots for sallets at night: and a sorie husband, that laboureth in his vineyard all the yeere, and hath not a cluster of grapes instore to cole his thirst: and so that Louer is vnhappie, that in twise hazarding his life for his Mistresse, can not obtaine one reasonable wish. Nay rather that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were vnfertill, that vineyard vnfruitfull, and that Mistresse too too cruell, that would not yeeld better fruite to such diligent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Wherefore sweete friend, I protest vnto thee, that as my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie recouered by the force of thy strong arme, hath vnchayned me
<pb facs="tcp:21041:69"/>
from the bondes of shame and dishonor: so thy skrowle sent by <hi>Perio,</hi> (which thou doest pretend to wrong my sight) hath very much cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed my late-recouered perishing bodie, because it was from the <hi>blacke Knight</hi> presented vnto me: but <hi>Moderatus</hi> presence nowe the second time purchasing my libertie with the price of his dearest blood, hath not onely reuiued me from death to life againe, but also thereby purchased the Fee-simple thereof vnto him selfe, if <hi>Modesta</hi> hath any interest in her selfe. Here both burst foorth againe into floods of teares, and teares choaking vp their ripe and mellowed speaches, left skant any vent to the breathing ayre to haue accesse vnto their panting hearts, to ease the ponderous burthen thereof with volleyes of farre-fetched and skalding sighes. Thus as it were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into anewe worlde, so closely embracing, that as it may be phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically disputed, that louers and friends haue distinct bodys, but one minde: so it might be nowe palpably prooued, that these two lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers were but one entire body, with such exceeding vehemencie they clipped that which either of them so long expected and earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: thus rauished with an extraordinarie ioy of this happie meeting, they continued a long time in this sort, not much vnlike to the picture of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> set foorth in that manner they were taken by <hi>Vulcan</hi>: they had commaunded all to stand apart vpon their first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, and happie it was that all discouered not so great a secresie. In the ende something awaking out of this sweete slumber, <hi>Modesta</hi> led him in by the hand, and called for <hi>Perio</hi> to vnarme him, assuring the Page he should be well rewarded for the paines and trauell he had sustained. And <hi>Moderatus</hi> being vnarmed, <hi>Modesta</hi> very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly searched his woundes, cherished and bound them vp with great care, and then causing the charriot to proceed forwardes, leauing <hi>Bergamo</hi> neither aliue, nor yet altogether dead. <hi>Moderatus</hi> albeit he confessed to <hi>Modesta</hi> his birth and Parentage, would not haue any other priuie thereunto, till such time, as vnexpected in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers presence, he might discouer him selfe, if his fortunes in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise would prooue happie, otherwise he meant not to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe knowen at all. <hi>Modesta</hi> at the first seemed very vnwilling to holde on this iourney to <hi>Florence,</hi> least her champion in perfourming so many exploytes should at last miscarrie, and so verifie the old saw:
<pb facs="tcp:21041:70"/>
So often goeth the pot to the water, that at last it commeth broken home, or halfe crazed, but in the ende ouercome with his earnest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswasion, she yeelded her selfe to his will, and then they trauelled on merrily, till they came within a dayes iourney of Florence, in all which time no aduenture worth the reciting happened: and being come so neere their iourneyes end, they thought it conuenient to send a messenger before, to giue notice of their comming, and to rest and repaire them selues in a fine village that was in the way called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> which tooke the name of one <hi>Albanus</hi> a monstrous great Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which had built part of the Towne, and a great castle which stood in the frontier or entrance of the same, wherein he lodged a crewe of thieuish monsters like him selfe, that spoyled and robbed all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey abouts, till such time as the noble Florentine <hi>Perduratus,</hi> who was nowe restored to his former place and liuing againe, hauing knowledge of the great villanies of this <hi>Albanus,</hi> came to apprehend him with a great number of valiant men at armes, the which was not so closely determined, but this fowle beast had knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and fled to the wildernesse of <hi>Apenninus</hi> that ioyned hard vpon this village, where together with the rest of his companions, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained robbing and spoyling all the countrey abouts.</p>
               <p>This village of <hi>Albania</hi> was about twentie leagues distant from <hi>Florence,</hi> where they continued foure or fiue dayes, and there we wil leaue them, till other occasions doe concurre to bring them forwards to the proofe of this aduenture.</p>

with answer from prince <hi>Perduratus,</hi> concerning the triumph which he was to performe there) hearing report of <hi>Albanus</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnios</hi> great outrage, and mischiefes committed against the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereabouts, was come there secretly al alone to seek out those hel-hounds, which he dealt withall, when <hi>Priscus</hi> came to assiste him. <hi>Moderatus</hi> seeing no more to be done, and that he had vanquished his enemies, he turned vnto <hi>Priscus,</hi> with an intent to giue him thankes for his kind succour offred vnto him, in time of so great need: but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him, he presently knew him by a deuise which he had in his armour, whereupon he was stricken into a great admiration of his bounty, &amp; ioy of his presence, which brought him almost besides himself for pure ioy: And presently taking away his own helmet, hee discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe to <hi>Priscus,</hi> by this each of them knew another: weepe and imbrace they did, and what more (Gentlemen) I leaue to your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that obserue and keep sacred, a faithfull and vnspotted league of true and perfect friendship: for truly better may a man conceiue in his mind, than set foorth with his pen, the vnspeakable kinde salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, friendly greetings, gentle embracings, recyting of sorrowfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, in ech others absence, and reioycing now at last in their so happy meeting. All which was so perfect a map of pure and vnspotted loyalty, that assuredly it was no lesse than admirable, to behold the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of their rare and feruent dispositions. And after they had thorow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reioyced, in ech others presence, they began to reckon vp of either side the aduentures hapned vnto them since their parting.</p>
               <p>And first, <hi>Moderatus</hi> shewed all the course of his pilgrimage, his comming to <hi>Aemulia, Priscus</hi> fathers court, how he had defended his sister <hi>Modesta</hi> from death and infamie, discouering withall his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards her, his departure again from <hi>Lothus</hi> court, his trauel in the Forrest <hi>Esina, Modestas</hi> letter sent vnto him by <hi>Perio,</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne towards <hi>Aemulia</hi> again, the report of the great triumph con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Modesta,</hi> the which was also to be performed at <hi>Florence,</hi> in his owne fathers court, who was now restored to his ancient honor and liuing againe: <hi>Bergamos</hi> possessing of <hi>Modesta,</hi> his proceeding forwards with her towards <hi>Florence,</hi> to finish the enterprise: and how himself met with him, and entring the combat, bereaued him of his life, and thereby got the custody and protection of his sister <hi>Modesta,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21041:78"/>
and how he was now to performe that begun enterprise: and by king <hi>Lothus</hi> proclamation, if he finished the same, he was to haue his faire sister <hi>Modesta</hi> for his wife, who nowe together with the rest of his company, he had left at a village called <hi>Albania,</hi> that was hard adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to that Forrest. And when <hi>Moderatus</hi> had from point to point thus discoursed at large of al matters vnto his friend, <hi>Priscus</hi> was more ioyfull than before, first in that his sister was deliuered from the false and treacherous accusations of <hi>Delamure,</hi> and also because hee was like to haue <hi>Moderatus</hi> for his brother in law, that he loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all men in the worlde, and therefore <hi>Priscus</hi> returned him this salutation.</p>
               <p>Happy be this day wherein such number of ioyes doe concurre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for beleeue me <hi>Moderatus,</hi> if the monarchy of the whol world had bene granted vnto me, I would not haue bene so glad, as of these tydings you do bring me, with your self, the which alone had bene suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to yeeld me more contentment, than I am able to vtter, much sorrow haue I sustained by reason of thy absence, and more was the sorrow I conceaned, when dissembling <hi>Florida</hi> vpon receit of thy let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; knowledge of thy departure, giuing mee a friendly countenance accepted of my seruice, and being throughly entred into acquaintance with her, shewed me the same letter sent vnto her in my behalfe, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly if al the furies together had conferred to deuise the greatest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that could be found, all that inflicted vpon mee at once, could not haue plagued me more: But yet all did not grieue me so much then, as it ioyeth my heart now that it was so, because I am in good hope that it was a heauenly decree, to vnite our loues with more ample scope of friendship, for besides the likelyhood you are into wed <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi> (as no doubt the Fates cannot be so iniurious to preuent it) I do greatly honor and loue <hi>Verosa</hi> your sister, who was the only comfort I had, whilest I remayned in <hi>Albigena.</hi> And now sith your father and my honorable good Lord <hi>Perduratus</hi> is so happily restored to his liuing and honour againe, and that you are here, which I know will assist me in any honest action, I make no doubt to obtaine her loue, if it be not that <hi>Cornelius</hi> Duke <hi>Deuascos</hi> sonne is Lorde of her hart already: some lyking was betweene them, but how it prooued after my departure I know not.</p>

               <p>WHen they had thus debated betweene them selues, of all the accidents happened vnto them, after their parting they determined that <hi>Priscus</hi> should carrie the head of great <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> vnto <hi>Florence,</hi> and present it vnto <hi>Perduratus,</hi> making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe knowen vnto him, and no dobut he should be very welcome. And <hi>Moderatus</hi> wished him not to make any shewe of acquaintance with him before this triumph should be finished, at what time he meant to discouer him selfe, and not before: whereupon the day being farre spent, <hi>Priscus</hi> returned to the place where he had left <hi>Albanus</hi> dead, and there striking off his head, he tooke his readiest way to <hi>Florence.</hi> And <hi>Moderatus,</hi> making no semblance of any trauell, taken in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing those barbarous people, came again to <hi>Albania,</hi> by what time his messenger was returned from <hi>Florence,</hi> with this answer from <hi>Perduratus,</hi> that the daughter of mightie <hi>Lothus</hi> King of <hi>Aemulia,</hi> and her Champion was very welcome to his Court, giuing them great thankes, that they did honour him so much, as to make choyce of his Pallace, for the perfourming of so honourable an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>

And when they had a while busied their braines on this matter, more Lords and knights of great account repaired there: for that the very next day this triumph of iusting and turnament did begin.

                  <hi>BYsantia</hi> entered the chamber (before <hi>Verosa</hi> scant had breathed some few sighs after this sorrowful dittie) &amp; asked her cousen why she started away vpon the sudden, hauing vnderstood somewhat by her song, which she ouerheard, she charged her with iealousie, adding further that if she did beare any mind to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> her self would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse him in his sute, &amp; giue him no more hope of obtaining her good wil. Then quoth <hi>Verosa,</hi> I pray God you be not more iealous than I am, when you shal find <hi>Cornelius</hi> but a flatterer: for surely hee hath promised as much or more vnto me (I am perswaded) than euer hee wil perform with any: wherfore take heed, for you may wel know, the Rose hath his prick, the Lawn his brack, the deadliest Adder lurketh

in the finest grasse, &amp; the greatest deceir is alwayes couered with the fayrest speeches: trust not afore you trie, for feare thy repentance shuld come too late: and as for me I am indifferent, for I had rather want than be cumbred with such a fickle friend, whose fancies be more in number than his yeares, &amp; his yeares ouer many to be thus nussed in the sude of wind-wauering inconstancy: wherefore <hi>Bysantia,</hi> thou art old ynough to warm by the fire and not burne, to look vpon the Adder with her pide skin, and not to handle her sting, to make a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a flattering parasit, &amp; a faithful &amp; indissembling mind. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a while debated vpon this matter, <hi>Verosa</hi> perceiuing by this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle discourse (that had in this behalfe passed between <hi>Bysantia</hi> and her selfe) that she had rather looke vpon the <hi>Panther,</hi> than come within his breath, gaue her the scope of aduising her selfe, and so leauing the chamber of <hi>Verosa,</hi> they went foorth to see what sturring there was abroad, and at their first flight, they met with <hi>Priscus</hi> walking alone in an outer gallery, not far from <hi>Verosas</hi> chamber, who came there of purpose to espie opportunitie to discouer his affections vnto her: who at their first meeting gaue him verie friendly entertainment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to confer with him singly, desired her cousen <hi>Bysantia</hi> to spare them a little time, who presently left them together to determine of new salues for their olde sores: for <hi>Verosa</hi> knew well of the loue hee had borne to <hi>Florida,</hi> and her disdainfull vnkindnes vnto him. And fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her selfe in like sort agreeued with the wauering and fickle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> she disclosed the whole euent of the matter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as being both assured of his fidelitie, vnto whom she discouered herselfe, and also knowing that <hi>Priscus</hi> woulde-ioyne with her in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, being in like sort deluded by <hi>Florida,</hi> as she had bene with the dissimulation of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> burst foorth with great vehemency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame against his wauering inconstancie. <hi>Priscus</hi> giuing attentiue ear hereunto, was the gladdest man in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to find <hi>Veroso</hi> in this predicament. And where before hee doubted but <hi>Cornelius</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, now he found that let remooued, and therfore was boide to open his griefs vnto her, which he discoursed with her in this sort.</p>
               <p>My deare <hi>Verosa,</hi> and only deare vnto me, because <hi>Verosa,</hi> is it possible that the Uine should beare the fruit of a bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble? the pear tree a crab? &amp; that vertuous <hi>Deuasco</hi> shuld haue such vicious chickens as

Wherefore (my sweet <hi>Verosa</hi>) let vs rather reioyce than bee sorrie, to bee rid of such wauering Kytes, and fickle changelings, whose voyces inchaunt like <hi>Syrens,</hi> and sighe preiudice like the Basiliske, alluring with their melodie, and inchaunting with their sorcerie, that sooner may one sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of their cancred spices, than euer haue any iust cause to triumph with true delights.
