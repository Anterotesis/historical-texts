         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
OF THE
AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>I Find my ſelf obliged write a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
to give a reaſon for the order I
obſerve in the choice of thoſe Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whereof I treat. For many perſons
till they ſhall have conſidered of it, may
well wonder, that I make no mention of
ſome very famous Authors, who are often
ranked amongſt the Hiſtorians. As <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
Diogenes Laertius, Philoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atus,</hi> and
<hi>Eunapius,</hi> of the Greeks, and <hi>Cornelius
Nepos,</hi> or <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> of the Latins, with
ſome Writers of particular lives, ſuch as
<hi>Spartian, Lampridius,</hi> and others, who
compiled the Volume uſually called <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria
Auguſta.</hi> It is certain that moſt of
them did write very well of the times
which they deſcribe, and that the reading
<pb facs="tcp:56273:4"/>
of their books, where we can have no
better recourſe than to them, ought not
to be neglected. But becauſe none of
them compiled a perfect body of Hiſtory,
that came to our hands, (if it be true that
the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
loſt;) my deſign would not allow
me to compriſe them in this book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I onely pretend to examine thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who have left us more Univerſal Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
and from whom the Laws of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
may be beſt collected. A true and
regular Hiſtory comprehends much more
than the ſingle narration of any life what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
And I thought I had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the writers of the <hi>Hiſtoria Auguſta,</hi> for
if I had put them in the place where they
were to be inſerted, they would not have
contributed to my purpoſe; All that Large
Volume being rather a cold and lifeleſs
Carkaſs, than a body of animated Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as it ought to be: The judgment of
many of the Learned in that behalf, is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his opinion who calls them in
his Preface, <hi>Hiſtoriae Dehoneſtamenta.</hi> For
there is nothing to be gained by reading
of them in relation to the rules of Hiſtory,
<pb facs="tcp:56273:4"/>
unleſs it be in a contrary ſenſe, as by
the ſound of thoſe bad Players upon the
Flute, which <hi>Iſmenias</hi> made his Schollars
to hear, that they might avoid the faults
they obſerved in his playing. If it be
objected that by omitting theſe, I might
as well have refrained from <hi>Suetonius,</hi> and
<hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> who wrot only Lives; it
is eaſy to ſhew by the inequality of their
labours, to thoſe I decline, that they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
the place they have in this work.
For as to the laſt, I have not ſo much
conſidered him as a Writer of the <hi>Life</hi> of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as an Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
of that great change and Tranſlation
of the Empire of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.</hi>
And as for <hi>Suetonius,</hi> the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he has left us of twelve Emperors in
the ſpace of an Age and more, puts ſuch a
difference between him, and thoſe who
only publiſhed ſeparate Lives without any
coherence, that the Learned unanimouſly
confer on him, the Title of an Excellent
Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>We ought not moreover to eſteem all as
Hiſtorians, who have given the Title of
Hiſtory to their works, <hi>Pliny</hi> that wrot
<pb facs="tcp:56273:5"/>
the <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> cannot properly be
taken for one; And the ſame may be ſaid
of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Aelian,</hi> though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
Hiſtories of Animals. And if the
word Hiſtorian were extended as far is it
would reach, <hi>Lucan, Silius Italicus,</hi> and
many other Poets might aſſume it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the ſubject matter of their Poems;
upon which nevertheleſs we have not
thought it convenient to make the leaſt
reflection, For we find ſo little relation
between Hiſtory and Poetry, that as the
one cannot be without Fable, the other is
inconſiderable without truth; and it would
be unreaſonable not to make a diſtinction
between things of ſo different a nature,
which have ſcarce any thing in common
except the double ſenſe of words.</p>
            <p>Neither let it be thought ſtrange to ſee
the number of Greek Hiſtorians which I
examine, exceed that of the Latins. Which
is to be imputed, either to the injury of
time that prevailed more over the latter
than the former; or to the different Genius
of the Nations, which gave that advantage
to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that although the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire was after the <hi>Graecian,</hi> yet the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56273:5"/>
were not ſo accurate in writing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
as the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For we have found
ſome of their Hiſtorians worthy of great
conſideration even in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> whereas thoſe who wrot
in Latin with reputation, do not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the age of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntonines,</hi> where all
the Criticks with a common conſent place
the Old age of Latin Hiſtory. Yet I
have made it deſcend a little lower, to
place after <hi>Juſtin, Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi>
who though a <hi>Graecian</hi> wrot his Hiſtory in
Latin, in the time of <hi>Julian, Jovian, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi>
and <hi>Valens,</hi> where it ended. If
I had not confined my ſelf to the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of the firſt Claſſe only, I might have
made the number of the Latins equal to
that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and deduced Hiſtory
writ in the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, to <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s
time, by the addition of <hi>Jorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>naes</hi> and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodorus;</hi>
as I have done the Greeks by
my Reflections on <hi>Proco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius</hi> and <hi>Agathias.</hi>
But in the deſign I had to gather the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
precepts to write Hiſtory well,
from the Reflections we might make upon
ſuch of the Ancients as cultivated it with
moſt skill and reputation, I was content
<pb facs="tcp:56273:6"/>
to examin the principal of them, imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſome manner thoſe Pirates, who
often let Veſſels that are light and of
ſmall burthen paſs, to fall upon the moſt
loaden, as on thoſe where there is more to
be gained.</p>
            <p>Having in ſome manner juſtified my
proceedings, it is reaſonable that I ſhould
acknowledg the great aſſiſtance I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from divers perſons who favoured my
enterpriſe. The Two <hi>Du Puys</hi> were the
firſt who perſwaded me to it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their natural goodneſs, (which ſo
many Schollars find by daily experience)
aſſiſted me with Books out of three Great
Libraries, to wit, the <hi>Kings,</hi> that of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
de Thou,</hi> and their own. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the firſt could never fall into
better hands, and though as all men know
it is very conſiderable, yet it receives at
this day its greateſt ornament from their
judicious conduct, whoſe preſence does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
animate the books contained in it.
Neither were they content to give me all
the help that way I could deſire; but as
it is ſaid of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he performed
the Office of Midwife to the ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries
<pb facs="tcp:56273:6"/>
of the moſt worthy men of
<hi>Greece,</hi> I ſhould be very ungrateful not to
confeſs, that I am indebted to their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conferences, for all that is good in this
Treatiſe. This compariſon, and their
backwardneſs hitherto in ſetting out any
thing under their own names (although
their works, when expoſed to the eye of
the world, will meet with an Univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation)
puts me in mind of a thought
of <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger,<note place="margin">Ep. 25. l. 7.</note> on the ſubject of one
of his friends. He ſaies, that they who,
though full of Learning and merit, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
ſilent, demonſtrate a greater
ſtrength of wit, than many others who
cannot forbear to proſtitute what they
know; <hi>Illi qui tacent hoc amplius praestant,
quod maximum opus ſilentio rever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntur.</hi> In
the next place I muſt acknowledg the great
aſſiſtance, I have received from the Library
of the moſt Eminent <hi>Cardinal Mazarin</hi> by
the means of his Learned Library-keeper
<hi>Monſieur Naudé,</hi> who was pleaſed to add to
the effects of his ordinary humanity, thoſe
of an Ancient and moſt perfect friendſhip.

            <p>I am not ignorant that my work is not
of the number of thoſe which pleaſe many
people. They that prefer Fabulous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
before true Narratives, and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, will not find
content here. I conſider herein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
waies uſed by the Ancients, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
us faithfully and ſatisfactorily, in
thoſe paſſages of the world which were
worthy to be Recorded to poſterity. And
thoughts are herein diſplayed in ſuch
a manner, that without giving a preciſe
judgment, as coming abſolutely from me,
I leave, without partiality, free liberty to
<pb facs="tcp:56273:7"/>
all men, to contradict my opinions. But
though many perhaps who are ſhort-ſighted,
will yeild freely to thoſe who have better
eyes than themſelves, yet very few refer
themſelves to others in what concerns the
Operations of the mind, wherein every
one thinks he is clear ſighted, and no body
will acknowledg a Superior. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what I expoſe here but as doubts
grounded upon ſome appearances of truth,
be taken for reſolutions. My freinds know
why I wrot them. And my comfort is what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happens, the Labour was as an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diverſion to me. And if it be true, as
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> aſſerts,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Strom.</note> that our Souls
are of the nature of Wells, from whence we
muſt alwaies draw ſomething, to make
their waters more wholeſome and pure; I
do not repent of a trouble which has been
ſo profitable to me, and which at leaſt has
kept my better part from corruption for
want of exerciſe. To conclude, I ſhould
willingly uſe in favour of this writing, the
ſame prayer to God, which <hi>Apollonius</hi>
made to the Sun, when he undertook thoſe
long voyages, which <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> deſcribes
upon the credit of <hi>Damis.</hi> Addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:56273:8"/>
to that great Star, which he held to be
the Viſible God of Nature, he asked him
the favour to find through the world, the
moſt honeſt men. If my book were ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to have no others to deal with, it would
be no ſmall advantage to it. But if its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
is otherwiſe ordained, I muſt ſuffer
patiently what cannot be avoided by thoſe
who expoſe any thing to the publick.</p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
HERODOTUS.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH there have been many
Greek Hiſtorians, who preceeded <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus;</hi>
he is allowed to be the moſt
Ancient of thoſe whoſe Works have been preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our time. <hi>Pherecydes, Dionyſius, Mileſius,
Hecateas, Xanthus Lydius, Charon of Lampſacum,
Hellanicus,</hi> and ſome others are indeed menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to have written Hiſtories before him: but
their writings have been ſo long loſt,<note place="margin">L. 1. de leg. &amp; 2. de Orat.</note> that <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
in his Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> acknowledged <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>
to be the Father of Hiſtory: and in another
place, for his excellency, he ſtiled him the <hi>Prince
of Hiſtorians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They reckon no leſs than one and twenty
Ages from his to ours, for he lived about four
Hundred and Fifty years before the Nativity of
Chriſt: <hi>Hellanicus,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56273:10"/>
and they differed ſo little in Age,
that,<note place="margin">L. 15. c. 25. Noct. Act.</note> as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> reports, <hi>Hellantus</hi> was
but twelve years elder than <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and
<hi>Thucydides</hi> but Thirteen years younger. <hi>Suidas,
Photius,</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> relate a circumſtance,
which-juſtifies this, in reſpect of the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
they write that <hi>Herodotus</hi> reading his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
in a great Olympick Aſſembly of all Greece,
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> (who was then but very young)
could not forbear weeping to hear him: which
obliged <hi>Herodotus</hi> to tell his Father, that he
eſteem'd him very happy in having a Son, who
ſhewed, ſo early, ſuch a great affection to the
Muſes.</p>
               <p>I do not affirm by this expreſſion of <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
that he then called the nine Books, he compoſed,
by the names of the <hi>Daughters of Parnaſſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. de ſcr. hist.</note>
The moſt probable opinion, and which <hi>Lucian</hi>
ſeems to uphold, is, that thoſe Books received
their names from the learned, rather than the
Author: and we find many other writings to
have been dignified with the like Title, which
did not deſerve it ſo well as theſe. <hi>Dion the
Rhetorician</hi> compoſed nine Books, which were
called the <hi>Nine Muſes,</hi> as we learn from <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes
Laertius.</hi> And the ſame Author aſſures us,
that the obſcure productions of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> his
brain,<note place="margin">In Bion. &amp; Herac.</note> of which <hi>Socrates</hi> made no difficulty to
confeſs, that he hardly underſtood any thing,
were honored nevertheleſs with the name of the
<hi>Muſes.</hi> We read moreover in the <hi>Library of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56273:10"/>
Photius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Book ſo called.</note> that one <hi>Cephaleon</hi> had compiled an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome

the <hi>Nine learned Siſters;</hi> though in a different
order from that of <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Noct. Act. l. 1. c. 25.</note> And that <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

who from a Philoſopher, became a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,<note place="margin">Suet. de ill. Gram. c. 6.</note>
and from a Rhetorician, a Grammarian (ſo
degenerate he was) did not forbear to do the
like, in a Treatiſe of his, conſiſting of Nine Books:
And few that converſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that as the three Orations of <hi>Demoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>henes</hi> his
Competitor, had the names of the <hi>Graces,</hi> his
<hi>Nine Epiſtles</hi> received thoſe of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> being
the moſt illuſtrious, which could be given them.</p>
               <p>But from this inſcription of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> ſome
have not forborn to accuſe <hi>Herodotus,</hi> of being
too great a Lover of Fables, and of having made
a Hiſtory, ſo Poetical, in favour of the <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Apollo,</hi> that there is ſeldome any truth
ſound in it. This Faction reproaches him of all
the ſtrange things he has writ, and which have
been moſt doubred of: and inſinuates that thoſe
words of the <hi>Latin Satyriſt,</hi> which tax Greek
Hiſtory:
<q>
                     <l>—&amp; quicquid Graecia mendax</l>
                     <l>Audet in Hiſtoria,<note place="margin">Juven. Sat. 10.</note>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Were meant of him, and even <hi>Caſaubon</hi> thought,
that <hi>Herodotus</hi> his relations, had made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors
invert, the word <hi>delirare,</hi> taking for an
Etymologie, that which is perhaps, but a ſimple
alluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56273:11"/>
But as he has had accuſers, ſo he has not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perſons to undertake his defence: <hi>Aldus
Manucius, Joachim Camerarius,</hi> and <hi>Henricus
Stephanus</hi> have writ Apologies for him: and the
long voyages, as well to the North, as the South,
and the Eaſt-Indies, which have been made in
our daies, have very much juſtified his writings,
to ſhew us that an infinite number of things,
that he writ by the relation of others, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he likewiſe doubted very much, are now
found to be true. He declares in his <hi>Melpomene,</hi>
on the Subject of thoſe Phenicians, whom <hi>King
Necus</hi> imbarked in the red Sea, and who returned
to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> more than two years after, by the
Pillars of <hi>Hercules;</hi> affirming, that they had in
ſome of the Coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> the Sun on the
right hand, that he could not in any wiſe believe
them; though it is now evident by common
experience, that they could not return from the
Erythrean Sea into the Mediterranean, (as they
did,) without doubling the <hi>Cape,</hi> now called the
<hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and without having, in that
place, the Sun on their right hand, and their
ſhadow on their left (they being beyond the
Tropick of Capricorn.) In the following book of
<hi>Terpſichore,</hi> he makes thoſe <hi>Thracians</hi> Lyers, who
ſaid, that the Country beyond the River <hi>Iſter,</hi>
was full of Bees, for this weak reaſon, that Bees
cannot live in places ſo cold as thoſe muſt needs
be. Yet few are ignorant in our daies that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovy</hi>
is full of them, that they often people
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56273:11"/>
whole Forreſts, where theſe little Animals, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by their labour, nouriſh Beares of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
magnitude, which inhabit therein. With
the like fear of being miſtaken, he doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhould believe,<note place="margin">In Euterp.</note> that the <hi>Iſle of Chemnis</hi>
floated upon a Lake of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe he faw
it not move, and that it was improbable that an
Iſle ſhould ſwim upon water. But not to ſpeak
of the fabulous <hi>Symplegades,</hi> or <hi>Cyaneans,</hi> we read
that both the <hi>Plinies, Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,
Theophraſtus,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> have witneſſed, that
ſuch are found in many places, and that they have
ſeen ſome in their agitation. There are ſome
near St <hi>Omers;</hi> in one of which the Arch Duke
<hi>Albertus,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> his Dutches,
were entertained at a dinner. And it is no ſtrange
thing to the <hi>Scotch,</hi> to ſee one of this nature,
in their <hi>Lake of Loumond,</hi> affording very good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
ground.<note place="margin">L. pen. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. 2 dig. de acq. rer. dom.</note> In fine, their exiſtence is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Lawyers <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Labeo</hi> diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the right of their Soil, the firſt being of
opinion, that none had property in them. Who
would not have taken for a Fable, that which
the ſame <hi>Herodotus</hi> mentions, in another place,
of certain <hi>Thracian</hi> Women, who contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, after the death of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,<note place="margin">Iaitio Terpſic.</note>
who ſhould have the Honour to be kill'd
upon his Grave, and buried with him? If the
<hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and other relations had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
that it is a cuſtome practiſed in all the
Coaſt of the <hi>Malabares,</hi> and almoſt through all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56273:12"/>
the Eaſt, for Women to caſt themſelves, of their
own accord, and in emulation one of the other,
into the flaming funeral Piles of their deceaſed
husbands.</p>
               <p>But as we may perceive by theſe examples,
that <hi>Herodotus</hi> did hardly ever expoſe for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoſe things, which he did not perfectly
know; though they were found true, long after
the age in which he lived: ſo we muſt obſerve,
that he has been very careful to condemn that
which he judged to be manifeſtly falſe, when it
appear'd to be againſt the ordinary courſe of
Nature: even ſo in his <hi>Thalia</hi> he laughed at the
pretended <hi>Arimaſpes,</hi> who had but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, and
ſtole the <hi>Gryphons</hi> gold in the North. In <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomene,</hi>
the following Section, he does not more
favourably deliver the Tale of the <hi>Aigipodes,</hi> or
Goat-footed men: not what he had read of the
<hi>Hyperboreans,</hi> who ſleep ſix Months of the Year:
though this may probably have reſpect to the
long Nights of thoſe people, who live under the
<hi>Arctick Circle,</hi> and who paſs almoſt half the year,
without ſeeing the Sun, whilſt they are very
near the Pole. When he writes a little after of
one <hi>Abaris,</hi> who run over all the Earth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eating, and with an Arrow, which ſerved
him inſtead of a <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> he relates it as a Fable
which was very famous in his time: but in the
ſame Book, he proteſts againſt the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that there were men, Neighbors to the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
who made themſelves Wolves once a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56273:12"/>
year, and reſum'd after ſome daies, their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
form: one cannot then ſay, that he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
mingled truth with Fables, without
diſtinguiſhing them; nor that he was a Lyer,
though he often rehearſed the Fables of others,
which the moſt exact Laws of Hiſtory do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid:
nay thoſe very Laws oblige us to report the
rumours which have been current, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
opinions of men, (as he well obſerved in
his <hi>Polyhimnia</hi> on the Subject of the Argians) by
an Advertiſement which may ferve for all his
whole Hiſtory. Add to this, that <hi>Herodotus</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been a moſt Religious obſerver of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip, of which he made profeſſion (if
one may ſay ſo of a Pagan) there is little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that he would charge his conſcience with
ſo foul a crime in an Hiſtorian, as falſe relation:
for it appears that he reſpected ſo much the things
he thought Divine, though he was an Idolater;
that he would never reveal thoſe Miſteries, which
the religion of his time forbad to be publiſhed;
although an occaſion preſented it ſelf in many
places of his works. And one may obſerve in his
<hi>Urania,</hi> how he makes all the ſucceſſes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
fight, wherein <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> overcame the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to agree with the Oracles which
preceeded, whereof, he affirms, each prediction to
have been punctually accompliſhed: therefore
one, that was ſo great a friend to Altars, ought
not to be ſuſpected, of having betrayed truth in
favour of impoſtures, which were no leſs infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56273:13"/>
or deteſted in his time than in ours.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs though much may be ſaid in his
defence; and though he may have been often
ſlandered, by thoſe whom ignorance, or envy
have animated againſt him, we find two Authors
of ſo great authority, who have cenſured him
(without ſpeaking of <hi>Harpocration,</hi> who made a
Book, purpoſely to defame him) that one can
ſcarcely pronounce him innocent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> is the firſt, who teſtified a marvellous
reſentment, to ſee <hi>Boeotia</hi> his Country ſo ill uſed
(as he thought) by <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
charged with an infamy, altogether inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
on the ſubject of the <hi>Perſian</hi> War. This,
he ſaid, was the motive, which induced him,
to compoſe that little Treatiſe of the <hi>malignity
of Herodotus,</hi> where he accuſes him, of having
maliciouſly taxed the honour, not only of the
<hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians:</hi> but almoſt of all the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> to oblige the <hi>Medes;</hi> and raiſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Country higher, in the perſon of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temiſia</hi>
Queen of <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> whoſe Heroick
actions, in the battel of <hi>Salamin,</hi> he ſo exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
that this Lady alone makes the greateſt
part of his Narration. <hi>Plutarch</hi> confeſſes that, it
is one of the beſt writ, and moſt charming pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that can be read: but adds that in that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſweetneſs, <hi>Herodotus</hi> makes men ſwallow
the poyſon of his detraction: and he compares
the malignity, which he imputes to him, to
Cantharides covered with Roſes. Some write
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56273:13"/>
that <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s invective is accompanied with ſo
much heat, and appears ſo full of animoſity, that
he ſeems to have all that ill nature himſelf, with
which he endeavours to aſperſe his Adverſary.
But I have too much veneration for that worthy

an anſwer: and, to ſay the truth, it is hard to
conſider, how <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi>

which <hi>Plutarch</hi> delivers for moſt certain.</p>
               <p>The Second Authour of very great importance
produced agaiſt <hi>Herodotus,</hi> is <hi>Dion Chryſoſtomus,</hi>
who though he was not in particular the Inſtructor
of an Emperour, does not perhaps deſerve leſs
reſpect than <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſince beſides that he was
probably as deep in the affection of <hi>Trajan,</hi> as
the other; by whoſe ſide <hi>Suidas</hi> witneſſes, that
he ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s been often ſeen in his Chariot: He paſs'd
his life in the inſtruction of mankind, Travelling
through the world, where he pronounced, in the
midſt of the greateſt Aſſemblies, thoſe excellent
Orations, which we have of his, to draw men
from vices, and to imprint even in their hearts (if
he could) a violent love of Vertue.</p>
               <p>We ſee in his Seaven and Thirtieth Oration,
that he brings <hi>Herodotus</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to
receive from them a recompence for the Greek
Hiſtories he had compoſed, and wherein they
were extreamly concerned: He had not yet (ſaies
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56273:14"/>
                  <hi>Dion</hi>) falfified them: and becauſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
declared that they would not purchaſe honour with
money, he changed (as was evident) the relation,
of what paſſed in the Naval Fight of <hi>Salamin,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
<hi>Adimantus</hi> General of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> of
flying in the beginning of the battel, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by that means the common cauſe of all Greece.
<hi>Dion</hi> adds a little after, that he could not allow
of what <hi>Herodotus</hi> has left in writing upon that
ſubject; the publick Epitaphs, and Inſcriptions of
Sepulchers, erected by the conſent of all Greece,
in the Iſle of <hi>Salamin</hi> bearing teſtimony againſt
him; and he recites part of the ſame Epigrams
of <hi>Symonides</hi> the Poet, with which <hi>Plutarch</hi> uſed
to convince <hi>Herodotus</hi> of prevarication, ſo that the
Authority of his Philoſophical profeſſion, joyned
with ſo many Monuments, which ſeem unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable,
may reasonably at this day divide our
minds in a difference, which thoſe of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
could never decide.</p>
               <p>However after the loſs of ſo many other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
is is certain that Antiquity has left us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more inſtructive, or ingenious, than the
<hi>Nine Muſes</hi> of <hi>Herodotus:</hi> they contain, as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius
Halicarnaſſeus</hi> has well expreſſed, the moſt
memorable paſſages in the world, during Two
Handred and Forty years, beginning from the
Empire of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> firſt King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
till <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Reign, in whoſe time he
lived, as <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> inform us:
but the laſt was miſtaken, when he writ that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56273:14"/>
his Hiſtory extended from the taking of
<hi>Troy</hi> by the Grecians, to the Reign of <hi>Xerxes;</hi>
which would involve more than Seaven Hundred
Years. <hi>Diodorus</hi> his error proceeded, from our
Hiſtorians ſpeaking a little in his Preface, of
that Fabulous time; and what was uncertainly
reported in his life time of the Reliques of <hi>Troy:</hi>
But there is no reaſon to make Reflections on ſo
ſmall a matter, and which does not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

to inſert a brief account of the Subject, of each of

Dionyſius Halicarnaſseus</hi> who compared
theſe two Hiſtorians together, does almoſt alwaies
allow the advantage to <hi>Herodotus:</hi> His Dialect
(which was a faſhion of ſpeaking, peculiar to each

<hi>Longinus</hi> aſſures us in his Treatiſe of the

erronious; for he had compiled his Hiſtory long
before this retirement, as is recorded in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56273:15"/>

a Citty of that part of Greece, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Doris,</hi> a Region confining on the <hi>Meleans,</hi>
and becauſe his illuſtrious birth had engaged him
in the expulſion of the Tyrant of his Citty, he
retired into <hi>Thurium,</hi> where he died, according
to the opinion of many; there being even ſome,
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, that make this place, where
he was buried, to be the place of his Nativity.
It is not aſſerted by all, that the book of <hi>Homer</hi>'s
Life, which follows the <hi>Ninth Muſe,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by <hi>Herodotus;</hi> but whoever is the Authour
of it, it is very ancient, and makes the labour of
thoſe men ridiculous, who even at this day, take
great pains to pretend to ſomthing more certain,
and conſiderable than is there writ, touching the
Country of <hi>Homer.</hi> But this matter concerns not
his Hiſtory, which was happily preſerved, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

almoſt aſſured conjectures of the merit of our

a conception was founded the predictions of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi>
mentioned in the foregoing Chapter,
when he obſerv'd <hi>Thucydides</hi> moved even to

of <hi>the Muſes,</hi> in one of the moſt celebrated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of <hi>Greece.</hi> He took that for a ſign of

                  </gap>reable watchings, and diſquiets,
which give Immortality to the learned of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<hi>Thucydides</hi> lived about Four hundred and
Thirty years before the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt Anno
Mundi</hi> 3520. and as he was a perſon of illuſtrious
Birth, and a great Fortune, added to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his Indowments, he had no temptation
to betray truth, in what he was to deliver to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
and though ſome have cenſured the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his writeing few ever queſtioned the truth
of it.</p>
               <p>He was rich, and of Royal extraction, but his
opulency was augmented by his Marriage to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich Wife, a Daughter of a King of <hi>Thrace:</hi>
and being very curious to have perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of affairs; in order to the compiling of his
Hiſtory, he emploied great ſumms of money to
procure memorials comperent to his deſign, not
only from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
alſo; that out of his collections from both, the
great Tranſactions of that might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more impartially diſcovered; as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
to inſtruct the Ages to come, for he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuleth
his Hiſtory <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56273:17"/>
a poſſeſſion for Everlaſting. It comprehends
the Peloponneſian War, which laſted one and
Twenty years: for though ſome Writers make it
to continue ſix years longer, yet others, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the more judicious obſervers do make, what
follows in the ſucceeding ſix years after our <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer</hi>
had ended his work, to be rather the
conſequences of that War, than truly a part of it:
but what was deficient in the affairs of thoſe
years, was ſince ſupplied by <hi>Theopompus,</hi> and
treated on by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who begins his Hiſtory,
where <hi>Thucydides</hi> ended. There are ſome Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
that do not believe his Eighth Book (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ordinary diviſion) to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him: ſome aſcribe it to his Daughter:
others to <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Theopompus:</hi> but the more
diſcerning part beleeve the contrary.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War began to break, out,<note place="margin">Hobbs <hi>in the life of</hi> Thueydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note>
                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> conjectured truly that it would prove
an argument worthy of his labour; and it no
ſooner began, than he began his Hiſtory; purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame not in that perfect manner, in
which we now ſee it; but by way of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
or plain Regiſter of the actions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
thereof, as from time to time they fell out,
and came to his knowledg: but ſuch a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
it was, as might (perhaps) deſerve to be
preferred before a Hiſtory written by another:
hence it is very probable, that the <hi>Eighth Book</hi>
is left the ſame it was, when he firſt writ it,
neither beautified with Orations, nor ſo well ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56273:18"/>
at the tranſitions, as the former ſeaven
Books are. And though he began to write as ſoon
as ever the War was on foot; yet he began not
to perfect and poliſh the Hiſtory, till after he
was baniſhed, and why he did not refine his laſt
Book equal to the reſt, is not known; for he our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
the whole War as appears by what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
in his fifth Book, where he ſaies, he lived
in baniſhment Twenty years, after his charge at
<hi>Amphipolis,</hi> which was in the Eighth year of
that Wat, which in the whole, by the largeſt
computation laſted but ſeven and twenty years.</p>
               <p>It is hard to judge, whether the method and
diſpoſition of the Hiſtory, or the Stile of it, be
moſt to be praiſed; ſince he hath in both ſhewed
himſelf ſo great a Maſter, that none that have
writ ſince, have exceeded him in either. As to
the diſpoſition, we ſhall in this place only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that in his firſt Book, he hath firſt, by way
of propoſition, derived the State of Greece from
its Infancy, to the vigorous ſtature it then was
at, when he began to write: and next declareth
the cauſes both real, and pretended, of the
War whereof he was to write: In the reſt, in
which he handleth the War it ſelf, he followeth
diſtinctly and purely the order of time through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
relating what came to paſs from year to
year, and ſubdividing each year into a Summer,
and a Winter. The grounds and motives of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
action he ſets down before the action it ſelf,
either narratively, or in the form of deliberative
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56273:18"/>
Orations, in the perſons of ſuch, as from time to
time bare ſway in the Common Wealth. After
the actions, when there is juſt occaſion, he giveth
his judgment of them, ſhewing by what means
the ſucceſs came, either to be furthered, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>His ſtyle is better diſcovered, by what the
moſt excellent of the ancient Writers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
of it, than by my Pen. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his
ſecond Book <hi>de Oratore,</hi> writes thus; <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
(in my opinion) in the art of expreſſion,
exceeded all that went before; for he ſo abounds
in matter, that the number of his ſentences, doth
almoſt equal the number of his words: and in
them he is ſo apt, and ſo conciſe, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcern, whether his words do more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his ſentences, or his ſentences, his words.
As for his <hi>Dialect,</hi> it is purely <hi>Attick,</hi> and <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
judges, that as <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſhould be a rule to
ſuch as would be perfect in the <hi>Ionick</hi> ſtyle: ſo
<hi>Thucydides</hi> is the moſt excellent example, one
can propoſe to himſelf, of a language purely
<hi>Attick.</hi> He is reproached nevertheleſs, of having
too much affected the reviving of ancient words,
which were, even in his time, obſolete, and of
having likewiſe taken a liberty to compoſe new
ones; which has contributed much to render him
ſometimes ſo obſcure, that even his contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
complained, that he was in ſome places ſcarce
intelligible to his readers. But <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> who
deſcribed his life, hath writ in his defence, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56273:19"/>
he affected obſcurity, and rendered himſelf pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
not intelligible, that he might be onely
underſtood by the learned: yet this obſcurity is
not found in the narratives of things done, or in
the deſcription of places, or of battels, in all
which he is moſt perſpicuous, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
of him. In the Characters of mens humours,
and manners, and applying them to affairs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
it is almoſt impoſſible, not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
to ordinary capacities, in what words ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
one deliver his mind. It therefore <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi>
in his Orations, or in the deſcription of a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or other thing of that kind, be not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
underſtood; it is of thoſe onely that cannot
penetrate into the nature of ſuch things, and
not from his intricacy of expreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
has great advantages over <hi>Thucydides,</hi> in the
choice of the Subjects whereof they both treated;
for the extent of the matter treated of by the <hi>firſt,</hi>
is more diffuſed; and therefore ſeems more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
then that of the latter. His aim is to
relare all the moſt memorable things, done by
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> during the ſpace of
two or three hundred years, which comprehends
ſo many great actions, ſo various, and worthy to
be known, that the relation of them cannot but
be grateful to the reader. Whereas <hi>Thucydides</hi>
hath ſhut himſelf up, almoſt to the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and twenty years, which is not only a very
narrow compaſs; but alſo the moſt unfortunate,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56273:19"/>
he could chuſe in all the Greek Hiſtory: which
contains few memorable actions, and thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to have been recorded to poſterity. The
ſame <hi>Dionyſius</hi> finds much fault with the order,
<hi>Thucydides</hi> uſes in the diſtribution of his matter,
repreſenting, by half years, all that happened in
divers places; without mingling the ſucceſſes
of the Winter, with thoſe of the Summer, ſo
that he is found to leave things imperfect, to
paſs to others, which make the memory of the
former loſt, when he proceeds to continue the
Hiſtory to the following half year. And <hi>Monſieur
de la Mothe le Vayer,</hi> our Author, improves this
reflection of <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> certainly (ſaies he) there
is nothing troubles the mind more than this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption;
and he never reaps any profit from an
Hiſtorical narration, who doth not end the things
he treats of, till he has jumbled together an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of actions. This is good (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
he) in nothing but Romances, where this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
is purpoſely uſed to render their faults leſs
apparent; but truth loves to ſhew it ſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and intire, which <hi>Herodotus</hi> knew how to
practiſe incomparably better than any one. He
never leaves an event, till he has repreſented it
as far as it extends, and when he has fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the curioſity of his Reader, he paſſes ſo
well to other ſucceſſes; or as the Rhetoricians
ſay, uſes ſuch due and fit tranſitions, that the
mind is carried on, not only without reſiſtance,
but even with pleaſure and tranſport. But Mr.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56273:20"/>
                  <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who has more curiouſly than any, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Hiſtory of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> very fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
theſe objections: To the firſt he ſaies, that
the principal and moſt neceſſary office of him
that will write a Hiſtory, is to take ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
as is both within his power well to
handle, and profitable to poſterity that ſhall read
it: which he ſaies <hi>Thucydides</hi> hath done better
then <hi>Herodotus.</hi> For <hi>Herodotus</hi> undertook to write
of thoſe things, of which it was impoſſible for
him to know the truth: but <hi>Thucydides</hi> writeth
of one War, the beginning and concluſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was certainly able to inform himſelf: and
by propounding in his proem the miſeries of it,
he ſhews it was a great War, and worthy not to
be conceal'd from poſterity; for men profit more
by looking at adverſe events, than on thoſe that
are proſperous.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, namely the order of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he ſaies, whoever ſhall read the Hiſtory of
<hi>Thucydides</hi> attentively, ſhall more diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of every action this way, than the other: and
the method is more natural; for as much as his
purpoſe being to write of one <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War,
he hath this way incorporated all the parts thereof
into one body, ſo that there is unity in the whole;
and the ſeveral narations are conceived only as
parts of that. Whereas the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> way he had but
ſowed together many little Hiſtories, and left the
<hi>Peloponnſian</hi> War (which he took for his Subject)
in a manner unwritten; for neither any part, nor
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56273:20"/>
the whole, could juſtly have carried ſuch a
Title.</p>
               <p>The ſame Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who mentions many
other objections of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> againſt <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
and fully and learnedly anſwers them; does ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
him for his cenſures, as done rather to
purchaſe glory to himſelf in the action, than
to inſtruct Mankind. For having firſt preferred
<hi>Herodotus:</hi> his Country-man a <hi>Halycarnaſſean,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> who was accounted, even by
himſelf, the beſt of all Hiſtorians that ever writ:
and then, conceiving that his own Hiſtory
might be thought, not inferior to that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi>
by this computation, he ſaw the honour
of the beſt <hi>Hiſtoriographer</hi> falling on himſelf;
wherein he hath manifeſtly miſreckoned in the
opinion of all the learned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> has the advantage, of having firſt
thought upon the animation of Hiſtory, that
was before a body languiſhing; which appears
in his exact Orations, compoſed in all the three
ſorts of Oratory; the <hi>demonstrative,</hi> the <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi>
and the <hi>Judicial: Herodotus</hi> had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame thing; but he was content to uſe
ſome <hi>oblique</hi> ſpeeches, and thoſe almoſt ever
imperfect, never proceeding ſo far as <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
who, in this way of writing, left nothing to
be objected againſt by the ſevereſt Orators. And
it is ſaid that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was ſo well pleaſed
with his Hiſtory, that he took the pains to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it Eight times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56273:21"/>
By the conſent of all he has the glory of not
mingling Fables, with his true Narrations. If
he is conſtrained to ſay a word of <hi>Tereus</hi> King
of <hi>Thrace;</hi> and <hi>Progne</hi> in his <hi>Second Book:</hi> or if
in deſcribing <hi>Sicily,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Sixth,</hi>
he finds himſelf obliged to ſpeak of the <hi>Cyclops,</hi>
and <hi>Laestrigones,</hi> as Ancient Inhabitants of a part
thereof, it is ſo lightly: that the Dogs of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
touch not ſo haſtily the water of <hi>Nilus,</hi>
whoſe Crocodiles they fear, as he paſſes nimbly
over a fabulous circumſtance, to avoid the leaſt
entrance of a lye into his writings. And yet he
has not been ſo happy, to be without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
of not having alwaies ſpoken truth: for
<hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms that he was taxed of having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified
his Hiſtory in many places: but at the ſame
time he accuſes all the Grecians of impoſture;
and if one obſerves the commendation, he gives
him afterwards, of having been the moſt exact,
and cautious of all his Country-men, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling
a Hiſtory; it will appear, rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the capricious humour of his Sect,
than the demerit of an <hi>Hiſtoriographer:</hi> for as
he was a Jew, who made it his buſineſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcredit
all Pagan Hiſtory, he thought he ought
to ſay ſomething, to the prejudice of <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
when he had ſpared none of the reſt. I ſhall
add here, that <hi>Thucydides</hi> did not onely lay down
in his Hiſtory all ſorts of Orations, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved; but took the liberty to inſert
Dialogues, as that betwixt the <hi>Athenian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56273:21"/>
and the Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Melos,</hi>
which comprehends a great part of the fifth
Book to the end. But thoſe, that have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to digreſſions, have no reaſon to hare them
in this Authour, who touches them with great
Art; as amongſt others the conſpiracy of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modius,</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtogiton,</hi> in the ſixth Book, which
may juſtifie many other excurſions, or like Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that are often cenſured with two little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and notwithſtanding all his defects, the moſt
judicious of the learned yeild him the prize of
Eloquence: and not one of the Ancients deny
him the glory, of having ſeconded <hi>Pindar,</hi> in the
Grandeur and Majeſty of expreſſion.</p>

                  <hi>XENOPHON</hi> does not owe the fame,
he has had ſo many Ages, to Hiſtory
alone; for Philoſophy and Arms have
contributed to it: and I believe that, for theſe
three Qualifications, he may be as well termed<note n="*" place="margin">Ter Maximus: For <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> was ſo called, becauſe he was a King, a Prieſt, and a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</note>

language, and of that hony-like ſweetneſs, which
the Graces ſeem to have poured on it, with their
own hands, (to ſpeak like <hi>Quintilian</hi>) but it is
a particular mark of his Attick Dialect, wherein
he excelled ſo much, that <hi>Diogenos Laertius,</hi>
writing his life, gives no other reaſon for the bad
intelligence, that was between him, and <hi>Plato,</hi>
than the jealouſie they conceived, one againſt the
other, upon that account. Yet <hi>Marcellinus,</hi>
who attributes to <hi>Thucydides,</hi> in his Elogy, the
height of Eloquence, gives the loweſt rank to
<hi>Xenophon,</hi> placing <hi>Herodotus</hi> between both: and
<hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> when he obſerves that
<hi>Xenophon</hi> has often imitated <hi>Herodotus,</hi> adds, that
the former was alwaies much inferiour to the
latter.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, it is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that <hi>Xenophon</hi> was the firſt Philoſopher,
who applied himſelf to the compiling of a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which, in what relates to the Graecian affairs,
treats of the Tranſactions of eight and forty years;
and begins where <hi>Thucydides</hi> ended: ſhewing
<hi>Aleibiades</hi> his return to his Country, whom
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> in his laſt Book, left meditating upon
that retreat. Nor is it a ſmall glory to <hi>Xenophon;</hi>
but a proof of extraordinary Honeſty, to have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expoſed, to the publick, the writings of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi>
which he might have ſuppreſt, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
as his own, if he would have been a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary,
and have aſcribed, to himſelf, the works
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56273:23"/>
of another, which many others have done, and
do daily practiſe. Beſides the continuation of the
Hiſtory begun by <hi>Thucydides, Xenophon</hi> has left
us, that of the enterpriſe of young <hi>Cyrus,</hi> againſt
his brother <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and the memorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
of ten thouſand Graecians, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities

               <p>
                  <hi>Xenophon</hi> has writ upon divers Subjects; and
it ſeems that, in many of them, there has been
Emulation, between him and <hi>Plato,</hi> for they both
compoſed, a defence of <hi>Socrates;</hi> and many other
moral, and politick Treatiſes, according to the
obſervation of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s life, without

ſo many Dialogues by them expoſed, in

will have it, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> repreſented, in very
lively colours, the defects of one <hi>Menon a Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalian,</hi>
in the end of the Second Book of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his

and of one <hi>Dares</hi> a Phrygian: and that it
was tranſlated, out of Greek, into Latin, by
<hi>Cornelius Nepos;</hi> when the Stile bewraies, that
he never thought upon the work; for it has
nothing of that inimitable purity, and eloquence,
which appears, in his lives of the <hi>Greek Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and in that of <hi>Atticus,</hi> writ by the ſame
Author: ſuch impoſtures are offenſive, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be too much dereſted, by the Lovers of
truth. And yet ſome there are, ſo led away by
their affection for Fables, that they feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſuch trifles, and ſo build upon
thoſe idle foundations; as thereby to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others, to impoſe the like chears upon
Mankind. We have lately ſeen, the Itinerary of
<hi>Alexander Geraldin,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi>
who pretends, to have found, over all <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
on this, and the other ſide of the Line,
Roman Inſcriptions, and Antiquities of ſuch
value; that all others, which the reſt of the Earth
affords, would be deſpicable, if the worſt of
his were true: But it is obſervable, that none
before, or after him, ever ſaw them: nor is
there any Schollar, ſo unexperienced in this ſort
of reading, that cannot eaſily diſcover, the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of his obſervations, ſo unlikely they are.
Is it not a great impertinence to raiſe pillars, to
teſtifie the Conqueſt, and abſolute dominion
of the Romans, in places, where apparently,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56273:24"/>
none of them ever ſet foot: and in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

The ſame judgment is to be made, of
thoſe <hi>Hetruſcian</hi> or <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Antiquities, which
we have of a freſher date, from one <hi>Inghira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius;</hi>
whoſe impudence is unpardonable, for

it were not unfit to have puniſhments eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,

UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
POLYBIUS.</head>
               <p>AS <hi>Xenophon</hi> was the firſt Philoſopher, that
applied himſelf to write Hiſtories, ſo <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi>
has the advantage to have given us
the moſt conſiderable one extant: and made it
appear, more clearly, than any other Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
that Hiſtory is, as it were, the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
of Philoſophy;<note place="margin">Diod. Sic. initio lib. 1.</note> to uſe the tearms of the
Hiſtorian, of whom we ſhall write, in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
following. But what is ſaid of <hi>Polybius,</hi>
might be more reaſonably admitted, if the whole
body of his works, were now extant, of which
only the leaſt part remains; ſince of fourty
Books, which he compoſed, there are, but the
five firſt, entire; with the Epitomy of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
twelve, which is continued, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Eighteenth. Many are of opinion,
that this Epitomy was writ, by the great aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56273:26"/>
of Roman Liberty, <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> becauſe
it is known, that he delighted, in nothing, ſo
much as in reading Hiſtory, being a man, ſo
difficult to pleaſe, that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s works did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
him, and therefore he imployed his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
in Epitomiſing the Hiſtory of <hi>Polybius,</hi>
finding therein, beſides that inſtruction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it abounded, the conſolation, he needed,
in the laſt, and moſt unfortunate daies of his
life. The Subject of this Hiſtory, were all the
moſt conſiderable actions in the world, from
the beginning of the ſecond Punick War, to the
end of that, which terminated the differences, of
the Romans, with the Macedonian Kings, by the
utter ruine of their Monarchy. This includes
the ſpace of Three and Fifty years, the events
of which, <hi>Polybius</hi> ſhewed, in the laſt Eight and
Thirty Books: for the Two firſt, are not ſo much
of the body of his Hiſtory, as they ſerve for a
preparative, in a ſummary narration, of the taking
of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the <hi>Gaules,</hi> under the conduct of
<hi>Brannus,</hi> and of that which followed, until the
firſt year, of the ſecond War, againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
But though the affairs, of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, were much more exactly deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him; than the reſt of thoſe, that writ of
that Subject; becauſe his chief aim was to omit
nothing, that might give a perfect information
of them: yet he neglected not alſo to repreſent
the concerns, of all the other powers of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
unſolding the intereſts, of the Kings of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56273:26"/>
                  <hi>Syria, Egypt, Macedon, Pontus, Cappadocia,</hi>
and <hi>Perſia,</hi> with thoſe of all the different
Dynaſties, which were then in Greece. And
therefore he gave, the name of Catholick or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal,
to his Hiſtory, as informing us of the
deſtinies of all the Nations of the Earth: there
being ſcarce any at that time which had not
ſome difference with, or dependance on the
Romans. He received, at his Birth, great gifts
from Nature, which favoured his enterpriſe:
and that chance of fortune, which made him
come to Rome, was no ſmall advantage to him;
ſince he is indebted to it, not only for the beſt
part of his learning, but the important friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
he contracted with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi>
which contributed much to the celebration of
his Hiſtory, to poſterity. But the pains, he took
in the acquiſition of all, that could put him in
a capacity of writing it well, and labouring for
eternity, ſeems worthy to be conſidered. He
thought it was required of a good Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
to have ſeen the beſt part of thoſe things
he related,<note place="margin">A. Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Noct.</note> according to the Erymologie of the
name, given by the Grecians, to that profeſſion.
He knew the errors,<note place="margin">Att. l. 5. c. 18.</note> which the ignorance of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
made <hi>Timeas</hi> commit: for he reproached
him, in his Twelfth Book, that having truſted,
to the reports of others, and not travelled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he might be proved guilty of many errors.
And poſſibly having learned the Latin Tongue,
with great care, he remembred the expreſſions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56273:27"/>
which <hi>Plautus</hi> (who lived an Age before him)
makes <hi>Meſſenio</hi> ſay to <hi>Menechmus,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

               </q>
               <p>So much they, at that time, thought travel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to an Hiſtoriographer, who could make
no exact deſcription, nor be confident of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of his memorials, from whatſoever place
he ſhould have them, if he had not rectified
them, by his own ſight, viewing himſelf the
Countries, he intended to treat of. <hi>Polybius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
therefore, to know exactly many places,
as well of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> whether
he went purpoſely, to be aſſured of what he
might write of them. And he uſed <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to procure Veſſels, fit to Sail on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick
Ocean, judging that, what he ſhould
there obſerve might prove uſeful to his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is certain, that he paſſed the Alps, and
one part of the Gaules, to repreſent truly <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi>
paſſage into <hi>Italy,</hi> and fearing to omit the
leaſt circumſtance, of the ſame <hi>Scipio</hi>'s actions,
he travelled all over Spain, and ſtopt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
at new <hi>Carthage,</hi> that he might carefully
ſtudy the ſcituation of it. But now we are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,
the famous Subverter of Carthage, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio
Aemilianus</hi> Grand Son, by adoption, of <hi>Scipio
Africanus</hi> (who vanquiſhed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after he
had compelled him to leave <hi>Italy</hi>) it may not be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56273:27"/>
improper to inſert, what <hi>Polybius</hi> himſelf left
in writing, concerning the ſtrict friendſhip, which
was between them two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall borrow the diſcourſe
of it, from a fragment of his one and thirtieth
Book, taken from the Collections, of <hi>Conſtantinus
Porphyrogennetus,</hi> under the Title, of Vice, and
Vertue; he tells in that place, that this recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
affection had its riſe, from the pleaſure they
took together, to talk of books, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them one to another. This was the reaſon
why <hi>Scipio</hi> emploied all his own, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Fabius</hi> his credit, to obtain leave for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi>
to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the other Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(which were ſent for, as well as he, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as Hoſtages) were diſtributed through all
the reſt of the Cities in <hi>Italy.</hi> One day, when
they had Dined all. Three together, <hi>Scipio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone with <hi>Polybius,</hi> after dinner (bluſhing
a little) complained to him, that he alwaies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
his ſpeech at Table to his Brother. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
ſaid he, you do it, becauſe you ſee me leſs
active than he; and that I am careleſs to ſeek
fame by publick pleading,<note place="margin">A cuſtome in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility.</note> in which the Youth
of this City employ their time, and by this
meaſure, you, and many others of my friends,
may conceive amiſs of me, which will be no ſmall
trouble to me. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſoon perceived the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
jealouſie of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was not full
Eighteen years old, and aſſuring him, of the
eſteem he had of his perſon, as one moſt worthy
to bear the many illuſtrious names, which his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56273:28"/>
Predeceſſors had left him, he excuſed himſelf,
in reſpect of <hi>Fabius,</hi> to whom, he ſaid, being the
eldeſt, civility often required him to direct his
diſcourſe, which he praied him not to apprehend
amiſs in him: and after this little expoſtulation,
which was followed by a mutual proteſtation of
good will, <hi>Scipio</hi> never received any one, into
ſucſt a ſtrict of Cordial familiarity, <hi>Lelius</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as he did <hi>Polybius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought the circumſtances of this conference,
between Two ſuch great men, ſo much the more
conſiderable, beſides that thereby we make ſome
diſcovery of their Genius, which alwaies appears,
more in a private diſcourſe, than in any the moſt
ſerious actions, that I may, by this inſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the impertinence of a modern Writer, who
had the impudence, to make many injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on <hi>Polybius.</hi> It is one <hi>Sebaſtian Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
that treating of Hiſtory, and declaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
digreſſions, took occaſion, to condemn
thoſe of <hi>Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> indecently calling
them, baſe conditioned Fellows, and men, ſprung
out of the dregs of the People. And the more to
defame the latter, he particularly adds, that he
was a meer pedant, given to <hi>Scipio,</hi> to ſerve him,
in the Quality of a Preceptor. But this is too
malicious, to paſs without an anſwer, on <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
his account, deferring, what may be ſaid
in behalf of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> till we treat of the Latin
Hiſtorians. None that converſe with Books can
be ignorant, that <hi>Polybius</hi> was of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56273:28"/>
City in <hi>Arcadia:</hi> and that he was Son, of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cortas,</hi>
General of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> which was the
moſt puiſſant Republick then in <hi>Greece.</hi> That
great State ſent them, both Father and Son, in
Quality of Ambaſſadors, to King <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Epiphanes;</hi> and the Son had afterwards
the ſame Honour, when he was deputed, to go
to the Roman Conſul, which made War upon
King <hi>Perſeus</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> His Birth then was very
illuſtrious, contrary to what was ſaid, by <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and it is not probable, that a perſon, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in the affairs of State, and accuſtomed
to great emploiments, as <hi>Polybius</hi> was, ſhould be
known to <hi>Scipio,</hi> for no other purpoſe, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
him in the Rudiments of Grammar. Nor
has any, but this detractor, had ſo lewd an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of him. All the Ancients, who writ of
<hi>Polybius,</hi> have done it, with great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many of them eſteemed <hi>Scipio,</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, than his choice of ſo faithful a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,
and his carrying him with him, in all his
military expeditions.<note place="margin">Cicer. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Cato</hi> reproached a Roman
Conſul,<note place="margin">Tuſc. quae.</note> for having had a Poet, amongſt thoſe of
his train, when he went to viſit a Province, out
of <hi>Italy.</hi> I will not ſay, he ſhewed in that too
much of the Philoſophical ſeverity, of which he
made profeſſion; though it is ſaid, that he would
himſelf, ſometimes, quit that humour, when he
feaſted with his friends: but it is certain, that
no man ever found fault, with the choice, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
made, of the perſon of <hi>Polybius,</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56273:29"/>
him, for he was neither conſidered as a Poet:
nor meer Grammarian, if to be ſuch may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
faults, the fragment we quoted is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
enough, to aſſure us of the contrary, in
purſuance indeed of the diſcourſe he uſed, to
pleaſe <hi>Scipio,</hi> he added, that neither his Brother
<hi>Fabius;</hi> nor he, ſhould ever want inſtructors, in
what related to letters, which he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
enough ſay, conſidering the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of learned men, which came daily to <hi>Rome,</hi>
from all parts of <hi>Greece:</hi> and in further compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with him, that no man ſhould be more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or induſtrious, than he, to improve his
thoughts to things worthy of his Birth, and what
might be expected from a ſucceſſor of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>'s
and <hi>Aemylii.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netus ut ſupra.</note> After this conference, ſaies
my Author, <hi>Polybius</hi> was hardly ever out of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>'s
company, who communicated to him his
moſt important affairs, and made uſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
in all the occurrences of the great emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had. But who can be ſafe from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
of detractors, when there will be found,
ſome that vilifie this great Hiſtorian, though he
was honored, in Inſcriptions, and Statues, by
his Country-men, who beſt knew his Quality
(as may be ſeen in <hi>Pauſanias</hi>) to acknowledge
thereby,<note place="margin">In Arcad.</note> the eſteem they had of his benefits and
rare merit.</p>
               <p>There might perhaps be more reaſon, to lay
to his charge, as ſome have done, his not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been religious enough, in his devotion to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56273:29"/>
the Deity; for though he ſpeaks, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
very advantagiouſly of the worſhip of the
Gods; as when he attributes all the glory of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi>
his Country, to the great care they had,
to ſerve the Altars: and elſe here profeſſes,
that he abhors the outragiouſneſs of War, that
cauſes the deſtruction of Temples, which he
makes to be a moſt capital crime. Yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
ſo formally, in another place, againſt the
Divinity, and all thoſe, which in his time, held
the opinion, of the pains of Hell, that it appears
evidently, he believed nothing thereof. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of his Sixth Book, he obſerves, that
ſuperſtition, which was accounted a vice by all
other Nations, paſt for a Vertue, among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
If one could, ſaies he, compoſe a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
only of wiſe and vertuous men; all thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
opinions, of Gods, and Hell, would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſuperfluous: But ſince there is no State,
where the people are not (as we ſee them) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
to all ſorts of irregularities, and evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
one muſt, to bridle them, make uſe of thoſe
imaginary fears, that our Religion imprints, and
the panick terrors of the other world, which the
Ancients have ſo prudently introduced to
this end that they cannot be contradicted now
by any but raſh perſons, or thoſe who are not
well in their Wits. Let them who defend <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
in every thing (as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> has done) ſay
what they pleaſe, on his behalf, they can never
make him paſs (after ſo formal a Declaration)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56273:30"/>
for a man, very zealous in the Religion of his
time. They would, perhaps, do him better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to ſpeak of him, as of a Soul, illuminated
by Heaven, in the darkneſs of Paganiſm: and
who believing, but in one <hi>Principle,</hi> or only Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
laughed at all thoſe, which the Idolatry
then reigning, made to be adored, as well as at
the <hi>Elyſian Fields, Gerberus,</hi> and <hi>Rhadamantus,</hi>
which were repreſented to thoſe Proſelites. Thus,
in my opinion, he may be beſt acquitted (if it
be poſſible) of the crime of impiety, putting
him, in the rank of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi>
whom, St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> more charitably, than perhaps
truly, maintains to be Chriſtians, long before
Chriſtianity.</p>

it is credible, by one of the Letters, which
<hi>Cicero</hi> writ to <hi>Lucceius,</hi> that he made a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Treatiſe of the War of <hi>Numantia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Macr.</note> His great
Age furniſhed him with the convenience to write
much, ſince we underſtand, from <hi>Lucian,</hi> that
he paſſed the great Climacterical year, and died
not, till he was Eighty two years old, about Two
Hundred and Thirty years, before <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
himſelf, that the advice of <hi>Lelius,</hi> which
he often required in their ordinary conferences,
and the memorials, which that great perſon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him withal; were very advantagious to
him. But, as to his manner of writing, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
agree not, that he ought to be accounted,
eloquent. <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> the moſt ſtrict
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56273:30"/>
and auſtere critick among them, names him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite,
and reproaches him with negligence, both
in the choice of words, and ſtructure or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his periods. His excellency is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
ſuch, in all other things, that one ought
to think, that he neglected words, as of little
importance, to tie himſelf entirely, to things
more ſerious. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> is not thought very
ingenious,<note place="margin">Voſſius de hiſt. graetis c. 19.</note> to give him only the commendation,
of a Writer not to be deſpiſed, ſince whole books
of his, are ſeen tranſcribed, word for word, in
his <hi>Decades.</hi> It is ſure, we have no Hiſtorian,
of whom one may learn more, in matter of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and civil prudence, than of <hi>Polybius.</hi>
He does not think a ſimple narration ſufficient,
but moves pathetically; and inſtructs no leſs like
a Philoſopher, than an Hiſtorian. <hi>Patritius</hi> is
miſtaken, to reprehend him for that method of
writing, without conſidering the affinity, which
has alwaies been, between Hiſtory, and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
which is ſuch, that the former, has been
often defined to be, a Philoſophy filled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
Perhaps, a meer Commentator is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable,
when he acts the Philoſopher too
much, and ſtretches ſo far that way; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid of one, that undertakes to write a juſt
Hiſtory. We learn from <hi>Suidas,</hi> that one <hi>Scylax</hi>
(whom he confounds, with a certain Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
of that name) made an invective againſt
<hi>Polybius,</hi> which was not, poſſibly, more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than the cenſure of the forementioned <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56273:31"/>
I cannot alſo be reconciled to thoſe, who are
ſcandaliſed, that he called, one of the Capes or
Promontories of <hi>Sicily, Pelorus,</hi> long before that
name was impoſed on it. For, treating of the firſt
Punick War, he calls the place, <hi>Pelorus,</hi> where
that innocent <hi>Pilot</hi> was interred, whom <hi>Hannibal</hi>
ſlew, long after, ſo unjuſtly, and which gave,
it's name of <hi>Pelorus,</hi> to the Promontory now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Capo di Faro</hi> (if this Etymologie, which is
combated by the learned <hi>Cluverius,</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.)
However it is a way of ſpeaking, which
the Compilers of the holy Scriptures practiſed
when it was neceſſary to make a thing better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
He is, it may be, not excuſable, for
having, contrary to the truth of Hiſtory, flatter'd
his <hi>Scipio,</hi> to that degree, as to make him exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
a memorable example of continency, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the fair Spaniſh Captive, with whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
he was ſo taken, that he could never
reſolve to reſtore her. <hi>Valerius Antias</hi> is he, who
charges him with this crime,<note place="margin">L. 6. Noct.</note> in <hi>Aulus Gellius;</hi>
which ſeems to me ſo much the more ſtrange;<note place="margin">Act. c. 8.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Polybius</hi> compared Hiſtory (which has not
truth for a Guide) to an Animal,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. hiſt.</note> whoſe Eies
are put out, and he pretended, after <hi>Timaeus,</hi> to
render truth,<note place="margin">Tr. of Hiſt. upon Sand.</note> as eſſential to an Hiſtory, as recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to a Rule; in which reſemblance, he may
be reaſonably contradicted, as I remember, I have
done in another work. The great affection, he had
for <hi>Scipio,</hi> puts me in mind of the excellent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
he gave him, that whenſoever he went abroad,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56273:31"/>
he ſhould never return to his Houſe, till he had
firſt endeavoured, to gain the friendſhip of ſome
particular perſon, by obliging him all the waies,
that lay in his power. And although this was a
very uſeful advice, to him that received it, I
mention it, in this place, to ſhew the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
which appeared, in him that gave it. We
are indebted, to <hi>Pope Nicolus the Fifth,</hi> that great
friend of the Muſes, and reſtorer of letters, for
the firſt publication of the Works of <hi>Polybius,</hi>
at that time, when the Turks invaded <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
though they are much augmented ſince in

               <p>
                  <hi>CLUVERIUS,</hi> one of the moſt exact of
our modern Geographers, teaches us that
<hi>Agyrium</hi> (of which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>
ſpeaks, as of the place of his birth) is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>San Filippo d' Agyrone.</hi> It is a great honor
to this little place, to have given to its Iſle
ſuch a perſon, without whom no body would
know its Antiquity; nor many things which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it very conſiderable. He ſaies in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Hiſtory (which ſtands inſtead of a
preface to it) that he was no leſs than Thirty
years in writing it,<note place="margin">Rome.</note> in the Capital City of the
World, where he gathered Notions, which he
could not have elſewhere; confeſſing that the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56273:32"/>
vaſtneſs of the Roman Empire had extreamly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
his deſign. But nevertheleſs he did not
omit to go himſelf, through the greateſt part, of
the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> where he was
in many dangers, and endured extream labour,
that he might not commit the faults, which he
had remarked (as he ſaies) in thoſe, who had
medled to ſpeak of places, where they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been. It does not appear in that place, that
he ſaw <hi>Affrick,</hi> and yet we read in the ſecond
Section of his <hi>firſt Book,</hi> that he travelled to
Aegypt, in the raign of that <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who is
diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, by the Surname of
new <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and who was the
firſt Husband of his Siſter <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> whereby
one may note, that the beſt part of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was
formerly, of <hi>Aſia,</hi> when the Geographers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it, from <hi>Affrica,</hi> rather by the <hi>Nile,</hi> than
the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not without reaſon, that <hi>Diodorus</hi> gave
his work, the name of an <hi>Hiſtorical Library,</hi>
ſince, when it was intire, it had united in one,
according to the order of times, all that which
other Hiſtorians have writ ſeparately: for he had
compriſed in Forty Books, whereof we have but
Fifteen remaining, the moſt remarkable paſſages
in the World, during the ſpace of Eleven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Eight and Thirty years, without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what was comprehended, in his <hi>ſix firſt books</hi>
of the more fabulous times, that is to ſay, of
all which had preceded the War of <hi>Troy.</hi> His
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56273:33"/>
Hiſtory is then truly, Oecumenical or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
and we ought, ſo much the more, to bewail
what is wanting, ſince, after the loſs of <hi>Beroſus,
Theopompus, Ephorus, Philiſtius, Calliſthenes, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi>
and ſuch other great Authors, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Diodorus</hi> alone, repaired in ſome manner
our dammage, having compiled, and digeſted
all their works, in his <hi>Library.</hi> Of the <hi>Six firſt
Books</hi> before mentioned, the <hi>laſt</hi> is no where
to be found, although <hi>Raphael Volaterranus,</hi> and
ſome others, quote it ſometimes, as if we had
it yet. But if one obſerves exactly, it will be
found, that they miſreckon in their account;
and that what they report to be in the <hi>Sixth,</hi> is
in the precedent <hi>Book,</hi> which <hi>Diodorus</hi> names,
the <hi>Inſular,</hi> and which is only the <hi>Fifth.</hi> The
error proceeds from the firſt impreſſion, which
was all <hi>Latin,</hi> and wherein <hi>Poggius Florentinus,</hi>
Author of the tranſlation, which <hi>Pope Nicolaus
Quintus</hi> deſired of him, made Two Books of the

ſtretches from the time in which the firſt ended,
to that of the Conqueſts of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi>
when he made <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Brittiſh
Ocean,</hi> the limits of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> on the
North ſide. The marvellous ſucceſſes of all this
interval, were deſcribed in <hi>Three and Twenty
Books;</hi> but there remains no more, than the
<hi>Eighteenth,</hi> the <hi>Nineteenth,</hi> and the <hi>Twentieth,</hi> to
our time: the others unto the <hi>Fortieth</hi> being all
loſt, except ſome ſmall fragments, taken from
<hi>Euſebius, Photius,</hi> and ſome others, who uſed
<hi>Diodorus</hi> his Text, in their works. <hi>Henricus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi>
affirms, out of a Letter communicated to
him by Mr <hi>Lazaro Baif,</hi> that all the works of
<hi>Diodorus</hi> are found entire, in ſome corner of
<hi>Sicily.</hi> I confeſs I would willingly go, almoſt
to the end of the World, if I thought to find
there ſo great a Treaſure. And I ſhall envy thoſe,
that will come after us, this important diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
if it ſhall be made, when we ſhall be
no more, and that inſtead of <hi>Fifteen Books</hi> only,
which we now enjoy, they ſhall poſſeſs the whole
<hi>Forty.</hi>

Since <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> which
he does in more than one place, and alwaies
with an attribute of ſome <hi>Divinity,</hi> as it is the
cuſtome of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> he cannot be more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
than he; which is about Forty Eight years,
before the <hi>Nativity of Chriſt.</hi> But when <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
writes in his <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that <hi>Diodorus Sieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
lived under this <hi>Emperour,</hi> it ſeems that he
limits the life of the <hi>former,</hi> with the reign of
the <hi>latter.</hi> Yet <hi>Suidas</hi> prolongs his daies even to
<hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And <hi>Scaliger</hi> very well obſerves, in
his animadverſions upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that <hi>Diodorus</hi>
muſt needs have lived to a very great Age, and
that he was alive at leaſt half the Reign of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
ſince he mentions, on the ſubject of the
<hi>Olympiads,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad annum Num. 1567.</note> the Romans <hi>Biſſextil</hi> year, which
name was not uſed, before the <hi>Faſts,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar</hi>
were corrected, which was done by <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Auguſtus,</hi> to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke the work of his <hi>Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi>
more perfect. We have at this time, in the
laſt impreſſion of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> a Fragment of his
Seven and Thirtieth Book, which would remove
all this difficulty, if it were true: for in it is
ſeen the death of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> revenged by the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat,</hi>
on <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> with the fall
of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in
the Empire, for all his life. This would infer
that <hi>Diodorus</hi> lived longer, than <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> But
that collection, which is ſomewhat larger in <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
ſhews by thoſe whom he calls Illuſtrious,
by a Title unknown in the Age of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56273:34"/>
another was the Author of it, or that his Text
has received additions from ſome one, who
lived long after his time, whence conſequently
we cannot make any certain concluſion.</p>
               <p>The time of theſe Two Emperors <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is indeed the Age of the beſt <hi>Latin,</hi> as
all, who underſtand it, agree: but not ſo of
<hi>Greek;</hi> becauſe, even in their time, the <hi>Athenian</hi>
Eloquence was already transferred to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
that faculty, which delights in command, had
quitted the vanquiſhed, to follow the fortune
of the victorious, taking their habit, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
It is no wonder then, that <hi>Diodorus</hi> is not
equal, in this reſpect, to <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi>
or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> bing a <hi>Sicilian</hi> onely, and having,
added to that, the diſadvantage to write in ſuch
a ſeaſon. <hi>Photins</hi> nevertheleſs does not forbear
to praiſe his Stile, as being very clear, unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and very proper for his Subject, which is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
It is (ſaies he) neither too <hi>Attick,</hi> nor
too full of Ancient words. His manner of writing
has a juſt mediocrity, between the moſt high
Stile, and the other, which the School calls hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and creeping, for its lowneſs, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
avoided by <hi>Diodorus.</hi> There is certainly
more reaſon to credit,<note place="margin">Photius Meth. hiſt. c. 5.</note> that learned <hi>Patriarch</hi> of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who was a moſt exact critick in his
Tongue, than <hi>John Bodin,</hi> who though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
Greek much leſs, ventures to give a quite
contrary judgment, and reprehend the words,
as well as the Stile of <hi>Diodorus;</hi> as if a ſtranger,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56273:35"/>
at this day, could ſay any thing worthy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in that matter, after what has been ſaid
by the Ancients, and contrary to the opinion of
thoſe, to whom Greek was a maternal language.</p>
               <p>Nor is there more heed to be taken,<note place="margin">5. diſc. de trad.</note> to the
invective of <hi>Lodovicus Vives,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> againſt
<hi>Diodorus,</hi> than to that of <hi>Bodin,</hi> the <hi>French man.</hi>
The laſt blames even the expreſſions, and words:
the firſt arraigns the body of his Hiſtory, and the
things whereof his narration is compoſed. If we
believe <hi>Vives,</hi> there is nothing more vain, than
the <hi>Hiſtorical Library,</hi> of our <hi>Sicilian;</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>
was much to blame, in his opinion, to ſay in his
<hi>Preface,</hi> that <hi>Diodorus,</hi> was the firſt of the Greeks,
who ſpoke ſeriouſly, and abſtained from writing
trifles, I know, the Authority of this accuſer, is
not ſmall, he being very learned, in reſpect of
his Age, and one of the ornaments of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
neither am I ignorant that others beſides
him, as <hi>Pighius,</hi> and <hi>Sigonius,</hi> complained of
the faults, which <hi>Diodorus</hi> committed in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie,
for having followed bad computations.
And I conſider that <hi>Vives,</hi> having commented,
on the Books of St <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
in them,<note place="margin">Cap. 40.</note> how that great Doctor of the
Church, laughed at the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who ſaid, that
they had Records, in their Books, a hundred
thouſand years old, to which <hi>Diodorus</hi> his Text
is not repugnant: nay he goes farther than this,
when he makes mention,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> of the great knowledg
of Heavenly things, which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56273:35"/>
acquired, who bragged that they had made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
upon them, for the ſpace of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſeventy and two thouſand years, before the
conqueſts, of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> He
had already ſaid,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reckoned,
ſome Ten, and others of them, Three and twenty
thouſand years, from <hi>Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> to the ſame
<hi>Alexander:</hi> and that their firſt Kings, who were
Gods, did each of them Reign, no leſs than
Twelve Hundred years. This is doubtleſs that
account, which <hi>Vives</hi> could not ſuffer, and which
provoked him, to declare ſo highly, againſt <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
who will not allow him, to have been
praiſed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> for any other thing, than the
Title of his Hiſtory, which is indeed, neither
improper, nor ridiculous, as many of thoſe were,
which the other Grecians ordinarily gave to their
Books.</p>
               <p>But if that may be ſaid to be the onely occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which moved <hi>Pliny,</hi> to pronounce this fair
Elogy, of our <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> (viz.) <hi>Primus apud Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos
deſciit nugari Diodorus,</hi> yet it was alwaies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
interpreted, to extend to his whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and it is a kind of injuſtice to affirm,
as <hi>Vives</hi> did, that there is nothing more vain, not
leſs ſolid, than his Hiſtory. As for the Egyptian
Ephemerides, and the Aſtronomical calculations,
of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> they are inferted, onely to ſhew
what was the common belief of thoſe people,
not arguing, that he gave any credit to them. He
is ſo far from it, that he ſaies expreſsly, in his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56273:36"/>
Second Book, that he cannot poſſibly acquieſe,
to what the <hi>Colledge of Chaldeans</hi> had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
of the long ſpace of time, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
the Victories of <hi>Alexander.</hi> I am ſo far
from condemning the Fables, and excellent My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology,
in the <hi>Five firſt Books of Diodorus,</hi> that
in my opinion, we have nothing more precious,
in all that remains of Antiquity: for beſides that
Fables may be told ſeriouſly, and that <hi>Plato's
Timaeus,</hi> with ſeveral other works of very great
conſideration, ſhould be rejected, if they were
abſolutely unneceſſary, it is to be ſaid of theſe,
that they teach us, the whole Theology of the
Idolaters. And if it were lawful, to give a Holy
name, to a profane thing, I might call the <hi>Five</hi>
forementioned <hi>Books,</hi> the <hi>Bible of Paganiſm,</hi> ſince
they teach us at the firſt ſight, what the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
believed of Eternity, and the Creation of the
World: and the birth of the firſt men, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
afterwards deſcribed, according to the pure
Light of Nature; So that they repreſent to us
ſo well, all the Theogony of the Egyptians,
whence that of the Greeks drew its Original,
that without <hi>Diodorus,</hi> we ſhould be ignorant,
of what is moſt curious, in that ſort of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Nevertheleſs he is not the firſt Infidel,
that began his Hiſtory, with the Original of all
things, as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Creation of
the World.<note place="margin">The name, or inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Hiſtory.</note> For he himſelf teaches us, in the
<hi>fifth Book,</hi> of his <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> that, <hi>Anaximenes</hi> of
<hi>Lampſacum,</hi> had not writ the firſt of any (as ſome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56273:36"/>
have ill tranſlated it) but the firſt Hiſtory of
Greece; becauſe he took it from the birth of the
Gods, and the infamy of Mankind (to ſpeak
like him) continuing it to the famous battel of
<hi>Mantinea,</hi> and the glorious death of <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi>
however ſince our evil deſtiny would not
permit the others labours to come to us; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we cannot, at this day, have too great an
eſteem for thoſe of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> which it hath not
envied us, nor too much retort the injurious
cenſure of <hi>Vives,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>But in this we do no more, than follow, the
opinion of moſt men of letters, not onely <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paraen. ad Gr.</note>
but even <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo. <hi>Jnſtin Martyr</hi>
calls <hi>Diodorus,</hi> in ſeveral places, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned,
and eſteemed, of all the Greek Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:
and proves by his writings, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Antiqnity, of the <hi>Great Law giver</hi> of
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and when he would inſinuate, that
<hi>Homer</hi> had learned, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the moſt refined
things, he put into his Poeſy, he uſes for it the
Authority of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> whom he does not name
without praiſe. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> goes beyond <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
Martyr,</hi> both in Titles of Honour, and in
citations of paſſages, drawn from our <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi>
with which he fills, all the books of his <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
preparation.</hi> And when he treats, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, and of what the Ancients
believed, of the Sun, and Moon, and of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had, to Sacrifice
men, and of infinite other Subjects, which fall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56273:37"/>
into his principal deſign, he alwaies alledges
<hi>Diodorus,</hi> but he does it chiefly, when he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins
the Theology of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> in his
<hi>Second Book,</hi> where he very much extols the
fame of him: he calls him a moſt illuſtrious
Writer, moſt exact in his Narrations, and one
eſteem'd by all learned men for his profound
doctrine, and he adds, that there is no Grecian,
who is not deſirous to read him, by a common
approbation, and preference to the reſt of their
Authors. But when he inſiſts in his <hi>Tenth Book</hi>
of the ſame work, that Greece had received,
from the hands of thoſe it eſteemed barbarous,
and particularly from the Jews, all the Sciences
and learning, for which it had ſo great a value;
it is in that he attributes the greateſt Honour
to him. For after having uſed the Teſtimonies
of St <hi>Clement, Porphyrius, Plato, Democritus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,
Joſephus,</hi> and ſuch like Authors, of the
firſt Claſſe, he finiſhes his proof with a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
out of the firſt Book of that incomparable
Hiſtory: <hi>to the end (ſaies he) that the Authority
of</hi> Diodorus, <hi>may be as a Seal, to all my demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>
To ſay the truth, he has a marvellous
advantage given him by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to be cited,
and put expreſsly after the reſt, to ſhew how
much he is eſteemed by him: in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as Archirects place that Stone laſt, which
is called the Key of the Arch, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
no leſs to the ſolidity, than the ornament
of the whole Edifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56273:37"/>
This is that, which I purpoſed to add to the
ſuffrages of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Photius,</hi> in favour of our
<hi>Historian,</hi> for fear that the ill terms, which
<hi>Bodin,</hi> and <hi>Vives,</hi> uſed againſt him, ſhould be
prejudicial to his fame. If I had reaſon to blame
him, it ſhould be much rather, for the great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
in which he abounds, in all his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as well as <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi>
than for his bad Greek, or for having handled
his ſubject ill, whereof thoſe indecent Criticks
accuſe him, there being no reaſon to diminiſh
his reputation, in that regard.</p>

UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
DIONYSIUS
HALICARNASSEUS.</head>
               <p>IF <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> had not ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in the beginning of his Hiſtory, that he
lived in the <hi>Emperor Auguſtus</hi> his time (in
whoſe Regin our <hi>Saviour</hi> was born) <hi>Strabo</hi> would
teach it us, in the <hi>Fourteenth Book</hi> of his <hi>Georgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
where ſpeaking of the City of <hi>Halicarnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
he obſerves that it beſtowed on the world,
Two great perſons, <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and in our time
(ſaies he) <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Hiſtoriographer. So that
ſince <hi>Strabo</hi> witneſſes, in that ſame work, that
he had it in hand, under <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
we are certain, that <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi>
was alſo of the ſame <hi>Age,</hi> which is, as all
know, one of thoſe, which moſt favored learning,
and learned men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56273:38"/>
                  <hi>Suidas</hi> names among many Writers, who bore
the name of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> another beſides him, we
ſpeak of, who was of <hi>Halicarnaſſus</hi> alſo, and of
his Poſterity; and appeared, under the Emperor
<hi>Adrian,</hi> with the Surname of <hi>Muſicus,</hi> becauſe
though he was an Orator, his principal Talent
lay in Muſick, of which he compoſed many Books;
and among others, one wherein he interpreted
all the places, of <hi>Plato's Republick,</hi> which could
not be well underſtood, without a particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of that Art. That which makes me
ſay, that this other <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was deſcended
from the firſt, is, that the ſame <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaies,
that from <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> came one <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi>
(whom he calls) <hi>Atticiſta,</hi> who lived
under <hi>Adrian,</hi> and had writ a Lexicon of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
words, as may be ſeen in the Hundred and
Two and Fiftieth Section of <hi>Photius.</hi> For my
part, I am eaſily perſwaded, that this <hi>Atticiſt,</hi>
and <hi>Muſitian,</hi> are but one, ſince they are both
mentioned to be under one <hi>Emperor.</hi> As for our
<hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> a little after <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
had happily finiſhed the Civil Wars, and
ſojourned there Two and Twenty whole years,
learning the Latine Tongue, and making his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of neceſſaries to the deſign, he had of
writing his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>He read to this end all Books, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Commentaries and Annals, made by thoſe
Romans, who had writ with ſome reputation,
about the concerns of their State, as old <hi>Cato,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56273:39"/>
Pabius Maximus, Valerius Antias, Licinius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
and ſome others. But acknowledges, that
the converſation he had with the worthy men,
of that <hi>Capital City</hi> of the world, and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
with an infinite number of learned men
there, were not leſs ſervicable to him, than all
the other diligence he could uſe. His Hiſtory
was of the <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in Twenty Books, whereof there remains
no more, than the firſt Eleven, to this Age,
which conclude with the time, when the Conſuls
reſumed the chief Authority in the Republick,
after the government of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> which
happened, Three Hundred and Twelve years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi> The whole work
comprehended much more; for it paſſed from the
taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> over the fabulous, and Hiſtorical
time, to the beginning of the firſt <hi>Punick War;</hi>
ending where <hi>Polybius</hi> beings his Hiſtory, near
Two Hundred years later, than what we even
now mentioned.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, it behoves us to obſerve the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of <hi>Sigiſmond Gelenius,</hi> who imagined that
<hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> whom he has tranſlated
very well, never ended his work, and that death
hindered him from compoſing above <hi>Eleven Books,</hi>
of the <hi>Twenty,</hi> he promiſed to give to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
When <hi>Stephanus,</hi> a Greek Author, who
writ of Cities, quotes the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> and <hi>Twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Book,</hi> of the <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> of our <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius:</hi>
and <hi>Photius</hi> ſaies, in his <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56273:39"/>
he read all the <hi>Twenty Books,</hi> giving the <hi>laſt</hi> the
ſame ending, which we aſſigned unto it.</p>
               <p>This learned <hi>Patriarch</hi> aſſures us alſo,<note place="margin">Photius.</note> that he
ſaw the <hi>compendium,</hi> or <hi>ſynopſis,</hi> which <hi>Dionyſius</hi>
made of his own Hiſtory, which he reduced into
Five Books, with much Eloquence, but it was
not agreeable to a Reader, becauſe of the ſtrict
Retrenchment of all he thought not abſolutely
neceſſary. The loſs of that Epitomy would be
leſs ſenſible, if we had the firſt compoſition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
which has received ſo much approbation,
eſpecially in reſpect of the calculation of times,
and what relates to Chronology, that all Criticks
prefer, in this point, <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Titus Livius.</hi> And <hi>Scaliger</hi> confeſſes, in his
<hi>Animadverſions</hi> upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that we have no
Author remaining, who has ſo well kept the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of years.</p>
               <p>As for his Stile, <hi>Photius</hi> conſiders it, as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and new, but accompanied with a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
which renders it delightful: and he adds,
that the Elegancy of his diſcourſe or phraſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
and ſoftens all the roughneſs which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found in his ſpeech. He commends him
alſo very much, for having underſtood how to
uſe many digreſſions, which retain, and recreate
the mind of the Reader, when the evenneſs of
an Hiſtorical narration, begins to be redious and
weariſom to him.</p>
               <p>And certainly it is not to be imagined, that
a man of that reputation, which <hi>Dionyſius Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſeus</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56273:40"/>
had acquired in learning, could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any thing, which was not very polite, and
worthy of his name. We have his <hi>compoſitions of
Rhetorick;</hi> and the moſt ſubtle Criticks place
him, in the firſt rank of thoſe who delighted
in that ſort of ſtudy: and though there were
no more to be ſaid of him, than the requeſt that
was made him, by <hi>Pompey the Great,</hi> to give
him his judgment, on the firſt Greek Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and eſpecially on <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon;</hi>
it ſhews ſufficiently the eſteem, wherein he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his time, and of what Authority he was
in <hi>Rome,</hi> among the learned; when <hi>Pompey</hi> choſe
him, out of ſo many others, to inform him
therein.</p>
               <p>If there be any thing which may be found fault
with, either in that letter, which he addreſſes
to <hi>Ammaea,</hi> and <hi>Tubero,</hi> or in others upon the
ſame matter, it is that he was too exact, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
therein, giving Laws to Eloqueuce, ſo full
of ſeverity, that they take from it, one of the
beſt parts, which is the generous liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it has alwaies made profeſſion. In effect he
often ſtraightens that noble Art ſo much, that he
deprives it, almoſt of all its reality, and reduces
it to a ſimple <hi>Idea,</hi> without hopes that it can
be practiſed by any one, for the future: ſo that
one may ſay, according to the ſtrictneſs of his
Maxims, there was never any perfect Hiſtorian,
nor true Orator. If one ſtudies his precepts of
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> upon all the ſorts of Oration, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56273:40"/>
of the Ancients, wherein he ſhews what
one ought to imitate in them, and what to avoid;
with his other Treatiſe, made to inſtruct us how
to examin their Writings; the truth of what
I have ſaid will appear, and the Spleen of this
Critick will be diſcovered, who found fault
with the Stile of <hi>Plato.</hi> This was one of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of a letter, which <hi>Pompey</hi> taking <hi>Plato</hi>'s
parr, writ to him. And we ſee by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his
anſwer, that although to content <hi>Pompey,</hi> he
profeſſes himſelf, an admirer of <hi>Plato,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears
not to prefer <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to him, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it was onely to give the whole advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the latter, that he exerciſed his cenſure,
againſt the former. Nevertheleſs it appears, that
at another ſeaſon he ſpared his <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> no
more than the reſt, ſo prone was his inclination
to carping: becauſe after he had conceived things
in the higheſt perfection, he pretended to find
nothing, which was not far beneath them, and
which did not conſequently diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p>But ſince it is not our intention to conſider
him here, ſo much an Orator, as an Hiſtorian,
Let us be content to make ſome obſervations,
on his <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> to be acquainted with
his judgment, concerning the principal matters
of Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>We have already ſeen, that he was no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to digreſſions, when we ſaid, that <hi>Photius</hi>
drew one of the greateſt cauſes to praiſe him,
from his making ſuch good uſe of them. And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56273:41"/>
that which he makes, in his Seventh Book, to
deſcribe the whole courſe of the Tyranny; of
<hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Mollis,</hi> ſhews that he
thought them, one of the Ornaments of Hiſtory.
The long Orations of <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> and <hi>Metius
Suffetius</hi> in the <hi>Third Book,</hi> with others of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Tullius</hi> which are in the <hi>Fourth,</hi> make it alſo
appear ſufficiently, that he did not condemn, as
ſome have done, all ſort of direct Orations;
though he has elſewhere blamed the bad ones.
He is not content, in his <hi>Fifth Book,</hi> to praiſe
P. <hi>Valerius Publicola,</hi> but takes occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
to preſcribe it to Hiſtorians, not to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the brave and glorious actions of illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men, in their Hiſtories, without making
their particular and Domeſtick virtues appear,
accompanied with their merited praiſes: which
is directly contrary to the opinion of thoſe, who
would have them refrain, from all things that
may excite the paſſions, leaſt they thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Province of an Orator. In the ſame
<hi>Book,</hi> on the Subject, of the Conſpiracy of the
<hi>Tarquins,</hi> detected, and ſeverely puniſhed, by
the <hi>Conſul Sulpitius,</hi> he delivers another impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
precept, to thoſe who write Hiſtory, not
to ſet down barely, in their narratives, the iſſue
of things, but to repreſent them alwaies, joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their cauſes, and the means which were
uſed to make them ſucceed, not forgetting the
leaſt circumſtances; nay to penetrate, if it be
poſſible, into the Counſels of the firſt Authors,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56273:41"/>
and thoſe who had the greateſt ſhare in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
But though <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<hi>Theopompus,</hi> for having emploied ſome
compariſons to no purpoſe, he does not judge
them to be all faulty, for he makes uſe of them
ſometimes, and of thoſe Parallels, or affinities of
actions, which many cannot endure. Thus, on the
Subject of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who to anſwer the Servant
of his Son,<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> beat down in his preſence, the heads
of thoſe Poppies, which were higher than the
reſt: he remarks, that <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> had practiſed
the ſame thing, towards <hi>Periander,</hi> pulling up,
before his Meſſenger, thoſe Ears of Corn, which

and abſolute power of the Roman Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
he obſerves, that this Magiſtracy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
inſtituted, in imitation of the Greeks:
becauſe the Inhabitants of <hi>Mitylene,</hi>

ſome hint, not to believe it; as he might have
done perhaps, if it would have been permitted.
But there is not a worſe Relation, in the Roman
Hiſtory, than the action of <hi>Cloelia,</hi> as he repreſents
it. He reports, that this <hi>Roman Virgin,</hi> who was
given in hoſtage, with many others, to <hi>Porſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of the <hi>Hetruſcians,</hi> returned with all her
companions, from the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Camp, into the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſwimming over the <hi>River Tiber,</hi>
wherein they had ask'd leave to bath themſelves;
as if it were poſſible, that fearful Women, and
who had not learned to Swim, durſt but look
upon ſuch a River, with deſign to paſs it, and
caſt themſelves deſperately into it, without any
neceſſity, the peace being almoſt then concluded.
For though <hi>Plutarch</hi> deſcribes the place, in the
life of <hi>Publicola,</hi> ſo very agreeable, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to bath in, yet he acknowledges, that the
River was very Rapid, and deep. I confeſs <hi>Livy</hi>
writes with no more likelyhood,<note place="margin">Dec. 1. l. 2.</note> when he tells
the ſame ſtory; and that Plutarch does no more
than doubt, of that of <hi>Cloelia,</hi> who, as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
paſſed the <hi>Tiber,</hi> by her ſelf, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56273:42"/>
thereby encouraging the reſt of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
to Swim over it. Nevertheleſs I dare
ſay, that the report of <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> has
much more appearance of truth in it, than what
the others related, though he was leſs obliged
than they, to follow it ſtrictly, ſince he was not
an Hiſtorian, and his Subject ingaged him onely,
to enrich (and if we may ſay ſo) to illuſtrate,
with fine colours, ſuch memorable actions. He
writes that <hi>Cloelia,</hi> under the favour of a dark
Night, eſcaped from the Enemies Camp, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a Horſe, which bare her, to the other ſide
of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> amongſt her friends: and the Statue
<hi>Equeſtris</hi> which was raiſed to her, and which they
all mention, would even force them to be of this
opinion, if they had not rather choſe to follow
the moſt popular rumour, and that which rendered
their narration more agreeable, becauſe it ſeemed
extraordinary, and marvellous; wherein, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
incredible, how much the greater part of
Hiſtorians tranſgreſs.</p>
               <p>I will not forget, for a Corollary, to what is
above expreſſed, that by the conſent of all learned
men, <hi>Dionyſius Halicarneſſeus</hi> unfolds the <hi>Roman
Antiquities,</hi> not onely in reſpect of time, as before
mentioned, but alſo in what relates to matter,
much better, than any of the Latin Hiſtorians
have done. For his being a ſtranger, was ſo far
from being prejudicial to him, that upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
he made it his buſineſs, to obſerve an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number, of the moſt curious particulars, of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56273:43"/>
the Roman State, that are found in his Books,
and which we do not learn, in their own Authors;
either becauſe they neglected to write, that which
was familiar to them, which they thought, all
the World knew; as well as themſelves; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Grecian was more careful, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
than they, to ſeek after that, which might
beſt conduce, to make all the circumſtances of
their affairs, known to Poſterity. And it is a
great glory to him, to have ſurpaſſed them all in
things, wherein they ought to have had ſuch
great advantage over him.</p>

to make uſe of it, or the Latin, to be underſtood
by the Grecians and Romans, for whom princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
in his Prologue to the Judaick War, he
declares that he ſet Pen to Paper. Few are ignorant,
that thoſe Nations had no eſteem, for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew

pieces writ by <hi>Joſephus.</hi> As for the Treatiſe
of his life, he compoſed it in imitation of many
great Men, who had done the like thing before
him, and have been imitated by many others.
For paſſing by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who alone, filled with
the Spirit of God, writ not onely his Life, but
Death; it is known, that a little before <hi>Joſephus,</hi>
the Emperors <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi>
were pleaſed to leave the platform of their lives
to Poſterity, traced with their own Pens: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina</hi>
Mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> did no leſs, as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
reports. And private perſons ſuch as <hi>Sylla, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
Rutilius Rufus, Aemilius Scaurus,</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus
Damaſcenus,</hi> had already practiſed that ſort
of writing. If we muſt mention others who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
themſelves therein, ſince <hi>Joſephus,</hi> we
ſhall name in the firſt place the Emperors <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,
Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>Severus;</hi> ſecondly,
to draw nearer to theſe Times,<note place="margin">Aegyptii op. inter Peluſium &amp; Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</note> 
                  <hi>James King</hi> of
<hi>Arragon, Maximilian</hi> the firſt, the <hi>Abbot Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius,
Cardanus,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus de Thou,</hi> who
have all written Books of their own Lives.</p>
               <p>But there is no ſmall difference at this day,
between learned Men, touching the credit <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
his Hiſtory ought to have amongſt us. For
if we refer our ſelves to <hi>Maldonat, Melchior
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56273:46"/>
Canus, Pererius, Salmeron, Baronius, Salian</hi>
and ſome others, we ſhould have no value for
all his labour, which they defame as full of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachroniſms
in the Calculation of times, and
Fables in the Narration of things. <hi>Baronius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, rebukes him very ſeverely in his
Preface which he calls <hi>Apparatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad. Ann. Chr. 58. Cap. 158.</note> &amp;c. and in
many other places of his <hi>Annals,</hi> nay he proceeds
ſo far as to impute to him that he knew not
juſtly his own Age, and that he was miſtaken in
it by ſix whole years. But if on the other ſide
we yeild to the judgment of his <hi>Partiſans,</hi> ſuch
as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calviſius,</hi> of whoſe Party are
<hi>Justin Martyr, Euſebius, St. Hierome, Suidas,</hi>
and ſeveral other Ancients, we ſhall be obliged
to place him in the rank of the beſt Hiſtorians
which remain. And truly when I conſider with
what recommendation <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſpoke of him, I am
not eaſily induced to condemn him ſo abſolutely
as many doe. He ſtiles him many times an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
wiſe Hiſtoriographer, and joyning him
with <hi>Philo,</hi> he ſaies they are Two Perſons

in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that <hi>Joſephus</hi>

rehearſes that place of the Jewiſh Antiquities,
which makes ſuch expreſs mention of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
As for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> after he had placed <hi>Jeſophus</hi>
amongſt the Eccleſiaſtical Writers, he confirms
the favours he received from <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and the honour that was done him by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Books into the Publick Library, and
raiſing a Statue to him in <hi>Rome.</hi> He quotes alſo
his forementioned Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And
in one of his Epiſtles, he did not forbear to name
him the <hi>Graecian Livy,</hi> which ſhews the great
valew he had for his Hiſtory. <hi>Suidas</hi> recites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the ſame things which he could ſee
in <hi>Juſtin, Euſebius,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> and he gives
him particularly the Quality of a Lover of truth,
which is much to be conſidered in his caſe. I
wonder not therefore after theſe Teſtimonies, if
many will take <hi>Joſephus</hi> his part, againſt thoſe
who endeavoured utterly to diſcredit him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<hi>Scaliger</hi> was a little too forward, when
he named him in a Preface to a Book intituled
<hi>the correction of Times,</hi> in one place the moſt

further that the integrity and learning of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
ſhowing it ſelf in every thing, he ſhall
not be backward to aſſert boldly, that not onely
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56273:47"/>
in what relates to the Jewiſh affairs, but in all
others alſo, it is more fit and ſure for one to refer
himſelf unto this Hebrew, than to all the reſt of the
Greek and Latin Authors. I would not proceed
to ſo determinate a judgment; yet I think one
may ſafely ſay that abating what may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Sacred Texts of the Old and New
Teſtament, <hi>Joſephus</hi> is for the reſt, an Hiſtorian
of great Authority, and one that merits a great
deference, eſpecially in the things of his own
time; wherof he writes as an Eie-witneſs: for
we ought I think in charity to make that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
of what ſo many Chriſtians have often
uttered in his Commendation.</p>
               <p>Although that paſſage of <hi>Joſephus</hi> concerning
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the primitive times of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was quoted, as we have already ſhown, in
<hi>Euſebius</hi> his time, and ſince by Great men, it is
ſuſpected by many others, who think it foiſted or

pious frauds, which they pretend to have been
ſometimes uſed in favour of Religion.<note place="margin">Ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to give ſuch a glorious Teſtimony of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
without a Divine impulſion, which poſſibly
might force him to it: nevertheleſs he allows
this paſſage as we have it now, to be incorrect,
and that other to be more like truth as it was
received in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, where <hi>Joſephus</hi>
does not affirm that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the expected
<hi>Chriſt, Chriſtus hic erat,</hi> but onely that he was
believed to be ſo, <hi>&amp; credebatur eſſe Chriſtus.</hi>
There is cauſe to wonder how it happened,<note place="margin">Sect. 47. 76. et 238.</note> that
<hi>Photius</hi> never remembred ſo notable a paſſage in
Three different Sections wherein he examins
this Author. The chief thing is, that thoſe Ages
are paſt, in which the Authority of <hi>Joſephus</hi> was
ſo important to the eſtabliſhment of the Church:
yet they that will make uſe of it in this, either
againſt the Jews, or otherwiſe, may well do it
after ſo many Fathers, whoſe opinions it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
allowed to follow.</p>
               <p>But we ought to take heed of the omiſſions
of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which tend to the ſuppreſſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Evangelical truths. For though he made no
mention of the coming of the Wiſe men into
<hi>Judaea,</hi> no more than the Maſſacre of the young
Innocents, ſpoke of by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mathew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> it does not
follow that we ſhould doubt ever ſo little of that
which we read of it in the Hiſtory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Truly it is very ſtrange that <hi>Joſephus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de bello Jud. cap. 21.</note> who
pardoned <hi>Herod</hi> nothing, who remembred well
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56273:48"/>
how that Tyrant had burned or cut the Throats
of a great number of young men, with their
teachers, for having beat down the Roman Eagle
from the Gate of the Temple of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
and who has ſo expreſsly ſhown us all the other
crimes of the ſame man,<note place="margin">Ib. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> namely in that Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Jews, ſpoke at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt his memory
in the preſence of the Emperor; that this <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi>
I ſay, ſhould not have ſaid the leaſt word
of ſo cruel an action, ſo odious, and ſo noiſed
abroad, as the murder of ſo many poor Infants,
put to death by the command of <hi>Herod,</hi> muſt
needs have been. But his forgetfulneſs, or Jewiſh
malice, if he concealed it wittingly, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
truth, nor be alledged againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Sacred Texts, and that, of a Pagan
alſo ſuch as <hi>Maerobius,</hi> which is expreſs for that,
in the Second Book of his <hi>Saturnals,</hi> where he
rehearſes <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his words, to this effect;
<hi>That it was better to be one of</hi> Herods <hi>Swine than
his Child. Joſephus</hi> moreover has writ many
things in his Antiquities quite contrary to what
<hi>Moſes</hi> has done, in which he cannot be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without impiety. As for the reſt, it cannot
be denied that he taught as many fine curioſities
of the Hiſtory of his Country, which we ſhould
be ignorant of without him, who has delivered
them very well to us, though it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that he did not alwaies agree with his
Country-man <hi>Philo</hi> in his relations.</p>
               <p>That which ought to recommend his Hiſtory
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56273:49"/>
very much unto us, is, that beſides the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he had by his extraction, ſince knowledg
and the Prieſthood were in a ſtrict union amongſt
the Jews, he was ſo well inſtructed in learning
from his moſt tender years, that at the Age of
Fourteen, as he writes, the chief Prelates and
Principal men of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> asked his Counſel
in the greateſt difficulties of the Law. At Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years old he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of
what was particular to each of the Three Sects,
which were current in his Country, the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſean,</hi>
the <hi>Saducean,</hi> and the other which was
called the <hi>Eſſenian;</hi> whoſe profeſſors were very
Auſtere and ſolitary in their way of life. One
of them called <hi>Banus,</hi> lived in the Deſert; as
the ſtricteſt <hi>Hermits</hi> of this time, his food was
of Fruit and Herbs, covering himſelf with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but leaves, or barks of Trees, and waſhing
his Body Night and Day in cold Water againſt
the temptation of the fleſh. <hi>Joſephus</hi> paſſed Three
years with this Anchorite, which ended, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
himſelf again to a civil life, and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
profeſſion of following the <hi>Phariſean</hi> Sect,
which he maintains to be very like unto the
Stoick, that has been ſo much valued by the
Greeks and Latins. It is certain that none but
the Phariſees, made publick profeſſion of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and partaked in the government of the
State; ſo that if a <hi>Saducee</hi> was compelled to be
a Magiſtrate, which he alwaies undertook very
unwillingly, the People obliged him to yeild to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56273:49"/>
the opinion of the Phariſees,<note place="margin">Lib. 18. Antiq.</note> and to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Maxims, as may be ſeen in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi>
where he treats of theſe Three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Sects,<note place="margin">Jud. c. 2.</note> and of a Fourth which was
a refinement of the <hi>Phariſean.</hi> Thus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Principals of his Sect, he accepted
the chief emploiments amongſt the Jews ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Peace or War, which gives a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Authority to his Hiſtory; as being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
compoſed of things which he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and actions wherein he had often the greateſt
ſhare.</p>
               <p>We muſt take heed of confounding as <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
has done the falſe <hi>Joſephus,</hi> commonly
called <hi>Joſippus Gorionides</hi> (who alſo made, or
rather falſified, a Hiſtory of the Jewiſh War)
with our Hiſtorian. When this <hi>Pſeudo-Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
in his Third Book placed <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and in his Fifth made <hi>Gallia</hi> to be poſſeſſed
by the <hi>French;</hi> he ſufficiently declared his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,
to have aſpired thereby to paſs
for the true <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in whoſe time there
were neither <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> in
<hi>Gallia.</hi> It is filled throughout with the like
repugnancies, which are ſo plain that nothing
but the credulity of the Jews of theſe laſt
Ages can endure it, whoſe ingenuity alone
conſiſts in cheating themſelves. <hi>Scaliger</hi> takes
this man for a Circumciſed <hi>French</hi> man, who
is not a very ancient Author, or at leaſt has
writ ſince the Sixth Age of our Salvation. But the

UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
ARRIAN.</head>
               <p>IN the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor, and
his two ſucceſſors, <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus
Aurelius Antoninus, Arrian</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi>
began to write his Hiſtory: he lived in the
Hundred and Thirtieth year of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> he was
a Diſciple of <hi>Epictetus.</hi> It is not eaſie to know,
whether his Hiſtory was writ, before his <hi>Enchiridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and thoſe other diſcourſes of his Maſter, which
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> in his Commentaries, aſſures us to
be compoſed by him, for though it might not
be thought, according to the ordinary, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
courſe of mens diſpoſitions, he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf to Philoſophical contemplations, in
the Youthful part of his life, yet it appears, in
the Preface of thoſe diſcourſes, that he writ
them, as they were ſpoken by <hi>Epictetus,</hi> collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his mouth, whilſt he was yet the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56273:51"/>
of that great Philoſopher, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that they were publiſhed without his
privitie, which is a certain evidence, of their
being writ in his younger Age. <hi>Photius</hi> ſaith,
they were formerly in Twelve Books, beſides
certain Philoſophical diſſertations, by him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
which are loſt to this Age.</p>
               <p>As for his Hiſtorical Compoſitions, though
we have not them all intire; by what remains
of them, we may diſcern enough, to oblige us
to value his merit. And his Seven Books, of
the Conqueſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and Eight,
which treat particularly of <hi>India,</hi> may ſuffice to
give him a Rank, amongſt the chiefeſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not inſiſt on the deſcription, which he
hath made of the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, and the Countries
which border on it, nor on that of the <hi>Erythrean</hi>
Sea, which comprehends part of the <hi>Indian</hi> Coaſts,
the <hi>Perſian Gulf,</hi> and the Red Sea, becauſe they
are rather peices, of Geography, than Hiſtory.
<hi>Rhamuſius</hi> obſerves, that many would diſtinguiſh
this <hi>Arrian,</hi> who, in his Eighth Book, deſcribes
the Voyage of <hi>Nearchus,</hi> Admiral to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
from the River <hi>Indus,</hi> to the <hi>Perſian Gulf;</hi> from
him, who is the Author, of <hi>Periplus,</hi> or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Erythrean</hi> Ocean. The difference
of Stile (whereon, thoſe that deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
eſtabliſh their opinion) is but a ſlender
foundation, for all agree (if it muſt be) that
there were Two <hi>Arrians,</hi> that they both lived,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56273:51"/>
in the time of the <hi>Antonines,</hi> and that Prince of
Geographers, <hi>Claudins Ptolemaeus Alexandrinus.</hi>
But that, which the ſame <hi>Rhamuſius</hi> notes on
this occaſion, is very conſiderable. That though
<hi>Arrian</hi> hath often followed, the opinion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus
Tyrius,</hi> whom <hi>Ptolemy</hi> does alwaies reject,
yet it appears, that his is a better, and more juſt
ſituation, of many parts of the Eaſt-Indies, than
that, which <hi>Ptolemy</hi> has left us; as is manifeſt
by many Modern Relations, exhibited thereof,
by the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> It is certain, that <hi>Arrian</hi>'s
merit recommended him ſo much, to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
of his time, that they advanced him, to
the Conſular dignity.</p>
               <p>He was a Native of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a City of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi>
where he made his Studies, and became
a Prieſt, of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> as he himſelf
reports, in thoſe Eight Books, of his <hi>Bithynicks,</hi>
mentioned by <hi>Photius,</hi> which began the Hiſtory
of his Country, at the fabulous times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
it, to the death of the laſt Monarch of
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> who left the <hi>Romans,</hi> to be the Heirs
of his Crown. He pretends to have writ this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, by Divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and that he did it, under the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
and with the like number of
Seven Books, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> choſe, to deſcribe the
Conqueſts of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and ſome obſerve, that he ſo
affected to follow that Author, that he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
imitated him in his Stile, and many other
reſpects, and is therefore called, the Young, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56273:52"/>
the Second <hi>Xenophon.</hi> He declares in his Preface,
that his Relations are by him delivered, on the
faith of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and
<hi>Ptolemaeus Lagus,</hi> who accompanied <hi>Alexander</hi>
in all his Enterpriſes, which were the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
for that, beſides the Royal Quality of the
latter, they did neither of them publiſh their
writings, till after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other obligation, than a real deſire of
diſcovering the truth of his Actions. And yet
our <hi>Author</hi> profeſſes, in his deſcription of the
death of <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> the Philoſopher, that it
was diverſly reported by them, though they
were both near the perſon of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when
the proceſs was made againſt that unfortunate
perſon. <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> ſaies, he was led in Chains
after the Army, till he died of a Sickneſs, and
the other affirms, that, after having been expoſed
to Torture, he was Stangled, for having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
involved in the conſpiracy of <hi>Hermolaus;</hi>
ſo difficult it is, to know the truth of actions
performed: and there is nothing more certain,
than that one and the ſame action is many times
variouſly related by thoſe that ſaw it, becauſe
of the divers reſpects, and intereſts, wherewith
moſt men are preoccupied. But notwithſtanding
theſe particular defects, which <hi>Arrian</hi> could not
redreſs; his Hiſtory is the more eſteemable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> are not
to be found, moreover there are many places, in
the Hiſtory of <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> which have need

                  <hi>Photius</hi> commends <hi>Arrian,</hi> as equal to the beſt
Hiſtorians, his narration is alwaies agreeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is both ſhort, and intelligible: and he
never diſcompoſes his Readers, with tedious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
and ſuch Parentheſes, as may obſcure
the ſenſe of his ſentences. And one cannot eaſily
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56273:53"/>
find, in all his Hiſtory, any one ſuch Miraculous
event, as might render it ſuſpected, if you will
except ſome predictions of <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> and the
ſtory of Two new Springs, which appeared near
the River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Alexander</hi> was there
Encamped.</p>
               <p>The pattern, which <hi>Arrian</hi> propoſed to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate,
permits him not to elevate his Stile, to
a Sublime degree of Oratory; becauſe the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of <hi>Xenophon</hi> is not of that order, but his
Phraſe is mingled with ſuch excellent figures,
that by retaining all the clearneſs, of him that he
imitates, his Stile has nothing in it, either too
flatly low, or too highly Towering. He occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
uſes, ſometies oblique Orations, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
direct ones. And all along, in his Second
Book, he Artificially couches the imperious letter
of <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Darius.</hi> The Oration of <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi>
againſt <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> who would have <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
to be adored, is one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
of thoſe that are direct. And there are Two
others, not inferiour to it, of the ſame Prince
to his Souldiers, which began to mutiny, once in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the other time on the Banks of the
River <hi>Tygris.</hi> Thoſe which were made, before
the Battel, given at the Streights of <hi>Amanus,</hi> and
at the Plain of <hi>Arbela,</hi> or <hi>Gaugamela,</hi> are oblique,
and much more conciſe, than the occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
<hi>Photius</hi> makes a very favourable judgment
of the Hiſtory of <hi>Arrian (viz.</hi>) that whoſoever
ſhall compare it, with the moſt Ancient of thoſe,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56273:53"/>
which are ſo much eſteemed, it will be found,
that there are many things in them, which in no
wiſe approach the valew of the other.</p>
               <p>But yet there is one paſſage, in the middle of
his firſt Book, wherein there is Vanity enough,
to ſtain the whole body of his Hiſtory, if decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
did not oblige us, to conſider it with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
which the beſt of us may ſometimes
need, in reſpect to our own productions; the
place I mean, is, where he declares, that the
greatneſs, and number, of the famous Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> made him enterpriſe the
writing of his Hiſtory, by the aſſurance he had,
of being able to acquit himſelf well therein:
and that without putting his name to it, or
mentioning his extraction, or Quality, he would
have the world to know, he might valew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in all thoſe reſpects: and that having loved
letters from his Infancy, as <hi>Alexander</hi> has merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the chiefeſt Rank, amongſt the Leaders of
Armies; ſo the greateſt, amongſt thoſe that have
enterpriſed the writing of Hiſtory, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injuſtice he denied to him. This impudence
of <hi>Arrian</hi> puts me in mind, of the impertinence
of another Grecian,<note place="margin">Sect. 131.</note> that was contemporary with
him, of whom <hi>Photius</hi> writes, that he dedicated
his compoſition, to the Emperor, <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi>
to get thereby the more credit to it, and
that it might obtain a more favourable reception:
and at his firſt entrance, preparatory to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he pretended, that his Stile ſhould be as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56273:54"/>
Sublime, as the actions of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was
the ſubject of his Book, when, alas! Nothing
was ever lower, and more barren, than his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
nor more weak and faint, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
wherein he expoſed them. It may be
reaſonably believed, that the Ambition of this
pretender equalled in the beginning the vanity
of <hi>Arrian;</hi> but his weak performances made all
his promiſes ridiculous in the end, whereas the
other hath given, to Poſterity, one of the beſt
Hiſtories that Antiquity hath left us; yet he
ought not to paſs without a cenſure, for the fault
he committed, there being ſcarce any thing in
the world more inſupportable than ſelf praiſe;
which, inſtead of the eſteem and reputation that
our merit might juſtly challenge for any worthy
enterpriſe, draws on us nothing but contempt,
and hatred.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Seven Books, before mentioned,
of the expeditions of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and
the Eighth, of ſo much of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> as was
known in his time: He writ, in Ten Books, the
Hiſtory of thoſe actions, which happened amongſt
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Captains, after his death, for they
could not agree about the dividing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
but of thoſe there remains nothing at
this day, but an abridgment of them, which <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
gives us, in his <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> and we have alſo
loſt his <hi>Bithynicks;</hi> and Two other Treatiſes,
One, of the moſt conſiderable actions, performed
by <hi>Timoleon</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Other,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56273:54"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Photius</hi> informs us, that he writ another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
called <hi>the Alanick History:</hi> ſo that many
believe, that which <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> reports, of one
<hi>Arrian</hi> Governour of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Adrian,</hi> who reduced the <hi>Alanians,</hi> and
<hi>Maſſagets,</hi> to the obedience of the Empire, was
meant of our Hiſtorian: it is he alſo, to whom
<hi>Plinius Novocomenſis</hi> addreſſes Seven of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<note place="margin">Voſſius de hiſt. grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, c. 11.</note>

               <p>But one of the greateſt Encomiums that can
be given to any, is that which <hi>Lucian</hi> applies
to him, when he excuſes himſelf for writing the

among the <hi>Muſes,</hi> condeſcended to write the life
of the <hi>Villain Tiliborus.</hi>
               </p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
APPIAN.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>APPIAN</hi> is ſo much the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
amongſt all thoſe that have laboured
in the Roman Hiſtory, in that, beſides
the commendation which <hi>Photius</hi> gives him, to
have, as truly as poſſible, delivered his matter:
He alone has particularly deſcribed their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
according to the Provinces, and different
Regions, wherein they were tranſacted: Not that
he has, in this method, excelled all other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers,
for the moſt Ancient of them have
alwaies followed the order of time, and related
things annually done, in Countries very diſtant,
one from the other.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Appian</hi> ſeems, in ſome things, to
have affected an order, even contrary to Nature,
not obſerved by any of the Ancients, yet it muſt
be acknowledged, that his Method, in general,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56273:56"/>
is very uſeful, to expreſs the things performed
diſtinctly, and ſeparately from each other, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
as to our view, all that paſſed in each
Country, ſo that no way of writing is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive,
and apter, in that reſpect, to conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the mind of the Readers. We learn from <hi>Suidas,</hi>
that his Hiſtory, by an excellency of Title, was
ſometimes termed <hi>Baſilick, or Royal.</hi> And his
Roman Hiſtory (which he writ in Twenty
Four Books,<note place="margin">Voſſias de Hiſtoricis graecit. l. 2. c. 13.</note> from <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the <hi>Taking of Troy,</hi>
to the Foundation of Rome) contains, in the
firſt thereof the Goverment of its Seven Kings, as
may be conjectured by the Text of <hi>Photius.
Florus</hi> his <hi>Epitome</hi> is indeed compoſed of Wars,
and actions ſeperated one from the other;
but <hi>Appian</hi> has repreſented them more intirely,
how long ſoever any of them endured; whereas
the <hi>Other</hi> confounds his relations, in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of them: as in the <hi>Firſt, Second,</hi> and <hi>Third Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Wars,</hi> he ſhuffles together all the affairs of the
<hi>Romans</hi> with the <hi>Gaules, Ligurians, Macedonians;</hi>
and many other People, with whom they had
conteſt, in the interval of thoſe Two ceſſations
of Arms, which happened betwixt the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and them.</p>
               <p>But this favourable judgment of <hi>Photius,</hi> in
<hi>Appians</hi> behalf,<note place="margin">Meth. hiſt. cap. 4.</note> does not reſtrain <hi>Bodin,</hi> from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
both his memory, and judgment in the
matter of his Hiſtory: for this bold Cenſurer
aſſerts, that the Romans did never lend their
Wives one to the other, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56273:56"/>
of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and
imputes therein too much credulity to <hi>Appian:</hi>
Though <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath written the ſame thing,
affirming that <hi>Cato</hi> freely ſent his Wife, to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi>
the Oratour,<note place="margin">In vita Cat. V.</note> to raiſe of her an iſſue to
him: nor is the <hi>Law of Romulus,</hi> or that <hi>againſt
Adulterers,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to this practiſe (as <hi>Bodin</hi> unadviſedly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.)
He taxes him likewiſe, to have made <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
ſay, in his <hi>Second Book of the Civil Wars of
Rome,</hi> certain expreſſions, which were not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, but <hi>Pompey,</hi> in a threatning ſpeech,
which he uſed to the Senate, when he put his
hand on his Sword, and told them, if they would
not grant him the things he deſired, that Sword
ſhould purchaſe them: but this may be aſcribed
to a failure of memory, to which all mankind is
ſubject: as alſo another error, which he notes
of him, in miſtaking <hi>Calphurnia,</hi> for <hi>Pompeia,</hi>
that Wife of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which was vitiated in the
<hi>Temple,</hi> called by the Romans, the <hi>Temple of the
good Goddeſs.</hi> But <hi>Sigonius</hi> is more indecent, who
arraigns him of levity, and many omiſſions,
without alledging any proof or inſtance thereof.
And <hi>Scaliger</hi> is not leſs bold in the cenſure that
he makes of him, in his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on the
Hiſtory of <hi>Euſebins,</hi> where he ſaies, he would
appear to be a Child in the buſineſs of Hiſtory,
were it not that an infinity of matters are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his Treatiſe of the Wars of <hi>Syria.</hi> Yet
though I approve not of theſe reflections; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56273:57"/>
one may truly impure it to him as a fault
in all his works, that he too much flatters the
Romans, alwaies making the right, as well as
the advantage, to be on their ſide, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of all other Nations in the world, with
whom they were concerned, as well as of his
own Native Country. And we may add to this,
that he often attributes to himſelf the labours of
others, tranſcribing many Paragraphs, and intire
Sentences of <hi>Polybius, Plutarch,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
more Antient, and inſerting them in his
Book, without citing their Texts, to render them
that acknowledgment, which is due to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
on ſuch occaſions. And ſome affirm that he in
like manner tranſcribed, the greateſt part of the
Commentaries of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> which contained (as
<hi>Suetonins</hi> relates) the principal actions of his life.
This is indeed a ſort of theft not to be allowed;
<hi>Deprehendi in furto malle, quam mutuum reddere.</hi>
As <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaies to <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> on the ſame ſubject,
and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> on this occaſion, calls him, <hi>alieno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
laborum fucum,</hi> in reſemblance to a certain
ſort of Flies, which nouriſh themſelves with
the honey of others.</p>
               <p>I have read in ſome Author, that the <hi>Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
when they had a purpoſe to honour the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of any well deſerving perſon, by having
his Statue erected in ſome publick place, were
uſed only to take the head from ſome of the old
Statues in their City, and put a new one in the
place of it, of the Figure of him they deſigned
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56273:57"/>
to repreſent. Thoſe that ſteal from the writings
of others, do the ſame thing as thoſe <hi>Rhodians</hi>
did, but in a more ridiculous faſhion, for by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their names to other mens Works, hoping
thereby to acquire honour to themſelves, they
ordinarily, inſtead thereof, reap only ſhame and
contempt, for ſo ſordid a practiſe. This matter
calls to my remembrance an abuſe, which was
put upon <hi>Diomedes,</hi> by his friend <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to
whom he committed the charge, of conveying
his Horſes to the <hi>Olympick games;</hi> for by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the inſcription which belonged to them, and
making them to run in the name of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi>
he took to himſelf the honour of the victory
they acquired, which was not of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
at that time, and to complaet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
was ſo unjuſt to retain them to himſelf,
without ever making reſtitution to <hi>Diomedes,</hi>
who truſted him therewith. What greater treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
can there be in reſpect to letters, than to
aſcribe to our ſelves, the productions of others,
when inſtead of yeilding the glory to thoſe, by
whoſe thoughts we have profited, we would have
thoſe very conceptions paſs, for the pure inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own wit.<note place="margin">Crimen Plagium à Plagis (1) à dolore quo is affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur qui ſurreptus eſt. Cat.</note> The figurative expreſſion

impudent to recite, in a publick Aſſembly in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
certain Verſes ſtoln by them, out of

abuſe; preferring a <hi>Poet,</hi> before them, that was
the leaſt applauded of all the reſt, but one that
had pronounced nothing, in the Aſſembly, that
was not of his own compoſition. <hi>Theocritus</hi> boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

of being not only very faithful (as we hinted
in the beginning) but one of thoſe, that has
given the greateſt Teſtimony, of his knowledg

To read the deſcription of his battels
would make one fancy himſelf in the middle of
them. And he is ſo happy in his <hi>Orations,</hi> that
he manages, and moves the affections, which

le Vayer,</hi> our Author, who in many things ſeems
to me, not ſo exact in his judgment of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer,
as his merit requires, and too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in his reflection, whilſt he makes ſo long a
defamatory digreſſion, againſt thoſe that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
the writings of others in their works, on
occaſion of the mention of his borrowing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in his Hiſtory, from <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
which he makes to be the more unpardonable,
becauſe he cites not, in his Books, the Texts of
thoſe Authors, to render them (as he Phraſes
it) the acknowledgment due to their merit.
And yet he himſelf, even in this Chapter, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
ſome part of his matter from <hi>Voſſius,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
quoting him. But may it not be doubted,
whither this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ever ſaw the <hi>Original
Manuſcript of Appian,</hi> where perhaps thoſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were, to know thereby, whether he or
thoſe that tranſcribed it, are to be blamed for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56273:60"/>
this omiſſion, or indeed whether, in thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, ſuch citations were practiſed: for
though the borrowing of writings from others,
may be ſometimes in ſome circumſtances a great
offence; it is not alwaies to be ſo accounted,
ſince there is not any thing written, that is not
taken from the conceptions of them that went
before: and when we take from others to improve
their reaſon, that it may be derived to us in a
more familiar, refined and exquiſite ſenſe, it is
rather commendable than faulty; as may be ſaid
of that which <hi>Virgil</hi> takes from <hi>Homer,</hi> or to ſpeak
of our time, of what our <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> extracts from
<hi>Catullus, Juvenal, Horace, Plautus,</hi> and other
<hi>Poets,</hi> and from <hi>Tully</hi> alſo, who ſo much improves
their thoughts, that they themſelves, if they were
alive, would not think themſelves diſhonored, by
the uſe he makes of them.</p>
               <p>What our Author mentions of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> which
is alſo hinted by <hi>Voſſius,</hi> of <hi>Appians</hi> being a Child
in Hiſtory, is rather to be imputed to his paſſion,
than right judgment, whoſe cenſures are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to be allowed, eſpecially when they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the more general conſent of the learned in all
Ages. What he ſaies alſo, in the beginning of
this Chapter in one place, that <hi>Appian</hi> ſeems to
have affected an order of writing, even contrary
to Nature, is an opinion, wherein he is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
for <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio</hi> (who had, it

pure, true, religious, and neceſſary; in which he

him write his Hiſtory, who before exerciſed

of which he had compoſed a Book.<note place="margin">Homo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſularis.</note> His Father
<hi>Apronianus</hi> a <hi>Conſular man</hi> (according to the
Phraſe of that Age) was Governor of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
and ſometime after Proconſul of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> He

on him twice, which he exerciſed jointly with

he had paſſed through divers Imployments

had eſtabliſhed him Lieutenant or Governor of
<hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and he ſometime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in <hi>Affrick;</hi> and had afterwards the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> then called
<hi>Pannonia,</hi> committed to him. Theſe things are
convenient to be known, before we ſpeak of his
Writings, becauſe they recommend, and give
the greater Authority to them. His Hiſtory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
all the time from the building of Rome,
to the Reign of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> which he writ
in Eighty Books, divided into Eight <hi>Decades,</hi>
whereof few are ſaved from that unhappy loſs,
which, as we have elſewhere ſhown, has been
fatal to many admirable Works of this nature,
whereof the ignorant and barbarous Ages have
deprived us. At preſent the Five and Thirtieth
Book is the firſt of thoſe that remain intire (for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56273:62"/>
we have but ſome Eclogues or Fragments of the
Four and Thirtieth preceding. His progreſs to
the Sixtieth is intire enough. But inſtead of the
laſt Twenty, we muſt be content with what
<hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> a <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Monk,</hi> has given
us in an Epitome or Compendium of them; for
the Text of thoſe peeces of <hi>Dion</hi> is not to be
found whole, by a misfortune alwaies incident to
Books, that are abbreviated. <hi>Photius</hi> obſerves,
that he writ his <hi>Roman Hiſtory,</hi> as ſome others
had likewiſe done, not from the Foundation of
Rome only, but even from <hi>Aeneas</hi> his Deſcent
into <hi>Italy,</hi> which he continued to the Tyranny

great commands, and finiſhes with the death of
<hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor, the reſt is the Epitome of
<hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Though all that has been loſt of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Author, is much to be regretted, I think
nothing is ſo deplorable, as the loſs of the Forty
laſt years, of which he writ as an Eie-witneſs, and
one that had a part in the government of the
State. For he could not expreſs, what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Empire of <hi>Commodus,</hi> but from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of ſtrangers, and as others had done it
before him. But after that Emperor, until the
other, with whom he had the honor, to be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56273:62"/>
in the Conſulſhip, he built no more upon
the faith of other men; but what he relates,
that deſcends to us, by his <hi>Organ Xiphilinus,</hi> is
no other than what he ſaw himſelf, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was a principal Actour. It is a clear proof
of <hi>Dion</hi>'s prudent conduct, that he could paſs
over ſuch bad times, as thoſe of the Tyrannical
Dominion of <hi>Commodus, Caracalla, Macrinus,</hi>
and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> without loſs of life, goods, or
reputation, which are often in danger under ſuch
Princes, without a wonderful dexterity of Wit.
His was ſo commendable, that after having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thoſe Stormy and Tempeſtuous ſeaſons,
wherein the quality of a ſtranger and his riches
expoſed him to much envy, he arrived happily
at a ſafe Port, to wit the Raign of <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
an exceeding Lover of juſtice, and a moſt
powerful Protector of virtuous men.</p>
               <p>Under him he publiſht the Roman Hiſtory,
to which as he was led by his <hi>Genius,</hi> as we
before hinted, ſo he was commanded by <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius
Severus.</hi> He confeſſes himſelf, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
Ten years, in providing the neceſſary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for this great building, and twelve more
in raiſing it, and adding that Majeſty unto it,
which makes us, even at this day, admire its
diſmembred Fragments and Ruins. A man of
his Quality, who had paſſed all his life in the
management of affairs, and had read men as well
as Books, and of ſuch an experimented conduct,
muſt needs have been a very conſiderable Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56273:63"/>
Nor have any of them revealed ſo much
unto us as he, of thoſe ſtate ſecrets, which <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
Stiles <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and whereof he
makes ſo high a Miſtery. He is ſo exact in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the order of the <hi>Comitia,</hi> the eſtabliſhing
of Magiſtrates, and the uſe of the publick Rights
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that thoſe things are no where

to the Conſecration of Emperors, their
<hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> or inrolling amongſt the number of
the Gods; We may ſay, that he is the only
Writer, who has ſhewn us a good form, except
<hi>Herodian</hi> who coveted afterwards to imitate him
in the ſame Subject. But particularly, in the
Fifty Sixth Book, he is very curious, where he
repreſents the Pomp of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Funerals,
his Bed of State, his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſigies in Wax, and the
Funeral Oration, which <hi>Tiberius</hi> read before the
People, he expoſes after that the manner of the
burning his body, how <hi>Livia</hi> gathered, and laid
up his Bones, finally with what dexterity they
made an Eagle part from the <hi>Funeral Pile,</hi> whence
that <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſeemed to bear the Soul of
the Emperor to Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Funeral Oration before mentioned obliges
me to remark, that <hi>Dion</hi> freely uſed, not only
the Oblique, but the Direct way of Oration alſo
in the body of his Hiſtory. Thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and of <hi>Gabinius</hi> afterwards, in his Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sixth Book, are of the laſt frame. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
diſcourſe of <hi>Philiſcus</hi> to <hi>Cicero,</hi> which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56273:63"/>
is ſeen in the Eight and Thirtieth, to perſwade
him to bear his Exile into <hi>Macedonia</hi> conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is alſo in the form of a <hi>Proſopopaea,</hi> after a
very conſiderable Dialogue between them Two.
The Orations of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> the
firſt of which exhorted <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to quit the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
the Second on the contrary to retain it,
are of the ſame ſort, and contain the whole Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Second Book. And <hi>Xiphilinus</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
in his Abbreviation of the Sixty Second, to
make <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Governor of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſpeak
a direct Oration to his Troops, ready to Engage
with the Britiſh Forces, after he had divided
them into Three different Bodies, but makes
him ſpeak Three ſeparate ones, on the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
to perſwade them to fight couragiouſly,
and thereby to obtain the Victory. By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that they who believe that all ſorts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are indecent in Hiſtory, will not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with <hi>Dio</hi>'s method of writing, for he abſtains
not from thoſe, which are moſt to be avoided,
namely the direct, and has made uſe of Dialogues
alſo. which is contrary to the rules of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in Hiſtory; but if we muſt take notice of
his faults, there are others, which deſerve ſooner
to be complained of, than what we mentioned.
He is accuſed of having taken <hi>Caeſars</hi> part too
much, againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> to accomodate himſelf to
the courſe of Fortune. Nor ſeems he more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in reſpect of <hi>Antonius</hi> his Faction, which he
alwaies favours to the prejudice of that of <hi>Cicero.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56273:64"/>
And whoever reads in the Forty Sixth Book, the
invective of <hi>Q. Fuſius Calenus,</hi> againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Oratour,<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> will be hardly able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
all the injuries, with which it ſeems <hi>Dio</hi>
would have Sullied his reputation. Not content
to make him be reproached, that he was the Son
of a Fuller or Dyer, very often reduced to dreſs
Vines, or cultivate Olive Trees; he aſſaults his
perſon, and touches his honour in all the moſt
ſenſible parts: he renders him ridiculous for his
fearfulneſs: and to blaſt him the more, affirms,
that of all the Orations which were ſeen of his,
he delivered not one of them, after the manner
in which they were writ, and therefore his want
of memory is imputed as a crime to him. But
he makes <hi>Calenus</hi> much more ſevere, He would
have him contented, not to wear the long Robe,
if he had not wanted it to hide his ill-ſhapt
Leggs and Feet. And arraigns his Conjugal Bed,
to expoſe the vice of his Wives, defaming him
to have proſtituted the honour of one of them:
and in the mention of his Children, he accuſes
him of Inceſt with his Daughter; and repreſents
his Son, as an infamous Libertin, Drunk Night
and Day. Certainly, to treat one of the greateſt
perſons of the Roman Republick thus, is rather
like a Satyriſt than an Hiſtorian. But <hi>Dion</hi> does
ſo purſue his diſparagement, that in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Book, he takes a new occaſion to make <hi>Fulvia,</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Antonius,</hi> vomit out abundance of
reproaches againſt his memory, who pierces his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56273:64"/>
Tongue through and through with her Needle.</p>
               <p>He has not been much more reſpectful to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
if the conjectures of ſome men are not

the <hi>Theatre</hi> with him, to make Orations in his

aggravated to that pitch, that the cauſe of the

where the People could no more indure his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,
than <hi>Nero</hi> could ſuffer his Conſpiracies,
from which he had no means to deliver himſelf,
than by putting ſo bad a Maſter to death. But
what we before hinted, that the invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

theſe men (ſince there was no Female amongſt
them, and they begot themſelves) endeavoured
in vain, to bring to life again. In his Fifty Eighth

of the Foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi> In another place he
writes, that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> cured a Blind Man, by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

to its vigour, by walking upon it, they being
both forewarned in a Dream, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this benefit from the Emperor. In another
place he expreſſes, that the famous <hi>Apollonius

find fault with <hi>Dio,</hi> becauſe he was not
favorable to Chriſtianity, I think it not worthy
to be conſidered, ſince he is to be eſteemed as a
<hi>Pagan</hi> Author, who was not like to uphold a
Religion contrary to that which he profeſſed. It
is true that ſpeaking of the victories of <hi>Marcus
Aurelius,</hi> he attributes to the Magick Art, of
one <hi>Arnuphis</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> rather than to the
prayers of the Chriſtians, the miraculous Rain,
which fell in favour of the Romans, and the
ſtrange Tempeſts, which afflicted the Army of
the <hi>Quadi,</hi> whom the learned <hi>Cluverius</hi> takes,
for the preſent <hi>Moravians.</hi> But is it a wonder, in
things ſubject to various interpretations, as are
ordinarily ſuch Prodigies, that <hi>Dio,</hi> an Idolatrous
Hiſtorian, ſhould not give the ſame judgment, as
a believer? And that he ſpake otherwiſe of them,
than <hi>Tertullian, Euſebius, Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and ſome
others have done?</p>

                     </gap>ius,</hi> put into the rank of
the moſt elevated, being extraordinarly raiſed by
the loftineſs of his thoughts. His diſcourſe, ſaies
he, is full of Phraſes, which reſemble the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
conſtruction or Syntaxis, and his expreſſion
anſwers the greatneſs of the matter he treats of.
His periods are often interrupted with Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,
and he uſes many Hyperbates, or tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56273:66"/>
which are very troubleſome when they are
not uſed Artificially after his manner. But one
thing is very remarkable, that though his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is very numerous, and adjuſted according
to Art, yet it appears to be ſo little laboured, that
the Reader does in no wiſe perceive the care that
has been taken in it, becauſe it is ſo clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
that every one preſuppoſes as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
in the compoſition, as there is in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He ſeems to have imitated <hi>Thucydides,</hi> whom
he follows, eſpecially in his Narratives, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:
But he has the advantage over him, not
to be reproached with obſcurity: In all elſe <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
is the pattern, by which he Copies with
all ſort of Circumſpection. This is the judgment
<hi>Photius</hi> gives of him, who is much more credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this point, than <hi>Sigonius,</hi> that to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own, long ſince thought on, accuſes
<hi>Dio</hi> of being too <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> and ſo prolix in his
Orations, that he is troubleſome to his Readers.
The world muſt be left to their liberty of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to the Law of the Romans, <hi>Populo
libera ſunto ſuffragia.</hi> Yet I conceive, for what
relates to language, the ſureſt way is to leave
that to thoſe to whom it is natural, and who have
ſucked it with their milk, rather than to ſtrangers,
who are much more ſubject to be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Dio</hi>'s Hiſtory, and his little Treatiſes
before mentioned, it ſeems that <hi>Suidas</hi> aſcribes
to him, ſome other compoſitions, as the <hi>life</hi> of
the <hi>Philoſopher Arrianus,</hi> the <hi>action</hi> of <hi>Trajan,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56273:66"/>

who was of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and by conſequence of <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

               <p>THE Hiſtory of <hi>Herodian</hi> (as moſt of thoſe
we have already mentioned) receives its
commendation, from the merit of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
He declares at the beginning of his firſt
Book, that he will only write of the affairs of
his own time, which he himſelf hath ſeen,
or underſtood from creditable perſons; for which
he was very competent, becauſe of the publick
imployments that he exerciſed, for he might
juſtly boaſt, to have paſſed through the principal
charges of the State.</p>

us) before he begins to write of the
life of <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> which contains all the
Third Book) that his Hiſtory in general ſhall
comprehend the ſpace of Seventy years, and treat
of the Government of all the Emperors, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56273:67"/>
ſucceeded one another, during that time, that
is, from the Reign of <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

whom he calls <hi>Maximus,</hi> committed on them
by the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Souldiers, to advance the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<hi>Gordianus Junior</hi> to the Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Photius</hi> writes of his Stile, that he has writ in
an Air ſo much the more cleer and agreeable, in
that he has not too much affected the <hi>Attick</hi>
terms; but ſo tempered his Phraſe, that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
is heightned above the lower form of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
and as there is nothing ſuperfluous in his
writings, ſo it cannot be ſaid, that he has omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
things neceſſary or uſeful to be known: and
he adds (to compleat his Elogium of him) that
conſidering all the virtues of an Hiſtorian, there
are few Authors to whom <hi>Herodian</hi> ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p>We have obſerved in the preceding Sections,
that he hath, as well as <hi>Dion Caſſius,</hi> informed
us of the Pagan Ceremonies, uſed at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
of their Emperors. It is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Fourth Book, where he ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
to us all the Funeral honours, rendered
to the Aſhes of <hi>Severus</hi> (which his Children
had tranſported from <hi>England,</hi> in an Alablaſter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56273:68"/>
Cheſt) that it is hard to ſee any where, any
thing more exact, and more inſtructive. He tells
us how they were put into an Urne, with the
general adoration of the Senate and the People,
and carried by the Conſuls to the Temple, where
the Sacred Monuments of their Emperors were
preſerved, and then proceeding to deſcribe the
Funeral Pomp, he informs us, that his Effigies
in Wax, all cloathed in Robes of Gold, was
placed at the Gate of his Palace on an Iv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bed, elevated from the Ground, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
adorned: Where Seven daies together the
Senators clothed in black, and the Roman Ladies
all in White (without any other Ornaments)
came to pay their reſpects, taking their places,
the Women on the right, and the men on the
left ſide of the Bed, all appearing with very
mournful countenances. He obſerves alſo, that
the Phyſitians came duly to viſit this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Emperor, making formal approaches
to the Bed, as if he were alive, and declaring
that his ſickneſs grew daily worſe and worſe; ſo
true it is that this world is a continual Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.<note place="margin">Univerſus Mundus exercet Hiſtoriam, Sea.</note>
After this time was paſſed over, the moſt
conſiderable of the Youth, and the Knights, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the ſame Bed on their ſhoulders, firſt to the
great Market places, where the Magiſtrates of
<hi>Rome</hi> uſed to Surrender their charges; and there
a Chorus of young men on one ſide, and Virgins
on the other, Sung Hymns to the praiſe of the
dead Emperor: from thence they proceeded to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56273:68"/>
the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> which was out of the
Town, where the Bed, and Effigies, were placed
in a large ſquare <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of Wood, reſembling
and elevated,<note place="margin">Pharos vulgo dict.</note> to the height of one of thoſe
<hi>Towers,</hi> upon which Lights are placed on the
Sea Coaſts, to direct Mariners to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Rocky ſhores, whereof he makes ſuch exact
deſcriptions, both as to the exterior and interior
Ornament, and the ſeveral ſtories of it, that any
one may eaſily thereby comprehend the manner
of the ſtructure. In the next place he writes
that the Roman Knights made their Horſes run
round about the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in certain orderly
motions, which were at that time called <hi>Motus
Pyrrhichii,</hi> and in orbicular revolutions. And at
the ſame time there were a certain number of
Chariots, filled with perſons which repreſented
the moſt qualified men of the Empire, which
alſo went in a kind of Proceſſion, round the great
<hi>Machine,</hi> till the next ſucceſſor of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
firſt took a Torch in his hand, and with it
kindled ſome combuſtible matter, made for that
purpoſe at the bottom of it, and then in a little
time all that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As in the firſt Book we have that of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Antoninus</hi> to his friends, a little before his

Book does as it were conclude, with that ſpeech
which <hi>Maximus</hi> made in the middle of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a little before he marched with it to <hi>Rome:</hi>
and all his other Books are filled with the like
diſcourſes, which are leaning to the form of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;
and which without any difficulty he
continually uſed as occaſion offered; as may be
ſeen by that letter which <hi>Macrinus</hi> writ from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
to the Senate and Roman People, in the
beginning of his Fifth Book.</p>
               <p>He did not moreover avoid Digreſſions in his
Compoſitions. There is one in his firſt Book,
on the occaſion of that <hi>Idol of the Mother of the
Gods,</hi> which the Romans cauſed to be brought
from <hi>Phrygia;</hi> after having related that the Stone,
all ingraved as it was into the form of the <hi>Image,</hi>
fell down from Heaven, in the <hi>Field of Peſinun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and made the Ship that carried it ſtop at the
Mouth of <hi>Tyber,</hi> till a Veſtal in proof of her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity
had drawn it out with her cincture: and
he gives no other reaſon for the Sacrifices, which
the Eunuchs celebrated to ſuch a Divinity, and
many other Fables which depended thereon (in
this whole diverſion) than that, writing in
Greek, he thought it might be acceptable to his
Country-men, to be informed of the Theology
of the Latins, whereof few of them had any
knowledg.</p>

                  <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> mentions <hi>Herodian,</hi>

to have favoured one, in hatred of <hi>Alexander

He did indeed commend the clemency and mild
diſpoſition of that Prince, who reigned Fourteen
years, without any effuſion of blood; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking away the life of any one, otherwiſe
than by the ordinary courſe of Juſtice, which

               </p>
               <p>As to the Empreſs <hi>Mammea</hi> (who is propoſed
by ſome, as a Pattern to thoſe to whom the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ſuch Princes, which they ſhall have
brought into the World, may appertain) he by no
means approved of her Government; ſometimes
he deſcribed her as an avaritious perſon, that
invaded the poſſeſſions of many perſons, by evil
and fraudulent means, and ſaies, ſhe was for that
reaſon hated by her Son. And then he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
her to be ſo proud, that ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
her Daughter in Law <hi>Augusta,</hi> impatient
to have the Title of Empreſs given to any but
her ſelf, but baniſhed her into <hi>Affrick,</hi> after
having cauſed her Father to be put to death, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the conſent of the Emperor; becauſe he
made publick complaints of the wrongs, he, and
the young Empreſs <hi>Auguſta</hi> his Daughter had
endured by the cruelty of the ſame <hi>Mammea:</hi>
nor was ſhe leſs injurious to her Son, who, when
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56273:70"/>
he regretted the defeat of a Roman Army, which
was too far advanced in to the Country of the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> could not but impute the diſhonor of
it to her, who on pretext of her care, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him not to hazard his perſon, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the occaſion of the loſs of that Army, and
all the reproach and infamy that attended it. Not
does <hi>Herodian</hi> aſſign any other cauſe of the death
of both the Mother, and the Son, who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated
by the Souldiers, than the hatred they
had conceived againſt <hi>Mammea,</hi> becauſe of her
inſatiable avarice and ſhameleſs parcimony,
whereby <hi>Maximinus</hi> was advanced to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>

of his Mother. And <hi>Sextus Aurelius
Victor</hi> declines not, to have it pronounced to that
unfortunate Emperor, at the laſt moment of his
life; that the ſame perſon which gave it to him,
was the cauſe of his death. And he adds that
<hi>Mammea</hi> had reduced her Son to that extremity,
by her frugal humour, that the meat which was
untouched at the Table one day, was ſaved to be

which <hi>Alexander</hi> had for his Mother <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea,</hi>
made him to be beloved by all men. But
<hi>Euſebius</hi> has ſurpaſſed all others in her commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
extolling her to be a Lady of virtue and
piety, in a more religious ſenſe than that of
<hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> and equal to, if not exceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
all the Women of her time, and he improves
that his good opinion of her to us; becauſe of
her ſending for <hi>Origen</hi> from <hi>Antioch,</hi> to confer
with him of the miſteries of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we then conclude of the bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
which <hi>Herodian</hi> writes of her, may we not
believe, with <hi>Julius Capitolinus,</hi> that as he was
diſpleaſed with the Government of <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
he for that reaſon arraigned the Qualities
of his Mother, or rather that in a mixture of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and vices wherewith <hi>Mammea</hi> was taxed, he
would ſuppreſs neither of them, to acquit himſelf
the better of the duty of an Hiſtorian; which laſt
I take to be the moſt equitable opinion.</p>
               <p>Though we conſider <hi>Herodian</hi> in this place, but
as an Hiſtorian, <hi>Suidas</hi> informs us that he writ
many other Books, which are not preſerved to
our time. He was Originally a Grammarian of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
and lived in the Three Hundredth year
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56273:71"/>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of one <hi>Apollonius,</hi> ſurnamed
<hi>Difficilis</hi> of the ſame profeſſion: and perhaps it
is for this reaſon that <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
calls him, <hi>Artium minutiſſimum ſciſcitatorem.</hi>
However, he paſſed the beſt part of his life at
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the Courts of the Emperors, where he
had the means to inform himſelf (with that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
which appears in his writings) of many
excellent particulars, which are no where elſe to
be found.</p>

of diviſion which ſome Sowed between
<hi>Honorius</hi> and him. And indeed we have but the
beginning of the Sixth Book, the end being loſt.
But I know not upon what Authority <hi>Sigonius</hi>
builds, to aſſert that there was a Seventh Book of
<hi>Zoſimus</hi> his Hiſtory, which was alſo loſt, ſince
<hi>Photius</hi> mentions but Six, and no other perſon

                     </gap>.</note> And few Chriſtian Authors,
till <hi>Leunclavius</hi> who tranſlated his Hiſtory into
Latin, made any Apology for him: To ſay the
truth although this learned German defends him
very pertinently in many things, ſhowing that
they were to blame to require of a Pagan Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
as <hi>Zoſimus</hi> was, other thoughts than thoſe
he expoſed; or that he ſhould refrain from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the vices of the firſt Chriſtian Emperors,
ſince he alſo had not concealed their virtues:
Nevertheleſs it may be ſaid, that, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he expreſſed more Animoſity, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
than the Laws of Hiſtory do permit. Yet
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56273:73"/>
I think, he had reaſon to reproach <hi>Conſtantin,</hi>
of that impoſition of <hi>Chryſargyr</hi> or gliſteting Gold,
which <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> afterwards removed, and that
his duty obliged him to arraign his luxury and
prodigality: nor was it a fault to have accuſed
him, of having made his wife <hi>Fauſta</hi> to be
ſmothered in too hot a Stove, after he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
through Jealouſie his own Son <hi>Criſpus</hi>
to be put to death: Perhaps <hi>Euſebius</hi> writing in
this <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, or at the lateſt in that of
his Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> durſt not publiſh ſuch bold
truths, as it happens to thoſe who expoſe any
relations, wherein the Governing powers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed.
Nor is it unknown, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſeveral other actions worthy of blame.
He repealed from Exile the <hi>Arch Haeretick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
to gratify his Siſter <hi>Conſtantia;</hi> and baniſht
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to <hi>Tryers,</hi> to the great prejudice of
Chriſtianity. But nevertheleſs <hi>Zoſimus</hi> cannot
be excuſed, who as much as in him lay, made
an ill interpretation of all the actions of this
Prince: who made himſelf a Chriſtian, if you
believe him, only becauſe he was told, that
Paganiſm had no faculty to waſh away ſo many
crimes as he had committed; and therefore he
reſolved by the advice of a certain <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> to
imbrace the Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> which promiſed
an abſolution of all ſorts of offences. But this
aſſumption is as if <hi>Zoſimus</hi> had penetrated into
the inward thoughts of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and all thoſe
graces with which his Soul might be filled, by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56273:74"/>
the liberality of Heaven. Moreover, when he
ſpeaks of the differences he had with his Brother
in Law <hi>Licinius,</hi> he laies all the blame on him,
as one that never kept his word. And he is not
content to ſay, that <hi>Conſtantin</hi> cauſed him to be
ſtrangled in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> violating thereby his
faith given to the Wiſe of this unhappy perſon;
but it was his uſual Stile, to take hold of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to blaſt his reputation to the world.</p>
               <p>And yet it is not on the Subject of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>
alone, that his paſſion is ſeen againſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
He attributes the fall of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to the contempt of the Ancient Pagan Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and principally to their neglecting in
<hi>Diocletian</hi>'s time, the celebration of the <hi>ſecular
Plays.</hi> And to the misfortunes which happened
to <hi>Gratian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> he aſſigns no other cauſe, than his
refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l as a Chriſtian, to be the <hi>Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
of the Gentils, for which even <hi>Conſtantin,</hi>
ſaies he, had no averſion. When <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
the Roman Senate, to quite the worſhip of
Idols,<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> declaring, that he would no more go to
the charge of Sacrifices; he put this anſwer into
the mouths of all the Senators, that there was no
reaſon to oblige them to abandon a Religion,
wherein they had proſpered, during Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, to follow an unreaſonable faith, to
which it was intended they ſhould be compelled.
The injurious deſcription of the <hi>Monathal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note>
which he ſaid, did appropriate to its ſelf
all the wealth of the Nation, under a pretext
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56273:74"/>
of making the poor partake of it, is no ſmall
proof of his Animoſity. He called that <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
an Hypocrite, and wicked man, who was
the cauſe of the ruine of <hi>Stilico,</hi> as well to make
him alwaies paſs for innocent, as becauſe the

be ſeen by <hi>Two Letters,</hi> which <hi>Saint Auguſtin</hi>
writ to him. In fine, no perſon, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

the exceſs of ſharpneſs and Animoſity, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56273:75"/>
he ſhowed againſt the firſt Chriſtian Emperors,
it is injuſtice to take it ill, that he noted their

Was he not obliged in duty, to reproach
the Children of the laſt, with their ſtrange

Relations? And can we think it ſtrange, that
he ſhould exhibit the ſucceſſours of the Firſt in

               <p>He is ſaid, to have uſed in his Hiſtory, both
oblique and direct Orations, and all ſuch as he
believed, might make him approach the method
and manner of the Ancients; yet he, as well as
<hi>Zoſimus,</hi> came far ſhort of them. That which
induces me to put him in the Rank of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
is, that I conceive, he may paſs, with
<hi>Agathias</hi> who follows next, for the Two laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Hiſtorians that have writ in Greek, of whom
in our time there remains any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I know that many take him for a Chriſtian
Author: and that in ſome paſſages of his works,
eſpecially in the Treatiſe he made of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> he ſpeaks like the Chriſtians
of his time. But there are other paſſages in his
writings, ſo contrary to that doctrine; and the
opinion of thoſe that believe he is an <hi>Ethnick,</hi> is
founded upon ſuch ſtrong conſiderations, that I
cannot but yeild to it. For not inſiſting upon
his ſeeming in many places, to eſteem Fortune
a great <hi>Goddeſs:</hi> and not minding the ſtrange
Antimoſity which he ſhewed againſt <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
grounded partly upon the intereſt of Religion:
that place alone in his Firſt Book of the <hi>Wars</hi> of
the <hi>Goths,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Ambaſſadors
which the Emperor ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to reconcile the different opinions of Chriſtians,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56273:77"/>
is ſufficient to undeceive thoſe who conſidered
him as a Chriſtian Hiſtorian.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I will not trouble
my ſelf, ſaies he, to relate the Subject of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies;
(although it is not unknown to me) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I hold it a meer folly to covet to comprehend
the Divine Nature, and underſtand what God is.
Human wit knows not the things here below, how
then can it be ſatisfied in the ſearch after Divinity?
I led alone therefore ſuch vain matter, and which
the credulity of man only cauſes to be reſpected;
contenting my ſelf with acknowledging, that there
is one God full of bounty, who governs us, and
whoſe power ſtretches over this whole Univerſe. Let
every one therefore believe what he thinks fit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a Prieſt and tyed to Divine Worſhip, or
a man of a private and ſecular condition.</hi> How
could he more plainly deride all our Theology,
and the zeal of the Fathers of the Church,
who were then buſied in ſuppreſſing the Hereſie
of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> in what relates to the Second
perſon of the Trinity? His diſcourſe expreſſes
him to be a perfect <hi>Deiſt,</hi> who thought, as many
other Philoſophers have done (and amongſt the
reſt that <hi>Meliſſus</hi> in <hi>Heſychius</hi>) that one could
determin nothing of God but raſhly, and that
it was impoſſible to have any knowledg of him.
How can it be imagined, that ſuch a man was a
Chriſtian, who founded his whole belief of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
matters upon ſuch erronious maxims? If
we add to this, the marks of Pagan Superſtition
which appear in all his books, we ſhall be hardly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56273:78"/>
able to diſtinguiſh him from the moſt profane
of the <hi>Gentils.</hi> The Tale he tells in the firſt
book of the <hi>Perſian War,</hi> of the Artifice uſed by
ſome of the <hi>Magi,</hi> to make One <hi>Arſaces</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the truth, is of this ſtrain. They covered
one half of a borded Floor with <hi>Perſian</hi> Earth,
and the other with <hi>Armenian,</hi> and both of them
conjured in ſuch a ſort, that when <hi>Arſaces</hi>
was upon the laſt half which was that covered
with his country Earth, he confeſſed all that he
had denied upon the other. In the following
Book, he relates that ſome <hi>military Enſigns</hi> turned
of themſelves, from the Weſt to the Eaſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging
thereby the calamity wherein the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Antioch</hi> fell. He makes King <hi>Genzerich,</hi>
in the firſt Book of the <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> to
underſtand by the flight of an <hi>Eagle</hi> upon the
head of <hi>Martianus,</hi> that he ſhould be one day Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
And he reports, that <hi>Attila</hi> ready to quit
the Siege of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> ſtaied his enterpriſe upon
ſeeing a Stork carry its young ones out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And in the ſame Book he relates one of his
dreams, which was the moſt vain that ſleep could
form; and yet to teſtify how much he relyed on
it, he confeſſes that nothing but that made him
reſolve on his Sea Voyage with <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Nor
are his Writings concerning the War with the
<hi>Goths,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> leſs exempt from ſuch like ſuperſtition;
wherein he makes a Jew foretel, by Thirty Hogs
the ruin of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> and <hi>Conſtantin</hi>
bury in the chief Market-place of the City
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56273:78"/>
(which bears his name) that renowned <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> purpoſely tranſported thither
from <hi>Rome.</hi> Which wild relations have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with the purity of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But ſince we have mentioned ſomething of
that ill will <hi>Procopius</hi> bore to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edita.</note> it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to examin that work a little; becauſe it is
the place from whence, thoſe who pretend to
defame this Emperor, have alwaies collected their
detractions. If we make it apparent that <hi>Procopius</hi>
was much to blame, in writing ſo defamatory a
Satyr againſt his Soveraign, to gratify his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we ſhall at the ſame time render thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions
inconſiderable, which others have caſt
upon his reputation. The word <hi>Anecdota</hi> imports
that it was a ſecret work, and that the Author
thereof had no mind to be known. He is judged
to have compoſed it, in the Two and Thirtieth
year of the Empire of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and left it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
as well becauſe he repented that he was
ſo far tranſported, as for the ſatisfaction he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his Stipend (which was then paid
him) and many other favours which he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He had complained in ſeveral places before
that one, that the Salaries of ſuch ſerviceable
men as he were detained: and it was an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
grief unto him, to ſee himſelf excluded
from thoſe honorable places and imployments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Thirty years, to which others were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whoſe deſert he thought no way equal to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56273:79"/>
his. Laſtly having been <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Secretary,
during all the Wars of <hi>Perſia, Affrick,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
(as it was before mentioned) he was received
into the number of the Senators: attained unto
the Quality of Illuſtrious, which was given
to few men: and to compleat his dignity the
Emperor made him <hi>Prefect</hi> of new <hi>Rome,</hi> where
all offices were inferiour to his. In the mean
time his book of <hi>Anecdota</hi> remained; <hi>Suidas</hi>
makes mention of it, and they who for divers
conſiderations have been animated aganſt the
memory of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> made uſe of it and alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the matters in it to his prejudice: it was not
long ſince printed with Expoſitions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  </gap> ſummarily, that all which <hi>Procopius</hi> has
writ of Hiſtory will prove ridiculous, if never
ſo little credit be given to the Calumnies of this
piece.</p>
               <p>He proteſts in the beginning of the Firſt Book
of the <hi>Perſian War,</hi> that he cannot be reaſonably
reproached of writing any thing for favour, or
to oblige the undeſerving; nor of refraining to
ſpeak the truth to ſpare a friend: and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in the ſame place, that as Eloquence is
the object of Rhetorick, and Fable that of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
the knowledg of truth is the only end of
Hiſtory. After this declaration what can be ſaid
in his excuſe, for having repreſented <hi>Juſtinian</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56273:79"/>
in his Hiſtory, as a mighty and moſt virtuous
Prince, and in this Libel rendred him the moſt
infamous and vicious of men? The fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Soveraign Powers which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
alledged, cannot qualify ſuch a ſhameful
diverſity, nor reconcile ſo manifeſt a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And <hi>Procopius</hi> is at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of having treſpaſſed, againſt the two moſt
important Laws of Hiſtory, whereof one forbids
the writing of lies, and the other, concealing of
a truth which ought to be diſcovered. But for
a better underſtanding of this matter it may not
be impertinent to proceed to ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>It is certain that <hi>Procopius</hi> ever made very
honourable mention of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">She was a common <hi>Comedian</hi> before he married her.</note> and his Wife
<hi>Theodora</hi> in his Hiſtory, although he did it not
ſo often as he might. In the Second Book of the
War againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he extols the Emperor
for providence joined with ſingular l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iety, on the
Subject of that great Peſtilence which paſſed
from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he uſed all
poſſible means to allay it. And in his <hi>Six Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Edifices</hi> of the ſame <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly
celebrates his greatneſs of Courage, his
devotion, liberality, clemency, and magnificence.
That Monaſtery of <hi>Penitent Women,</hi> whom the
Empreſs <hi>Theodora</hi> withdrew from vice, gives him
occaſion to commend her zeal and charity joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with her Husbands, although he recounts the
action otherwiſe in his <hi>Anecdota.</hi> But he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
this Lady in many places of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56273:80"/>
with great titles of honour.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Bello Perſ.</note> When a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
was held to reſiſt the enterpriſes of <hi>Hipatius</hi>
(who had cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) he makes her argue ſo
generouſly that, as he affirms, nothing infuſed
ſo much courage into the whole imperial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
as her Heroical reſolution. And when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
the ill conditions of that <hi>Johannes of
Cappadocia</hi> who was turned out of his office of
<hi>Praefect</hi> of the <hi>Praetorate,</hi> he ſaies, he was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
and raſh, as to ſlander the Empreſs
<hi>Theodora</hi> even in the preſence of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> whom
he there Stiles a very diſcreet Lady. And though
he did not praiſe her in other places of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
he never blamed her. In the end of the
Second Book of the <hi>Perſian War,</hi> he mentions
her death, but does not ſpeak ill of her. And in
the Third treating of the War of the <hi>Goths,</hi> he
again remembers her deceaſe, which happened
at the ſame time that <hi>Beliſaerius</hi> ſent his Wife
<hi>Antonina</hi> to Court, to forward his affairs there
by the favour of the Empreſs, which he relates
without uſing the leaſt invective againſt her.</p>
               <p>But let us now ſee the reverſe of the Medal,
and with how many different colours he draws
the Picture of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Theodora,</hi> in that
extravagant Satyr which we complain of.</p>
               <p>To render this Prince the more odious,<note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> he
will have him reſemble <hi>Domitiaen</hi> in his outward
form, whoſe memory was ſo much abhorred,
that by a Decree of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56273:80"/>
wear beat down through the whole Empire,
and his name razed out of the publick inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But though he is conſtrained in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
he makes of theſe Two Monarchs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was not ill-favoured, yet he
likens him in one place to an Aſs, not only for
his dulneſs and ſottiſhneſs, but alſo in reſpect of
his wagging Ears, which made him be called in

Alemannus,</hi> who lately cauſed theſe <hi>Anecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
to be printed with Hiſtorical Notes of the
ſame kind. Moreover he makes him a Prince, that
condemned upon the firſt, and very light infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
without hearing; and would coldly and
without any remorſe, order the razing of places,
the ſacking of <hi>Cities,</hi> and the deſolation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.<note place="margin">Pag. 39. &amp; 59.</note>
The love of Women, he ſaies, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him beyond all bounds; and he was an
irreconcilable Enemy. He alſo accuſes him to
make a ſhow of being a Chriſtian, but that in
his heart he eſteemed the Heathen Duities. His
prodigality (he writes) eſpecially in building,
forced him to aſe ſtrange exactions,<note place="margin">Pag. 91.</note> ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the extraordinary Tolls, he drew from the
Prefect of his Tribunal of Juſtice, a tribute, which
he himſelf called in a ſcoffing manner <hi>an Airy
Lap,</hi> becauſe it had no other foundation than
his covetous and Tyrannical humour. His light
mind was ſuſceptible of all impreſſions except
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56273:81"/>
humanity. He never kept his word, but when
it was to his advantage:<note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> and was ſo tranſported
with flattery, that nothing made him affect <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonianus</hi>
ſo much, as hearing of him once ſay,
that he feared his extream piety would make
Heaven ſteal him from the Earth on a ſudden,
and when it was leaſt thought of. Laſtly, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if this Character of him was true, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had took pleaſure to inſtil into the Soul of
this Monarch, all the defects which are capable
to defame the reſt of Mankind. And the more
eaſily to betray thoſe they had a mind to ruin,
his Empreſs and he laid this Snare, they feigned
to be alwaies at diſcord, ſo that the one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
their deſign, ſided with thoſe of the <hi>blew
Livery,</hi> the other openly favoured the contrary
party namely the <hi>Green,</hi> which were the Two
factions of that time. They were both of them ſo
impious ſaies this Detractor, that many perſons to
inſinuate themſelves into their eſteem, ſeemed
to be wicked and have all their inclinations bent
to vice. And amongſt thoſe who knew them ſo
well as <hi>Procopius,</hi>

<hi>Devils</hi> Incarnate, and true <hi>Furies</hi> inveſted with
humanity, more conveniently to infeſt human
kind, incenſe Nations one againſt the other, and
turn all the world upſide down. It is certain, as
he pretends, that the Mother of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> often
confeſſed, that he was not begotten by her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Sabbatius,</hi> but an <hi>Incubus</hi> who lay with
her. And as for <hi>Theodora,</hi> they who loved her

of the book which for ſhame was cut off, from
the One and Fortieth, and Two and Fortieth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the printed <hi>Anecdota,</hi> was ſent to me
from <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein <hi>Procopius</hi> renders this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

that I think no body has reaſon to envy the

                  </gap>ng to the
lineaments wherein <hi>Procopius</hi> has repreſented
them, in that infamous work which diſcred is
all the reſt we have of his. I ſhall not inlarge
on what <hi>Nicephorus Bartholus, Johannes Faber,
Gennadius,</hi> and ſeveral others have written of
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who report that he was ranked amongſt
the <hi>Saints,</hi> aſſigning even the <hi>Calends of Auguſt</hi> for
his holy day. But though he and his Empreſs
had been the moſt vicious perſons in the World,
<hi>Procopius</hi> ought not to have been ſo unlike to
himſelf, and ſo unfaithful to truth, as to ſpeak
of them ſo as he did, overthrowing the Faith of
his Hiſtory in his book of <hi>Antidota:</hi> and that of

                  <hi>Gregory of Tours</hi> alledges, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi>

Authority, affirm that being reduced to extream
miſery, he was forced to beg; but that muſt
be accounted as a Fable: and on the contrary we
may obſerve in his perſon the bounty of his
Prince, who having heaped riches and Honours
on him, never treated him worſe, although endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56273:82"/>
were thrice uſed to render him ſuſpected
of deſigning to be maſter of the State. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſtrange that he upbraids <hi>Juſtinian</hi> with his
buildings, who writ a book purpoſely in their
commendation, and who deſcribing the lofty
ſtructure of ſo many Churches, Hoſpitals, and
Monaſteries, did no leſs admire the Piety, than
the magnificence of their Founder. <hi>Evagrius</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes

of a Hundred and Fifty Cities; But I ſee
no reaſon for this to be imputed to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Nor has the love of Women, for which
his reputation is blemiſhed, any better foundation.
For though he may be blamed, for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himſelf ſo far in the affection of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
as to extort from his Predeceſſor <hi>Juſtin,</hi> new
laws in favour of <hi>Actreſſes,</hi> that ſhe might be
qualified to marry him; we cannot therefore
accuſe him, like <hi>Procopius,</hi> for having abandoned
his thoughts to Women, without ſpecifying any
particulars, when neither his own Hiſtory, or any
other mentions thoſe Ladies to whom he was
ſo paſſionately addicted; and who doubtleſs would
have prevailed on his weakneſs, if he had been
ſo fond on that ſide, as the <hi>Anecdota</hi> would
make it be believed. I could not forbear to
manifeſt in ſome ſort, the abſurdity of theſe Two

I muſt nevertheleſs, add this only word on

that then printed <hi>Suidas</hi> by a corrupt Copy,
where the name of <hi>Justinian</hi> paſſed for that of
<hi>Juſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anecd. Pag. 28.</note> with the Surname of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literat
man,</hi> which even <hi>Procopius</hi> attributes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the laſt, who could not ſo much as write
his name; has made worthy men miſtake: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
which <hi>Alciatus</hi> and <hi>Budaeus,</hi> when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this falſe Authority, which all the <hi>Vatican
Manuſcripts</hi> contradict, they ranked <hi>Juſtinian</hi>
with the moſt ignorant Princes that ever were.
I was curious to ſee in the King of <hi>France</hi> his
Library, Three other <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of <hi>Snidas</hi> which
are there, to aſſure me of the miſtake which
happened in that impreſſion: Two of the beſt
account were very correct, and aſcribe this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to <hi>Juſtin</hi> alone (who was known to be a
mean keeper of Oxen, before he bore Arms by
which he attained to the Empire) but the Third
was falſe, and in that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was called <hi>Juſtin,</hi>
which ſhews that the Impreſſion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
probably followed a Copy, as erronious
as the printed Book. In the mean time it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had made a great progreſs
in learning, under his <hi>Tutor</hi> the <hi>Abbot Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:56273:83"/>
Many Books are aſcribed unto him by <hi>Iſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and others. <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> his letters ſtile him moſt
learned. And this obſervation has been alſo made,
that many crowned Heads at the ſame time made
profeſſion of Philoſophy, <hi>Choſroes</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the
unfortunate <hi>Theodahatus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and our <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which plainly diſcovers the
injury that is done him, by thoſe tearms of <hi>ſtupid</hi>
and <hi>ignorant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Procopius</hi> is to blame for having yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo much, to his particular reſentments againſt
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the reading of his Hiſtory is of great
moment, becauſe we can learn from no other,
what he delivers as an Eye-witneſs, of the Wars
of this Emperor in <hi>Perſia,</hi> of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in
<hi>Affrick,</hi> and of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> It was that
which made <hi>Leonard Aretin</hi> commit the crime
of a <hi>Plagiary</hi> (for we have no other tearm to
ſignifie that ſort of theft) when he had a mind
to publiſh their Hiſtory in Latin. For being not
able to learn almoſt any thing of them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he reſolved to Tranſlate the Three books
of <hi>Procopius</hi> into the Roman Language; dividing
them into Four by making Two of the laſt, and
reſcinding in ſome places, what he judged leſs
important to his Country, and adding ſomething
in others; as the burning of the <hi>Capitol</hi> by <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilas,</hi>
by whom as <hi>Procopius</hi> affirms, ſo much of
<hi>Rome</hi> was not conſumed by fire, as <hi>Aretin</hi> reports.
In the mean time he is contented to ſay in his
Preface, that he uſed ſome Forreign Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56273:84"/>
or Greek relations, not naming the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of whom he is meerly a bad tranſlater, by
an affected forgetfulneſs which cannot be too
much condemned. We have already in our
foregoing Sections, exclaimed upon thoſe who
counterfeit Authors, aſcribing books to perſons
that never thought upon making of them. And
certainly it is a great point of infidelity thus to
deceive as much as one can even all mankind:
But as this vice is very great, I find that of a
<hi>Plagiary</hi> which is the contrary, and takes away
inſtead of giving, to be much the more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
becauſe there is nothing more vile or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
than to ſteal, and they who apply to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
other mens labours, confeſs their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
to produce ſomething of value. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Procopius,</hi> he was acquainted under <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi>
with almoſt all the ſecrets of State of that
Age, which renders his Hiſtory of great weight.
But the exceſſive zeal which he has for this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi>
makes <hi>Bodin</hi> amongſt others, accuſe him
of too much partiality towards him. Thus <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
is reproved for having alwaies flattered
<hi>Charlemagne; Euſebius, Constantine; Paulus Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Coſmodi Medici; Sandoual</hi> Charles the Fifth;
and ſeveral others, the Princes whom they affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to oblige at the expence of truth. It is certain
that <hi>Procopius</hi> never ſpeaks but to the advantage
of <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> he illuſtrates all his actions, and
rather chuſes to ſuppreſs a part of the ſucceſſes
which he recites,<note place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> than to write any thing which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56273:84"/>
might any waies blemiſh the reputation of his
<hi>Hero.</hi> I ſhall produce one ſingle inſtance, and
ſuch a one that I think is not to be marched in
any other Hiſtorian, the place is in his Second
Book of the War of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> where, after
the Oration of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to his Souldiers, and
Two others of his Adverſary <hi>Stozas; Procopius</hi>
writes that the Troops of the former revolting,
forced their Chiefs to retire into a Temple
where they were all killed. He was obliged in
reaſon to ſignifie thereupon what became of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius,</hi>
who one would think was maſſacred
with the reſt. But becauſe it was an unhappy
event, without telling how he came off; <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
adds only, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> upon this ill news
diſpatched away his <hi>Nephew Germanus,</hi> who came
and took poſſeſſion of the command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in <hi>Affrick;</hi> and not ſaying the leaſt word
of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> he makes his narration ſo lame
that the Reader knows not where he is. The
Latin Text is a little deffective here, having not
all which is read in the Greek, yet this fault we
ſpeak of appears alſo in that verſion.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of another place, in
the Second Book alſo of the War of the <hi>Goths,</hi>
where upon a meer Letter of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
King of <hi>France,</hi> he quits the purſuit of his
victories in <hi>Italy,</hi> and returns haſtily into his
Country. He acknowledged his fault, ſaies he,
and his temerity, as ſoon as he had read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> returning with all ſpeed to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56273:85"/>
                  <hi>France:</hi> as if this powerful Monarch came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like a raw Schollar, without having well
conſidered what he did; and the Rhetorick of
<hi>Beliſarius</hi> had obliged him and all his Councel,
to abſent themſelves for want of a reply. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is a great defect of judgment in this
paſſage, and <hi>Aretin</hi> had reaſon to ſupply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own in this place, ſaying that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and want of victuals made the Victorious
<hi>French</hi> return into their Countries. He might
have added ſickneſs, according to the relation
of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> who ſpeaks of this retreat. I
find moreover,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Hiſt. cap. 32.</note> that our <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> makes <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Author of an action, which does not agree
with what he had ſaid a little before of him,
namely that the <hi>French</hi> were the men of the
world, who violated their Faith the moſt; when
the letter of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> which upbraids that
Prince with nothing elſe but not obſerving Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
had nevertheleſs ſuch power over him. An
Author of more judgment would not have ſaid
ſo, nor have raſhly offended a whole Nation,
with the like Animoſity wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi>
declaim againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Punick</hi> Faith, at the
ſame time when they themſelves were the moſt
unfaithful, that ever had been, to all Nations of
the World. I muſt, before I leave that place
where <hi>Procopius</hi> ſpoke ſo ill of the <hi>French,</hi> do
the Nation reaſon, by remarking with how much
malice and abſurdity, he makes them in the ſame
place, become Maſters of the Camp of the <hi>Goths,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56273:85"/>
and of that of the Grecians Romanized, as it
were by a ſurprize, although they exceeded the
number of a Hundred Thouſand: as if their
Army deſcended from Heaven upon the heart
of <hi>Italy,</hi> like Graſhoppers, which a boyſterous
Tempeſt of wind tranſports ſometimes, from
one Region to another. But ſince we reprove
him of having been too partial, let us ſtop
here the courſe of the zeal, which we have for
our <hi>Anceſtours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meaning the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </note> that it may not be judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I think that <hi>Procopius</hi> deſerves
to be read attentively, eſpecially in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the things which he alone treats of
with an exact knowledge. And that beſides
a great diſcretion is to be uſed in reading of
him, to diſcern the good things from the bad,
and the defects, whereof we have produced
Examples, from what he has writ more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.
He was of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> from
whence he came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the time
of the Emperour <hi>Anastaſius,</hi> whoſe eſteem he
obtained, as well as that of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Firſt,
and <hi>Juſtinian. Suidas</hi> after he had given him
the Surname of <hi>Iluſtrious,</hi> calls him <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
and <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> as truly he ſeems to have
been to much for an Hiſtorian. He is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
but with a Copiouſneſs more <hi>Aſiatick</hi>
than <hi>Athenian,</hi> which has often in it more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
than true Ornament. <hi>Photius</hi> only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in his <hi>Library,</hi> as was before mentioned,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56273:86"/>
an abſtract of the Two Books of the War againſt
the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 160.</note> although he made ſome mention
of the reſt. He diſtinguiſhes him elſewhere,
from another <hi>Procopius</hi> Surnamed <hi>Gazeus,</hi> who
lived in the ſame time of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and who
alſo was a Rhetorician by Profeſſion. If I durſt
follow the judgment of one of the men of
this Age,<note place="margin">M. Gueit.</note> who has the greateſt inſight into
the Greek Tongue; I ſhould willingly be of his
mind, that the Book of <hi>Anecdota</hi> is a ſuppoſed
work, and falſely aſcribed to the Hiſtorian <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi>
For that which is really his, is writ
in a Stile much different from that of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
and has much more of the Air of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Greece.</hi> But becauſe even they who have
writ againſt the <hi>Anecdota,</hi> ſeem to agree, that
they are his to whom they are imputed, I
was obliged to make the precedent Reflections,
and to treat <hi>Procopius</hi> upon this Foundation,
more to his diſadvantage than I had othewiſe
done. It is true, that at the ſame time I end
this Section, an Epiſtle of <hi>Balthaſar Boniface</hi>
to the <hi>Clariſſimo Molini,</hi> which I read even
now, hinders me from repenting of what I did.
It is printed at the end of his judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe who wrot the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory. And
becauſe they did not mention the <hi>Anecdota</hi> in
the Chapter of <hi>Procopius,</hi> he takes occaſion to
declare his opinion to that <hi>Noble Venetian</hi> in the
ſaid <hi>Letter.</hi> He appears to be no leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than I, at ſuch an inſolent invective. And
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56273:86"/>
wonders, as I did, that <hi>Rivius,</hi> and they who
undertook to anſwer it, never thought of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
it as a ſuppoſed piece, although he
himſelf comes to no determination therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it.</p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
AGATHIAS.</head>
               <p>I HAVE as much reaſon to doubt of the
Religion of <hi>Agathias,</hi> as I had of that of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi>
For when he ſpeaks, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Hiſtory, of the <hi>French</hi> of his time;
he praiſes them amongſt other things, for being
all Chriſtians, and becauſe they entertained (as
he adds) very good thoughts of God. But when
he gives a reaſon in his Third Book, why the
fortreſs of <hi>Onogoris</hi> Situate in <hi>Colchis,</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his time the <hi>Fort of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Stephen;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that this <hi>Protomartyr</hi> was ſtoned to death
in that <hi>Place,</hi> uſing the term <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>as they ſay,</hi>
or <hi>as it is ſaid;</hi> from whence many draw a ſtrong
proof of his infidelity. The moſt common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
alſo, founded as well on this paſſage, as on
ſome others, liſts him in the number of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils;</hi>
although he never railed any more than
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56273:87"/>
                  <hi>Procopius,</hi> againſt Chriſtianity; as moſt Pagan Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
did in imitation of <hi>Zoſimus.</hi> The time
wherein theſe Two lived, not favouring Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,
is perhaps the only cauſe. He himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
in his <hi>Preface,</hi> that <hi>Murina</hi> a City of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
was the place of his Nativity; which he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
from another of <hi>Thrace,</hi> bearing the ſame
name. His Father was called <hi>Memnonius;</hi> and
he profeſſed the Law, pleading at the <hi>Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Smyrna</hi> in Quality of an Advocate, as <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
reports; whence he had the Surname of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us:</hi>
becauſe the places where the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws were taught, then went under the name
of Schools, as they are even at this time in ſome
places called. He confeſſes that Poetry was the
Miſtris of his firſt affections, which led him to
write many ſmall Poems in Heroick Verſe, that
he publiſhed under the Title of <hi>Daphnicks.</hi> And
there are certain of his Epigrams collected by
divers hands, whereof, I believe, many are ſeen
in the <hi>Greek Anthology</hi> under his name. And
this renders his Stile ſo agreeable and Florid,
having undertook Hiſtory, by the advice of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychianus</hi>
the Firſt Secretary of State, as approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this reſpect to, and bordering (as he
tearms it) upon Poetry. <hi>Sigonius</hi> and <hi>Verderius</hi>
were of another mind concerning his writing,
and that very different from this opinion, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him amongſt the loweſt and impureſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But they were not only miſtaken in <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
his Stile; but have been accuſed for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56273:88"/>
other raſh judgments; ſo that I have been
conſtrained many times hitherto, to follow ſome
more equitable cenſures than theirs. He began
not to write till after the death of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
in the Reign of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
declares in his <hi>Preface,</hi> beginning his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
where <hi>Procopius</hi> left. And I doubt not,
but that great Stateſman <hi>Eutychianus,</hi> who put
him upon ſo high an Enterpriſe, and who was
his intimate friend, furniſhed him with many
rare pieces and Memorials of conſequence, to
make him ſo ſucceſsful as he has been. There
are <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Direct Orations</hi> in all his Books;
as that of <hi>Narſes</hi> in the Two Firſt; of <hi>Aetes</hi> in
the Third; of the <hi>Deputies</hi> of <hi>Colchos</hi> in the
Fourth; of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> in the Fifth. And not
content to penetrate into the Councels, and to
diſcover the principal cauſes of events, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
gives his judgment thereupon: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the cuſtom of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who
never declare what they think of things, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
his opinion of matters; and therein imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
ſome great Authors, who were not of the
mind of theſe we mention.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Agathias</hi> highly commends <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
he does not refrain from following opinions
very contrary to his, and even reproves him
ſometimes, for having given unreaſonable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures:
of which there are many examples; the
moſt conſiderable whereof, is that which he ſaid
to the advantage of the <hi>French,</hi> in his Firſt Book,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56273:88"/>
againſt the infamous reproach which <hi>Procopius</hi>
had caſt upon them, of being the moſt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of men. <hi>Agathias</hi> on the contrary, after he
had ſhown that they were very polite and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
as they who already made uſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws almoſt in all things, adds, that they
were to be eſteemed for nothing ſo much, as the
exact juſtice they obſerved without exception,
their Kings themſelves being not exempted from
it; whereby they lived in an admirable Union.
Certainly, beſides that juſtice is a tranſcendent
virtue, and which comprehending all others, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſubſiſt without fidelity; nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, than breach of word of Faith, and
conſequently <hi>Agathias</hi> could not more reaſonably
contradict <hi>Procopius,</hi> nor make better amends
for the wrong he had done the <hi>French Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that notwithſtanding theſe Two
Hiſtorians had ſuch oppoſite thoughts in what
concerned us,<note place="margin">The French.</note> they agreed in what related to the
greatneſs and independence of our Kings. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi>
acknowledges, in the Third Book of the
<hi>Gothiſh</hi> War, that They, and the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
were the only Monarchs in the World, who
had the priviledge to ſtamp their Images on gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Coin; ſo that even the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who
had ſuch glorious Titles, durſt not attempt to
do the like. <hi>Agathias</hi> alſo ſpeaking of King
<hi>Theodebert,</hi> ſaies, that he was ſo much offended to
ſee, that the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian</hi> aſſumed among
other Titles, that of <hi>Francious;</hi> as if he had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56273:89"/>
conquered the <hi>French,</hi> and held ſome right of
ſuperiority over them; that for this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone he reſolved to go and ſubdue <hi>Thrace,</hi>
lay Siege to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and overthrow the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, whereof that City was then the
<hi>Capital.</hi> I know that the ſame <hi>Agathias</hi> calls
that deſign raſh, preſuppoſing that <hi>Theodebert</hi>
would have periſhed in ſo bold, or, to uſe his
tearm, in ſo furious an Enterpriſe. Nevertheleſs
he confeſſes, that this King had brought it to ſuch
a paſs; that if he had not been killed, as he
was hunting a wild Bull, nothing had retarded
him in it: and God knows, whither the event
would have anſwered the conjectures of Our <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian.</hi>
But we may ſay that theſe are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable
teſtimonies, of the abſolute power of
the French Monarchy, which never acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any Superiour but God (and according to the
words of a good <hi>Gaule</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi>) any thing but
Heaven to be above it.</p>
               <p>To return to the reflections of <hi>Agathias,</hi> very
different from thoſe of <hi>Procopius,</hi> which ſeem to
have the force of argument wholly on their ſide,
we will examine a very remarkable place of his
Fourth Book. Where he cannot endure that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi>
not content to ſay that <hi>Arcadius</hi> left his
Son <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and Empire, to the protection of
<hi>Iſdigerdes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> (which no Author wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of credit ever writ before him) ſhould more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
praiſe the action, as if it were full of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
and add, that although <hi>Arcadius</hi> was not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56273:89"/>
very diſcreet in other things, yet in this he
ſhewed wiſdom, and demeaned himſelf very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.
This, ſaies <hi>Agathias,</hi> is judging of things
by their ſucceſs, as the vulgar alwaies do; but
weighing them with reaſon, it will be found, that
a Soveraign never did any thing more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
than this Declaration of <hi>Arcadius:</hi> for
he ſeemed in it to make a Wolfe Gardian of a
Sheep, truſting his Son and State in the hands of
their greateſt Enemy; through a confidence which
though it is ſometimes tolerable in private men,
was not ſufferable when the ſafety of a young Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
lay at ſtake, and the preſervation of a
Crown by ſo much the more envied, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give Laws to all others. Methinks, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ought to yeild to this opinion of <hi>Agathias,</hi>
and conclude with him, that in the event of this
Tuition, happy as it appeared, there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to admire the goodneſs and integrity of the

allow the ſame rank, amongſt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
to <hi>Criſpus Saluſtius,</hi> although there
have been ſome much more Ancient than he. For
it is known that <hi>Ennius</hi> had writ Eighteen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
in Heroick Verſe long before him: and that
<hi>Nevius</hi> in the ſame Age deſcribed the <hi>firſt Punick
War,</hi> in another ſort of Verſe called <hi>Saturnian.
Fabius Pictor</hi> was the firſt of the Romans (as
<hi>Voſſius</hi> obſerves) that compiled a Hiſtory in Latin
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56273:93"/>
Proſe. <hi>Poſthumius Albinus, Caſſius Hemina,</hi> and
<hi>C. Fannius,</hi> whom <hi>Saluſt</hi> celebrates for true Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
writ after him. And <hi>Cato</hi> with his <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Hiſtoricae, Sempronius, Vaelerius Antias,</hi> and
<hi>Quadrigarius</hi> (ſo often quoted by <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi>)
may be all ſaid to have preceded <hi>Saluſt</hi> in this
ſort of writing. But ſince there remains to us
nothing of their works, but the grief for the loſs
of them (the Hiſtories of <hi>Fabius, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>
delivered unto us by <hi>Annius of Viterbum,</hi>
being all counterfeit, by an impoſture which we
have already complained of more than once)
is it not juſt to begin this our Second Enterpriſe
with <hi>Saluſt,</hi> from whom we have Entire pieces
of Hiſtory, and other Fragments which all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men reſpect? I know that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is as
Ancient as he, and that ſome even affirm, that
<hi>Saluſt</hi> though Elder, died Seven years after the
murder of this <hi>Emperor.</hi> It cannot be a fault to
give precedence in this place, now he is dead,
to One that he could never indure while he
lived. The name of <hi>Commentaries</hi> rather than
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> which his works bear, invites me to it:
And the language of <hi>Saluſt</hi> (that is raxed with
the Air of Antiquity, and affectation of the old
words of <hi>Cato</hi>) may be another Motive, in which

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56273:94"/>
it in the very terms of <hi>Saluſt.</hi> He cenſures his
too frequent repetition of the word <hi>hyemare,</hi> and
of <hi>Famas</hi> in the plural ſignifying <hi>Fame,</hi> and ſome
other expreſſions which were read in <hi>Aruntius.</hi>
But nevertheleſs he writes, that in the time of
<hi>Saluſt,</hi> obſcure brevity, and cut periods, which
left men to gueſs at the ſenſe, paſſed for an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of language; <hi>Saluſtio vigente, amputatae

ſee that <hi>Macrobius</hi> many Ages after, under the
Authority of one of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Entertainments,</hi>
makes <hi>Saluſt</hi> reign in the conciſe way of writing;
that is, he rendered himſelf ſo conſiderable in it,
that no body thereupon could diſpute the firſt
rank with him.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the word <hi>brevity</hi> is <hi>equivocal,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſons ſpeak of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Saluſt,</hi> as of
Authors equally brief; it may be convenient to
declare, of what great conſequence it is, not to
confound their Stile as agreeing, when they are
very different. It cannot be denied that <hi>Tacitus</hi>
followed <hi>Saluſt</hi> in a cloſe way of writing, which
both uſed; wherein they may be ſaid ſomewhat
to reſemble one another. And in this all thoſe
agree that have conſidered the Stile of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
and even <hi>Tacitus</hi> himſelf acknowledges,
how much he eſteemed that of <hi>Saluſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. g. hiſt.</note> when he
called him <hi>Rerum Romanarum florentiſſimum Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem,</hi>
which made him imitate him. But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be affirmed that this <hi>Laconick</hi> expreſſion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56273:94"/>
which is common to them both, makes them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in the reſt, and can make them paſs for as
correct Hiſtorians one as the other: for to ſpeak
properly, a ſuccinct way of writing does not ſo
much contribute to make an exact brief Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
as when the matter whereof he writes is ſuch,
that nothing can be taken from it, without a
prejudice to his Subject, and the ſpoyling of his
work. <hi>Tacitus</hi> is admitted to be an Author cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
and brief in his Phraſe, by the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there is to cut of the leaſt word of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
without neceſſarily diminiſhing his
thoughts, and doing a notable injury to his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
But it is not ſo with <hi>Saluſt,</hi> who though
he ſtraightens his Stile, puts many things into
his Hiſtory, which are not eſſential to it, and may
be ſevered from it without diſtracting his deſign,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de re Poet. Cap. 24.</note>
or wronging the conduct of it, according to the
obſervation of <hi>Julius Scaliger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have but parcels of the principal Hiſtory
of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> the beginning whereof was at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Rome:</hi> but Two intire pieces of
his remain, <hi>Catilines conſpiracy,</hi> and the <hi>War
againſt Jugurtha;</hi> from whence may be drawn
ſufficient proofs of what I have ſaid of him. As
for the firſt, though ſmall, it has Two <hi>Prefaces,</hi>
whereof that which precedes, and is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Declamation againſt idleneſs, may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
be called a true <hi>Saddle for all Horſes;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as <hi>Quintilian</hi> well obſerved, it has nothing
which relates to his Hiſtory, nor any thing which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56273:95"/>
renders it more proper for this than any other
compoſition. It is followed by a <hi>deſcription</hi> of the
good and bad conditions of <hi>Cataline</hi> in Three or
Four periods. And from thence he paſſes to the
Second <hi>Preface,</hi> finding himſelf obliged, as he
ſaies, by the immorality of <hi>Cataline,</hi> to deſcribe
the virtues of the firſt Romans, and that which
made them degenerate in his time. To this end
he begins no nearer, than at the foundation of
<hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> when the Fugitive <hi>Aeneas</hi>
with the reſt, came to diſpute, that part of <hi>Italy</hi>
where it is founded, with the <hi>Aborigines.</hi> He
afterwards ſhews how it was governed by Kings,
who were depoſed for their pride, and how it
became great in a ſhort time, by the virtue of the
Inhabitants, He inſiſts upon the Wars they waged
with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the ſlackning of Diſcipline
which happened ſince; and the civil Diſſentions
of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> which had like to have
made the Republick deſolate. All this he relates
to come at length to <hi>Catilines</hi> time, the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
of all; and which ſeemed to invite that
bad Citizen to enterpriſe his conſpiracy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
methinks, it cannot be properly ſaid, that
he who takes occaſion to write, though very well,
ſo many things, before he enters upon his chief
purpoſe, affects brevity. The <hi>Preface</hi> of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurthine
War</hi> is no nearer to its Subject. It is an
Invective againſt thoſe, whom Vice and Riot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorted
from imbracing thoſe occupations of the
mind, wherewith Nature had ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56273:95"/>
them. He pretends not to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and therefore judging it in no wiſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
conſidering the corruption of the Age, to
intereſs himſelf in the Government of the State,
he declares he will endeavour to be uſeful to it,
by the imployment he undertakes of writing
Hiſtory; and will begin with that of the Wars
which the Romans had againſt <hi>Jugurtha.</hi> But
we cannot better ſhow, with what liberty he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
upon all he thought, might render his
work more agreeable, than by the <hi>Digreſſion</hi> of
thoſe Two Brothers named the <hi>Philani,</hi> who died
ſo gloriouſly, for the love of their Country: and
that upon the pretext alone of Two <hi>Deputies</hi> of
the little <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Leptes,</hi> ſituate between the
Two <hi>Syrtes,</hi> who came to <hi>Metellus</hi> after the
taking of <hi>Thala;</hi> where he takes occaſion to ſay,
that he thinks fit to relate a Notable action, which
happened in the ſame Country, of Two <hi>Young
Men of Carthage,</hi> who buried themſelves alive
to increaſe the Territory of their Nation. And
thereupon he makes a curious deſcription of the
State differences, and Wars, which the <hi>Cyreni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
heretofore had with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their limits, and how they agreed upon
a courſe, wherein the Two <hi>Philaeni,</hi> after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
diligence, were contented for the good of
their Country, to take ſo generous a reſolution.
It is certain that the <hi>War of Jugurtha</hi> might have
been deſcribed as well without this Digreſſion;
and if <hi>Saluſt</hi> had affected to be conciſe in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56273:96"/>
Hiſtory, he would doubtleſs have forborne it. Which
induces me to affirm, that though his Expreſſion
or Phraſe was very ſhort, as was that of <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
it does not reſtrain him from being large like
<hi>Livy,</hi> in the body of his Hiſtory, who uſes not
ſuch confined expreſſions. And perhaps <hi>Servilius
Nonianus</hi> had no other meaning, when he ſpoke
theſe words mentioned by <hi>Quintilian, Viz.</hi> that
<hi>Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> were rather <hi>equal</hi> than <hi>alike,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. inſt. c. 1.</note>
                  <hi>pares eos magis eſſe quam ſimiles,</hi> becauſe both of
them handled their Subjects very diffuſedly
though in different manner.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be very ſorry if it be thought, that by
marking this Digreſſion of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> I ſeek to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it. It ſeems to me very agreeable; and I
am of the opinion, that no ſort of <hi>Epiſodes</hi> are to
be blamed, unleſs when they are unreaſonably
uſed: not would I be underſtood to arraign him
for what I have related concerning his Phraſe and
expreſſion, either as too new, or too old, deſiring
not to be of the number of thoſe that cenſure a
whole work, for a word which diſpleaſes them.
It is good to avoid as much as one can, that
form of ſpeech which is out of uſe, or which is
not enough uſed: and perhaps <hi>Saluſt</hi> in the time
he writ, was juſtly reproved upon that account,
conſidering the authority of his Accuſers. But
we ought not to be too ſcrupulous in that point,
and I deſire thoſe that are ſo nice, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuffer any thing in language, that grates them
never ſo little, to conſider what <hi>Dion Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomus,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56273:96"/>
one of the moſt celebrated Oratours of
<hi>Greece,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orat. 22.</note> obſerves, when he deſcribes the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Eloquence of <hi>Homer.</hi> He ſaies that he
freely uſed all Dialects, and as a Painter mixes
his Colours, he agreeably mingled the <hi>Dorick,
Attick,</hi> and <hi>Ionick Dialects,</hi> He made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to imploy a ſignificant term, were it never
ſo Ancient, and not commonly approved of; and
therefore <hi>Dion</hi> compares him to thoſe who have
found a Treaſure, and ſell old pieces of Gold
and Silver, whoſe worth is eſteemed becauſe of
their intrinſick valew, though they are not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
coin. And where he found energy and grace,
though in new and barbarous words, he compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, ſaies he, freely in his verſes; as often
as there was occaſion to expreſs, the murmure of
running Waters, the noiſe of Winds, or ſome
ſuch reſemblance. In the mean time (adds this
Great <hi>Oratour</hi>) whatever liberty <hi>Homer</hi> took, he
is acknowledged to be the moſt eloquent of all
Poets, and the Prince of thoſe of his Profeſſion.
And we ought to give the like judgment of the
Eloquence of Hiſtory or Oratory, as <hi>Dion</hi> does
of that of <hi>Homer;</hi> but becauſe I have inſiſted
upon it largely enough in another Treatiſe, I ſhall
ſay no more of it here.</p>
               <p>To return to <hi>Saluſt,</hi> it is no wonder that he
was diſcommended for his Stile,<note place="margin">Vell. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere. in voce Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</note> ſince <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
whom he had propoſed to himſelf for a Rule
and Prototype, was not free from cenſure. Yet
this did not hinder <hi>Zenobius</hi> a Greek Sophiſter,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56273:97"/>
who lived in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour,
from taking the pains to tranſlate the Hiſtory of
<hi>Saluſt</hi> into Greek, ſo great a reputation it had
amongſt thoſe of his Nation, as well as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports.<note place="margin">L. 9. cont. decl. 1.</note> But the judgment of
<hi>Seneca</hi> in behalf of our <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
who writes in one of his <hi>Declamations,</hi>
that <hi>Saluſt</hi> only equalled by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> to <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi>
ſurpaſſed him in his conciſe way of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and as he terms it, <hi>conquered him even in his
own fortification,</hi> in the place where he ſeemed to
have the greateſt advantage, <hi>cum ſit praecipua in</hi>
Thucydide <hi>virtus brevitas, hac eum</hi> Saluſtius <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,
&amp; in ſuis eum caſtris caecidit.</hi> His reaſon is,
becauſe one may take away ſomething from a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> impairing a little the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of it, but not utterly ſpoiling it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
to do the like to the expreſſions of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> they
will be very perceptibly defaced. And <hi>Seneca</hi>
complains thereupon of the injuſtice of <hi>Livy</hi> who
endeavoured on the contrary to advance <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
above <hi>Salust.</hi> It was not ſaid he, for the great
affection he bore <hi>Thucydides</hi> that he prefers him,
but becauſe he is not jealous of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he does it to get more eaſily the applauſe
from <hi>Saluſt,</hi> whom he had ranked below the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> was of another fancy,
when he preferred one <hi>Caecilius</hi> to <hi>Saluſt, Cato</hi> to
<hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Hadr.</note> and <hi>Ennius</hi> to <hi>Virgil.</hi> But <hi>Spartianus,</hi> who
took notice of the capricious judgment of this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56273:97"/>
                  <hi>Prince,</hi> ſhows us that of Another as advantagious
to our <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Sev.</note> as this was prejudicial. He writes
that <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> at the point of death, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf ſubdued by ſickneſs, ſent to his Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Son that <hi>Divine Oration</hi> (ſo he terms it)
which <hi>Salust</hi> makes <hi>Micipſa</hi> at his death ſpeak
to his <hi>Children,</hi> to exhort them to concord: This
Oration is in the beginning of the <hi>Jugurthine
War;</hi> and by the credit it received from that
<hi>Emperour,</hi> it makes its Author be valued above
that contempt of him, which <hi>Adrian</hi> expoſed,
and none ever imitated.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Oration</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> aſcribed to
<hi>Saluſt,</hi> which is a counterfeit, and ought not to
be admitted as his, for it is not an Hiſtorical
work; and all the learned agree, that how An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſoever it may be, and notwithſtanding that
it is quoted by <hi>Quintilian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 4. inſt. cap. 1.</note> yet <hi>Saluſt</hi> never was
the true Author of it. But there is not a like
conſent amongſt the Criticks, in what relates to
the <hi>Two Orations,</hi> or rather <hi>Epistles</hi> addreſſed to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> probably about the time when he made
War in <hi>Spain,</hi> and which treat of the order that
might be eſtabliſhed in the Government of the
Republick. <hi>Lewis Carrion</hi> cannot be perſwaded
that they are of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> eſpecially conſidering
that none of the Ancients, who often quoted paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of his writings, ever recited any part of theſe
Two <hi>Epiſtles. John Douza</hi> on the contrary part
affirms, that their Stile, and the Faith of all
Manuſcripts ought to oblige us, to hold they

that none can deny that they are very Ancient,
and were writ in the time of the purity of the
Latin Language.</p>
               <p>It is of much more importance to obſerve,
that from <hi>Saluſt</hi> may be drawn a certain Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
that all judgments of the manners of men
by their writings, are not receivable. No one
ever ſpoke better ſentences than he, in favour of all
ſort of Virtues, and chiefly of Chaſtity; nor uſed
more rigid invectives againſt the exceſs and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of his time. But notwithſtanding this, it is
recorded, that his immorality made him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the <hi>Senate</hi> by the Cenſors: and that being
taken in Adultery with <hi>Fauſta</hi> the Daughter of

that <hi>Caeſar</hi> reſtored him to his dignity of <hi>Senatour</hi>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56273:98"/>
to recover his former State and Riches;
which laſt he purſued with ſo much Tyranny,
that (though after he had ranſacked the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and found a way to be abſolved by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he
could not eſcape the infamy of his actions, which
was ſo much the greater in him, becauſe it was
conſidered how ſeverely he had in his Hiſtory,
expoſed thoſe who were much leſs guilty than he,
and <hi>Metellus</hi> amongſt others, whoſe exceſs and
expences in <hi>Spain</hi> he very much arraigned) He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
ſo rich from <hi>Africa,</hi> that he immediately
purchaſed one of the nobleſt dwellings in <hi>Rome,</hi>
in the <hi>Mount Quirinal,</hi> with Spacious Gardens,
which are at this day called the <hi>Gardens of Saluſt;</hi>
and beſides this he had a Country houſe at <hi>Tivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
which <hi>Cicero</hi> tells him of in the ſame Oration.
His life therefore was very different from his
writings; and his Example alone is ſufficient to
prove, that as very good men may write very bad
Books, ſo vicious men ſometimes may compoſe
thoſe that are good; it being not incongruous that
an Author ſhould at the ſame time be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hiſtorian, and a wicked man.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the things obſerved in him, and which
are moſt conducing to the recommendation of his
Hiſtory, is his imbarking purpoſely to take a preciſe
view of the places in <hi>Africk,</hi> of which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make a deſcription; becauſe it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
ſo to do, for the better underſtanding of what
he writ. And this was the practice of the beſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians;
and <hi>Meſſenio</hi>'s words in <hi>Plautus,</hi> ſhow
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56273:99"/>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56273:99"/>
Direct, inſtead of being Oblique; becauſe though
he, and ſome others are of that opinion, yet it is
ſubject to much debate. <hi>Saluſt</hi> inſerts <hi>Letters</hi> in
his writings, without regarding whither that of
<hi>Lentulus</hi> to <hi>Cataline,</hi> or that other of <hi>Mithridates</hi>
to <hi>Arſaces,</hi> does interrupt the contexture of his
Narrations. But though theſe are little things,
yet they deſerve to be taken notice of in great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
for an example. If <hi>Keckerman,</hi> and ſome
modern Writers, had been touched with ſuch a
reaſonable conſideration, they would not have
condemned, as they did, all ſort of blame or praiſe
given by an Hiſtorian. The reaſon they give for
their opinion is weak, ſaying that ſuch things are
more the buſineſs of an Oratour; and according
to them, a naked Narration leads a Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
enough, to eſteem or diſapprove the actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented:
for they obſerve not, that an Oratour
and an Hiſtorian have many things in common,
which makes <hi>Cicero</hi> ſay ſome where, that Hiſtory
is the moſt important part of Oratory,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
JULIUS CAESAR</head>
               <p>THE name of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is ſo illuſtrious,
that nothing can be added to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of his works, of what nature
ſoever they are, after it is ſaid that he is the
Author of them. So that he is not indebted to
his military actions alone, for the high reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that follows him; ſince his learning has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
little leſs to it than his Arms; and he
is not leſs glorious by the Crown he received
from the <hi>Muſes</hi> upon their <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> than his
Triumphs by <hi>Bellona</hi>'s ſide in the Fields of <hi>Mars.</hi>
Which made <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſay, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpoke
writ and fought by the ſame Spirit, and that the
ſame happy <hi>Genius</hi> which favoured all his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">L. 10. inſ. c. 1. eodem animo dixiſſe quo bellavit.</note>
animated even his Orations and writings.
It is obſervable, that amongſt the praiſes which
the Ancients gave to the Orators of that time;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56273:100"/>
though they valued much the ſharpneſs of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,</hi>
the gravity of <hi>Brutus,</hi> the diligence of
<hi>Pollio,</hi> the judgment of <hi>Calvus,</hi> and the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> they admired above all the
vigour of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Stile, <hi>vim, Caeſaris:</hi> as if the
ſame virtue by which he executed ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
exploits, had inſpired him with that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and vehemence, by which he was alwaies
ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of that
Age. But if it may be fit to enlarge on this
ſubject, and draw new parallels of the learning
and valour of this incomparable Prince; it will
not be difficult to ſhew, that <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and
<hi>Africa,</hi> even all the parts of the world then
known, divided his Conqueſts: nor has he leſs
penetrated into the intellectual Globe, having
hardly left any Science uncultivated, and not
improved to admiration. In his moſt tender age
he compoſed the <hi>Praiſe of Hercules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſcon. Pedia.</note> and wrot the
<hi>Tragedy of Oedipus,</hi> and ſome other Poems under
the Title <hi>Julii,</hi> which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> afterwards did
forbid to be publiſhed. We cannot affirm, what
the Poem called <hi>Iter</hi> was, which <hi>Suetonius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But as for that Epigram which ſome aſcribe
to him,<note place="margin">In Caeſ. cap. 56.</note> and others to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> made upon
the young <hi>Thracian</hi> which fell into the River <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brus,</hi>
as he played upon the Ice; it is one of the
moſt delicate pieces of all Latin Poetry. Great
was his fame in Oratory, as it is before expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and his Orations for the <hi>Bithynians</hi> for the
<hi>Law Plautia,</hi> for <hi>Decius à Samnite,</hi> for <hi>Sextilius,</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:56273:101"/>
and many others (which are now wanting) gave
a certain Teſtimony of his excellency therein. At
the age of One and Twenty, he ſolemnly accuſed
<hi>Dolabella:</hi> and being no more then <hi>Quaeſtor</hi> he
compoſed the funeral Orations of his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi>
and his Wife <hi>Cornelia;</hi> and his two <hi>Anticatones</hi>
ſhewed what he could do in <hi>Satyr;</hi> as his Two
other books of <hi>Analogy</hi> gave him no ſmall place
amongſt the moſt eſteemed <hi>Grammarians.</hi> He
wrot ſome Treatiſes of preſaging by the flight of
Birds; and others of <hi>Augury;</hi> and ſome of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms</hi>
or ſhort and witty ſentences. But what
he publiſht of the motion of the Stars, which he
had learned in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> deſerves ſo much the
more to be conſidered, becauſe it Prognoſticated
his own death on the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March</hi> (if the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Pliny</hi> may be credited) nor muſt we omit
the mention of his reformation of the <hi>Calendar,</hi>

which ſucceeded that work. I paſs over the <hi>Ephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides</hi>
or <hi>Journals</hi> mentioned by <hi>Servius,</hi> which
he left, to proceed to his <hi>Commentaries,</hi> which
are his Hiſtorical writings that we now propoſe
to examine, and the only work remaining of ſo
many different pieces, whereof methinks a perfect
<hi>Encyclopaedie</hi> might be made.</p>
               <p>The Title of theſe Commentaries alone makes
it manifeſt, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had no deſign to write a
compleat Hiſtory.<note place="margin">In Beuto.</note> They are ſo naked, ſaies <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
and ſtript of all thoſe ornaments of Oration,
which he was very capable to give them; that
though they are extreamly agreeable in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56273:101"/>
they are, they are to be taken for nothing
elſe but Notes prepared by him, for their uſe
who would compile a Hiſtory of his time. And
though materials ſo well provided might have
excited ſome perſons raſh enough to attempt
any thing, to try their skill to refine and poliſh
them: yet all judicious men have abſtained from
doing it, and others that perhaps endeavoured in
it, have found themſelves altogether unable,
and unlikely to gain to themſelves any Honour,
by medling with a deſign framed by ſo great an
Artificer. His pure and elegant Stile is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
compared to that of <hi>Xenophon.</hi> And though
he is brief, nothing that is obſcure can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him; for the places wherein he ſeems
any thing difficult are without doubt corrupted.
Since we know that he was ſo far from falling
into the vice of obſcurity,<note place="margin">A Gell. l. 1. Noct. Att. c. 10. &amp; Macr. l. 1. Satur. c. 5.</note> that he himſelf gives
it as an important precept, to avoid like a Bock
all expreſſions that are not frequently uſed, and
thereby leſs proper to explain a thing neatly and
clearly. As for the matters whereof he treats in
his Commentaries, they are his own actions
which he deſcribes, and he recounts few events
that he has not ſeen.<note place="margin">In Caeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar. 56.</note> Nevertheleſs <hi>Suetonius</hi> makes
<hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> accuſe him of not having been exact
enough, and even to have ſwerved ſometimes
from truth, either through credulity when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
on falſe reports, or wittingly for defect of
memory; ſo that as the ſaid <hi>Aſinius</hi> conjectures,
if he had lived, he would have reviewed his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56273:102"/>
Commentaries, and corrected them in ſeveral
places. To ſay the truth, his report is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in many things that concern himſelf, from
what we read of him in other Authors, ſuch as
<hi>Dion,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> who have writ on the ſame
ſubject. An Example of this (to inſtance no
more) may be obſerved, in what he writes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that publick Treaſure, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from the time that <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> not to be made uſe of but in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
neceſſity. He pretends that <hi>Lentulus</hi> who
had order to ſend it to <hi>Pompey,</hi> abandoned it by
his flight, upon the firſt Rumour that <hi>Caeſars</hi>
Troops began to be maſters of <hi>Rome,</hi> though it
was a falſe report. But that which is received
for a certain truth in this matter, is, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>
intending as <hi>Tribune,</hi> to hinder <hi>Caeſar</hi> from
ſeizing on the Treaſure, was forced to quit the
City, being terrified by the Menaces of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
who made the Gates of the place where that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
of War and of the State was kept to be
forced open, which proved a wonderful advantage
to his deſigns. This ſhews that it is oftentimes
no leſs difficult to an Hiſtorian, than any other
writer, to reſiſt the temptations of humanity, and
treat as indifferently of the things which concern
himſelf, as thoſe wherein he is no way intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
For my part I doubt not, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid
many things of the Ancient <hi>Gaules,</hi> which would
be contradicted by their Hiſtories, if any of them
had been preſerved to our time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:56273:102"/>
Some Criticks have maintained,<note place="margin">Fr. Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, et Lud. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> that neither
the Three Books of the <hi>Civil War,</hi> nor the Seven
of the <hi>War of the Gaules,</hi> were writ by <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
but ſuch an opinion is ſo groundleſs that it
merits not the leaſt reflection. As for the
Eighth book of the laſt mentioned work, moſt
agree that <hi>Hirtius</hi> was the Author of it, who
writ alſo the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
Africa,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Though ſome aſcribe
them to <hi>Oppius</hi> an intimate friend of <hi>Caeſars,</hi>
who likewiſe wrot a Treatiſe, to prove that the
Son of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which ſhe pretended to have
had by the ſame <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was not of his begetting.
Whoſoever was the Author of the laſt book of the
War of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> appeared to have been much
in the favour and confidence of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for he
ſaies in one place, that though all that read the
writings of <hi>Caeſar</hi> admire them as well as he, yet
he had more reaſon to do it than others, becauſe
they conſider in them only the purity of Phraſe,
and excellency of Stile; but he who knew with
what facility and expedition he uſed his Pen,
had a more particular ſubject of admiration. This
paſſage calls to my memory the noble Elogy
which <hi>Pliny</hi> gave him (<hi>viz.</hi>) to have ſurpaſſed in
vigor of mind all the reſt of Mankind.<note place="margin">L. 7. Nat. hiſt. c. 25.</note> He writ
that he has been ſeen at the ſame time to read,
write, dictate, and hear what was ſaid to him;
and adds that he made nothing at once to dictate
to Four Secretaries; and when he was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by other affairs, he uſually imploied Seven
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56273:103"/>
to write under him. This activity of thought is
as if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ere ſomething more than human, and
indeed the greatneſs of his genius would be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wholely incomparable, ſhould we examine it
exactly in the extent of all his actions: but this
being not the proper place for ſuch an inquiry, we
ſhall confine our ſelf to what particularly concerns
his Commentaries.</p>
               <p>They are deſtitute of many Rhetorical Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as we have already obſerved, yet they
contain both Oblique and Direct Orations: and
they have been ſo valued by all Nations, that
they are tranſlated into moſt languages. <hi>Selimus</hi>
the Great cauſed them to be turned into <hi>Arabick.</hi>
And it is held that the reading of them, which
was no leſs agreeable than ordinary with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much to the conqueſt of ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
wherewith he augmented his Empire. And
<hi>Henry the Fourth</hi> that famous Monarch of <hi>Franco,</hi>
took the pains to tranſlate into <hi>French</hi> thoſe that
related to the War of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
were no ſmall aſſiſtance to that Heroick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
wherewith his whole life was animated. It
was under <hi>Florence Chriſtian</hi> his Tutor, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook

who affirms that he ſaw it writ by the <hi>Kings</hi>
own hand, adds, that he told him he was recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
his matter, to write commentaries of his
own actions, which he would finiſh as ſoon as his
leaſure would permit. But God was not pleaſed
to allow him that leaſure, and his haſty death,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56273:103"/>
by a crime more deteſtable than was that of the
Murtherers of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> has deprived us of thoſe
<hi>Second Commentaries,</hi> which might have made a
greater reſemblance between theſe Two Princes,
than there is; though the clemency, valour, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and ſeveral other virtues wherein they

that if <hi>Cicero</hi> had attempted to write a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
he would have been inferiour to him in
the performance of it. But without reflecting on
either to their diſadvantage by ſuch compariſons,
we may ſay that they both excelled in their way
of ſtudy; and as never any one was heard with ſo
much attention and tranſport at <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Cicero,</hi>
ſo we have no example of a reputation higher and
more glorious in reſpect of Hiſtory than that of
<hi>Livy. Pliny</hi> the Younger has left us a memorable
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56273:104"/>
paſſage of his fame in one of his Epiſtles. Where
he ſaies that his Predeceſſors ſaw a man come
into <hi>Italy</hi> from the extremities of <hi>Spain</hi> (which
was then counted the remoteſt place of the Earth
in the Weſt) to have the ſatisfaction to ſee <hi>Livy,</hi>
and injoy for ſome time his converſation, who
ſought no other diverſion than the diſcourſe he
had with ſo great a perſon; and though the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City of the world where he found him had
many rarities to entertain his curioſity, nothing
thereof could detain him, after he had converſed
ſome time with him for whoſe ſake he undertook
ſuch a journey. But we muſt obſerve that the
credit <hi>Livy</hi> has amongſt the learned, is not only
for the writing of this Hiſtory, for he had writ
certain <hi>Philoſophical Dialogues</hi> before he came to
<hi>Rome,</hi> which he dedicated to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi>
and which acquired him the love and protection
of that renowned Monarch, the moſt favourable
to the <hi>Muſes</hi> that ever governed the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.<note place="margin">Ep. 101.</note>
And beſides theſe <hi>Dialogues</hi> which are
mentioned by <hi>Seneca,</hi> we learn from <hi>Quintilian,</hi>
that in a <hi>Letter</hi> to his <hi>Son</hi> he delivered excellent
Precepts of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. inſt. cap. 1.</note> wherein he eſpecially
commended to his reading the writings of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi>
and <hi>Cicero,</hi> bidding him neglect many
other Authors, unleſs any were found amongſt
them, to reſemble thoſe which he adviſed him
to have alwaies in his view.<note place="margin">In Claud. cap. 41.</note> And one may read
in <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that <hi>Livy</hi> was choſen amongſt the
moſt learned men of his Age, to take care of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56273:105"/>

and in his younger years by the advice
of this his <hi>Tutor,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to write the Roman Hiſtory, of which he
gave many volumes to the Publick which are loſt
to us. As to the writings of <hi>Livy</hi> the laſt and
moſt conſiderable thereof, is the Hiſtory which
reached from the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> to the death
of <hi>Druſus</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi>

But <hi>Voſſius</hi> and ſome others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
pretend that it is a counterfeit piece, and
can be only impoſed on thoſe who have ears
like <hi>Midas.</hi> For the remaining Fourteen <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi>
we muſt reſt ſatisfied, with that <hi>Summary</hi>
or <hi>Epitomy</hi> which <hi>Florus</hi> compiled, if he was
the Author of a work which many perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
believing him to have been the cauſe of
the loſs of <hi>Livys</hi> writings, a loſs that cannot be
enough lamented. This is the opinion of <hi>Bodin</hi>
who likewiſe accuſes <hi>Juſtin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Meth. hiſt. c. 2.</note> for having done the
ſame prejudice to <hi>Trogus Pompeius, Xiphilinus,</hi>
and <hi>Dion,</hi> in epitomizing them. <hi>Caſaubon</hi> is alſo
of this mind, who thinks that the brief collection
made by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> of a body of Hiſtory in Fifty
Three parts, occaſioned the neglect of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that compoſed it, which were afterwards
loſt. But if the Three Decades and a half which
we have of <hi>Livy,</hi> make us deplore the want of the
reſt, they are yet ſufficient to repreſent him to
our eſteem, moſt worthy of the Elogies which
he received from the Ancients.<note place="margin">Anna 1451.</note> The moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
whereof was that yielded to him, two
hundred years ago by <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi>
when he ſent his Embaſſador to demand of the
Citizens of <hi>Padua,</hi> and obtained from them as a
pretious relique, the bone of that Arm where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this their famous Country-man had writ his
Hiſtory, cauſing it to be conveyed to <hi>Naples</hi> with
all ſorts of honour, as the moſt eſtimable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56273:106"/>
could be made him. And it is ſaid that he
recovered his health from a languiſhing indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
by the delight he had in reading the ſame
Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange to conſider with how much
paſſion others went about to defame if they could,
a perſon of ſuch rare merit. In the Age wherein
he lived <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> arraigned his Stile, which
he called <hi>Patavinity. Auguſtus</hi> taxed him of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favoured <hi>Pompey</hi>'s party, but did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diminiſh his good will towards him. And
<hi>Caligula</hi> a while after, accuſed him of negligence
on the one ſide, and too exceſſive redundancy of
words on the other, taking away his image and
writings from all Libraries, where he knew they
were curiouſly preſerved. But the capricious and
Tyrannick humour of this Prince, was exerciſed
in the ſame manner towards the works and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suet. in Calig. cap. 34. et in Domit. c. 10.</note> And he would have ſuppreſſed
the Verſes of <hi>Homer,</hi> pretending that his power
ought to be no leſs than <hi>Plato</hi>'s who had prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the reading them in his <hi>Imaginary Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
Moreover hating <hi>Seneca,</hi> and all men of
eminent Virtue, it came into his head to aboliſh
the knowledg of Laws, with all thoſe Lawyers
whoſe learned deciſions were reſpected. But the
humorous conceit of ſuch a Monſter cannot preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<hi>Livy,</hi> nor thoſe others we named, no more
than that of <hi>Domitian</hi> a ſecond prodigy of Nature,
who put to death, through a like animoſity, <hi>Metius
Pompoſianus,</hi> becauſe amongſt others he delighted
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56273:106"/>
to expoſe ſome Orations of Kings and Generals,
collected by him out of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Hiſtory. The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of <hi>Augustus</hi> is full of moderation, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that the ſame Hiſtory inſtead of flattering
the victorious Party, could not condemn that
of the good and moſt honeſt men in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
who had all liſted themſelves on
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſide, which rather tends to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Livy</hi> than otherwiſe. But that
which <hi>Pollio</hi> finds fault with in all his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is a thing which deſerves to be a little more
reflected on.</p>
               <p>The moſt common opinion is, that this Roman
Lord accuſtomed to the delicacy of the language
ſpoke in the Court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> could not bear
with certain <hi>Provincial Idioms,</hi> which <hi>Livy</hi> as a
<hi>Paduan</hi> uſed in divers places of his hiſtory. <hi>Pigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
is of another mind, and believes that this
odious <hi>Patavinity</hi> had reſpect only to the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy
of certain words, wherein <hi>Livy</hi> uſed one
letter for another, according to the cuſtome of
his Country, writing <hi>ſibe,</hi> and <hi>quaſe,</hi> for <hi>ſibi,</hi> and
<hi>quaſi;</hi> which he proves by divers Ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.
Some think that it conſiſted meerly
in a repetition, or rather multiplicity of many
Synonymous words in one period, contrary to
what was practiſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they did
not affect ſuch a redundancy which denoted a
Forreigner. Others report that the <hi>Paduans</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwaies been of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, which was
apparently the juſteſt as we have obſerved, <hi>Pollio</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56273:107"/>
that was a <hi>Caeſarian,</hi> derided <hi>Livys Patavinity,</hi>
and accuſed him of having ſhown too great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for the unhappy faction of the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
which ſeems ſo much the likelier, by the
conformity it has with that opinion of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
which we already mentioned. There are thoſe
who likewiſe affirm, that <hi>Livy</hi>'s partiality for
thoſe of <hi>Padua,</hi> appeared manifeſtly in thoſe books
which are loſt, where he was led by his Subject
to an immoderate praiſe of his Country-men.
It is the ſame fault which <hi>Polybius</hi> imputed to
<hi>Philinus</hi> as a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> as a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
And many modern Hiſtorians have been
charged therewith, whereof <hi>Guicciardin</hi> was one,
who to oblige the <hi>Floreutines</hi> dwells ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the leaſt concerns of their State, and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
ſo much their ſmalleſt actions, that he often
becomes troubleſome, and ſometimes ridiculous
in many mens judgment. The quaint <hi>Diſtich</hi> of
<hi>Actius Syncerus,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Poggius</hi> on the
like occaſion, renders it altogether deſpicable,
<q>
                     <l>Dum patriam laudat, damnat dum Poggius hoſtem;</l>
                     <l>Nec malus eſt civis, nec bonus hiſtoricus.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They who rather imagine than prove a like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in <hi>Livy,</hi> pleaſe themſelves with a belief, that
this was that which <hi>Pollio</hi> found fault with in his
Hiſtory, when he was offended that it had too
much <hi>Patavinity.</hi> I rather build upon that ſenſe
which <hi>Quintilian</hi> gives the word,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. inst. cap. 5.</note> who in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
knew in his time the true ſignification of
it. He quotes it in the Chapter of the virtues
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56273:107"/>
and vices of Oration, where he remarks, that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius</hi>
was reproached of having imployed too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Sabine, Tuſcan,</hi> and <hi>Praenestine</hi> words in his
writings; ſo that, ſaies he, <hi>Lucilius</hi> thereupon
laughed at his language, as <hi>Pollio</hi> did at the
<hi>Patavinity</hi> of <hi>Livy.</hi> Wherefore after an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſo expreſs, of ſuch a conſiderable Author
in this reſpect as <hi>Quintilian,</hi> I ſhould be loath to
wreſt the ſignification of that word, which the
Courtiers of <hi>Rome</hi> reproved in the Hiſtory we
ſpeak of, to any other ſenſe than that of Stile and
Phraſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin</hi> informs us, that <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<hi>Livy</hi>'s Orations for being Direct, and too
long; which many attribute to ſome jealouſy,
that might ariſe between Two Authors of the
ſame time and profeſſion,<note place="margin">Lib. 9. inſt. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Quintilian</hi> obſerved
that <hi>Livy</hi> begins his Hiſtory with an <hi>Hexameter
Verſe:</hi> and <hi>Maſcardi</hi> in the Fifth Treatiſe of his
<hi>Art of Hiſtory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> rehearſes many others which he
found there; but there is no proſe where ſome
do not occur, if looked after with too much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.<note place="margin">Tr. 1. c. 4.</note>
The ſame <hi>Maſcardi</hi> taxes him in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place, of having been defective in many
important circumſtances,<note place="margin">L. 9. contr. decl. 1.</note> which we read in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,</hi>
and which he ought not to have omitted. I
have already ſhown in a precedent Section, how
<hi>Seneca</hi> the Rhetorician accuſes <hi>Livy,</hi> of having
ſuffered himſelf to be ſwayed by envy, when he
gave <hi>Thucydides</hi> the preference to <hi>Saluſt.</hi> I here
add in oppoſition to <hi>Voſſius</hi> his opinion, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56273:108"/>
although <hi>Seneca</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> conferred the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of moſt Eloquent upon <hi>Livy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Ira. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ult.</note> he does like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
reprove him in the ſame place, for having
attributed to any man greatneſs of wit without
goodneſs, believing them to be inſeparable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
And in another place on the ſubject of
the <hi>Great Library of Alexandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de. tranq. c. 9.</note> he blames him
for commeding the care of thoſe Kings who
founded it; and yet pretending, that they did it
rather in a vain oſtentation of glory, than a true
affection for books. But ſuch <hi>Stoical</hi> Auſterities
do not much wound the reputation of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
who ſpeaks according to the common ſenſe
of things, and is not obliged to follow all the
opinions of Philoſophers. But if <hi>Antoninus</hi> his
<hi>Itinerary,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbum</hi> expoſed was
true,<note place="margin">Vide Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium de Hiſt. Lati. pag. 95. cap. 19.</note> it would be a hard matter to excuſe <hi>Livy</hi> of a
great fault which he accuſes him of, in ſpeaking of
<hi>Fanus Volturna,</hi> which was his ſuppreſſing of the
moſt gallant actions of the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> whereof he
envyed them the glory. But it is of importance
to know, that the impudent ſuppoſition of <hi>Annius</hi>
in this reſpect, appears manifeſtly in the good
editions of that <hi>Itinerary,</hi> which we have from
<hi>Simler,</hi> and <hi>Surita,</hi> wherein nothing like that is
read, becauſe it is a ſlanderous addition of the
<hi>Impostour,</hi> who ſoiſted in this corrupt relation
with that Comment, whereof we have ſo often
complained already. But I find it a harder task
to anſwer the zeal of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who
would not ſuffer <hi>Livy's</hi> Works in any Chriſtian
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56273:108"/>
Library, becauſe of his Pagan Superſtition; which I
remember I read in the <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Caſaubon</hi> upon
<hi>Polybius.</hi> And indeed it cannot be denyed that
his Hiſtory is filled with many Prodigies, which
denote a great adherence to Idolatry. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an Ox ſpoke; one while a Mule ingender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
another time Men, Women, and Cocks, and
Hens changed their Sex. There are often ſhowers
of Flint-ſtones, Fleſh, Chalk, Blood, and Milk.
and the Statues of the Gods be mentioned to
ſpeak, ſhed tears, and ſwet pure blood. How
many Ghoſts are made to appear; Armies ready
to ingage in Heaven; with Lakes and Rivers of
Blood; and the like? So that no Hiſtorian ever
reported ſo much of the vulgar's vain belief of that
time, as he. But we ſhould condemn almoſt all
the books of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> if our Religion received
any prejudice from ſuch trifles. One might
moreover repreſent to <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> that <hi>Livy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
all thoſe and ſome others of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
no otherwiſe than as fond opinions of the
vulgar,<note place="margin">Dec. 1. l. 5. et dec. 3. lib. 1. et 4.</note> and uncertain rumours which he derides;
often proteſting, that although he is obliged to
report them; becauſe they made ſuch an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
impreſſion upon the minds of moſt men of
that time, and had a mighty influence on the
greateſt affairs, yet there was nothing therein but
vanity and impoſture.</p>
               <p>Some modern Authors have been found,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de conſec. hiſt. Jul. Scal. l. 1. poet. c. 2.</note> ſuch
as <hi>Bodin, Benius,</hi> and others like them, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to cenſure <hi>Livy</hi>'s Stile for being too Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56273:109"/>
in ſome places, too prolix in others, and
often unlike it ſelf. But theſe are raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and worthier of pitty than conſideration,
chiefly in reſpect to thoſe that give them. Yet
the like cannot be ſaid of <hi>Budaeus,</hi> and <hi>Henricus
Glareanus,</hi> that accuſe him of injuſtice to the
<hi>Gaules</hi> in all his narrations, where he treats of
them and their Wars. I know they who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to defend him from this imputation,
reply in his behalf, that if the powerful conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Protector, could not
hinder him from ſpeaking honourably, not only
of <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib 4. annal.</note> but even of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> as
<hi>Cremutius Cordus</hi> teſtifies in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he ſhould refrain from ſaying the truth
in what concerned the <hi>Gaules,</hi> out of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Animoſity, to render himſelf more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Romans. But it is certain, he was
borne away herein with the common tide of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and that there was no Latin Hiſtorian of
that time, who did not as well as he uſe all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ill, to oblige the <hi>Italian,</hi> either through
flattery or ignorance, taking their relations from
the reports of the victorious, who ſuppreſſed all
the memorials of others.</p>
               <p>So general a fault nevertheleſs, ought not to
hinder us from eſteeming <hi>Livy</hi> in particular, as
one of the firſt men of his Country. He was of
<note n="†" place="margin">Priori nomine Patavium appellata.</note> 
                  <hi>Padua,</hi> and not of<note n="*" place="margin">Vicus ad Euganeos colles in Italiâ prope Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavium.</note> 
                  <hi>Aponus,</hi> as <hi>Sigonius</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
becauſe of a verſe in <hi>Martial</hi> which puts
one place for another, by a figure ordinary enough
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56273:109"/>
to Poets. His reſidence at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the favour
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> afforded him the means to have
all the inſtructions neceſſary for the compiling of
his Hiſtory. He compoſed one part of it in that
<hi>Capital</hi> of the Empire, and the other at <hi>Naples</hi>
whither he retired from time to time to digeſt
his matter with leſs diſturbance. After that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
death he returned to the place of his Birth,
where he was received with unparalell'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and applauſes by the <hi>Paduans,</hi> and there
he dyed in the Fourth year of the Reign of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and the very day of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>January,</hi>
which was alſo <hi>Ovids</hi> laſt day, according to the
obſervation of <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicles.</hi> His life
was lately delivered unto us by <hi>Jacobus Philippus
Thomaſinus</hi> the <hi>Paduan Biſhop,</hi> who omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that a <hi>Paduan</hi> could ſay, to the advantage of
One whom he conſiders as the glory of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
He mingled in all places of his Hiſtory Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and Direct Orations, wherein his Eloquence
principally appears. And he did not refrain from
Digreſſions, though he excuſes himſelf for it, in
the Ninth Book of his firſt Decade, on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe renown, he ſaies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him to reflect upon the probable ſucceſs he
might have had againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> if he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
them. He makes a queſtion of equalling
Ten or Twelve Roman Captains to that invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monarch, but manages it with ſo much diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
on one ſide, and ſo much flattery on the
other, that it is the place in his whole Hiſtory,

which is the leaſt agreeable to a judicious Reader.
Is it not ridiculous to ſay upon ſo ſerious a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was compoſed of as
many Kings, as there were Senators? And ought
he not to have conſidered, that <hi>Alexander</hi> led
Twenty Generals under his command, <hi>Ptolemaeus,
Lyſimachus, Caſſander, Leonatus, Philotas, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,
Eumenes, Parmenio, Cleander, Polyperchon,
Perdiccas, Clitus, Ephestion,</hi> and others like them,
more renowned and experienced in military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
if we may judge by their actions, than all
thoſe Roman Chiefs which he pretends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to him? To ſay the truth, that his Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
examined in all its parts, is more worthy of a
declamer, than of an Hiſtorian of <hi>Livy</hi>'s reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
VELLEIUS PATERCULUS.</head>
               <p>THOUGH <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> in the Two
Books he compoſed, pretended only to write
an Epitomy of the Roman Hiſtory, from the
Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> to the time wherein he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which as he himſelf reports, was in the Reign
of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Yet he began his
Treatiſe with things more Ancient, for though
the beginning of his firſt Book is loſt, we never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
find, in the remains of it, the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of many Cities more Ancient than <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Originals whereof he diſcovers, before he
deſcribes the Foundation of that great <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>
He was of an illuſtrious extraction as appears
by thoſe of his family,<note place="margin">Vide Voſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium de ſcriptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. Lib. 2.</note> who had ſignaliſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the exerciſe of many of the greateſt
imployments of the Roman Empire. And he
himſelf having gloriouſly ſucceeded in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56273:111"/>
profeſſion, ſaies that the remembrance of
the countries he had ſeen, during the time he
commanded in the Armies, and in his voyages
through the Provinces of <hi>Thrace, Macedonia,
Achaia, Aſia</hi> the leſs, and other more Eaſterly
Regions, eſpecially thoſe upon both the ſhores
of the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea, furniſhed his mind with moſt
agreeable diverſions. Whereby one may judge
that if he had writ this Hiſtory as intire and
large, as he ſometimes promiſed, we ſhould have
found many things very conſiderable in it, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a man who was ſo Eminent an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,
and had a ſhare in the execution of the
nobleſt part of them. In that little which is left,
wherein he repreſents all compendiouſly, divers
particulars are related that are no where elſe to
be found; which happens either by the ſilence of
other Hiſtorians in thoſe matters, or the ordinary
loſs of part of their labours.</p>
               <p>The Stile of <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> is very worthy
of his Age, which was alſo the time of pure lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
His greateſt excellence lies in diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
or praiſing thoſe he ſpeaks of; which he
does in the ſofteſt terms and moſt delicate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
that are ſeen in any other Hiſtorian
or Oratour. But he is blamed, and perhaps with
reaſon, for flattering too much the Party and
Houſe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and making extravagant Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
not only of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but even of his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> whoſe merit he celebrates as of one
of the prime and moſt virtuous perſons, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56273:111"/>
the Roman Common wealth has produced. But
the like fault may be obſerved in many others
that have writ the Hiſtory of their own times,
with a deſign to publiſh it whilſt they lived.
However it was, <hi>Lipſius</hi> imagined that thoſe
his exceſſive praiſes of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> were the cauſe
of his fall, and the ruine of the reſt of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Favourites friends, who were almoſt all
put to death upon his account; but yet this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
can paſs for nothing but a meer conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
ſince it is no here elſe to be ſeen. The
nature of his Epitomy did not (it ſeems) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of Orations. Yet an Oblique one is ſeen in
his Second Book, which he introduces the Son
of <hi>Tigranes</hi> to ſpeak before <hi>Pompey,</hi> to procure
his favour. I find beſides a very remarkable thing
in his Stile, to wit, that amongſt all the Figures
of Oratory which he uſes, he imploies the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema</hi>
ſo gracefully, that perhaps no One ever
equalled him in that reſpect. So that in all or
moſt of the events which he mentions, there are
few that he does not conclude with one of theſe
ſententious reflections, which Rhetoricians call
by that name. And beſides the beauty of that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
when it is judiciouſly imployed, as he knew
how to do it, there is nothing inſtructs a reader
more uſefully, than that ſort of Corollary apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the end of the chief actions of every narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He ſhewed his great inclination to Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
in his invective againſt <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi>
on the Subject of his proſcription, and the death
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56273:112"/>
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> whom none ever raiſed higher than he
does in that place, and in another of the ſame
book, where he acknowledges that without ſuch
a perſon, <hi>Greece</hi> though overcome in Arms,
might have boaſted to have been victorious in
wit. And this he did in purſuance of that zeal,
which made him declare in his firſt book, that
excepting thoſe whom this Oratour ſaw, or by
whom he was ſeen and heard, there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Romans who ought to be admired for
their Eloquence, which was a faculty as to the
excelling part, as it were incloſed only in the
ſpace of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s life.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Two Books of the abridged Hiſtory
of <hi>Velleius Paterculus,</hi> a Fragment has been ſeen
which is aſcribed to him, touching the defeat of
ſome Roman Legions in the Country of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Civitatem non muro, ſed vallo foſsaque &amp;c. quam appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, è no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine deae Ciſae, quam religioſiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.

And of that part amongſt others where this
ſmall writing place a City called <hi>Cicera,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that of a Legion there ingaged, <hi>Verres</hi>
alone eſcaped, whom the above mentioned <hi>Cicero</hi>
cauſed afterwards to be condemned with infamy,
for having during his Proconſulſhip in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
uſed ſuch extortions in ſo important a Province,
that they had like to have made it deſolate. But
moſt learned men, &amp; <hi>Velſerus</hi> with <hi>Voſſius</hi> amongſt
the reſt, declaim againſt this piece, which they
affirm to be counterfeit as well by the Stile,
which ſeems of an Age much inferiour to that of
<hi>Paterculus,</hi> as by the matter whereof it treats,
wherein they find great abſurdities. But laying
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56273:112"/>
aſide the doubtful judgment of Criticks, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in reſpect of the true Phraſe of this Author,
that excepting the faults which proceed rather
from his tranſcribers than himſelf, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
than the Original, we have nothing more
pure in all the Latin Language than his Writings;
nor more worthy of the times of <hi>Augustus</hi> and

ſo eminent an Hiſtorian as <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi>
to deſcribe the actions of his life. I take him
to be one of the greateſt Authors they had; and
the excellency of his Stile would oblige me to

and to make him paſs for him of whom
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks in one of his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> if the more

Contemporary; and ſome to have lived in

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56273:113"/>
paſſages of his fourth book where he ſpeaks of
<hi>Tyre,</hi> nor on that of the Tenth where he makes a
Digreſſion upon the felicity of his Age, becauſe
many are ſubject to wreſt thoſe expreſſions to
their own ſenſe. But as he lived to a great Age,
he may well be the ſame perſon that <hi>Suetonius</hi>
mentioned, as a great Rhetorician in the time of
<hi>Tiberius;</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> as a <hi>Praetor</hi> and Proconſul
of <hi>Africa</hi> under that Emperour,<note place="margin">Lib. 11. Ann.</note> for there is not

the diverſity of opinions on this ſubject,
which are collected together in <hi>Voſſius,</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi>
a Commentator of <hi>Quintus Curtius.</hi> He is
perhaps a Son only of thoſe whom <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
mentions, and may have nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with any of the other that we named, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſidering that neither <hi>Quintilian,</hi> nor
any of the Ancients, have ſaid the leaſt word of
him or his Hiſtory, which is very ſtrange: for
how <hi>Quintilian,</hi> who omitted not to mention all
the conſiderable Hiſtorians then extant, in the
Tenth Book of his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> writ in <hi>Domitians</hi>
Reign, could forget him, is not to be anſwered,
without preſuppoſing that the works of <hi>Quintus

               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56273:114"/>
The ordinary impreſſions of this Author wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that his Two Firſt Books, and the end of
the Fifth are loſt, as alſo the beginning of the
Sixth, and in ſome few places of the laſt which is
the Tenth, there manifeſtly appears a defect. It
was not <hi>Quintianus Stoa,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtopher Bruno</hi>
that ſupplied the Two firſt Books, which he did
out of what <hi>Arrianus, Diodorus, Juſtin,</hi> and ſome
others left us in writing of the Archievements of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> did well
to abſtain from the relations of the counterfeit
<hi>Calliſthenes</hi> (the true one cited by <hi>Plutarch</hi> being
not to be found) which make One <hi>Nectanebus</hi> a
<hi>Magician</hi> to be the Father of that Monarch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and repreſent him
rather as a <hi>Roland,</hi> or <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule</hi> than a true
Conqueror. <hi>Henry Glarean</hi> is not followed by
any, in his diſtribution of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
into Twelve Books, re-eſtabliſhing the Two
firſt, and dividing the reſt into Ten others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the ordinary Eight. But in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſoever his Hiſtory is diſpoſed, it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
found worthy of its Subject; and to him
alone can that Elogy be applyed, which one
<hi>Amyntianus</hi> inſolently and undeſervedly arrogated
to himſelf (<hi>Viz.</hi>) that he had in ſome ſort equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by his Stile the noble actions of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apud Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ſect. 131.</note>
As Cenſurers are every where found, it is not to
be ſuppoſed that <hi>Curtius</hi> will eſcape them. The
ſame <hi>Glarean</hi> whom I mentioned before, reproves
him for having like an ill Geographer, made
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56273:114"/>
the <hi>River Ganges</hi> proceed from the South; and
confounded <hi>Mount Taurus</hi> with <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
miſtook the <hi>Jaxartes</hi> of <hi>Pliny</hi> for the <hi>River Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais.</hi>
But one may anſwer in his behalf that theſe
errors (if they are ſuch) are not his, who as a
Latin Author did no more than follow the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Relators, from whom he borrowed his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
<hi>Strabo</hi> obſerved in the Fifteenth Book of
his <hi>Geography,</hi> that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> called that,
<hi>Caucaſus,</hi> which was but part of the <hi>Mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
becauſe the former furniſhed them with
more fabulous matter than the latter, as that
wherewith they delighted to flatter the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and their own alſo. And as
for the courſe of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> although it is true
that generally ſpeaking it deſcends from the
North to the South, yet <hi>Strabo</hi> adds that it finds
ſuch oppoſition as obliges it many times to hold
different courſes, and that at length it conveighs
all its waters to the Eaſt.<note place="margin">Tr. 5. dell'. arte hiſt. c. 2. ep. 3.</note> But <hi>Maſcardi</hi> makes
other objections, he thinks him exceſſive in the
uſe of Sentences; and though he cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that all his are very elegant and ingenious,
yet he accuſes him for not having alwaies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
them judiciouſly, making ſome perſons ſpeak
in a Phraſe no way proportionable to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
and he inſtances in that Oration of the
<hi>Scythians</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Seventh Book. I
have read it over and over by reaſon of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
but with far different Eies from thoſe
of <hi>Maſcardi;</hi> and I can ſcarce believe that it is a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56273:115"/>
piece contrived by the Author, for I find all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Stile, ſo fitly ſuited to the perſons of
the <hi>Scythian</hi> Ambaſſadors that pronounced it,
both in reſpect of the Sentences, and all the reſt
of its parts, that it paſſes in my judgment for a
Copy taken from the true Original of <hi>Ptolemaeus,
Ariſtobulus, Calliſthenes, Oneſicritus,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe preſent with <hi>Alexander</hi> at the time
it was ſpoke, who had the curioſity to inſert it
in the Hiſtory of that Monarch. I inſiſt not on
that part which is ſo well accommodated to the
preſent made by thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> of a pair of
Oxen, a Plough, a Cup, and an Arrow. The Greek
Proverb of the ſolitary places of their Country is
admirably applyed. And the <hi>Scythian</hi> deſcription
of Fortune without feet, whoſe flight cannot be
ſtopped, although you have hold of her hands,
ſeems unexpreſſibly graceful in their mouths. But
though all theſe things do ſuit wonderfully well
with the perſons that utter them, I find the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
harmony in the manner of imploying thoſe
Sentences which <hi>Maſcardi</hi> arraigns; and if ever
the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> was conſidered, or
thoſe rules obſerved which their Rhetoricians
authoriſed, I think one may ſay that <hi>Quintus
Curtius</hi> has on this occaſion moſt religiouſly kept
them.</p>
               <p>They who know with what liberty the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Tartarians</hi> uſe Fables in all their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and that they, like the reſt of the Eaſtern
People, ſcarce ſay any thing without intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56273:115"/>
parables therewith, will admire the judgment
of <hi>Curtius</hi> in the moſt ſententious part of that
Oration, which his Cenſurer found ſo much
fault with. Are you ignorant (ſay thoſe Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to <hi>Alexander</hi>) that the talleſt Trees which
are ſo long growing, may be beat down and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in an inſtant? It is not the part of a wiſe
man to mind only the fruit they bear, and not to
conſider their height, and their danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Take heed leſt endeavouring to climbe up
to the top, their uttermoſt branches do not break,
and make you fall with them. The Lion be it
never ſo great and fierce, ſometimes ſerves for
nouriſhment to the leaſt Birds; and Iron for all
its hardneſs is often conſumed with ruſt. Nor is
there any thing ſo ſolid or ſtrong in Nature, that
may not be hurt by the weakeſt things, and
which have in appearance the leaſt vigour. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
here are many Elegant expreſſions, which
inſtead of being condemned for unſeemlineſs, as
ſpoken by <hi>Scythians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 6. &amp; Lib. 10.</note> ought rather to be eſteemed
in a more than ordinary manner, for the Air they
have of their Country, and that unuſual way of
expreſſion, which almoſt totally differs from that
of the Greeks or Latins. If I had a mind to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
this Hiſtory, as well as Others, I would not
find fault with its Geography, or Rhetorick; I
ſhould rather accuſe <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
wherein he can be no way juſtified. For
after he had acknowledged in more than one
place, that <hi>Alexander</hi> made the ſame uſe of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56273:116"/>
                  <hi>Eunuch Bagoas,</hi> as <hi>Darius</hi> did, which made him
have ſo great a power over his affections (not to
ſpeak of <hi>Epheſtion,</hi> whoſe friendſhip he does not
render ſo ſhameful or criminal as others have
done) he had the confidence afterwards to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the pleaſures of <hi>Alexander</hi> were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and lawful. The place I mean, is where he
firſt repreſents the death of that Prince, and
then examins his virtues and vices, uſing theſe
very terms, <hi>veneris juxta naturale deſiderium u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
nec ulla niſi ex permiſſo voluptas.</hi> How! this
infamous paſſion he had for <hi>Bagoas</hi> was not then
eſteemed againſt Nature? I know not, ſince long
before, notwithſtanding the darkneſs of <hi>Paganiſm,
Phocylides</hi> had obſerved in one of his verſes, that
even Brutes naturally abhorred that ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.
And <hi>Plato</hi> how infamous ſoever in that
reſpect, acknowledged in the Eighth Book of his
<hi>Laws,</hi> that even before the time of <hi>Laius,</hi> that
Example of Beaſts, made maſculine love be ſtiled
a ſin againſt nature. Certainly <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi>
his fault herein cannot be palliated, what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
ſoever may be aſcribed to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> both
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> on this Subject.</p>
               <p>I will not repeat in this place what I ſaid in
the Section of <hi>Arrian,</hi> of ſome ſmall errours of
<hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> which are amended by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the former, or rather by the mutual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
which theſe Two Authors give one to
the other to be rendered more intelligible. But
I will obſerve, that notwithſtanding the praiſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56273:116"/>
we attributed to the <hi>Graecian,</hi> of having been one
of the moſt tender writers in matter of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
he whom we now examine is much more
reſerved therein than he, of which there needs
no more proof, than what they both writ of one
or two extraordinary Springs, which newly ſprung
up from the ground where <hi>Alexander</hi> had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped,
near the <hi>River Oxus. Arrian</hi> ſaies that
one of them was of Oil, and the other of clear
Water, which he confidently reports, as if he
would impoſe a belief thereof on his Readers.<note place="margin">Lib. 7.</note>
                  <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> on the other hand, ſaies nothing
of the Source of Oil, but that in digging of Wells
a Spring was found in the Kings Tent, of which
as ſoon as it was diſcovered, a rumour ran as if
it had been miraculous; and <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf ſo
far improved it, as to be pleaſed that it ſhould be
thought a grace of Heaven, beſtowed on him by
the Gods. But to ſhew clearly, with what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
this Hiſtorian alwaies handled things
which admitted of doubt,<note place="margin">Lib. 9. But this fierceneſs ſo admired and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, is not ſtrange to us, that ſee the like courage in our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifs on all occaſions.</note> I will inſtance the
terms wherewith he accompanies the narration
he writes of a Dog in the Kingdom of <hi>Sopita,</hi> that
faſtened on a Lyon with ſo much courage, that he
ſuffered his members to be cut piece-meal, rather
then loſe the hold he had taken. <hi>Equidem,</hi> ſaies
he, <hi>plura tranſcribo, quam credo. Nam nec affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare
ſuſtineo de quibus dubito, nec ſubducere quae ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepi.</hi>
And this moderation may be applied to that
place of the ſame book, where on the occaſion of
<hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s ſickneſs, a Serpent ſhewed to <hi>Alexander</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:56273:117"/>
in his ſleep, an Herb which would cure him. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when an Author is ſo modeſt in his relation,
that he appears not to have any deſign to invade
the credulity of his Readers, he may write what
he pleaſes, as we have already remonſtrated in the
Chapter of <hi>Livy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt all the Latin Hiſtorians there is none
more generally approved than <hi>Quintus Curtius.</hi>
Some are for <hi>Livy</hi>'s Stile, others for that of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
but all agree that <hi>Curtius</hi> has writ very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
and well. <hi>Lipſius</hi> adviſes that no book is more
worthy the peruſal of Princes, than this Hiſtory
which he commends to their frequent inſpection.
Some there are of that dignity, who have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recreated their minds with this Book, but
found other advantages by it. We have already
reported ſomewhat like this in what we writ of
<hi>Livy;</hi> and I remember I obſerved that one <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius
di Medicis,</hi> who cauſed the Hiſtory of the
Emperors to be read to him, was ſo affected with
the recital of ſome notable Act of <hi>Conrard</hi> the
Third of that name, that he thought he owed his
health to the content he received from that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Lib. de reb. geſt. Alph.</note>
                  <hi>Antonius Panormitanus,</hi> and ſeveral others
obſerve a memorable occurrence concerning our
Author, in reference to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> that wiſe King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> who finding himſelf oppreſſed with an
indiſpoſition, from which all the remedies of his
Phiſitians could not delive him, ſought ſome
diverſion in the Hiſtory of <hi>Quintus Curtius;</hi> which
was with ſo much ſatisfaction and good ſucceſs,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56273:117"/>
that he became cured of his infirmity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
to all about him, that neither <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
nor <hi>Avicenna,</hi> ſhould ever be of equal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him with that Treatiſe. But to draw to a
concluſion, I muſt admit that <hi>Curtius</hi> is excellent
in all his Orations, either Direct or Oblique. I
have ſeen but one <hi>Letter</hi> in all his works, which is
the anſwer of <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Darius.</hi> And I do not
remember that there is any other Digreſſion, than
that one of the Tenth Book which I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where, taking an occaſion from the Diviſions
amongſt the <hi>Macedonians</hi> after the death of him
that had made them Monarchs of the world, he
celebrates the felicity of the Roman People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
in the time when he wrote, under a great
and happy Emperor.<note place="margin">Suppoſed to be Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatian.</note> We muſt not take for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
the Relation of the manner of living of
the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the Deſcription of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which is found in the Eighth Book, becauſe
there is nothing therein, that is not eſſential to
the Theme which the Author propoſed to himſelf;
for being to write of the Exploits of <hi>Alexander</hi> in

ſome ſummary account of it.</p>

UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
CORNELIUS TACITUS.</head>
               <p>IN all the impreſſions of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi>
his <hi>Annals</hi> are printed before his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi>
which is underſtood to be becauſe they have
a farther beginning,<note place="margin">I ſuppoſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, for <hi>Voſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſpeaks but of two years.</note> treating of the laſt daies of
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and proceeding unto the end of <hi>Nero</hi>'s
Reign, whoſe laſt Twelve years are nevertheleſs
wanting; whereas the books of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſeem
to follow one another from the <hi>Epoche</hi> of the
death of that <hi>Tyrant,</hi> to the happy Government
of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan.</hi> And yet there is no doubt
but <hi>Tacitus</hi> firſt compoſed his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as being
nearer to his own time;<note place="margin">Extremum Neronis Biennium deeſt. de Hiſt. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinis lib. 1. cap. 30.</note> for he quotes a place in
the Eleventh of his <hi>Annals,</hi> to which he refers his
Reader, concerning what he had already writ of
the actions of <hi>Domitian,</hi> which were not by him
mentioned any where, but in the Books of his
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> there remains to us but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56273:118"/>
Five Books, and <hi>Lipſius</hi> gueſſes that there are Ten
loſt. For if they reached from <hi>Galba,</hi> to <hi>Nerva,</hi>
and <hi>Trajan,</hi> which includes at leaſt a ſpace of
Twenty one years, it is probable the greateſt
part of them are wanting, ſeeing the Five we
have comprehend little more than the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of one year.</p>
               <p>Their Stile is more large and florid than that
of the <hi>Annals,</hi> which are compoſed in a cloſe
contracted Phraſe; but <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Eloquence
appears every where in his grave way of writing,<note place="margin">Muret. or. de Tac.</note>
which has ſomething of that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or ſublimity
in it, from which the Rhet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>icians have obſerved,
that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> never ſtraved. Amongſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cenſurers, who find every one ſomething
thing to ſay againſt the works of this Hiſtorian,
none are more excuſable than thoſe who only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of his obſcurity. For as he often leaves
his Narrations imperfect, he is ſometimes found
leſs intelligible. And the faults of the Copies,
and depravation thereby of his ſenſe, in many
places, contributes much to render his matter
difficult to be underſtood; but where the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
are intire and uncorrupted, his meaning
is eaſily diſcovered. Howſoever it be, it is no
wonder if <hi>Tacitus</hi> (having imitated <hi>Thucydides,</hi>
and both followed <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>) retained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that roughneſs and auſterity, which is
obſerved in the writings of thoſe Two <hi>Graecians;</hi>
and which all the Ancients accounted as a virtue,
ſo far is it from deſerving to be imputed as a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56273:119"/>
fault, to him that ſhould propoſe them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for imitation. And as ſome Wines are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to our palates by a little bitterneſs
that is in them; and many perſons find that a
dusky and obſcure light in Churches in moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their exerciſe of devotion: ſo others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the obſcurity of an Author, mixed with
a little roughneſs of Stile, is rather to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than otherwiſe; becauſe it diſpoſes the mind
to attention, and elevates and tranſports it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which it would not arrive at in a more eaſy
compoſition.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who were ſo confident to pretend
that <hi>Tacitus</hi> writ ill Latin, I judge them more
worthy of compaſſion for that extravagance, than
any ſolid anſwer. Yet Two great Civilians were
of that opinion, <hi>Alciat,</hi> who maintained that
the Phraſe of <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> was preferable to that
of this Ancient Hiſtorian, which, he ſaid, <hi>was full
of Thornes;</hi> and <hi>Ferret,</hi> who condemn'd his Stile,
as being in his judgment not <hi>Roman</hi> enough. If
ever men were abſurd in cenſures, doubtleſs theſe
were: and I do affirm againſt ſuch unreaſonable
opinions, that apparently <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes the leaſt
Groome or Cook, in narratives, ſpeak better La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
than either <hi>Ferret,</hi> or <hi>Alciat:</hi> they are indeed
learned in the Law, but very bad judges of the
Roman Eloquence. For though <hi>Tacitus</hi> has not
writ like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> that is no argument
of his bad performance. Eloquence is not uniform;
there are divers kinds of it: and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56273:119"/>
to the Learned, that Latin flouriſhed in
all of them differently till the Reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Adrian,</hi> who was not ſo Ancient as <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
to whom the greateſt Orators of his time
Freely yielded the Palm of Hiſtory. And <hi>Pliny</hi>
the younger who was one of the moſt conſiderable
amongſt them, declared in many of his Epiſtles,
that he eſteemed <hi>Tacitus</hi> one of the moſt Eloquent
of his Age. In the Twentieth Epiſtle of the firſt
Book, he makes him Judge of a diſpute he had,
about the Eloquence to be uſed in pleading at
the Bar, againſt a learned man that maintained the
moſt conciſe to be alwaies the beſt.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 1. l. 2.</note> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place he deſcribes to one of his friends the
Pomp of <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> his Funerals, obſerving
his laſt and principal happineſs to conſiſt in the
praiſes of the Conſul <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who made
his funeral Oration, and who was the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of that time; <hi>laudatus eſt à Correlio Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Nam hic ſupremus felicitati ejus cumulus acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit

another called <hi>Arrian,</hi> the ſucceſs of a great cauſe
againſt a Proconſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> accuſed of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the publique Treaſury, he ſaies, that <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Tacitus</hi> made a replication to the perſon that
defended him,<note place="margin">Ib. ep. 11.</note> wherein his Eloquence and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
inſeparable from his diſcourſe were admired;

                  </gap>. And when

for the City of <hi>Coma</hi> in his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">L. 4. ep. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:56273:120"/>
he intreated <hi>Tacitus,</hi> as one to whom all the
great Wits of the Age applyed themſelves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
one to him to exerciſe that charge. I
mention not the deſcriptions he makes him, in
two different <hi>Letters,</hi> of the death of the Elder
<hi>Pliny</hi> his Uncle,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. ep. 16. et 20.</note> and of the burning of <hi>Veſuvins,</hi>
which he was ſo deſirous that the Hiſtory of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
ſhould deſcribe,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. ep. 33.</note> that he conjures him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
not to forget his name in it, declaring
his paſſion for it in terms, which I think not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to rehearſe in this place: <hi>Auguror, nec me
fallit augurium, Hiſtorias tuas immortales futuras,
quo magis illis, ingenue fatebor, inſeri cupio. Nam
ſi eſſe nobis curae ſolet, ut facies noſtra ab optimo
quoque artifice exprimatur, nonne debemus optare,
ut operibus noſtris ſimilis tui ſcriptor praedicatorque
contingat.</hi> But the place, wherein <hi>Pliny</hi> ſhews
moſt the eſteem which he and all <hi>Italy</hi> had of
<hi>Tacitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. ep. 20.</note> is that of another <hi>Letter,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that from his youth upwards he had choſen
him for a pattern of Eloquence, from amongſt
the great number of excellent Orators, which
were then in <hi>Rome.</hi> And becauſe we learn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
from that place the age of thoſe two men,
I will again very willingly inſert it in its native
language: <hi>Equidem adoleſcentulus cùm tu jam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
gloriaque floreres, te ſequi, tibi longo, ſed proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
intervallo &amp; eſſſe &amp; haberi concupiſcebam.
Et erant multa clariſſima ingenia, ſed tu mihi (it a
ſimilitudo naturae ferebat) maxime imitabilis, maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
imitandus videbaris.</hi> There is no need to ſeek
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56273:120"/>
other proofs of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his reputation in his own
time, which produced ſo many excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
and few are ignorant how all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ages have honoured his endeavours, whereof
we ſhall give ſome more Teſtimonies before we
finiſh this Section. But in the mean time is it
not ſtrange, that any ſhould be ſo barbarous as
<hi>Alciat</hi> and <hi>Ferret,</hi> and contradictory to all the
Ancient Romans, to maintain that ſo conſiderable
an Author could not ſo much as ſpeak his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue?
One muſt certainly have a brazen
face, and a very empty head to advance ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
For my part ſhould I ſee a Thouſand
things that diſpleaſed me, I ſhould rather accuſe
my own weak underſtanding, or the faults of the
Copies, or ſome other defect (which ought not
to be imputed to him) than give the lye to all
Antiquity, by falling into ſuch an imaginary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>There is a third ſort of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his accuſers,
who tax him of ſpeaking untruths; <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> is of
that number.<note place="margin">In Aurel.</note> But becauſe he only arraigns him
to excuſe himſelf in this general propoſition,
that the beſt Hiſtorians of the world cannot avoid
the mixture of lies in their trueſt narrations. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
his reputation ſeems not to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
therein. We have ſhown elſewhere that
ſeveral perſons took delight to maintain this
<hi>theſis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orat. 11.</note> And I remember <hi>Dion Chryſoſtome</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to prove in one of his <hi>Orations,</hi> that one
never knows the truth of things, is not content
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56273:121"/>
to ſay, that the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> by the <hi>Graecians</hi>
is a meer Fable; and that the <hi>Perſians</hi> delivered
a very different account of the wars of <hi>Xerxes</hi>
and <hi>Darius</hi> againſt <hi>Greece,</hi> than the <hi>Graecians</hi>
themſelves; but he adds, as a note of the ſmall
certainty there is in Hiſtory, that amongſt the
moſt famous of the Greek Hiſtorians, ſome held
that the Naval victory of <hi>Salamin</hi> preceded that
of <hi>Plataea,</hi> and others aſſerted the contrary. It
is ſufficient then to anſwer, that there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
which our humanity bears with, when they
are related by report, and without lying. But
when <hi>Tertullian</hi> reproaches <hi>Tacitus</hi> with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and <hi>Budaeus</hi> calls him one of the moſt vile
and impious Authors we have, it is evident that
they mean ſomething more than that ſort of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report,
which ignorance may excuſe; and which
one may retort upon errors Authoriſed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
belief. For they are offended at what he
impiouſly ſpoke of Chriſtians, &amp; in deriſion of our
holy religion, whom he aſſaults even in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> deriding the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reproaching the <hi>Jews</hi> with
adoring the <hi>Effigies</hi> of a <hi>Wild Aſſe.</hi> I confeſs that
one cannot too much condemn what he writ on
that ſubject, as he was a <hi>Pagan.</hi> But nevertheleſs
we muſt be forced to acknowledg, that if he muſt
be totally renounced for what he writ againſt
the true God, and our Altars, we ſhall be obliged to
burn with his Books, almoſt all thoſe of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils,</hi>
very few of them having abſtained from the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56273:121"/>
like calumnies. I ſay the ſame thing againſt the
judgment which <hi>Caſaubon</hi> in his <hi>Preface,</hi> paſſed
upon <hi>Polybius,</hi> where he pretends that Princes
cannot read a more dangerous book than <hi>Tacitus;</hi>
becauſe of the bad examples which are ſeen in it.
For it is an ill cuſtome that <hi>Caſaubon</hi> has followed,
never to write upon an Author without blaming
all others, to give that the greater Authority;
and we know that he has praiſed <hi>Tacitus</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
as much as any one can do. It is true
his Hiſtory has repreſented unto us, the actions
of the moſt wicked Princes that ever were; and
that by misfortune thoſe Books which contained
the beſt Emperors Raigns, as of <hi>Veſpaſian, Titus,
Nerva,</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> are loſt. Yet it is the way
to cenſure all the Hiſtories we have in the world,
even without excepting the Holy Writ, to make
that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> reſponſible for the bad examples
it contains, there being none found that have not
ſome very dangerous in them, and where there
is no need of diſtinguiſhing with judgment, the
good and the bad of every Narration. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
heretofore, as even in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, the
<hi>Pagans</hi> invectives againſt us might be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe the world was not then purged of their
errors, as it is at preſent by the Grace of God. I
cannot imagine that any perſon can be found at
this day, that would let himſelf be ſeduced by
the Calumnies of the <hi>Ethnicks;</hi> or by all that the
infidelity they lived in, could make them write
againſt our <hi>Evangelical</hi> truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:56273:122"/>
The general eſteem the works of <hi>Tacitus</hi> have
gained, might ſuffice alone againſt the Authorities
we have examined, though we wanted reaſons to
refute them. If it were needful to weaken them
by other contrary authorities, I can produce Two,
beſides the Univerſal conſent of learned men,
which are ſo weighty that they will alwaies turn
the Scale on their ſide. The firſt is that of the
Emperor <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who though inveſted in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
dignity of the world, did not forbear near
two hundred years after the death of our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
to glory in that name common to them,
eſteeming it as an honour to have had ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtour,
and to be acknowledged one of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
He cauſed his Statue to be placed in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries,
and all his books to be writ over Ten
times every year, that they might paſs from hand
to hand, and from Age to age, as they have done
unto ours. The Second Authority ſhall be that of
the Great Duke <hi>Coſmo di Medicis,</hi> whoſe memory
will never want veneration, as long as the Science
of Polity or good government (as his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
term it) ſhall be cultivated. That Prince
choſe <hi>Tacitus</hi> amongſt all the Hiſtorians, as one
from whom his mind could receive the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and ſolid ſatisfaction. Add to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Princes and Emperors, that the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Author into all Tongues, gives a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
proof of the valew of him in all Nations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his <hi>Commentaries</hi> &amp; <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> he wrote a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi>
of divers people who inhabited <hi>Germany</hi> in his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56273:122"/>
time, and of their different manners; with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of his Father in Law <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola.</hi>
Some moreover aſcribe to him, the book En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<hi>the cauſes of the corruption of Latin Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
which others attribute to <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and
which poſſibly belongs to neither of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the probable conjecture of <hi>Lipſius.</hi> As for
the collection of the book of <hi>the pleaſant ſayings
of Tacitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Taciti fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiae.</note> which <hi>Fulgentius Planciades</hi> mentions,
it is a meer counterfeit, which never deceived any
one but that Grammarian. The true compoſitions
of <hi>Tacitus</hi> are diſcernable enough,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de re poet. c. 1. et l. 3. c. 1.</note> either by their
form, or matter, taking, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> does, the words
of the Hiſtory for the matter, and the things it
unfolds for the form. He ſcatters here and there
throughout the whole, Oblique and Direct Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the condition of time, place, and perſons
require. But as conciſe as he is in his Stile, he
flies out into Digreſſions in many places, witneſs
that of the <hi>God Sarapis</hi> amongſt the reſt, in the
Fourth Book of his Hiſtory; and that other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
one in the Fifth, which we have already in
ſome ſort reflected on, relating to the Religion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that of <hi>Moſes</hi> their <hi>Law-giver.</hi>
He was of the opinion, that, as there is no Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
who may not go out of his way ſometimes, to
ſee a memorable place, or ſome ſingular thing of
the Countries he paſſes through; ſo the Laws of
Hiſtory do no more forbid a Writer to make ſome
ſmall excurſions, which pleaſe and refreſh the
mind more than they diver it, when they are
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56273:123"/>
uſed only in apt ſeaſon. He is no leſs ſententious
than <hi>Thucydides</hi> or <hi>Saluſt,</hi> but with ſuch artifice,
that all the maxims he laies down, iſſue from
the nature of the ſubjects he treats of, in the ſame
manner as Stars are made of the proper ſubſtance
of the Heavens. There is nothing of Foreign,
affected, too far fetched, or ſuperfluous in what
he writes; each thought holds a place which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
it ſo well, that it cannot be diſputed.
Moreover you do not only learn from him the
events of things paſt; He ſeldom fails to diſcover
their cauſes, and the foregoing councels. One
may ſay the ſame thing of Hiſtory, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid
of Husbandry.</p>
               <q>Faelix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas.<note place="margin">Virg. 2. Georg.</note>
               </q>
               <p>And if what many people aver, be true, to wit,
that the water is ſweeter in the bottom of the Sea,
than in the Superficies; it is more certain that
an Hiſtorical relation, which only gives an inſight
into affairs, and the purſuance of events, leaving
the Antecedent cauſes and advices unpenetrated,
cannot be ſo uſeful or pleaſant, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
all the miſteries thereof, and does not hide
the greateſt ſecrets contained in thoſe affairs,
which reliſh according to the comprehenſion we
have of them. But that which neightens the merit
of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his works, is the obſervation which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have made before me, that one often learns
no leſs from what he left unſaid,<note place="margin">L. 1. Hiſt.</note> than what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
his ſilence being as inſtructive as his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and his cyphers (to ſpeak in the terms of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56273:123"/>
numbers) as conſiderable as his moſt important fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
becauſe all therein deſcribed is full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
proportion, and judgment. Thus as
the Ancients report, the <hi>Painter Timanthes</hi> left
more in his Pictures to be imagined, than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the view of Spectators. And it is known
that <hi>Tacitus</hi> did not ſet himſelf to write, before

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
LUCIUS ANNAEUS.
FLORUS.</head>
               <p>THEY who make <hi>Lucius Florus</hi> to live
under <hi>Trajan,</hi> are obliged to correct that
place of his <hi>Preface,</hi> where he ſaies there
was little leſs than two hundred years, from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
his time to his. The moſt probable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is that he was of a little later time. And it
is beleived that the <hi>Poet Florus,</hi> whoſe verſes
<hi>Spartianus</hi> quotes in <hi>the Life of the Emperor Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
is the ſame of whom we now write, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Epitomy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory in four
books. The verſes are in a very familiar Stile;
<q>
                     <l>Ego nolo Caeſar eſſe,</l>
                     <l>Ambulare per Britannos,</l>
                     <l>Scythicas pati pruinas.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> was addicted to Poetry,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56273:124"/>
as may be ſeen by the pleaſant anſwer which he
returned.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Ego nolo Florus eſſe,</l>
                  <l>Ambulare per Tabernas,</l>
                  <l>Latitare per popinas,</l>
                  <l>Calices pati rotundos.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And one may ſee that the Phraſe of his Hiſtory
is wholly Poetical, and that the love of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>
cauſed him ſometimes, like <hi>Virgil,</hi> to imploy
<hi>Hemiſtichs</hi> in his Periods, But though he ſeems
very licentious in it, and his ſpeech and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
often favour more of a Declamer, than an
Hiſtorian, yet we muſt affirm <hi>Sigonius</hi> to be very
unjuſt, when he ſtiles him <hi>an impertinent Writer.</hi>
The manner in which <hi>Florus</hi> treats of every War
apart, did not deſerve ſo ſevere a cenſure. And
it is apparent, that he was ever acknowledged to
be a very fluent Author, full of Eloquence, and
very agreeable flowers of Oratory. He is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
repleniſhed with very ingenious ſentences,
thoughts expreſſed with force and vehemency.
And laying aſide ſome little places, which may
be thought cold, in compariſon of others, many
refined precepts are contained in what he writes,
which could not be expreſſed in better terms.</p>
               <p>Some doubt whither <hi>Florus</hi> that made the four
books above mentioned, was the ſame that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Arguments to the books of <hi>Livy</hi>'s hiſtory.
Nevertheleſs it is a great miſtake, to beleive that
he intended to Epitomize the whole Hiſtory of
<hi>Livy,</hi> in his four books, for he does not follow it
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56273:125"/>
in divers places, but rather purſues his particular
fancy. Which is ſo extravagant in reference to
<hi>Chronology,</hi> or the account of time, that it is not
ſafe for any that will be truly informed, to take
him him for a guide in that matter, becauſe of
the many faults he has committed therein, through
negligence, or otherwiſe. He is accuſed alſo of
contriving the loſs of <hi>Livy</hi>'s works, to value his
own collections; but I judge thoſe that are of
that opinion, to be in an error, ſuch a ſort of
ſummary Narration being not ſufficient ſo to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the mind, as to make it reject a work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that Compendium gives but a very ſuperficial
account.</p>
               <p>Moreover ſome make <hi>Seneca</hi> to be the Author
of the Compendious Hiſtory of <hi>Florus,</hi> becauſe
<hi>Lactantius</hi> laies down, in the fifteenth Chapter of
the Seventh book of his <hi>Divine Inſtitutions,</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of the Roman Empire into four different
ſeaſons, aſcribing Metaphorically to it, Infancy,
Youth, Virility, and Old Age, which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s invention. And becauſe the like
diviſion is ſeen, in the <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Florus</hi> his books,
they conclude that <hi>Seneca</hi> is the Author of them;
and that the name of <hi>Florus</hi> is to be no otherwiſe
conſidered, than as a counterfeit. But he that ſhall
well obſerve the writings of theſe two Authors,
will eaſily diſcern great differences in them. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
makes the <hi>Youth</hi> or <hi>Adoleſcency</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he
terms it, reach to the end of the laſt <hi>Punick War,</hi>
whilſt <hi>Florus</hi> makes it continue but to the firſt.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56273:125"/>
And <hi>Seneca</hi> begins its <hi>Old Age,</hi> when the Civil
Wars aroſe between <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi>
whereas <hi>Florus</hi> accounts it from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
in the abſolute power of the Empire.
Is it not therefore more probable that <hi>Florus</hi> made
uſe of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s thought, varying it, and rendering
it in a manner his own, by the alteration he made
therein? I am apter to believe, that <hi>Lactantius</hi>
was miſtaken, than to imagine that all the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
ſhould err, which have put <hi>L. Annaeus Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in the Title of the Books we now mention.
But perhaps <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> being both of the
ſame family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Annaei,</hi> their names may
have been confounded by adoption, or otherwiſe;
and that <hi>Florus</hi> was therefore ſometimes called
<hi>Seneca,</hi> as one cannot deny that he is in ſome old
Copies; and ſome have given him alſo the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of <hi>Julius.</hi> Whereupon we muſt obſerve that
the Houſe of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> is not more honoured
in the valour of the many gallant men it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on the world, than that of the <hi>Annaei</hi> in
the number of the excellent perſons it has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in all ſorts of learning. <hi>Seneca</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi>
the <hi>Tragedian,</hi> and the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> (if they are
three) prove it ſufficiently, as well as the Poet
<hi>Lucan,</hi> and our <hi>Hiſtoriographer,</hi> whoſe Stile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſomething of the <hi>Genius</hi> of that laſt <hi>Family,</hi>
born all to be Maſters of Eloquence, and Poetry.
It will not be amiſs to obſerve, that the praiſes
which <hi>Florus</hi> gave in many places to <hi>Spain,</hi> are
reproached to him by thoſe who think, that the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56273:126"/>
love of his country induced him to exceed a little,
in the ſixth, ſeventeenth, and eighteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the ſecond book, beſides what he adds in
the third,<note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> treating of the Warlike exploits of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
in that Country.</p>
               <p>There was another <hi>Julius Florus,</hi> more Ancient
than the <hi>Hiſtoriographer,</hi> who lived in <hi>Tiberius</hi>
his Reign. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his <hi>Controverſies,</hi> ſaies that
he was inſtructed in the art of ſpeaking well, by
the Oratour <hi>Portius Latro.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. c. 3.</note> And <hi>Quintilian,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that <hi>Florus,</hi> ſaies he was <hi>the Prince of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
and was a publick Profeſſor of it in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>
They who build upon the Surname of <hi>Julius</hi>
(which ſome Manuſcripts attribute, as we have
already ſaid, to him whoſe Hiſtory we examin)
imagin he may be deſcended from that other <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
whereof <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> have made ſuch
honourable mention. But it is a meer conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and ſo light, that it deſerves not to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reflected on.</p>
               <p>I will only add, that amongſt the Licences <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
has aſſumed, as we have already obſerved, there
is one ſo Poetical, and ſtrangely Hyperbolical,
that <hi>Scaliger</hi> with reaſon blames him, in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
upon Euſebius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 134.</note> for having in a miſtaken
zeal, ſuffered himſelf to be led away, by a mean
and childiſh appetite of relating wonderful things
to the prejudice of truth.<note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> It is where he relates
the expedition of <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> along the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
Galician,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Coaſts. Where he
alledges that <hi>Brutus</hi> never ſtopped his victorious
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56273:126"/>
courſe, till he beheld the Sun fall into the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and heard with horrour its fire extinguiſh in
the waters; which gave him a certain apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of being Sacrilegious, and to have done more
than his religion permitted. <hi>Putida <gap reason="foreign">

The ſame deſire of writing ſome ſtrange thing
ought to be cenſured in him, where he ſpeaks of
the defeat of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> by <hi>Marius.</hi> He pretends
that two Young Men were ſeen in <hi>Rome</hi> near the
Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> preſenting to the
<hi>Praetor</hi> Letters accompanied with Laurel, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
a victory obtained. But I ſhall on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
repeat a Maxim, which I have elſewhere eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<hi>viz.</hi> that if an Hiſtorian ſometimes inſerts
any thing in his Narration, of ſo extraordinary a
nature, he ought at the ſame time to ſignify the
ſmall faith he has therein, and proteſt that he
meerly reports it as a popular rumor.</p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
SUETONIUS.</head>
               <p>I Have hinted in the Preface of this Book,
that I would not have ranked <hi>Suetonius</hi> with
the other Hiſtorians, if what he writ of the
twelve firſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> had not contained as well as
their Lives, an Hiſtorical ſeries of what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
during ſo conſiderable a time as an Age and
more. Moreover I obſerve that no body mentions
the Roman Hiſtory, without ſpeaking very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly
of <hi>Suetonius;</hi> and <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi>
has not ſtuck to prefer him for diligence, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
to all the Greek and Latin Writers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.<note place="margin">Lib. 5. de trad. diſc.</note>
                  <hi>Bodin</hi> likewiſe affirms, that none of them
has compoſed any thing exacter, or better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
than what we have of this Hiſtorian. But
though he is very deſerving, I ſhould be loath
to aſcribe ſo much to him, as to celebrate his
praiſe to the prejudice of thoſe whom we have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56273:127"/>
hitherto treated of. I allow him to be one of
the Principal of the Latin Writers. He was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State to the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> which
is an evidence that he poſſeſſed, beſides the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Great Affairs, a competent capacity to
deliver them in proper and apt expreſſions. It
is ſaid, his imployment was taken from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſome private familiarity he had with the
Empreſs <hi>Sabina,</hi> which was diſliked, as if the
reſpect and reverence due to her ſupreme digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had been thereby violated. But it happens
ſometimes that particular diſgraces are uſeful to
the publick, as was evidenced in his perſon,
for his fall, and the leiſure he had by it, reduced
him to a ſtudious contemplation, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
us amongſt other works, that which gives
him a place amongſt the beſt Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>Beſides his Hiſtorical Labour, we have part of
his Treatiſe of the <hi>Illustrious Crammaninus,</hi> and
that of the <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> and ſome remains of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
which contained the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Poets.</hi>
For that of <hi>Terence</hi> is almoſt all of <hi>Suetonius</hi> his
writing, as <hi>Donatus</hi> himſelf confeſſes, who adds
ſomething to it. And the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Horace, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal,
Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Perſeus,</hi> are probably of the
ſame compoſition. However it be, ſome write
that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> took him for his Pattern, when
he made his <hi>Catalogus</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiastical Writers.</hi>
But we ought not to believe, that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of the Elder <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> under the name of
<hi>Suetonius,</hi> to be of his writing; and if the Stile
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56273:128"/>
were not an obſtacle, the Phraſe is enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it to be of a more modern contexture. <hi>Sucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
was too much a friend to the Younger <hi>Pliny,</hi>
(as it is apparent in his <hi>Epistles</hi>) to ſpeak ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſay ſo little of his Uncle, that was a moſt
worthy perſon. There are many of the Epiſtles of
the Nephew addreſſed to <hi>Suetonius,</hi> in one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Pliny</hi> takes notice, that he deſired him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for ſome daies,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. ep. 18.</note> the pleading of his cauſe, on
the occaſion of an ominous dream, which made
him apprehend at that time, the event of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
This ſhews on the one ſide that <hi>Suetonius</hi>
was ſuperſtitious; and the anſwer <hi>Pliny</hi> makes
him, importing that dreams are often to be taken
in the contrary ſenſe, witneſſes that he yeilded
no leſs than his friend, to that ſort of vanity.
And in another <hi>Epistle Pliny</hi> merrily menaces
<hi>Suetonius,</hi> that if he delayed to publiſh his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he would change the <hi>Hendeoaſyllables,</hi> which
he had made in their praiſe,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. ep. 11.</note> into <hi>Scazons</hi> of defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
adding withal, to incourage their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
that his work was arrived to ſuch a ſtate
of perfection, that the file inſtead of making it
brighter, did now diminiſh its value, and weaken
it. <hi>Perfectum opus abſolutumque eſt, nec jam ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcit
lima, ſed atteritur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One may read in <hi>Aulus Gellius, Servius, Tzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez,</hi>
and in <hi>Suidas,</hi> the Titles of ſeveral Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> which we have loſt; As that

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56273:128"/>
of the <hi>Illuſtrious Families of Rome;</hi> and many
others. <hi>Suidas</hi> gives him barely the character of
<hi>Roman Grammarian,</hi> a Quality much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in that time, than it has been ſince. <hi>Auſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
mentions a Treatiſe of <hi>Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 19.</note> writ by <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
in three books, whereof <hi>Pontius Paulinus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
them made a Poem. Moreover the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> which is given to <hi>Suetonius,</hi>
is in effect the ſame in ſignification, as that of his
Father, whom he himſelf calls,<note place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> in <hi>the Life of Otho,
Suetonium Lenem,</hi> reporting that his charge of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
of the thirteenth Legion, obliged him to be
preſent, when that Emperors Troops engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe of <hi>Vitellius.</hi> They therefore were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
who beleived,<note place="margin">In vita Suet. var. lect. l. 5. c. 11.</note> that this <hi>Suetonius</hi> of whom
we write, was Son of that <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi>
whereof <hi>Tacitus, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> make mention.
<hi>Sicco Polentonus,</hi> and <hi>Muret</hi> committed this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
which <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and Some Others judiciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
there being no reaſon in what they affirm,
to confound a Military Tribune with a Conſul.
<hi>Gerardus Voſſius</hi> ſhews alſo the miſtake of thoſe
who read, in the tenth Chapter of the firſt book of
the <hi>Divine Inſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Lactantius, Tranquillus,</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Tarquitius,</hi> who was another Author ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
learned in the Pagan Religion, and whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
in that reſpect, <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculapius,</hi>
rather intends than our <hi>Suetonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to his particular Hiſtory of the
Twelve firſt Emperors, There are ſome Criticks
which affirm, that the beginning of the firſt book
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56273:129"/>
is wanting; and the ground of their opinion is
founded on the improbability, that <hi>Suetonius</hi>
ſhould have writ nothing of the birth and firſt
years of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> when he took the pains to
ſearch into the Original, and Education, of eleven
other Emperors that ſucceeded, whoſe lives he
has deſcribed. He laboured in it, according to
the judgement of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> (with the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

                  <hi>Muret</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

to his diſadvantage, and maintains that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome</hi>
rather blamed, than praiſed him in that ſaying.
For, ſaies <hi>Muret,</hi> it were to be wiſhed, that we
had not learned ſo many Riots, and ſhameful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as he declares to have been practiſed by the
<hi>Tiberii, Nerones,</hi> and <hi>Caligulae.</hi> They are, ſaies he,
ſo filthy, that they almoſt make the Paper bluſh,
upon which they are repreſented. And if what
one of the Ancients ſaies, be true, namely that
there is but little difference,<note place="margin">Parum abeſt à do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente qui talia nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> between him who
deſcribes ſuch infamy with care, and he who
teaches it; we ſhall have much ado to excuſe <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi>
for having acted ſuch a part as he did.
And to augment his charge, he is accuſed of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſed the Chriſtians ill,<note place="margin">In Ner. cap. 16.</note> calling them a ſort of
men, who imbraced a new, and miſchievous ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
which made them be perſecuted in
<hi>Nero</hi>'s time. But, as we have already anſwered
to the like objections in other Sections, is
there any of all the Hiſtorians of repute, who is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56273:129"/>
not guilty, if it be a crime in him, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the wicked actions of thoſe they write
of, which makes the greateſt, and often the moſt
conſiderable part of the narration? Does not the
Sacred Hiſtory it ſelf, ſhew us Parricides, Inceſts,
Idolatry, and many other Profanations, amongſt
the beſt examples, and holieſt inſtructions? And
ought we not to caſt into the fire all the books of
thoſe Pagans, who have writ ſince the beginning
of Chriſtianity, if what they expoſed againſt our
Religion, ſhould make us abſolutely condemn it.</p>

diſcharged, in aſſerting that they have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them valuable works, unleſs it be made to
appear, that they have not been acceſſory to the
loſs of the Originals, which is the crime imputed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56273:130"/>
to them by many Learned Men, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
obſerved in the Chapters of <hi>Herodotus,
Dion Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Livy.</hi> The Extracts or Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of that Underſtanding Emperor <hi>Porphyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genetus</hi>
are inſtanced on this occaſion. And <hi>Tribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianius</hi>
meets with the like entertainment, for
having made a defective compilation, in his <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects,</hi>
of the Texts, or rather Oracles, of all thoſe
Ancient Lawyers, whoſe excellent reaſonings,
and elegant expreſſions, ought to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from ſo bold an attempt. A very ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
modern Author ſpeaking of <hi>Epitomys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verulam de aug. Scient. l. 2. c. 6.</note> does
not ſtick to call them <hi>Moths and Worms that gnaw
Hiſtory,</hi> which have made ſuch a ſpoil therein,
that there often remain but miſerable ſhreads of
the firſt contexture. And indeed there ought
to be more than a bare negation, to refute ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
an opinion; though it may be alledged
that the works of moſt Abreviators, and thoſe of
<hi>Juſtin</hi> amongſt the reſt, ought to be now very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to us, becauſe we can have recourſe
to no other relations of the matter they deliver.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to make a near gueſs at the time when
<hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> lived, by what he ſaid in his
forty third book, of his Parents that came from
<hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> where he declares his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to be made a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great (whoſe Surname pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
he took) during the Wars of <hi>Sertorius;</hi>
and that his Father, after he had borne Arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> (who is here taken for the firſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56273:131"/>
Emperor who bore that name, rather than for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi>)
had the honour to be his Secretary, and
jointly to keep his Seal. It is therefore thought,
that <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> wrote his Hiſtory under <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> having ſpoken of the former
at the end of the whole work. It was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
forty four books, whoſe number <hi>Juſtin</hi> has not
changed, no more than their Title, which was
<hi>the Philippick Hiſtory,</hi> becauſe (as it appears from
the ſeventh unto the one and fortieth book,) it
was a continued narration of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
which owed its riſe to <hi>Philip</hi> Father of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the Great. <hi>Theopompus</hi> had written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fifty eight books called <hi>Philippicks,</hi> which
are quoted by <hi>Athenaeus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and by
Some held to be the Model which <hi>Trogus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi>
followed; as <hi>Cicero,</hi> imitating <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
named his Orations <hi>Philippicks,</hi> with much
leſs reaſon. The ſeven firſt books of that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in purſuance of the Title we mention, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
the firſt beginnings of the world, or of the
Inhabitants thereof, together with deſcriptions of
Places and Countries, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> has apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut of, as it may be collected from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Preambles</hi> before each book of <hi>Trogus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi>
publiſhed by <hi>Bongars.</hi> But we had been
more fully ſatisfied herein, if that Friend of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
who bragged he had in his hands all the
works of that Hiſtorian, and would even in a ſhort
time ſhew them the light, had ſaid a truth.</p>
               <p>As to what relates particularly to <hi>Juſtin,</hi> he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56273:131"/>
made his Epitome, according to the moſt common
opinion, under <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Pius,</hi> to whom
it is thought he dedicated it in his <hi>Preface.</hi> I
know, the paſſage wherein that Emperor is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
is diverſly interpreted; and ſome have
been perſwaded, that he wrote after the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of a place in the eighth book, where he
ſpeaks of the Soveraign power of <hi>Greece.</hi> But that
may admit other interpretations, without a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of making him live two hundred years later
than he did, and in an Age which produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo polite or elegant, as all we have of this
Author is. Yet it is a greater error to confound
him with <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> as one <hi>Martin'</hi> a
<hi>Polander</hi> did in his <hi>Chronicle.</hi> For though theſe
Two <hi>Juſtins</hi> were Contemporary, the manner
how the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> treats the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in his ſix
and thirtieth book, where he will have <hi>Moſes</hi>
to be the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the Latter a very
Great Magician, ſhews that he was of the Pagan
belief. And <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> never wrote but
in Greek, nor did <hi>Euſebius,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
rank the Epitomy of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi>
amongſt his Works. Though S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> indeed
quotes ſomething of it in his <hi>Preamble upon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi>
And no Author more Ancient than that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Church, ſpoke of <hi>Justin</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</p>
               <p>He was not like to uſe Direct Orations, when
he whom he epitomiſed, had condemned them
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56273:132"/>
in <hi>Saluſt</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> as we have already elſewhere
mentioned. Which appears in the eight and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
book, where he rehearſes in an Oblique
form, that long Oration of <hi>Mithridates</hi> to his
Souldiers, to animate them againſt the Romans.
And that of <hi>Agathocles</hi> in the twenty ſecond book,
pronounced as ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Africa,</hi> to
incourage his Troops then terrified by the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of an Eclipſe of the Sun, is no leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than that of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though it be
ſhorter. But he is cenſured by Some, for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a few Digreſſions in a work ſo cloſe and
ſhort, as the Hiſtory he writes. The firſt is found
in the beginning of his ſecond book, where the
<hi>Scythians</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> have a debate on the
point of honour, in what relates to their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
both of them pretending to have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reaſons to call themſelves, the moſt Ancient
People of the Earth. The ſecond is in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
book, on the ſubject of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whoſe
birth, voyages, learning, virtues, and death, he
deſcribes, without forgetting the misfortune
which happened to his Diſciples, whereof three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
were burnt in <hi>Croton,</hi> and the reſt exiled.
Whence one may conclude, that all ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
are not to be condemned; when ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
an Author as <hi>Juſtin,</hi> who contracted into ſo
little a ſpace, the Hiſtory of the Tranſactions of
two thouſand years (which are reckoned from
<hi>Ninus</hi> the Founder of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy,
to the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi>) made no difficulty
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56273:132"/>
ſometimes to divert himſelf this way upon an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
ſubject.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s manner of writing is ſo
excellent, that it was thought worthy of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
his Age, rather than of that of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonines;</hi>
his elegancy of Stile cannot atone for
his miſtakes in relation.<note place="margin">Cap. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Pererius</hi> has convinced
him of many errors in reference to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</note>
in his <hi>Commentaries upon Daniel.</hi> And <hi>Vopiſcus</hi>
places him in the rank of Hiſtorians who could
not avoid lying: but one may ſay, that his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
him with <hi>Livy, Saluſt,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
renders that accuſation very light. That which
he cannot be excuſed in, is Chronology, where
he was ſo much miſtaken, that one ought not to
follow him alwaies. And that which makes his
fault the greater, is that the reputation of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
Pompeius,</hi> and the eſteem which all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
had for him, obliges men to think, that
thoſe miſreckonings in the ſequel of times, are
rather of the Copy, than the Original, or of the
Abreviator, rather than the Primitive Author.
Which is the ordinary judgment of thoſe who
have laboured moſt in the beſt Editions of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:56273:133"/>
I Should have ended here, according to my firſt
intention, not finding after <hi>Juſtin</hi> and the
time of the <hi>Antonines,</hi> any Latin Hiſtorian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Ancients, whence one might draw any
profitable inſtruction to compoſe a Hiſtory, or
whoſe works might merit a ſerious reflection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it ſhould be abſolutely to condemn the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and ill conduct of them. They who are
uſually called the Writers of the <hi>Auguſt Hiſtory,
Spartianus, Wlcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio,
Julius Capitolinus, Lampridius,</hi> and <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> have
nothing in them contrary to this propoſition, or
otherwiſe conſiderable, except it be that they
teach us things of many Emperors, whereof we
hardly learn any thing elſewhere, though indeed
<hi>Vopiſcus</hi> is the leaſt faulty of them. <hi>Trebellius
Pollio</hi> may be put in the ſecond order. <hi>Spartianus,
Lampridius,</hi> and <hi>Wlcatius</hi> are incomparably more
faulty and more negligent than the others; and
<hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> is the worſt of all, by the advice
of thoſe who have taken the pains to examin them.
But it is very ſtrange that a whole Age and more
ſhould paſs away, from that of the <hi>Antonines</hi> to
<hi>Diocletian</hi> (under whom all thoſe before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
did write) without the appearance of one
good Hiſtorian in the Roman Empire, who might
deſerve to have his works deſcend to us. Neither
will <hi>Sextus Aurelius Victor</hi> (who came a little
after) merit a better eſteem, whoſe abridged Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56273:133"/>
contains but a word of each Emperor's Life,
from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to <hi>Julian;</hi> nor would it be any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to him if we ſhould confound in one, the
three who bore the ſame name of <hi>Sextus Victor,</hi>
to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great. And as for <hi>Eutropius,</hi>
who dedicates almoſt at the ſame time, his <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Breviary,</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> and whom
<hi>Suidas</hi> calls <hi>an Italian Sophiſter,</hi> I ſhall ſay little of
him, as having nothing comparable in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to thoſe of the celebrated Authors, whoſe
works we have examined. There remains only
<hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> whom I cannot with a
good conſcience decline, he having compiled a
juſt body of Hiſtory, and by whom I will finiſh
this Treatiſe: for we cannot extend it to the Age
of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> as we have done that of the Greek
Hiſtorians; unleſs we ſhould introduce <hi>Jornandes,</hi>
and <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> indiſcreetly mingling the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Goths,</hi> with the purity and adreſs of
the beſt Authors of the Latin Language.</p>

               <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
HISTORY
OF
AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS.</head>
               <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>Ammianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
is not conſiderable in reſpect of the
beauty of his language. For he was a <hi>Greek</hi>
by Nation, as he himſelf declares at the end of
his laſt book. And from an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Libanius</hi> to
him, it is inferred, that he was a Citizen of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;</hi>
he ſpeaks of him with Elogies, as often as
occaſion does occur, excuſing him in his two and
twentieth Book, on the ſubject of the Invectives of
the <hi>Miſopogon</hi> of <hi>Julian,</hi> which he affirms to have
been exceſſive, and contrary to what might be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
with truth. After the death of the Emperor
<hi>Valens,</hi> he retired to <hi>Rome,</hi> where it is beleived
by very probable conjectures, that he complied
his Hiſtory after he had paſſed through the moſt
honourable Offices of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
under divers Emperors, having been in his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56273:134"/>
youth, of the number of thoſe who were then
named <hi>Protectores Domeſtici;</hi> which was a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that reſembles that of the <hi>Gardes du Corps</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Guards of the King of France his body.</note> an ordinary ſtep to the higheſt Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the State. He flouriſhed under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<hi>Gratianus</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and wrote his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
in one and thirty books, which he began at
the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign, or the beginning of
<hi>Nerva,</hi> and continued to the death of <hi>Valens;</hi>
the firſt thirteen of them are loſt, and the eighteen
that remain, are full of imperfections, which the
injury of time, and the inſolent temerity of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
have introduced in them,<note place="margin">Henr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius.</note> as the learned
Author of the laſt Edition of that work, has very
prudently obſerved.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to judge that the books of <hi>Ammianus</hi>
his Hiſtory, which are wanting, were writ much
more compendiouſly, than thoſe we have; for
he compriſed in the thirteen firſt, the Reigns of
as many <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as were between <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi>
who makes the beginning of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth;
all the reſt which followed being imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to deſcribe, what paſt from that laſt Emperor's,
to <hi>Gratian</hi>'s time, under ſeven Reigns only. We
have ſpoken in the Section of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of thoſe
who undertook to write in Foreign Tongues. I
will not repeat any thing here that I there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
but only add, that if the Hiſtory of <hi>Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Marcellinus</hi> receives ſome prejudice from his
defects in the Latin Elocution, in which a <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
and a Souldier by profeſſion as he was, could
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56273:135"/>
not very much excell, it is ſo well recompenſed
by the merit of the thoughts, and all the reſt of
his work, that an advantagious place, amongſt the
Prime and Principal Hiſtorians, cannot be refuſed
him, He is of the number of thoſe who writ the
things they ſaw, in which they often had a great
part; wherefore he has ſomething common with
<hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Nevertheleſs I do not think
(as others have done) that he is that <hi>Free Prince</hi>
of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> of whom <hi>Suidas</hi> ſpeaks,
though he bore the ſame name, and was a great
friend of <hi>Saluſtius</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who ought
not to be confounded with another of that name,
a Principal commander of the <hi>Praetorian Militia,</hi>
under <hi>Valentinian.</hi> But <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
is very much to be valued; becauſe, though he
was a Pagan, he had the diſcretion to publiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
directly contrary to Chriſtianity; and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
from many Invectives, which his equals
often in that time uſed againſt our Religion. He
gives indeed exceſſive praiſes to <hi>Julian;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de virtute Pagano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> and
though that <hi>Apoſtate</hi> cannot be too much deteſted,
for his infidelity and revolt, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but he was indued, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
definitions of the Schools, with the Moral
and intellectual virtues of Chaſtity, Magnanimity,
Learning, and Temperance, unleſs the faith of all
Hiſtories that have writ of him be diſputed; which
is needleſs in the Age in which we live, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the grace of God has left us nothing more to
fear from the Idolatry of the Ancients. If the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56273:135"/>
of <hi>Geſner</hi> may be allowed, who maintains
that <hi>Marcellinus</hi> the Hiſtorian is the ſame that
writ the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Thueydides,</hi> it may be wondered
that he treated Chriſtianity with ſo much mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The Author of the <hi>Life</hi> commends <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
for nothing ſo much, as that he had the
power over himſelf, to forbear writing with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity,
againſt <hi>Cleon,</hi> or <hi>Braſidas</hi> (who had cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be baniſhed) never ſhewing any where
his reſentment of ſo great an injury; though, to
ſpeak the truth, he did not wholly refrain from
repreſenting the bad conditions of <hi>Cleon.</hi> It is no
marvel then, that <hi>Marcellinus</hi> practiſed himſelf
what he eſteemed ſo much in others, or that he
made uſe of that virtue in his diſcourſes, which
he commended in thoſe of <hi>Thucydides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the conſiderations which ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to a greater eſteem of the Hiſtory of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meaning the French.</note>
is, that <hi>we</hi> have none like that, which
gives us the knowledge of many Antiquities of
the <hi>Gaules,</hi> or ſo well explains the Originals of the
firſt <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> of whom
it makes frequent mention. Morover it contains
many things beſides, which are found no where
elſe, and has had the approbation of all Ages ſince
it was writ, becauſe of the ſincerity and veracity of
the Author. And for his reputation, we may add
to what has been already ſaid of him, and his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
that he paſſed his laſt years with great
reputation, under the Emperors <hi>Gratian, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi>
and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:56273:136"/>
But all theſe Encomiums do not protect him,
from being accuſed of having too often acted the
part of a Philoſopher in his writings, affecting to
appear learned, beyond what the Laws of Hiſtory
permit, which do not admit of Entertainments of
ſo great oſtentation, as many of thoſe he relates.</p>
               <p>It is the ordinary fault of thoſe that are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by their profeſſion, from men of letters,
and has great reſemblance to that vice, which the
<hi>Greeks</hi> named <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies a learning
in old age; becauſe they which ſtudy when they
are advanced in age, and againſt the Rules of the
uſual courſe of ſtudy, are much more ſubject to it
than others. And indeed, <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
cannot be juſtified in many places of his Hiſtory,
where he indecently quits the proſecution of his
narration, to enter upon diſcourſes of Philoſophy,
and other Sciences, which have hardly any relation
to the matters whereof he treats. But to make the
thing clearer, and conſequently more inſtructive,
I will produce two or three examples of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
herein.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventeenth book, ſpeaking of terrible
Earthquakes, which happened under the Reign of
<hi>Conſtantius</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in the Province which
at that time bore the name of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and in many
parts of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> he makes an excellent deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and not improperly, of the ſtrange Ruines
which <hi>Nicomedia</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Bithynia</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by this accident. And if he had ſtopped there,
he had done enough, but he takes occaſion on that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56273:136"/>
ſubject, to ſeek for the Phyſical cauſes of ſuch
ſhakings in the loweſt part of the Univerſe. And
conſiders firſt what the Prieſts of his Religion ſaid
of it. Thence, examining the reaſons of <hi>Ariſtotle,
Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Anaximander,</hi> ſtrenghtned by
the Teſtimony of the Poets, and <hi>Theologians,</hi> he
ſhews that there are four ſorts of Earthquakes. And
after a long enumeration of the new <hi>Iſles,</hi> which
appeared in divers places after ſuch ſhocks, he
names thoſe that were ſwallowed up by a quite
contrary violence, and one amongſt the reſt, which
was of a greater extent than all <hi>Europe,</hi> and was
ſwallowed by the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea; which doubtleſs
he took from <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus</hi> though he does not
name him. At laſt having a long time Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
expatiated himſelf, he begins his narration
again with <hi>Julian</hi>'s reſidence at <hi>Paris,</hi> being then
only a deſigned <hi>Caeſar</hi> or Emperor.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the twentieth book, he takes
notice of a great <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the Sun, in the year
when the <hi>Scotch,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Picts</hi> waſted <hi>England,</hi> which
was that of the tenth <hi>Conſulat</hi> of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and
the third of <hi>Julian.</hi> As this was a good obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be made, and very worthy of his Hiſtory, ſo
there is no reaſon on that circumſtance, to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the moſt ſecret miſteries of Aſtronomy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in what concerns thoſe Periodical defects of the
light of the Sun, but alſo in what touches the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of the Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Poets ſay, when the Earth
darkens it with its ſhadow. He expoſes on that
ſubject the opinion of <hi>Ptolemaeus,</hi> in the ſame
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56273:137"/>
words he uſed; and not content to treat of <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
he inquires into the cauſe of the <hi>Parelia,</hi> when
we think we ſee more than one Sun in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
ſo that one would think in this place, he
quite abandons the proſecution of his Hiſtory, to
deliver to his readers, a Lecture of Aſtronomy. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
at laſt he reſumes his diſcourſe, recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preparations of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> againſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
and his jealouſy of the brave actions of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
after a tireſome and intolerable excurſion.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt example of the vicious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
of <hi>Ammianus,</hi> is in his thirtieth Book,
where he obſerves with curioſity and profit, how
the Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> was diverted by his Courtiers
from hearing cauſes pleaded, and aſſiſting at judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they might thereby purſue their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
<hi>Monapolies;</hi> and becauſe they feared, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his rigid and ſevere nature, he would cauſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to be exerciſed as legally and juſtly, as it was
a little before, under the government of <hi>Julian.</hi>
Thence he takes occaſion to inveigh againſt the
profeſſion of Advocates, which he ſays, <hi>Epicurus</hi>
named the <hi>Art of Knavery</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And the
better to repreſent the infamous proceedings of
thoſe of his time, he exaggerates the merit of one
<hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that made all <hi>Greece</hi> come to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
when he was to ſpeak in publick; and of one
<hi>Calliſtratus,</hi> who made even <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> leave
<hi>Plato</hi> in his Academy to go and hear him; And
then he mentions <hi>Hyperides, Aeſchines, Androci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Dinarchus,</hi> and one <hi>Antiphon,</hi> who was the firſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56273:137"/>
of all Antiquity that was recompenſed for plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a weighty cauſe. From the Greeks he paſſſes
to the Romans, and naming thoſe great Orators
<hi>Rutilius, Galba, Scaurus, Craſſus, Antonius, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus,</hi>
and <hi>Scaevola,</hi> he deſcends to <hi>Cicero,</hi> to prove
that formerly, they that had exerciſed the chief
imployments of State; after having been Cenſors,
Conſuls, Generals, and had Triumphed, did not
diſdain to take a place at the Bar; and add to the
glory of their precedent actions, as a Corollary,
that of having had the applauſe of a whole Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in pleading. And after having ſhown ſo fine a
Scene, he draws the Curtain, to expoſe to all eies
the ſhameful and criminal proſtitution of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
of his Age, dividing them into four ſorts,
whoſe impoſtures, impertinencies, and perplexing
tricks he does ſo particularly diſplay, that one has
much ado to get out of the Laborinth, to recover
the narration, and return to <hi>Valentinian</hi> in <hi>Tryers,</hi>
where he had left him. Though his Declamation
is very moral and elegant being ſeparately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it muſt needs be troubleſome, and tedious
as he introduces it, becauſe it too viſibly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
the courſe of the Hiſtory. And thoſe that
would be inſtructed in Phyſicks, Aſtronomy, or
Moral Philoſophy, do not ſeek ſuch leſſons in an
Hiſtorian, and to thoſe that deſign to be informed
in Hiſtory, nothing can be more uneaſy, than to
find in the midſt of a relation foreign diſcourſes,
which divide or miſlead the mind, and do but
ſhew his learning that expoſes them.</p>

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:56273:138"/>
Beſides this vicious oſtentation, which one may
eaſily perceive in thoſe three paſſages I inſtanced,
<hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> is blamed for having made
certain deſcriptions ſo Poetical, that they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſufferable. And though, as we have elſewhere
obſerved,<note place="margin">In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Agathias. Lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> Hiſtory and Poetry are good friends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and agree in many things; <hi>Cauſſinus</hi> the
<hi>Jeſuite,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Eloquence,</hi> gives divers
examples of this defect, which appear ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the writings of <hi>Ammianus,</hi> that it is hard
not to find ſome in every opening of the book. But
all theſe cenſures cannot deprive him of the praiſes
we have given him. There are generally ſpeaking,
certain things in books that are diſpleaſing, which
nevertheleſs are not to be rejected, becauſe they
ſerve for a Baſis to others which are better, and
are like the Lees, which preſerve the Wine, in
its ſpirits.</p>
               <p>But after all that has been ſaid, the imperfections
of this Hiſtorian ſeem to me ſo much the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
as the virtues of his Age were rare. And
it is that which induces me to put an end here to
my labour, hardly finding after him, any thing but
groſs errors, in the writings of thoſe Authors of
the next ſucceeding age, which buſied themſelves
in writing Latin Hiſtory. To write of the Modern
Hiſtorians is not my deſign, and the Interval of
time which divides them from the firſt of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is a juſt occaſion for me to make a ſtop here.</p>
