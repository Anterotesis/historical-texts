            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Master Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis Petition and Protestation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships presented to his Majestie, is the cheife subiect of our present debate, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire under the favour of this Honorable House, to speake somewhat concerning the same, and in speaking thereof I shall observe the persons that deluded it, the subiect and matter conteined in the same; the dangerous effects that are likely to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon if it bee not suddently prevented; And lastly their crime in making and deluding thereof.</p>
            <p>First <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> concerning the persons Actors of this tragedy, Bishops of a holy function, the dedomination of their stile prescribes them in Scripture to bee men of God, Fathers of the Church, Starres, (not blazing Commets or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52631:3"/>
(as it is to apparant, many of them have bne;) lights, the salt of the Earth. (That should seasons the hearts lives and conversation of the people of God, with piety and godlines, for these Men.</p>
            <p>Master Speaker, the hinderers of the peace and quiet of the Kingdome, is extreame vilenesse, for Bishops Governours (aswell as teachers of the people of God) to instruct, admonish, rebuke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and correct evill doers in the Clergy, for these I say not onely to convey, and winke at su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Innovations, and ceremonies introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Church, by the inferiour and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ministers, but to Amnimate and incourage them in their evill practises, nay not contented therewith, but themselves to Innovate Religion, corrupt the true and <hi>Orthodox</hi> doctrine of the Church, to attempt, to intice and draw the minds of Peeres, Nobles and great officers of State; nay his most sacred Majesty, to favour their indeavours and designes, shew them plainely to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the devill, striving to increase and build his Kingdome, to the decay of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospell; and the Kingdome of Christ, to whom they would seeme to be devoted, these corrupt officers and Ministers Master Speaker, both in Church and State, haue, produced these corrupt and dangerous times, this it is that makes religion seeme vile, and hatefull to most men, this it is Master Speaker that staines their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of it selfe uncorrupted (sacred) this changes their names of being called men of God, to be men serving onely the devill, if Fathers and nurses of the Church, prove the betrayers of the Church,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52631:3"/>
woe to that flocke of whom Christ is the sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; If starres fall to the earth, wee notifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great change and alterations in a state to insue; if the lights of the Church be put out, or put out themselves, or be hid and appeare not, how is it likely the Children of God should, see to walke in the right way, If salt be corrupt and putrified and thereby looseth its savour, what profitteth it for the use of man, you know the Phrase well enough. Then Master Speaker to conclude these persons (that have had all these titles) that have (as we have proved by woefull experience, shamed themselves, complyable to all the defects that are thus disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to their denominations) are as I under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ur conceive altogether unfit, and unworthy to beare them any longer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now <hi>Master Speaker</hi> I come in the Second place to the subiect of their Petition and Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is of most dangerous Consequence, being altogether treacherous, both against his most sacred Majestie his Royall Queene and Princ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Progeny, his rightfull Throane seated ouer all his Maiesties Kingdomes, against the Fun<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lawes of this Kingdome and all other statuts and lawes made for the good Gouernment therof by the wisdome of his Maiestie and his great and wise Councell of state, against the Priuiledges of Parliament and the free proeeedings therof, And against all his Maiesties Loyall subiects that are true and good Protestants.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly the dangerous effects of this their Malitious and traiterous actions are easie to be guessed at.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52631:4"/>1 By this meanes the division betweene the two houses may be increased, the Lords most of them favouring rheir cause, thereby keeping them from comming to triall vpon our accusations of them for their haynous Crimes Commited by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If ihey proceed in their intentions, it may prove the Maine cause of setting an Irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able division betwene the King and his Leig people who desire ther grevance may be redrest and all Malefactors delinquents receiue Condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for their misdeeds both in Church and state, And especially the Bishops accused whom they Conceaue to haue bine the principell incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries betwene Scotland and us, Great favorers of the dangerous Rebellion in Ireland, cheife Actors in Innovating our Religion, &amp; the greatest oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Parliamentarie proseedings.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By this attempt the Romish faction will be much imbouldened to put in practise their wicked plotts priuatly now in Agitation amongst them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It may cause great uproares and tumults in the City, and about <hi>Westminster,</hi> of the Citizens who are altogether set against Bishops.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will be a great incouragement to forraigne Princes that are disaffected, and private enemies to this State, (seeing our devisions betweene our selves) to put in practise some dangerous designe against the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Lastly, It will disable us for continuall supply of ayde into <hi>Ireland</hi> to app<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>se the rebellion there.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I come now (Master Speaker) to the fourth and last thing I intimate to you concerning this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52631:4"/>
Petition, and that is what fault they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in-framing and delivering the same, my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is Master Speaker, that they are guilty of high treason; I will give you a few reasons and grounds of this my opinion, and then humbly leane it to the further Consideration of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable house.</p>
            <p>To protect against the proseedings of a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is adiudged high treason in the tenth year of <hi>Edw</hi>: the second, by the Parliament holden then at <hi>Westminster</hi> where the Bishop of Yorke the Duke of Suffolke, and others of that conspiracy, protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the proceedings of the parliament for their Appointing and placeing the Commicinors about the King for the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for one yeare, were adiudged Guilty of high treason and some of them Executed, some banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the rest fleed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To endeavour to subvert the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, was adiudged high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Earle of Straffords case, my example of Strafford take this present Parliament, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test or incense the King by petition, or otherwise against the proceedings of Parliament, (which is a constitution of Government, found to be the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninentest of this Nation, and the onely meanes to preserve and defend the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome; the powerfull councell of indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, to punish all delinquents in the government thereof, and the breakers, and infringers of the laws of this land,) is to subvert the fundamentall lawes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To endeauour to bring into this state an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52631:5"/>
way of gouernment was likewise by this Parliament adiudged high treason in the Earle of Straffords case, to protest against Parliamentary proseedings, is to change that forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and to introduce an Arbitrary and tiranicall forme of Gouernment, for these reasons I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Master Speaker these Bishop that have signed this petition and protestation are guiltie of high treason.</p>
            <p>And my humble motion, is wee may send up to the Lords to accuse them Perticularly and with all Convenient speed make ready a Charge or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of high treason against them.</p>
