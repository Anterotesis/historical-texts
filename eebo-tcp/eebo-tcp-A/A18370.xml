            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So is it with worldlings,

            <p>Not to ſpeake what a

when the ſtranger leaves

as long as the world goes

when the world leaves
God, we ſhould leave the

As there is a miſery in

            <p>It is good for a man to

            <p>Honour is like a Palace

The ſtaffe of mans

            <p>The moſt laſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

Hope; which once

man either deſperately to

or with ſighing

the mournfull valley of

            <p>God hath an infinite

            <p>As the eye of Gods
providence protects the

of the moſt helliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments.
Our breaſts

            <p>Affections founded on

            <p>High time it is to flee

            <p>It is for the moſt part

            <p>Juſtice is the ſoule of a
Common-wealth: for as
a Body without a Soule

            <p>There are certaine
Springs, that when the
Sun ſhineth hotteſt, they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5184:38"/>
are coldeſt: at midnight
when the Sunne is gone,
they are then hotteſt:</p>
            <p>So it is with Man, his
zeal is coldeſt in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of proſperity; but in
the gloomie dayes of
dark adverſity, begins to
gather heat.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of the Sea Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
that ſometimes he

where as ſoone as he is

who as ſoone as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
leaps with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

leap again into the Sea,
but cannot.</p>
            <p>So it is with thoſe, who
ſtragling out of the waies
of piety, oftentimes fall
aſleep in ſinne, which
(when by death, or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
they are awakened)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5184:39"/>
think preſently to ruſh
into heaven, or upon the
inſtant to leap into the
paths of Repentance, but
then it is too late; for they
are oftentimes catcht as

the foole in the Goſpell,

            <q>Nocet empta dolore voluptas</q>

the deadly Arſenicke of

            <p>It is not good to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

but the ſoules great
feſtivall: for the pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

ſtarving of the ſoule; and
when we macerate the
body, we make the ſoule
a feaſt: if <hi>depreſsio carnis</hi>
leade not the way, <hi>elevatio
mentis</hi> will never move.</p>
            <p>There is a creature,
ſaith <hi>Plinie,</hi> in the North
parts of Sweden called a
Ierfe, of ſo ravenous and
devouring a nature, that
though his belly be nere
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5184:45"/>
ſo full, he is not ſatisfied;
he will eate till by his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he is ſcarce able to
goe, and then run to the
trees that grow neare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and there by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his body through,
diſgorgeth himſelfe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to repaire his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
for a freſh prey:
thoſe that are minded to
take him, throw a carkas
in his way, and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the trees that he runs
to when he is full, when
they once perceive him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5184:46"/>
faſt betwixt the trees,
they run to him, and kill
him.</p>
            <p>So it fares with thoſe
that never think of any
thing but how to pleaſe
their ſenſes, which the
devill obſerving, throws
divers temptations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes, which
they never ſuſpecting are
oftentimes confounded
in the very act of ſin.</p>
            <p>Of all other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

            <p>To husband well a
ſmall talent is the onely
way to mount a low for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>To be too full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
is ridiculous: to
be altogether without it,
ruſticity.</p>
            <p>Of all conditions the
moſt lamentable is that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5184:47"/>
of ignorance: an ignorant

with whom it is alwaies
night.</p>
            <p>The onely way to be
rid of a domineering
vice, is to avoid all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
thereto tending.</p>
            <p>Proſperity caſt at the
feet of the wicked, is like
a rich carpet caſt over the
mouth of a bottomleſſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5184:47"/>
pit, which allures the feet
of the ungodly, along the
path of ſecurity, into that
bottomleſſe tophet of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
miſery.</p>
            <p>A ruinous end attends
a riotous life. Well were
it for the drunkard, as he
hath liv'd like a beaſt, if
he could ſo die.</p>
            <p>If the world did but
truely conſider that there
is a Tophet prepared for
the wicked, it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

run mad through
feare and deſpaire, than
thus wallow in dreadful
ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The rich may offend
more for want of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than the poore in ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
things neceſſary.</p>
            <p>He that rectifies a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

that would reforme a

            <p>It is dangerous in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things to make Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the touchſtone:
hee that diſputeth too
much with God about
things not revealed, all the
honour he gets, is but to

to be <hi>pius pulſator,</hi> for
