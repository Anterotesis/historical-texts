            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Favours have been so many and so great, which your Grace's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Bounty has conferred upon me, that I cannot omit this opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of telling the World, how much I have been obliged, and by whom. My Gratitude will not suffer me to smother the favo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>urs in silence; nor the Pride they have rais'd me to, let me conceal, the Name of so Excellent a Patron. The honour of being favoured by the great <hi>Newcastle,</hi> is equal with any real Merit, I am sure infinitely above mine. Yet the encouragement I receive from your Grace, is the certain way to make

the World believe I have some desert, or to create in me the most favourable thoughts of my self. My Name may thus, when otherwise it would perish, live in after Ages, under the protection of your Grace's, which, is famous abroad, and will be Eterniz'd in this Nation, for your Wit beyond all Poets; Judgment and Prudence, before all Statesmen; Courage and Conduct, above all Generals; Constancy and Loyalty, beyond all Subjects; Virtue and Temperance, above all Philosophers; for skill in Weapons, and Horsemanship, and all other Arts befitting your Quality, excelling all Noblemen: And lastly, for those eminent Services in defence of your King and Countrey, with an Interest and Power much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and with Loyalty equalling any Nobleman. And indeed, the first was so great, that it might justly have made the greatest Prince afraid of it, had it not been so strongly secured by the latter.</p>
            <p>All these Heroick Qualities I admired, and worshipped at a distance, before I had the Honour to wait upon your Grace at your House. For so vast was your Bounty to me, as to find me out in my obscurity, and oblige me several years, before you saw me at <hi>Welbeck;</hi> where (when I arrived) I found a Respect so extremely above the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Condition, that I still received it with blushes; having had nothing to recommend me, (but the Birth and Education, without the Fortune of a Gentleman) besides some Writings of mine, which your Grace was pleased to like. Then was soon added to my former Worship and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,

            <p>Then (by the great honour I had to be daily admitted into your, Grace's publick and private Conversation) I observed that admirable Experience and Judgment surmounting all the Old, and that vigorousness of Wit, and Smartness of Expression, exceeding all the Young, I ever knew; and not onely in sharp and apt Replies, the most excellent way of pursuing a Discourse; but (which is much more difficult) by giving easie and unforced o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the most admirable way of begining one; and all this adapted to men of all Circumstances and Conditions. Your Grace being able to discourse with every man in his own way, which, as it shows you to be a most accurate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of all mens tempers, so it shows your Excellency in all their Arts. But when I had the favour daily to be admitted to your Grace's more retired Conversation, when I alone enjoyed the honour, I must declare, I never spent my hours with that pleasure, or improvement; nor shall I ever enough acknowledge that, and the rest of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours done me by your Grace, as much above my Condition as my Merit.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He story from which I took the hint of this Play, is famous all over <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> It was first put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Spanish</hi> Play (as I have been told) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which they believe) of such a vicious <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as is represented in this Play. From them the <hi>Italian</hi> Comedians took it, and from them the <hi>French</hi> took it, and four several <hi>French</hi> Plays were made upon the Story.</p>
            <p>The Character of the <hi>Libertine,</hi> and consequently those of his Friends, are borrow'd; but all the Plot, till the latter end of the Fourth Act, is new: And all the rest is very much varied from any thing which has been done upon the Subject.</p>
            <p>I hope the Readers will excuse the Irregularities of the Play, when they consider, that the Extravagance of the Subject forced me to it: And I had rather try new ways to please, than to write on in the same Road, as too many do. I hope that the severest Reader will not be offended at the representation of those Vices, on

which they will see a dreadful punishment inflicted. And I have been told by a worthy Gentleman, that many years agon (when first a Play, was made upon this Story in <hi>Italy</hi>) he has seen it acted there by the name of <hi>Atheisto Fulminato,</hi> in Churches, on <hi>Sundays,</hi> as a part of Devotion; and some, not of the least Judgment and Piety here, have thought it rather an useful Moral, than an incouragement to vice.</p>
            <p>I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ve no reason to complain of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uccess of this Play, since it pleased those, whom, of all the world, I would please most. Nor was the Town unkind to it, for which reason I must applaud my good Fortune, to have pleased with so little pains: there being no Act in it, which cost me above five days writing; and the last two, (the Play-house having great occasion for a Play) were both written in four days, as several can testifie. And this I dare declare, notwithstanding the soul, course, and ill-manner'd censure passed upon them, (who write Plays in three, four, or sive weeks time) by a rough hobling Rhimer, in his <hi>Postscript</hi> to another Man's Play, which he spoil'd, and call'd, <hi>Love and Revenge;</hi> I having before publickly owned the writing two Plays in so short a time. He ought not to have measured any Man's Abilities, who writes for the Stage wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h his own; for some may write that in three weeks, which he cannot in three years. But he is angry, that any man should write sense so easily, when he finds it so laborious a thing to write, even Fustian, that he is believed to have been three years drudging upon the
<pb facs="tcp:62273:6"/>
               <hi>Conquest of China<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But he ought not to be called a Poet, who cannot write ten times a better in three weeks.</p>
            <p>I cannot here pass by his sawcy Epistle to this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> which (instead of expressions of just respect, due to the Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>th and Merit of his Patron) is stuffed with railing agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st others. And first, he begins with the vanity of his Tribe. What Tribe that really is, it is not hard to ghess; but all the Poets will bear me witness it is not theirs, who are sufficiently satisfied, that he is no more a Poet than Servant to his Majesty, as he presumes to write himself; which I wonder he will do, since Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections are taken off: I know not what Place he is Sworn into in Extraordinary, but I am sure there is no such thing as Poet in Extraordinary.</p>
            <p>But I wonder (after all his railing) he will call these Poets his Brethren; if they were, me-thinks he might have more natural affection than to abuse his Brethren: but he might have spared that Title, for we can find no manner of Relation betwixt him and them; for they are all Gentlemen, that will not own him, or keep him company: and that, perhaps, is the cause which makes him so angry with them, to tax them, in his ill-manner'd Epistle, with Impudence, which he (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a particular affection for his own vice) calls by the name of Frailty. Impudence indeed is a very pretty Frailty.</p>
            <p>But (what ever the Poets are guilty of) I wish he had as much of Poetry in him, as he has of that Frailty, for the good of the Duke's Theatre; they might then
<pb facs="tcp:62273:7"/>
have hopes of gaining as much by his good Sense, as as they have lost by his Fustian.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought sit to say in vindication of the Poets, though, I think, he has not Authority enough (with men of sense) to fix any cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>mny upon the Tribe, as he calls it. For which reason I shall never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self to take notice of him herea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ter, since all men of Wit will think, that he can do the Poets no greater injury, than pretending to be one. Nor had I said so much in answer to his course railing, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Arrogance, and lead him to a little better knowledge of himself; nor does his base Language in his <hi>Postscript</hi> deserve a better Return.</p>

               <p>It was something, and a good thing too, Sirra: his whole design was to debar me of my pleasures: he kept his purse from me, and could not be content with that, but still would preach his sensless Morals to me, his old dull foolish stuff against my pleasure. I caus'd him to be sent I know not whether. But he believ'd he was to go to Heav'n; I care not where he is, since I am rid of him.</p>

               <l>THrough all the Perils of the Play I've run,</l>
               <l>But know not how your fury I may shun;</l>
               <l>I'm in new dangers now to be undone—</l>
               <l>I had but one sierce Master there,</l>
               <l>But I have many cruel Tyrants here.</l>
               <l>Who do most bloudily my life persue;</l>
               <l>Who takes my Livelihood, may take that too.</l>
               <l>'Gainst little Players you great factions raise,</l>
               <l>Make Solemn Leagues and Cov'nants against Plays.</l>
               <l>We, who by no Allies assisted are,</l>
               <l>Against the Great Confederates must make War.</l>
               <l>You need not strive our Province to o'r-run,</l>
               <l>By our own stratagems we are undone.</l>
               <l>We've laid out all our Pains, nay Wealth for you,</l>
               <l>And yet, hard-hearted men, all will not do.</l>

               <l>Why do you come, and rant, and damn, and roar?</l>
               <l>'Sdeath, what a Devil would you have us do?</l>
               <l>Each take a Prison, and there humbly sue,</l>
               <l>Angling sor single Money with a Shoo.</l>
               <l>What, will you be <hi>Don Johns?</hi> have you no remorse?</l>
               <l>Farewell then, bloudy men, and take your course.</l>
               <l>Yet stay—</l>
