         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable Sir Francis Child, Kt. Lord Mayor of the City of London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Your Lordſhip's Acceſſion to the CHAIR, advanced by ſo many Eminent Merits to that High Poſt, there needs but a very little Spirit of Prophecy to foretel with what true Glory Your Lordſhip will execute that Honourable Truſt. To ſay, Your Lordſhip will anſwer the Expectation of the World, ſpeaks too little: There's ſomething more than Expectation, an Univerſal Aſſurance and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Your Lordſhip's Performance.</p>
            <p>And whilſt the Worſhipful <hi>Company</hi> of GOLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SMITHS, have, after a three Years Ceſſation, reviv'd the Cuſtomary <hi>Splendor</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> on this Solemn Occaſion, I dare not ſay, 'tis wholly their own Natural <hi>Grandeur</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> ſo much as their <hi>Gratitude</hi> that furniſhes the <hi>Entertainment.</hi> Your Lordſhip makes ſo conſiderable a Luſtre, and gives that Ornament to their Society; that this Publick <hi>Triumph,</hi> on Your Inauguration-Day, is not ſo much a Preſent they make You, as a Debt they pay You.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50750:3"/>
Of all Your Lordſhip's numerous Virtues, the truly Noble Train that attend You thither, Your Unſhaken Conſtancy to Your <hi>Native Altars</hi> ſeems to carry the Leading Glory. Your Lordſhip's truly Chriſtian <hi>Undivided</hi> Knees, pay that greater and more entire Adoration to an Eternal Throne, than to make at one time a <hi>Cain</hi>'s, and, at another, an <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice. Your Lordſhip would ſtart at ſo poor a <hi>Prevarication</hi> with Omnipotence, as to bring a Sheaf of <hi>Stubhle</hi> to Your <hi>Morning</hi> Oblation, and a <hi>Lamb</hi> to Your <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> one.</p>
            <p>Nor are Your Lordſhip's Moral Perfections leſs Conſpicuous: You aſcend to this Metropolitan Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wholly untainted with the too common <hi>Avarice</hi> of Greatneſs. No, my Lord, You come not thither to Gather, but Shower the Gold; whilſt warm'd and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by Your own innate. Principles both of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> thoſe two Illuſtrious Ornaments of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, Your Lordſhip has reſolved to recal from their late <hi>Baniſhment:</hi> And indeed thoſe truly radiant Virtues could never appear on the <hi>Praetorian Chair</hi> with nobler Luſtre than now; conſidering they will ſo immediately break forth in that full Glory there, after ſo total an Eclipſe before. 'Tis thus Your Lordſhip deſigns in Your Adminiſtration of Your <hi>Mayoralty</hi> to waken and revive the late drooping and languiſhing <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>City:</hi> And indeed to give a new Reſurrection to the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the <hi>Chair;</hi> which I may honeſtly ſay has ſome time lain buried. 'Tis thus, my Lord, the Shades behind You will illuſtrate Your own Glories before You; Or, to ſpeak in the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Dialect, Thoſe <hi>Foils</hi> will ſet off Your <hi>Diamond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50750:3"/>
But what has yet more nobly ſignaliz'd Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; In the late Suppreſſion of the Defaced and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Coin, at the time when all the <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Banks</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and indeed the whole Currency of <hi>Exchequers</hi> and <hi>Treaſury's</hi> ſtood almoſt intirely ſtopt; at that time when 'twas no forfeited Credit even for the proudeſt <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>City Heads</hi> to play the Inſolvents; 'twas then Your Lordſhip's Particular, I might ſay, Only Pride, that when all the other <hi>Golden Veins of the Nation</hi> were ſtagnated, Yours alone kept their whole open Circulation: You anſwered all Bills with the ſame prompt and entire Satisfaction, perhaps to the Wonder, at leaſt to the Envy of the World. And tho' the then general Examples all round Ye, might have excuſed You from that Stretch of Payment; yet Your Lordſhip ſo valued Your Reputation, as to do Juſtice even to a Supererrogation.</p>
            <p>And here methinks Your Lordſhip's very Coat of Arms, the long <hi>Hereditary Eſcutcheon of Your Family,</hi> by a kind of <hi>Prophetical Herauldry</hi> ſeems to blazon the very Virtues of Your Lordſhip that bears them; when Your Lordſhip's <hi>Argent Eagles</hi> truly ſoard, whilſt your Neighbours flagg'd and droop'd.</p>
            <p>But in enumerating Your Lordſhip's ſingular Worth and Deſerts, I am enter'd into too large a Field, and therefore ſhall modeſtly retire, with ſubſcribing my Self,</p>

            <head>TO THE Worſhipful Company OF GOLDSMITHS.</head>
            <p>AS we are all naturally Ambitious to ſerve the Nobleſt Maſters, You may believe, Gentlemen, that my humble Muſe takes no common Pride in being call'd up to entertain You. For beſides the particular commanding Merits of ſo many Honourable Members of Your Society, I cannot but conſider what extraordinary dazling Luſtre even Your Profeſſion it ſelf carries with it.</p>
            <p>When I enter into the Goldſmiths Laboratory, methinks I ſee even <hi>Soveraignty</hi> it ſelf ſhine there: The very Strongeſt Nerves of <hi>War,</hi> and the Richeſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of <hi>Peace,</hi> in effect the only Product of Your Forge, are all Your own. Nay, even <hi>Crown'd Heads</hi> hold their very Thrones but by a Precarious Tenure, without Your <hi>Mints of Gold</hi> to ſupport 'em.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Columbus</hi> in his <hi>Peruvian Diſcovery,</hi> found out a <hi>New World</hi> for little more than only to ſupply Your Furnace: Nay, the very <hi>Sun</hi> himſelf is but the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Fellow-Labourer, whilſt his moſt vigorous Beams warm the rich Beds, and impregnate all the whole Mineral Veins, to furniſh Your Shops of <hi>Gold. Gold,</hi> I may honeſtly ſay, (Your Handy-work) <hi>does</hi> all Things, nay indeed <hi>is</hi> all Things, or at leaſt makes all Things its own. 'Tis from the Golden Mine that the Pallaces of Monarchs, nay the very Temples and Altars of Heaven, receive not only their Nobleſt Ornaments, but even their very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>And tho', 'tis true, that ſometimes that too fatal Mineral, may be the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vice, or the Purchaſe of Shame and Injuſtice; yet to over-ballance thoſe more unhappy Influences, 'tis no leſs the higheſt Reward of <hi>Virtue.</hi> Induſtry, Study, Labour, and all the honeſt Toils of Life ſweat only for that Prize: In ſhort, we are all <hi>Smiths</hi> at Your <hi>Anvile,</hi> and only hammer for the <hi>Gold.</hi> Thus, tho the Golden Show'r may ſometimes fall into a wanton <hi>Danae's</hi> Lap, yet 'tis that very glittering Metal too, that wreaths the Bracelets, and moulds the very Coronets for a <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, not to expatiate upon ſo voluminous a Subject, 'tis enough to Congratulate Your preſent Pride and Glory, in having the faireſt <hi>Royal</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>Deputy</hi> Royal) <hi>Collar</hi> of SS's, and the Richeſt <hi>Gold Chain</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> among You: To whom wiſhing all Continuance of <hi>Honour,</hi> and Your Selves of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> I am,</p>
