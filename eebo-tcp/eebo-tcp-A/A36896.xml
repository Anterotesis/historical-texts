            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        </gap>O I know you take no great Pleasure in Addresses of this Nature, yet, by</hi> an happy Experience <hi>I can say it,</hi> Pardoning of Faults <hi>is not uneasie to you; especially those that can't be avoided: This is of that Nature: for</hi> what Man could forbear writing a Thousand Letters, after you had engag'd your self to answer 'em? <hi>And where could I think to find so Illustrious a Patron, to give 'em Credit and Esteem, in such an Age as this, so over-charg'd with</hi> Wit and Sense? <hi>What if the World's a Stranger to your</hi> Rank and Person? <hi>It knows in your Thoughts what sufficiently declares your</hi> strict Alliance to Vertue; <hi>and nothing can take your Title to support it, but must have some Pretensions to instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in the Laws of Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I confess you are</hi> a Lady of a particular Genius: <hi>for those that see you, know little of your Mind; and the World you communicate your Thoughts to,</hi> neither see nor know your Person: <hi>Nay, some believe you have no real Being but in my <hi>Brain.</hi> I am oblig'd to 'em for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me such</hi> a Man of Art, <hi>that can divide my Principles; for 'tis apparent those I act by, are very different from those I make use of to</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reprove my Actions; <hi>Yet all this while (say these Men) the Title of <hi>Honourable Lady</hi> is but a Fiction I amuse the World with. I know your Ladyship is unconcern'd what is thought of it; I am not: but would be thought</hi> a Man of Truth; <hi>and, if I knew how, would fain convince 'em of their Mistake; but if</hi> only Seeing is Believing with 'em, <hi>I can never do it; that sort of Conviction I shall never have in my power; and if they will not believe upon the Credit of an</hi> Honest Man, <hi>I can go no farther.</hi>

Could they have secured to themselves good Thoughts, as Dr.</hi> Fuller <hi>presum'd they always had, their</hi> Retreat <hi>must needs have been happy: But St.</hi> Jerome <hi>found it not so well; for in the midst of his macerating Mortifications, his Imagination brought him a</hi> Troop of beautiful Maids in a Dance, <hi>as he himself relates.

                     </p>
                     <p>To this I answer, There appears to me a greater happiness in an unenvyed Cottage, than in the Noisy Crowds of Flatterers. <hi>Little does the Plebcian know how heavy a Crown weighs,</hi> how great the Trust is, and how hard to be managed; 'Tis the Court that's full of <hi>Ambition. Bribes, Treachery,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Watch</hi> must be kept so strictly, that there's no time to act Vertuously. But in the retired Solitudes of <hi>Poverty,</hi> one Fourth of our Temptations are lost; the uneasiness of the Flesh, causes a search after the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of the Mind. I mention'd in my last, <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and several others, who laid by their Scepters for Spades; and I might here tell you how happy the change was—</p>
                     <p>But 'twill be again objected, That <hi>the Rich have many Friends, but few (if any) caress the Poor.</hi> I shall therefore be thought to be half mad, to write thus <hi>in Praise of Poverty,</hi> which is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally despised, but without any good Reason; for abundance of this World is a Clog to the <hi>Christian Pilgrim:</hi> With what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty do those that have Riches enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?—I hear <hi>Israel</hi> praying in <hi>Egypt,</hi> quarrelling in the Wilderness; when they were at their Brick-Kilns, they would be at their <hi>Devotion;</hi> and no sooner are they at ease, but they are wrangling for their <hi>Flesh Pots.</hi> I dare say, many a man had not been so wicked, if he had but been Poor. It is the saying of a Great Divine, That <hi>Solomon's Riches did him more hurt than his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did him good.</hi> Affliction and Want do that many times, which fair means cannot; Wealth, like Knowledge, puffs up, when <hi>Poverty</hi> makes men flock to Christ. 'Tis <hi>the Poor receive the Gospel;</hi> then how much better is Poverty than Riches, if it carries me to Heaven? Who wou'd not be a <hi>Lazarus</hi> for a Day, that he might sit in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom for ever? Poverty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd, but 'tis the best Physick: I know not whether Prosperity

                        </hi> It is pity fair Weather shou'd do any harm: Yet it is often seen Riches makes many forget those Friends which Want wou'd make cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who wou'd pursue the World, when Poverty makes us happy? <hi>Alas! Madam,</hi> This World is a Lyar, and he will find it so, that (like you and <hi>Philaret)</hi> does not <hi>retreat</hi> from it. But tho Men wou'd come to Heaven, yet they do not like this way; they like well of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, but not at <hi>Dives</hi> Door. But alas! Riches, like the Rose, are sweet, but prickly; the Honey doth not counter vail the Sting, they end in Vexation; and, like <hi>Iudas,</hi> while they Kiss, they Petray. <hi>Riches,</hi> like their Master, are full of Deceit, promise what they have not.

True Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches consist not in having much, but in not desiring more. Some think they have not enough, if they have not all. Thus have I seen some Beasts, not knowing when they were well, burst with feeding.</p>
                     <p>Did not <hi>Diogenes</hi> well perceive this, being not illuminated with any other knowledge, than only that which <hi>Nature taught him:</hi> When he chose such a kind of life, which (I think) is unknown to no man, whereby he made himself equal, and fellow (as it were) with Fortune? Surely, his Estate was most happy, and yet had he neither <hi>Money, Possessions, Medows, Gardens, or Houses;</hi> neither would he that <hi>Alexander</hi> should bestow any on him. For, as the History noteth, <hi>Alexander</hi> came one day to behold him as a wonder, and said unto him, <hi>Diogenes, behold, I am ready to supply thy need, because I see thee Poor. Diogenes</hi> thus boldly answered him: I pray thee which of us two seemeth to be most indigent or needy? I, who have nothing but my <hi>Mantle and my Wallet,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do desire any more; or thou, who not contented with thy Fathers Kingdom, dost offer thy self to so many dangers, only through <hi>desire thou hast to rule;</hi> and that desire is so great, as it seemeth the whole World will scarce content it? Certainly, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever judgeth the state of <hi>Diogenes</hi> unhappy; by like reason may repute himself most unhappy: perceiving the <hi>poor</hi> man to be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and himself never satisfied: The things of this World, are in a manner but Apparitions; not so indeed: why then do we so labour to abound, and not rather to be content? But some Men are in such <hi>haste to be Rich,</hi> that they do not climb, but <hi rend="margQuotes">vault into Preferment at a Leap: I know not their sleight, I mistrust their quickness; few Men were ever <hi>Great and Good in an Instant;</hi> all the harm I wish these is, that their early ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> do them no harm; but what does their Wealth signifie, seeing Earth is but our Road to Heaven, and Riches such mean
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59872:13"/>
things, that like High way Fruit, they are common to all—Besides, <hi>what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his Soul?</hi> I will grudge no Man Riches, if he has 'em (as most have) upon those Terms. It shall suffice me there is another World to come, and that mine (if I follow <hi>Sabina</hi>'s Advice) shall begin when this is ended.—I will be content to want this for a while, that I may enjoy that other for ever. What is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> the better to <hi>out shine Lazarus,</hi> and at last die and be damn'd? The good Man takes his God as he doth his Wife, for <hi>Richer for Poorer, in sickness and in health:</hi> We may not always judge of God's Favour by his Bounty; I am but a <hi>Novice in Religion,</hi> if I think I can be <hi>God's Son, and miserable.</hi> A Rich Court is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sight, but he that looks up to Heaven, will not care for the World. All the Afflictions of this World cannot answer the Joys of that other. Then where is the Damage in being poor? For as Fortune is not my Landlady, so I fear not her displeasure; and, which still adds to the Happiness of a <hi>Poor Condition,</hi> if I posses nothing, my Account is the less. But to the Disgrace of Riches, 'tis <hi>hard in Prosperity</hi> for Men to remember themselves, and what they have <hi>received of God;</hi> we are apt to forget what we have been, when we are <hi>changed for the better. Pharoah</hi>'s Butler hath forgot he was a Prisoner. It is too true that too many love God for their own sakes, either they are <hi>poor, and would be rais'd,</hi> or they are sick and wou'd be heal'd; and like Beggars, no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are they serv'd, <hi>but they are gone—</hi>I could tell ye (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) of a Miser worth Hundreds, that never did a Generous Act, but promis'd mighty things if he arriv'd to such an Estate. If I had his Wealth (as I am Heir to it) and do no more good, I shall add to my Condemnation, together with my Store: I will therefore study rather to use my little well, than to encrease it—God is therefore bountiful to us, that we might be so to others: <hi>He alone hath the true use of Wealth, that receives it only to disburse it.</hi>

                        <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Elder, entering into his Son's Lodging, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding there great store of Rich Jewels and Gold, said unto him, <hi rend="margQuotes">My Son, I did not give thee these Riches to use in this sort, but to impart them to thy Friends.</hi> But so few spend their Riches as they ought, that I think Poverty preferrable to Wealth; and the rather, as Poverty comes not from the East, nor from the West, but from God himself. He hath said to every Man, <hi>Rule thou hare, or work thou there, be this, or thus:</hi> Then why do Men grudge at their Wants, when it is not Chance, but Providence? <hi>It is less praise to be Rich, than to be able to despise the world;</hi> the less I

'Tis true, when Fortune smiles upon a Man, his Relations that shunn'd his Company when it frown'd upon him, flock to him again, as if he were <hi>come from a strange Country,</hi> to welcome him home; they now offer their Services, with a thousand Protestations of the <hi>sincerest Friendship</hi> to him, whom a little before they denied to have <hi>a drop of their Blood in his Veins.</hi> But tho the only thing Men are valued for, is their Money, yet a <hi>Moderate Fortune</hi> is the only thing to be wish'd and pray'd for in this World, lest we be either tempted to Wantonness, thro a too great Plenty; or pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Despair by the Sting of a pinching Necessity.

                        <hi>Salvian</hi> saith, that Christ himself is <hi>Mendicorum maximus,</hi> the greatest Beggar in the world, as one that shareth in all his Saints necessities, and will never forget the charitable person. <hi>Cicero</hi> could say, <hi>That to be rich, is not to possess much, but to use much.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> could rebuke them that so studied, to increase their wealth; that they forgot to use it.

a pious Bishop; to give somthing to charitable uses, he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last to give three hundred Pounds; but first took Bond of the Bishop that it should be repayed him in another world before he had been one day dead. He is said to have appeared to the Bishop, delivering in the Bond cancelled, as thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging what was promised was made good, according to that promise.</p>
                     <p>What we give to the <hi>Poor,</hi> we secure from the Thief; but what we with hold from his Necessity, a Thief possesses. God's Exchequer is the <hi>Poor Man's Box;</hi> when we strike a Tally, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Debtor. <hi>Faelix</hi> the Fifth, being demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he kept any Hounds? he brought them that asked him to a place where a great company of poor people sate down together at Dinner, saying, <hi>Behold, these are my Hounds, which I feed daily,</hi> with the which I hope to hunt for the Kingdom of Heaven. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was a rare Spokes-man for the <hi>Almighty's Box</hi> (such are the Poor) when he said, That God commanded Alms, not so much for the Poors sake, as the good of the Rich:—Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls Charity to the Poor, <hi>An Art the most thriving of all Arts.</hi> Nay, the Almighty often maketh present payment (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how hardly he can get Credit from our Insidelity) and even in Temporals. Thy bread cast upon the Waters, maketh better than <hi>Fast India Voyages.</hi>—But if the Rich should be hard hearted, the Poor have Law on their side, and can force the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish (where they were born) to keep 'em.—And if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be Kin to Estates, and han't Moneys to claim their Right, yet they can sue <hi>in Forma-Pauperis;</hi> and if the Lawyers were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, I don't see but the Poor are the most likely to carry the Day, as their Necessities plead, as well as the Lawyer, and the Justice of their Cause—Or if they are bauk'd in a Just Suit, the worst that can be said, is,—<hi>There goes a Poor (injur'd) Honest Man,</hi> which is more Honourable than to have it said,—<hi>There goes a Rich Knave.</hi> But suppose they had no Advocate, yet at <hi>worst</hi> they can beg for their daily Bread, and then when they sleep, Heaven is their Canopy, and <hi>Mother Earth their Pillow.</hi> Beggars, more than others, seem to be the peculiar Care of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. <hi>Then who'd be a King, when a Beggar Lives so well?</hi> or if all support for their bodies fail, to stand their ground, and look to Heaven for <hi>a handful of supply,</hi> speaks their Faith: At a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Den, or a fiery Furnace,</hi> not to turn our back, is a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation worthy a Prophet.—When our Saviour wou'd put to silence the distrusters of his Time, he points them to the <hi>Lillies of the Field,</hi> (not of the Garden; which are digg'd and dung'd)

but of the Field, which have <hi>no Gardiner but the Sun,</hi> no water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pots but the Clouds; and your Heavenly Father <hi>(says he)</hi> cloaths these.—Then who'd be afraid of Poverty, that has such a merciful Father to go to?—'Tis true, the Poor are Slaves to the Rich, and their words little regarded.

                     <p>I <hi>Confess I have, as well as you, observed, that</hi> Poverty <hi>is much despised: I have known some Persons, tho Pretenders to Religion, speak with more Contempt of those they</hi> knew to be Poor, <hi>than of those that were by all detested for their Vices; yet I can't but think it <hi>worth ones w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I own 'tis the best thing this World can pretend to,</hi> yet like it self as full of Cares, Troubles, and Vexations, and is given to the <hi>Children of this World as their Proper Portion;</hi> for they are capable of no better; and because God will be Debtor to none, those Corrupt and Imperfect Services they render him, shall be rewarded with such Corruptable and Imperfect Blessings as <hi>Riches</hi> can procure 'em.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There's hardly any instance can be given of their ever making any person</hi> more Religious and Devout, more indifferent, and wean'd from the World, more humble and resigned to God, <hi>both in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and suffering his Will. These are the Vertues attending <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> which are carefully entertain'd by all such as aspire to those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All the Vertue</hi> Riches <hi>pretends to, is the making choice of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to bless, as they believe, with their</hi> Riches, <hi>when they die, and perhaps impart some of their</hi> Superfluity, <hi>while they Live, to some miserable people, whom they esteem so for being</hi> Poor, <hi>with intent to make 'em their slaves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But whatever Usage the World gives one for being</hi> Poor, <hi>it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, nor lessens the Blessing at all: We set a greater value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World than it deserves, to</hi> rate ones happiness by their Esteem. <hi>But whether they will allow it or no, to bear</hi> Poverty as one ought, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves Honour, and 'tis better to deserve it than to have it.</hi>

                        <hi>Not to be dejected with</hi> Poverty, <hi>and the Contempt it lies under, shews a Right Iudgment of the</hi> World, <hi>and the things of it, and</hi> speaks a Great Mind, <hi>supported with Nobler Objects; not so weak or Childish, to be uneasie in the want of</hi> Toys and Trifles; <hi>for so one may call all those Superfluities that are thought necessary to purchase E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and Respect in this vain world. God knows our</hi> True and Real Necessities, <hi>and never fails to furnish such as rely upon him;</hi> his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral hand makes all Rich <hi>whom he blesses: Even in Poverty, when he gives us Grace to seek the Kingdom of Heaven, that one Blessing adds all the rest; and what can give us better Means and Opportunity for that, then</hi> Poverty? For by cuting off all Excess, it makes us Wise, Moderate, and Sober; <hi>it brings us to Thinking and Consideration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then concludes in Humilation and Thankfulness, which God will do us the Honour to accept, and that Crowns all.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But such Advantages are rarely found in</hi> Riches, <hi>'tis possible with God sometimes to make 'em Blessings; but with Men 'tis impossible, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to those that <hi>seeks and desires 'em.</hi> But compare 'em both together in their worst Capacity,</hi> Riches does more mischief than Poverty; <hi>and 'tis only for the Love of Riches when Poverty does any mischief at all.

                     <p>I Might inform you how studious I have been from my Youth, and how curious to know more than's Reveal'd: But when I read what mighty things some men promise themselves, and what braggings and boastings when they have discover'd any thing; it makes me conclude, that God will never give a Blessing to such <hi>a violent pursuit after Knowledge,</hi> that will not keep within its bounds: Even Cutting for the Stone in the Kidneys, was once practic'd with good success, but is now, and ever since <hi>Gallen</hi>'s

                        <hi>All Ages (as if</hi> Athens <hi>had been the Original) have been Curieus in their Enquiries; Curiosity it self is so much a part of Nature, that 'tis seldom laid aside till the whole Frame is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd:</hi> Yet some few recover; (of which I'm one Instance); for my <hi>Living Incognito</hi> has quite cur'd my <hi>Athenian Itch.</hi>

                        <hi>certain strange things to our Ears,</hi> (said these <hi>Athenians</hi> to <hi>Paul,). We wou'd know therefore what these things mean.—These</hi> Athenians <hi>spent their Time in nothing else but in vain Disquisitions.</hi>—Paul <hi>seeing this, stood up in the midst of Mars-hill, and said, Ye Men of</hi> Athens, <hi>I perceive that in all things ye are too Superstitious,</hi> &amp;c. I need say little to prove I'm cur'd of this <hi>Itch;</hi> my forsaking <hi>London,</hi> and all Company, plainly shews it.—Or if I was ne'er so curious, where cou'd I be Resolv'd?

                           <hi>The Athenian Itch</hi> is a catching Distemper; it is not only in one or two Houses, but it spreads every where. And 'tis observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as the <hi>bodily.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59872:16"/>
that this Mental Itch shou'd lie more in the Ears than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Body.—For the Ears are the <hi>Doors of the Soul;</hi> without these we were but <hi>Artificial Creatures,</hi> Men only in shew: Hence we know, we discourse, we believe, we learn to speak to God, and hear God speak to us; without these we cou'd not speak, nor know, nor understand. <hi>In a word, by these</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) we are what we are—Then e'nt it pity such use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Organs shou'd be defil'd with the <hi>Athenian Distemper?</hi> But so, it is, and I scarce know a Man but has itching Ears: I was pester'd with this Itch for 5 years my self, <hi>(witness the Athenian Mercury,</hi> which continued for that time); but being cured, I wou'd do my best to cure others, more especially those <hi>Nice Querists</hi> that my <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Mercury</hi> has any ways infected. But I undertake the Cure of these Men with small hopes of Success; for tho with common things Men are little affected, (while <hi>Moses</hi> doth only what the Magicians can, he is slighted), yet Men are taken with something that is not ordinary. All <hi>Samaria</hi> will run out to see a Man can tell them all that ever they did; and I doubt whether the Apostles drew not more after their Miracles, than their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; when they begin to heal, and cast out Devils once, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> will be one too: But this <hi>Athenian Itch</hi> is Destructive to Soul and Body; when <hi>Adam</hi> wou'd better his knowledge, he lost his dwelling in Paradise; and when those <hi>Builders of Babel</hi> wou'd mend <hi>their Dwelling</hi> they lost their knowledg. The Itch of finding the Philosophers Stone, or of being great, or pointed at, how many hath it undone? For my share, I will never more care to be, or to know that which I know shall repent me: What <hi>Honour</hi> is it to <hi>Iames the Second</hi> that he was once King? or to me (in my Private Cell) that I ha' once been <hi>Some-body?</hi> 'Tis clear that in some Cases, and some things, a Man may <hi>know too much.</hi> It is not good to be prying into the <hi>Privy Councels</hi> of God, St. <hi>Austin</hi> being asked what God did before he made the World, Answered, <hi>He was making a Hell for such Curious Inquirers.</hi>—Thus dealt <hi>Demaratus</hi> with a Curious and Importunate Fellow that had oftentimes asked of him, <hi>Who was the honestest man in</hi> Sparta? <hi>He that resembleth thee least,</hi> quoth he unto him.—The Answer also of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> was not unsitly made to one that sk'd him, <hi>What he carryed</hi> there <hi>folded?</hi> It is wrapt up (quoth he) because thou shouldest not know what it is?

                     <p>The Sun returneth every morning to the same place he came from, with like form, and self-same substance—The <hi>Days and Nights</hi> pass by course, and ever continue of like Essence.—The Fields are every year deek'd with the same Flowers, like
<pb facs="tcp:59872:24"/>
pleasant Herbs, and the very same Accidents yearly. Nothing is the Object of our Senses, but what is ordinary and familiar: We see nothing strange and <hi>New:</hi> what we do to day, that we do to morrow, and every day. What Men call a <hi>Discovery</hi> is a meer Banter upon our Understanding: For my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Book of Aphorisms proves, <hi>that which we call New and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start, to be the truest Antiquity.</hi>—And the Sage Common-wealth of the <hi>Lycians</hi> heretofore ordained, That all those who should propose <hi>any Novelty in matter of Law,</hi> should deliver it in publick with an Halter about their Necks, to the end, that if their Propositions were not found to be good and profitable, the <hi>Authors thereof should be strangled in the place.</hi>—The <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> held it ominous to pretend to any <hi>New Form,</hi> even of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Indifferency. When <hi>Darius</hi> had altered the Fashion of his Sword, which used to be <hi>Persian,</hi> into the form of <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> (in the year immediately before the fought with <hi>Alexander)</hi> the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> or South-sayers, prophesied, That into what Fashion <hi>Darius</hi> had altered his Sword, so Time wou'd reduce his State; and that the <hi>Persian</hi> Glory was drawing unto her <hi>last Period,</hi> by subjecting her self unto the <hi>Soveraign of Macedon:</hi> Which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was soon confirm'd by the next years Conquest.—<hi>And as the Ancients held it ominous to pretend to any New Form,</hi> so 'tis as clear in the Instance I gave in the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> &amp;c. and other parts of the Creation. That Thnigs here below seem NEW to many; and are so miscall'd; which in themselves are Old, and known so, to sounder Judgments.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true Mr. T——tells us <hi>(in his Treatise of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence) <hi>that Philosophy it self had never been improved, had it not been for NEW Opinions.</hi>

B.</hi> in his book of <hi>Extraordinary Adventures,</hi> tells us of a <hi>Barber,</hi> who kept Shop at the end of the Suburbs, call'd, <hi>Pyreum in Athens,</hi> he had no sooner heard of the great discomfiture of the <hi>Athenians in Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> from a certain Slave fled from thence out of the Field, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Shop at <hi>six and sevens,</hi> he ran directly into the City to carry the Tydings fresh and new,</p>
                     <l>For fear some other might the Honour win,</l>
                     <l>And he too late, or second shou'd come in.</l>
                     <p>Now upon reporting these unwellcome Tydings, there was a great stir within the City; the People assembled to the Market
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59872:25"/>
Place, <hi>search was made for the Author of this Rumor.</hi> Hereupon the Barber was haled before the Body of the People, and being examined hereof, he knew not so much as the Name of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from whom he had heard the News: Upon which, the whole Assembly were so moved to Anger, that they cryed, <hi>Away with the Villain, set the Rascal upon the Rack; have him to the Wheel, who had devised this Story of his own fingers ends.</hi>—The Wheel of Torture was brought, and the Barber was tormented upon it. In the mean while, there came <hi>certain News</hi> of that Defeat, and thereupon the Assembly broke up, leaving the Barber racked out at length upon the Wheel, till it was late in the Evening, at which time he was let loose; <hi>yet was no sooner at liberty, but he must enquire. News of the Executioner,</hi> what he had heard abroad of the General <hi>Nicias,</hi> and in what manner he was slain.—</p>

'Tis a saying, there is <hi>but One Good Wife in the World, and ev'ry Man enjoys her</hi> (or, in other words, if he that's marry'd cou'd see ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good Wife besides his own, he'd see something wou'd be <hi>thought New)</hi> but it is not because <hi>it is so,</hi> but because <hi>it seems so;</hi> other Wives, as good, or better than ours, never coming to our Knowledge.—Much less likely is it that <hi>New Diseases</hi> shou'd be produced, as some have believed, imagining that the Ancients were not Curious enough to describe all those of their Times, or their Successors diligent enough to examine their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to find them there. That Diseases, some Hundred years ago, were the very same as they are now, is evident in that One Distemper the <hi>French Pox,—</hi>which tho charged to <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Account, as a <hi>New Disease</hi> of his own begetting, yet 'tis easily proved, by <hi>Sennerius,</hi> and other Authors, that 'twas found at <hi>Naples</hi> many hundred years before 'twas call'd the <hi>French Disease;</hi> and I cou'd as easily prove it had not its Rise at <hi>Naples,</hi> but was frequent in other Places, before it was heard of there.—So that (as I said before) many things appear New which are not so, if we look into 'em.—Thus Printing, and Guns, which we believe were invented within these 200 years, are found to have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59872:28"/>
been in use among the <hi>Chineses</hi> above a Thousand Years ago.—A like Instance we have in the <hi>London-Lotteries</hi> (and that establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Act of Parliament) which some will tell ye were never heard of till the <hi>English Wits</hi> set 'em on foot; tho 'tis not a month since I heard an <hi>Italian</hi> say, these Lotteries were practis'd in <hi>Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> many years before they were mention'd in <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>One wou'd think (Madam) my being Banish'd to a <hi>Private Cell</hi> shou'd raise in my Breast an Aversion to your Sex, (by Reason my Dear wou'd not prevent it) yet I see nothing can change my nature; for the Thoughts of the good Wife I lately Buryed, and that <hi>kind one,</hi> I yet hope to find in <hi>Valeria,</hi> fills me with an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Opinion of Marriage,</hi> and truly (Madam) your Displeasure at this, has strangely <hi>Mis-lead your Friendship,</hi> if it makes you angry with me for being such <hi>a Loving-Creature.</hi>—Sure, <hi>Sabina,</hi> you were not in Earnest when <hi>(after the Death of my first Wife)</hi> you reflected on my design of <hi>speedy Marrying again</hi>—That Widdower only loved at first as he ought, who Marries again as soon as (decently) he can; 'tis a known Truth, those love their first Wives best, who Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soonest <hi>(there's a Remarkable instance of this now at Hackney)</hi> neither is it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to think they'd run Head-long into a State of Life, wherein they had been unfortunate; alas, Madam, a good Wife at first does but whet ones Appetite the more for another, and make; one e'en languish for <hi>a second part to the same Tune</hi>—A good Wife is but Woman in Body alone, and a Woman with a

wise Soul is the fittest Companion for Man, otherwise God wou'd ha' given him <hi>a Friend rather than a Wife;</hi> but we find even in Paradice twon't good for Man to be alone, and that even then a she-Companion was the meetest helper. If Man <hi>in Innocency needed a Help, Solace, and Comfort,</hi> and Marriage was all these, how deficient were our (now miserable) Lives without it? For besides that it <hi>doubles Ioys and divides Griefs,</hi> it creates new and unthought-of Contenments. So that I admire Marriage is so <hi>unfashionable,</hi> and that you and others are so backwards to't, for it not only includes all the <hi>Sweets of Life,</hi> but he that hath a Wife which Loves him, <hi>hath two Selfs, and possesses all his Faculties double,</hi> his Hands, his Eyes, and Mind, he can at once leave Faithful at home, and carry Faithful abroad—<hi>Cato</hi> was so taken with Marriage, that he'd have no Widower live <hi>a month single;</hi> and he did not stick to maintain that it was more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be a good Husband then a great Senator—Madam, when you're blaming of <hi>hasty Matches,</hi> you quite forget, that when <hi>Ieptha</hi>'s Daughter Dyed, <hi>they mourned for that she Dyed a Maid;</hi> and the truth is, tho' we we find many Enemies to speedy Marriage, yet 'tis rare to find an Enemy to the use on't, and I don't wonder at this, for both Sexes made but Man at first, so that <hi>Marriage perfects Creation by restoring our lost Rib.</hi> Surely He, (I won't say she) was made Imperfect that is not tending to Propagation—Now all are concern'd here (even <hi>Sabina</hi> herself, if she's Flesh and Bloood) and consequently <hi>shou'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as soon as they can;</hi> for to have an honest Remedy at Hand, and yet to seek out <hi>forbidden Cures,</hi> is a Phrensy that deserves more then a Chain and a Dark Room. But tho' <hi>speedy Marriage be often a Duty,</hi> yet let generous minds beware in their <hi>haste</hi> of Marrying Poor, for tho' they care the least for Wealth, yet they'l be most gall'd with the want of it; for my own share, my Flesh is not over Malicious towards sweet meats, yet <hi>(shou'd I lose Valeria)</hi> I'd soon Marry again, for the defence of a good Custom, a great deal of Love, and a little Money—Nay, Madam, think what you please <hi>(of this speedy Marrying,)</hi> to something I must dedicate my self: for my Dear in her parting with me, seems to take away even the substance of my Soul along with her, and certainly I laid up my chief Treasure (whatever you may think of my Marrying so hastily) in the Frail and Sickly Life of that Tender Wife—But now shee's gone, <hi>I must not weep as one without hope;</hi> for she's as happy as Heaven can make her, and I as Earth can make me; if <hi>Valeria</hi> for my sake, and her own good, wou'd despise the World.—</p>
                     <p>These were the Reasons why I <hi>Marryed so soon after the Death of my first Wife,</hi> and made me think Time lost 'till I went about it; for (Madam) the Soul is framed of such an active Nature, that 'tis impossible, but it must assume some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it self to delight in; we seldom find any <hi>without Peculiar Delight in some Peculiar thing;</hi> and mine consists in carressing a Vertuous Wife. But tho' something I must <hi>Like and Love,</hi> yet nothing so Violently as to undo my self with wanting it; yet will never love a Wife so little <hi>(shou'd I Marry</hi> 50) as that she shall not Command the <hi>All of an honest Man;</hi> and what wou'd they have more?—Confess, <hi>Sabina,</hi> shou'd not these considerations weigh down all the <hi>Formalities</hi> that a Customary Practice can possibly impose? Besides, <hi>Gather your Rose-Buds whilst you may,</hi> is an old Song, and Nature having denyed me Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>(those tender Pledges of conjugal Love)</hi> it cou'd be no Crime in me to <hi>prevent the work of Time,</hi> and Marry as soon as I cou'd, for fear of Staying 'till Time were past——'Tis true, <hi>Children are the poorest way of Immortalizing as may be, and as Natural to a Beggar as a Prince:</hi> yet for all that, I shall be very Proud of <hi>getting an Heir to Sampsill</hi> (when 'tis consistent with doing Justice,) and of being a Father, tho 'twere but for one Day. Not that I'm in Post-haste; but if <hi>pure Love can make a Woman Kind,</hi> I hope (with <hi>Valeria</hi>'s leave) to be happy a second time in a Marryed State, and can never be so in any other. But <hi>Valeria</hi> sure is

                        <hi>I AM very sorry so</hi> Unhappy a Necessity should come to take from you the Glory of Constancy; for I am perswaded you would <hi>have perfected your Art of Living</hi> Incognito, without Constraint, <hi>and shew'd your self as constant to what you first chose for your Pleasure, and the Improvement of your Thoughts, as you</hi>

                        <hi>do now to</hi> Marriage, <hi>in your defence of it, after all the</hi> Ill Treatment you have so lately received from it, <hi>which, as you well observe,</hi> might have created an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the whole Sex, <hi>in a Man of a Less Loving Temper: but you still dream of finding out some way of making</hi> Valeria <hi>a Kind and Loving Wife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <l>Small hopes, 'tis true, attends your mighty Care;</l>
                     <l>But of all Passions, Love does last dispair.</l>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And indeed I should be very defective in my Friendship, were I resolv'd to blame your</hi> Loving Temper <hi>since 'tis that alone enables you to bear your Misfortunes with any Tolerable Fase, hoping still to</hi> Charm Valeria with your Love, and at last rival the Bags <hi>I wish it may ever do you so much good. I confess what I observe in</hi> those Loving Tempers, <hi>can never bring me to Ambition such a happiness as they possess with all their Injoyments, in a World so full of changes and uncertainties, and</hi> in one of the frailest things in the World, a Woman, so Compos'd of Vanity and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. <hi>Yet notwithstanding I must own (what will partly Iustifie your Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Opinion of Marriage);</hi> That Friendship never is in that Perfection as between Man and Wife; and that a Woman with a Wise Soul, is the fittest Companion for a Man: <hi>Nay if there be but one WISE SOUL between 'em, so it be but known to 'em which it is that has it, 'tis well enough;</hi> the very Union makes 'em happy, <hi>and useful to each other. CALO was much in the right to say,</hi> It was more Honourable to be a Good Husband than a Great Senator? <hi>For 'tis always better to be Good than Great; but was not so extreamly rig't in not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing A MONTHS TIME for single Liberty. The Man that can obtain the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a good Husband in such an Age as this, is worthy of double honour; for he must have a strange Art of Conduct, not only for the</hi> Governing his Wife, <hi>but of what ever Governs her; and 'tis twenty to one he gets the Reputation of an ill Husband for his pains, rather than a good one, let him deal never so gently, unless the vertue lie in some Measure on the Womans side, of chearfully submiting to his Government; therefore by</hi> Cato's good leave, there's no doing any thing well in haste, <hi>the World is not so mightily stock'd with Women of that Vertue, that a Man can't chuse but light on 'em in a Months time; they were more scarce than so in</hi> Solomon's <hi>time, much more in this Corrupt Age; yet so far I yield, as to allow it</hi> a great Argument of Love to your first Wife, your Impatience to be yoak'd again; <hi>but must beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if I deal plainly with you, and tell you such a suddain Engagment after her Death, look'd as if you had not the Exact Estimate of her</hi> Singulr Vertue; <hi>you did not impute the Sole cause of your Felicity to a thing so rarely found in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as</hi> Solomon <hi>affirms, but</hi> thought it went in common with the fair Sex. <hi>I also fear you imputed a little too much to your self, and thought</hi> your Love and Tenderness, most needs indear you to any Woman. <hi>Some such Mistake made you so fearless in such a Hazzardous Attempt. but tho I blam'd your</hi> hasty Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, <hi>when I was a stranger to your many reasons for it, yet am I far from thinking i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>But be it as it will, when</hi> SPEEDY MARRIAGE <hi>becomes a duty (for then God calls us to that state of Life) we have nothing to consider, but how to make</hi> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Necessity, <hi>and chuse, as near as we can, for</hi> Piety and Goodness, rather then trouble our selves with the fears of Poverty. <hi>A Man is not the less Generous for having little to give; but shews his Generosity as much in envying no Body, but being satisfied with his Portion in this Life:</hi> For the greater the Mind is, with the less it is content; <hi>and whatever the World may think, the Poor serve the Publick in Marrying, as much as the Rich. Should</hi> none Marry but the Wealthy, with what a Race of Pride and insolence would it fill the World? <hi>All Arts and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity Spring from Necessity; and Poverty may be truly said to be the source of all Vertue; and those that make so ill use of it as to commit</hi> such Outrages, <hi>as brings 'em often to untimely ends, would have made no better use of Riches, if they had had 'em; and 'tis only our corrupt Nature turns Soveraign Medicines into Poison.</hi>

                     <p>And I'm as great an Enemy to <hi>Backbiting; not one Report in 40 is true,</hi> and therefore in Cases of Slander, <hi>I believe no Man's Eves nor Ears but my own:</hi> If I find any Man Censorious, I have done with him, for 'tis my way, <hi>to judge of all Mens Religion by their Charity</hi>—I observe

                     <p>I Can easily believe you are the <hi>First that ever Writ an Essay upon their own Funeral,</hi> for our Dissolution is no inviting Subject; it has but a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Aspect,</hi> even when 'tis look'd upon as the only Remedy of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. But, <hi>How bitter are the Thoughts of Death to those that Live at Ease?</hi> Which if you Consider, you may well conclude, had <hi>Valeria</hi>'s Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness been such as you would have had it, you had ne'er enjoyed the Blessing you do now, of Contemplating the Miseries of this Life; till in <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking your Memory for all that could possibly any more afflict or torment you, you light upon Death as the last and most dreadful of all terrible Things;</hi> which being once fix'd in your Mind, sets you out of the reach of all Temptations. In this she makes it appear, she loves you <hi>as well at least, if not better, than her own Soul,</hi> that she affords you a Happiness she denies her self; and chuses to leave you to the full Enjoyment of it, without robbing you of the least Share. But if you are <hi>Serious in the Thoughts of Death,</hi> 'twill do you more good than all her <hi>Smiles,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may prize 'em.</p>
                     <p>The Gentleman that thought he was <hi>as good as Dead when his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was gone,</hi> might have some cause to think himself <hi>really Dead,</hi> tho he walk'd about, perceiving the <hi>Fear every ones Countenance discover'd at the sight of him,</hi> the Case of most Persons in his Circumstance; therefore never be surpriz'd at his having <hi>more Brains than he could be quiet with,</hi> for were your Case his in one respect, it might be so perhaps in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; every <hi>one is not able to hear the Contempt of the World.</hi> Tho' if well consider'd, when we answer the Designs of Providence, it should be all one to us, whether we <hi>stand for a Penny or a Crown;</hi> for in God's Account we are equally as useful and acceptable: And I am perswaded, there has been <hi>many great Saints, very little seen or known in the World, and whose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Share in it has been but Obscurity and Contempt;</hi> and truly speaking, what are we the better for so large a share of earthly Enjoyments, that shall both disorder our Minds and Bodies that we can't discern our true Interest, but <hi>place our Happiness in catching at departing shadows, while we forget we are all born subjects of Death, and begin to die from the first moment of our Life.</hi> And 'tis no matter how soon one is discharg'd of a Debt one must certainly pay. And were our Life never so long, to think in time
<hi>we should have enough of living, is a great mistake; for at Fourscore Years and we shall</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:59872:77"/>
                        <hi>think our lives short, and our past Enjoyments extremely imperfect; and any one that dies at Twenty can do no more:</hi> That in general, Death is saluted with the same shy Air, whenever he claims the debt they are not willing to pay; as well those he has long forborn, as those he deals with more severely. Yet methinks <hi>aged. Person's Experience,</hi> and some sort of good Nature and Compassion, might prevail with 'em willingly to make room for others; that by their Deaths young Persons, to whom they leave their Places, may have the opportunity of making the <hi>same Experiment they have done of the Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness of all humane Ioys, which is best known and believed by dear bought Experience,</hi> and never till then can they be freed from the <hi>Tyranny of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopes and wild Ambition,</hi> the Disease of Youth.</p>
                     <p>I confess I can't but wonder at the <hi>vain curiosity of the Philosophers,</hi> who set themselves so much to know exactly, in the last Minute of their Life, <hi>what Being Death has,</hi> which is none at all. The most that can be seen of <hi>Death</hi> is by its Operation on our Bodies in this Life; <hi>our total Dissolution is but the last stroke,</hi> not much differing from the rest, nor perhaps the most painful; we know enough of it to make us hate the thoughts of it, as of a <hi>Molancholy Subject;</hi> and if ever we are brought to love it, 'tis certain it must be by <hi>looking beyond it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For 'tis to the consideration of that happy change of Life, to which Death brings us, that we are obliged for all our <hi>Ease and Comfort</hi> in this Life, and from the hopes that in <hi>Death, the Soul shall be set at Liberty,</hi> and be triumphant over that Enemy which had so long insulted, and with the sight and feeling of his Tyranny kept it in bondage and slavish fear. There's nothing in this World that is not under his Dominion; <hi>his Character is stampt on every thing,</hi> which makes 'em change, corrupt, and die, that we are tir'd with such perpetual Alterations; tho'it shou'd sometimes supply the place of a comfort to one that has no better; for if <hi>a meer change</hi> will mend their Condition, they are sure of that Relief, since nothing remains in the same state, all tends to a Dissolution; the <hi>Heavens wax old as doth a Garment, and shall be changed;</hi> nay, Death it self must shortly yield to Destruction; and till then, the worst it can do is but to change us for the better.</p>
                     <p>'Tis much to be admir'd, there should be any Pretenders to the making a <hi>Divorce between Death and Sin,</hi> that the same Persons that abhor the Sight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Thoughts of Death, shou'd take Sin into their Embraces; for <hi>what's so sure to let in Death as Sin?</hi> For 'tis not only the Wages of Sin but it's natural Issue; and one may say, 'tis the only <hi>good thing Sin ever brought forth;</hi> for we have many Advantages by Death, since every degree of Death, in the Body, adds to the Life and Vigour of any Soul that is not already <hi>dead in Sin;</hi> and in the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Dissolution of the Body, the Soul is freed from any more sinning, and all the sufferings of this Life; a Condition much to be desir'd, by all but those that are so blind to take <hi>their Misery for their Happiness,</hi> and dore upon this present Life; and such there are, and ever was, of whom St. <hi>Austin</hi> in amazement speaks, when he says, <hi>At what cost and labour do Men endeavour to prolong their Labours, and by how many frights to fly Death, to the end they may be able to fear it for the longer time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, since <hi>Death</hi> was at first laid on Man as a penalty, it must be allow'd to be that which Nature in it self abhors; but God, <hi>whose very Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the effects of his Mercy and Goodness,</hi> has ordain'd it to be the means to procure our Happiness, both to wean our Affections from too much love of this Life, and also to bring us to the possession of a better; which if tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood, would more than overcome our natural aversion; <hi>it wou'd make us long to be dissolv'd, at least willing to die at our appointed time;</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:59872:77"/>
for those that believe, and hope for a glorious Resurrection, should they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret in Death <hi>the loss of their Bodies,</hi> 'twould look like the impertinent Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one that shou'd lament the loss <hi>of the Egg that was become a Chicken;</hi> for sure it is, for us to desire to be always what we are, is to oppose the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Natures, and speaks us <hi>degenerated to the lowest degree of Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Could we obtain a true Judgment of our selves, we should (like the Man you mention) <hi>think it more Eligible to end than begin our Life again;</hi> and 'tis a great sign we have never labour'd for Heaven and Happiness, when we are not weary enough to wish for Rest, but like Children that pass their Day in trifling Follies are never weary, but <hi>must be forced to Bed,</hi> or else deluded to it by a false hope; some such deceits are found for cheating Men as much as Children, and often sends 'em to rest before they think on't; tho' were they not <hi>as insensible as Death it self</hi> can make 'em, they cou'd scarce think of any thing else amongst the <hi>many Monitors</hi> the World affords us; but yet I wonder how you can think it an easie matter to humble the preposterous Pride of Man; 'tis not the sight of <hi>a Funeral</hi> can do it, nor yet your <hi>humbling Uerses;</hi> he carefully secures his Pride from all Assaults while he lives, and charges it to carry it to his Grave, so dearly he loves it as his best Companion, without which, all worldly Enjoyments would be insipid, and give him more pain than pleasure, for <hi>Pride is the chief Ingredient in all our Pleasures to make 'em desirable;</hi> and for that reason they do well to keep the thoughts of Death at an <hi>humble distance</hi> from their Pride, for Death's the greatest Enemy it can encounter, which first or last will get the Victory; for <hi>how many Persons are in Mourning half their Life time for the Death of Pride?</hi> Those who lament the loss of Youth, the loss of Beauty, or of Grandeur, 'tis all but <hi>Funeral sorrow for the loss of Pride,</hi> the dear Companion of Beauty, Youth and Grandeur, which is gone before 'em; but if that will satisfie 'em, <hi>they shall soon follow.</hi> This we must needs observe in the Death <hi>of our Friends</hi> and Relations, who once enjoy'd this Life as much as we do, yet cou'd not baffle Death, but were forc'd to yield to his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are so <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> we have no Rule to take our Measures by to prevent surprize; 'tis therefore best <hi>to be always ready to entertain Death's Harbingers, and make every thing our Monitor,</hi> and almost all we see and converse with, are naturally dispos'd to do us that courtesie, wou'd we give leave; for there is so much truth in what you call an <hi>Active Death,</hi> that more of Death than Life appears in the imperfection of all humane Actions.</p>
                     <p>For Example, <hi>Your ringing your Passing-Bell—, your laying your self out—, speaking your last Words—, describing your Looks—, and your Spouses Sentiments upon your Death and sight of you—are very like the Dream of those that are under the Image and Similitude of Death, and probably like Dreams may come to pass by contrarys:</hi> For the Circumstances of your Death may differ so much from what you make account of, that it may not permit you to <hi>Pray that Prayer you have prepared for obtaining the blessing to see and know again your Spouse in Heaven;</hi> but let not this fright you, for you may yet have this comfort, If it is none of the Joys that belongs to Heaven, you'll be happy without it; but if it is the <hi>common Blessing belongs to all beatified Spirits,</hi> you'll not want it. Nor can I see the least reason to count our Death, <hi>because 'tis strange, a dismal and mysterious Change;</hi> for what shou'd we fear, since there's no being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in God's Hands? Had he never discover'd to us the Joys of another Life, we have tasted so much of his Goodness in this, as may well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59872:78"/>
us there is <hi>nothing to expect but Happiness wherever he sends us,</hi> for Death, Sin and Misery, was no portion of his providing, 'twas of our own procuring by Rebelion; therefore 'tis no matter what we are, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go, <hi>if we can leave Sin behind us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How Beautiful were we made at first, to enjoy an earthly Paradice, till <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Sin changed all into misery and deformity?</hi> But now how glorious shall we be made at the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> to fit us for a heavenly Life, where we are out of all possibility of any change, for we are in no danger to forfeit that Life, since all the Conditions we hold it by are already fulfilled for us? You may well think <hi>what a bright and serene Morning the Resurrection will make,</hi> and long for it at a great rate, therefore to be provided for your happy Change is your chief care; when you are once about to die, you won't stay to be ask'd the least Question about <hi>your Funeral, or disposing your Estate,</hi> for you have not only made your <hi>Will,</hi> but order'd every Circumstance of your <hi>funeral.</hi> The Care and Fondness you shew for your <hi>Epitaph,</hi> and the rich Monument you bequeath your self, may very justly be imputed to your loving temper; for had <hi>Iris</hi> been still alive, you had never had such <hi>hot Thoughts and Concern for your cold Grave,</hi> where you are laid in your Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Pleasure not inferiour to Kings; and to assert your title to that Priviledge, can prove your self <hi>as frail and mortal as the greatest Monarch alive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But tho' you might think it necessary to make some <hi>Friendship and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Death</hi> before you fall into his Hands, I can't see so much use of the Contemplation of your Funeral; for to me 'tis a care I shall never charge my Thoughts with, but as <hi>I live and die Incognito,</hi> so I wou'd be buried; and so wou'd you, I'm perswaded, were it not to shew your Friends <hi>how much you valu'd a Wife that lov'd you;</hi> but having such a President as <hi>Iacob,</hi> you can't be thought <hi>vain or prodigal,</hi> if like him you erect a Monument in Memory of your <hi>fair Wife and happy Marriage;</hi> for 'tis an imperfect Felicity, according to the World, that is but little known or talk'd of.</p>
                     <p>I am secured from mistaking <hi>the Person of your Executor</hi> by the <hi>Character you give him,</hi> there are so few comes near that resemblance; from whom you may well promise your self <hi>a speedy performance of your Will.</hi> But how slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish must that Vertue be, that such an Encomium as you have made upon the Fidelity of a Friend in that occasion, cou'd not animate with Life and Spirits to put every <hi>thing in execution for the Love and Honour of his deceased Friend?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I can't disapprove your Sentiment, that 'tis the truest Charity to your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Heir, <hi>rather to leave him a necessary Instruction to Reflect upon and do him good, than your Estate,</hi> that will do him harm; and the Character you give the Person you leave it to, will extremely justifie your choice. Your <hi>other Legacies are very generous; and in particular to me,</hi> who have done nothing for you equal to so kind a Concern; but it <hi>seems to be your design to exceed all Persons Deserts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I wish that be all; for your leaving the <hi>Athenians and me Mourning,</hi> looks as if you were resolv'd to engross to your self <hi>the sole advantage of living and dying Incognito;</hi> and had sound out the way to discover us to the World; for now we are not known but <hi>guess'd at;</hi> for wherever Wit and Modesty appears in one Person, he is presently suspected for one of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and perhaps some Woman may be supposed to be the <hi>honourable Lady,</hi> if she is once discover'd to abound in her own Sense, which are marks so near the Truth, there needs no more than <hi>putting on Mourning for a Friend, when all the Town knows you are dead,</hi> to make a perfect discovery of those Persons who had liv'd till then unknown; but I'm more enclin'd to impute

'Tis but too Natural, and far from a Vertue, to hate your Enemies, which they both are, for the <hi>one keeps you from paying your Debts, the other makes you pass for a Hypocrite:</hi> However the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is not to deserve his Legacy for the Commendations he gives you, but you are satisfied if <hi>a Sermon is Preach'd for the Benefit of your surviving Friends,</hi> which is all it can pretend to, when 'tis the best perform'd; nor is any thing more design'd in the <hi>Highest Elogiums</hi> that are given to any Persons Vertues, 'tis but to <hi>recommend 'em to our Imitation with the more advantage;</hi> and as Humble and Modest as it looks in many Persons that decline the having <hi>funeral Sermons</hi> for fear there should be some mistaken Honour paid to their reputed Vertues, I see but little Reason for it: If in our Life-time <hi>We must let our Light shine, that Men may see our good Works,</hi> notwithstanding the Danger it may prove to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as it is the most proper occasion for Instruction, 'tis pity any Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration shou'd disappoint it.</p>
                     <p>I am of Opinion you might have spar'd <hi>your Ring and Inscription to Valeria,</hi> for should she follow your Counsel, it would deprive her of all the <hi>Satisfaction she should take in her Iointure,</hi> when it fell to her, for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent 'tis only the Hopes of it that makes her cheerfully undergo all the Misfortunes relating to herself, and her <hi>Dear Spouse,</hi> whose Absence she is forced to bear, having no means to redress this Ill but by a greater, for <hi>she likes her Iointure just as it is,</hi> and had rather endure any Misery, than ever consent to make it better or worse.</p>
