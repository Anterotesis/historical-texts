            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>So many are Her Virtues, and so vast,</l>
               <l>And croud upon my Memory so fast,</l>
               <l>'Tis difficult on what Part to begin;</l>
               <l>And 'twill be hard to leave, when once I'me in.</l>
               <l>Her Converse was from all that Dross refin'd</l>
               <l>That is so visible in Woman-kind;</l>
               <l>So sweet, so fraught with Heav'nly Innocence,</l>
               <l>I dare believe, She cou'd not give Offence.</l>
               <l>By Practice, She did Virtue's Path commend;</l>
               <l>And honour'd all that wou'd be Virtue's Friend:</l>
               <l>Perhaps the Vain and Vicious were Her Foes;</l>
               <l>But, who would care for pleasing such as those?</l>
               <l>Her Ardor still to Heav'nly Things, did show</l>
               <l>She learnt to be an Angel here below.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49936:4"/>Pious, devout, and to Her Self austere;</l>
               <l>Hardly a Day but was half-spent in Prayer.</l>
               <l>'Tis Heav'ns Command, that we should pray for those</l>
               <l>That are our bitter, most inveterate Foes;</l>
               <l>Hard Lesson! hard to us, so prone to Err;</l>
               <l>But 'twas a very easie one to Her.</l>
               <l>Her Charity did everywhere extend;</l>
               <l>For to be poor, was to make Her a Friend.</l>
               <l>All this She was:—nor did She less excell</l>
               <l>In the great <hi>Poet-art</hi> of writing well</l>
               <l>Her charming Strains did please the nicest Ear,</l>
               <l>And even the haughtiest Swams were proud to hear.</l>
               <l>Ah sweet <hi>Urania!</hi> of all Woman-kind,</l>
               <l>Where hast thou left one like thy Self behind,</l>
               <l>Unless the chaste <hi>Mirrana?</hi> who, but She?</l>
               <l>Thy virtuous Sister; For in Her we see,</l>

               <l>By Heav'ns, <hi>Alexis,</hi> Thou so well hast shown</l>
               <l>The Virtues of the Nymph, for whom you mone;</l>
               <l>In such sad Numbers told the fatal Cause</l>
               <l>That from your Eyes this bleeding Deluge draws;</l>
               <l>I've caught in too, plung'd in the same Extreme,</l>

               <l>Such pious Grief Heav'n cannot but forgive,</l>

               <l>But see, if now thou dost some Tears let fall,</l>
               <l>There goes a Sight that will engross 'em all!</l>
               <l>The sweet <hi>Urania</hi> (Oh untimely doom!)</l>
               <l>By Virgins born to Her eternal home!</l>
               <l>See, with what mournful Pomp the Scene appears,</l>
               <l>The Swains all speechless, and the Nymphs all Tears!</l>
               <l>Instead of flow'ry Wreaths, with Chaplets crown'd,</l>
               <l>Their Temples are with Funeral Cypress bound:</l>
               <l>Although they speak not, yet their Looks impart</l>
               <l>A lasting Anguish, and a bleeding Heart!</l>

               <l>You sigh, but Ah! you know, you sigh in vain;</l>
               <l>You'll never more behold Her tread the Plain:</l>
               <l>No more you'll hear that sweet harmonious Voice,</l>
               <l>Which none yet ever heard, but did rejoyce:</l>
               <l>For ever ceas'd are all Her matchless Lays;</l>
               <l>Heav'n has clos'd up the Volume of Her days!</l>
               <l>Oh Grief! that I can think on the chaste Dame,</l>
               <l>Think that She's dead, and not become the same!</l>

               <l>We fail'd in our last Office to the dead;</l>
               <l>Let's follow then the Mourner's gone before;</l>
               <l>It cannot add to our Affliction more</l>
