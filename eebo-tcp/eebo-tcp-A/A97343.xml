            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et me crave your Honorable patience, while your eye runs over this <hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Preface:</hi> both as ſhort, as poſſibly I could make it. For the Book it ſelf, it cannot crave, haply it may command your eye and eare both, for this Reaſon. It is a <hi>CHRONICLE</hi> fully and wholy taken out of the Book of <hi>God.</hi> It treats of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> too, of common-people alſo; their ſeverall ways here on Earth, with ſeverall notes upon theſe wayes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>Gods</hi> mouth too.</p>
            <p>I will take leave to tell you, how I fell upon this work. I heard a great cry, and I was one, who helped to make it greater; we complained of the Times and of you, not a word of our ſelves, and thus we ſpake unadviſedly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough after our manner; <q>our expectation is cleane fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: we looked for good, behold evill: for peace, behold a Sword: Summer is come and gone, we are not delivered. Delivered! never in worſe caſe then now. That we thought would do us good, hath done us hurt.</q> Then, as that ſtubborne people, never well full nor faſting, called out <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> (he was in all the blame ſtill) ſo we called out upon you, and wiſhed <hi>ten</hi> times, as they did, that we were, as we were, in <hi>Egipt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Thus we, poore ſimple ones, have done and doe, ſtanding all the while in the <hi>bottom</hi> and upon the <hi>levell</hi> of our own Imaginations.</p>
            <p>By the good hand of <hi>God</hi> upon me, I did according to the charge, SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES; they teſtifie of
<pb facs="tcp:55161:3"/>
the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yes, and of all that ever was, is, or ſhall be done in the world, for, or againſt His Kingdom there, wherein theſe times are eminently, very infamous and very glorious both.</p>
            <p>I thank <hi>God,</hi> that I did ſearch the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> for now I can give a full and cleare account of all the affairs now a days. 1. That they are what they have bin, nothing NEW, that is <hi>now</hi> under the Sun. What is now irregular and our of Rule is not <hi>new,</hi> but as it hath bin done by theſe, whoſe <hi>will</hi> was their <hi>Bias,</hi> ſo they run apace furiouſly, I had almoſt ſaid, but very directly to their own and their peoples ruin: And they that walked regularly after the line of Heaven, obtained the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>port</hi> of all their labours, were a bleſſing to themſelves, and to the place where they lived. 2. I can reprove my own folly now, and theirs, who are but a little wiſer, That we have not a faith to <hi>live</hi> upon, for we make haſte; we ask and we have not, becauſe we asked amiſſe; we expected, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is vain, becauſe we were too haſty, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the book: we would have <hi>God</hi> goe our way, and do things juſt <hi>when</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> we would have Him: as if wiſdom were with us, and we could tell the fitteſt time.</p>
            <p>Our complaints are as wild as our thoughts; we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as if ſome ſtrange and new things were done now, when indeed there is nothing <hi>now</hi> that is <hi>new;</hi> Man was <hi>mad</hi> upon <hi>his Idols</hi> in ancient times; he is but <hi>mad</hi> now. And when his <hi>Idols</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 50 38.</note> were ſtruck-at, he would ſtrike too, and be in a rage; he do's no more now. <hi>The Nations were angry,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> had taken to Himſelf <hi>power</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Reve. 11. 18.</note>, then they made Tumults; they do but the ſame now: And in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their <hi>rage</hi> now, ſhal their judgment be anon, it ſhall reach unto <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>be lifted up even to the skies.</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 51. 9.</note> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 9.</note> They brake His bonds before and caſt away His <hi>Cords,</hi> They are not more like to Devils now. The <hi>Lord laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55161:3"/>
at thoſe furious fools then; He laughs now: He ſaw their <hi>day was coming</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 37.</note>; we thank Him for His <hi>Eye ſalve,</hi> we ſee as much now. The <hi>LORD Chriſt</hi> has few friends, that will own His cauſe, that will ſtand by Him, and that troubles a few in the world: That is no <hi>new</hi> thing neither: Time was when all forſook Him, Diſciples and all: And then His Adverſaries wrought their will on Him, but then He wrought moſt gloriouſly, for from the <hi>Croſse</hi> and the <hi>grave</hi> (the Adverſaries thought Him ſure enough, they had their will on Him, when they had Him there, but from thence) He hath brought <hi>life and immortality to light, through the Goſpell.</hi> He is the ſame, and by the ſame <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> croſſe-ways and <hi>wills,</hi> can worke as gloriouſly ſtill; and there is nothing <hi>now</hi> that is <hi>new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But that, which pleaſeth me moſt of all, is, I have found a <hi>price,</hi> and I find it put into your hands, I meane, A way opened unto you, whereby to deliver a Nation, brought even to the mouth of deſtruction; which you ſhall do, not by commanding the <hi>Sword</hi> to be <hi>ſtill,</hi> (for it is the <hi>Lords Sword,</hi> and out of your command; you are no more able to ſtop it in it's way, then you can the Sun in it's courſe) but by ſtriking at the root, Idolatrous perſons and things; by removing them from before the <hi>eyes of His jealouſie:</hi> and by caſting them out: If not, the <hi>Lord</hi> has ſworne, and He will not repent, that He will do with you, and with your Land (for it is yours now, and not the <hi>Lords,</hi> ſo long as Idols are countenanced there, and they are countenanced, ſo long as they are not throwne out, whether perſons or things) as you ſhould have done to the Idols there; &amp; as He hath done to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thoſe Idols; They did not caſt them forth from before His <hi>Eyes;</hi> therfore they are caſt out of their own Land, and from being a Nation. Now the choiſe is eaſie; you muſt caſt-out theſe <hi>abominations,</hi> els you and your
<pb facs="tcp:55161:4"/>
               <hi>Land</hi> muſt be caſt-out; it is at your choiſe, chuſe you whether.</p>
            <p>You are about it, you will ſay, you have made an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> againſt Idolatry, and we muſt be humbled for it, every man of us. Bleſſed be <hi>God</hi> for that, and His bleſſings be upon your ſouls. But do ye conſider what an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you have laid upon your ſouls; or do we ſilly ones conſider what it is, to be humbled for this high <hi>provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> To loath our ſelvs, becauſe of our <hi>whoriſh hearts,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable <hi>Idolatries,</hi> wherwith we have broken <hi>the Lords heart</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 6. 9.</note>, as His Highnes is pleaſed to expreſſe His loathing of that ſin; This is to be <hi>humbled;</hi> and then preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a <hi>caſting-out,</hi> as we do that we <hi>loath,</hi> and our <hi>ſtomack</hi> riſeth againſt <note n="d" place="margin">Eſa. 30. 22.</note>. But herein you muſt lead us the way, els, like <hi>Behemoths legs,</hi> we ſhall <hi>break</hi> before we <hi>bow;</hi> we muſt ſee you humbled before us, as all the <hi>worthies</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before the <hi>Lord</hi> for this thing; but we ſhall never believe our eyes neither, till we ſee you, as you may ſee them, <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting-out Idols,</hi> and their <hi>ſervices,</hi> till they were all <hi>caſt-out,</hi> I mean al theſe <hi>abominations;</hi> and ſo I met with a 4<hi rend="sup">h</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The exacteſt <hi>patterne</hi> of <hi>poſturing a Kingdom</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was looked upon; the very work you are upon now. Shall it proſper? The <hi>Lord</hi> knows, I cannot tell, and yet I have enquired of the <hi>Oracle.</hi> I can tell, it is your work, and woe unto you if you do it not; but how you <hi>hand-</hi>it I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, nor by what <hi>line</hi> and <hi>levell</hi> you go; nor do I take upon me to judge therof; but till you make anſwer to <hi>God</hi> in that point, you will never be anſwered. Truely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell vvhat to ſay to men or their vvork. The <hi>Oracle</hi> (that is the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God)</hi> tels me, they are fickle, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>prepoſterous</hi> too, they begin where they ſhould <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> where they ſhould begin, the manner of <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This only I can tell, for ſo the <hi>Oracle</hi> tels me, that when the <hi>Worthies</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> there, <hi>Priest</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:55161:4"/>
               <hi>People</hi> too (in the Nonage of their King) fell upon this great worke, the <hi>Poſturing their Kingdom,</hi> they began vvith an <hi>Ordinance againſt Idolatry;</hi> That is the <hi>Land</hi> vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſin: nor did they mock <hi>God,</hi> for vvhoſoever lifted up his hand to a <hi>ſtrange god,</hi> him they cut-off <note n="d" place="margin">2 Chr. 15. 13.</note>.

            <p>Now (as was ſaid) I take not upon me to judge by what <hi>line</hi> and <hi>levell,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> is carried-on, if, as <hi>Iudahs</hi> vvork was, we can the more heartily wiſh your proſperity in the name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> for our lives, to ſay no more, the <hi>life</hi> of our <hi>lives</hi> is wrapt-up with it: if otherwiſe, and you work not as you have them for an enſample, yet the <hi>worke</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall go-on, that ſhall proſper; He is vvorking now, to make His <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>quiet habitation:</hi> and He vvill bring His <hi>work</hi> about through the <hi>ſtraits</hi> and by <hi>the croſſe ways</hi> and <hi>wils</hi> of men, though you ſhould deſert the <hi>work</hi> and vvith-draw your hands from ſhould ring up the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> to His Throne (He cals for your hand to honour you, and wo to you if you with-draw, but I ſay, He needs you not) He can ſet Himſelf in His throne without you, &amp; His vvork ſhall go-on in deſpight of Devils or men.

            <p>There is indeed a great ſeducement by wicked examples, for, through the depravation of our natures, we rather imitate the worſe then the better; and too ordinary it is in <hi>ill</hi> to exceed; in <hi>good</hi> to come ſhort of the example; But this is for want of well weighing the example, becauſe we doe not looke through it to the end: we ſee what is done, but we doe not ſee what will be the iſſue of the act.

            <p>Before we reade their doings, I would ſay this for the length of the <hi>Chronicle,</hi> That when my thoughts were first upon it, I did not intend it ſo, but more contracted and abrid ed into a narrow roome. But then I conſidered what a <hi>worke</hi> I had in hand, and what my <hi>ſcope</hi> therin: My <hi>worke</hi> was well to ponder the wayes and workes of bad and good Kings, wherin nothing can be found ſmall or of light account: Then again,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> is, as we heard, the Inſtruction of the living Kings and their People all: I thought it then my duty to ponder matters yet more, and to looke over their Hiſtory again and againe: And the more I read, the more I found, even mighty things, and wheron the <hi>LORD Himſelfe</hi> had ſet a marke with His owne Hand, like an hand in the road-way, pointing the paſſenger; <q>This way thou muſt goe for this is the ſtrait way, and tends to life: And here thou muſt forbeare, for it is a deſtructive way and tends to death.</q> Truly I find ſo many marks in my travell here, that I could not tell where to picke and chuſe, finding all ſo remarkable of ſo great and excellent uſe, to marke out the way of <hi>LIFE</hi> and <hi>DEATH</hi> unto us all, whether high or low, great or ſmall.</p>
            <p>I would adde this alſo. That the Chapters in this <hi>Chronicle</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, as the Story of the Kings there is continued; where thorow two whole bookes and more, as is the Story of the two firſt Kings, there are the Chapters lengthened: Where thorow three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the Story of <hi>Aſa;</hi> or foure as the Story of King <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (for theſe wrought effectually to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, strengthen and establiſh themſelves and their Kingdomes, which is a worke evermore of difficulty, labour and time) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly are their Chapters enlarged.</p>
            <p>The Story of the bad Kings is begun in one Chapter, and there ended (except the Story of <hi>Saul,</hi> which fils a Booke, and of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> which is continued through three Chapters:) for a King in an Idolatrous way, doth not goe, but runne, and is quickly at the end, poſting-on himſelfe and his people to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb facs="tcp:55161:8"/>
and deſtruction: Therfore, though the Story be ſhort, yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations therupon, may be long and of infinite uſe.</p>
            <p>It is our wiſdome to ſet our hearts thereunto: And ſith <hi>DEATH</hi> and <hi>EVILL, LIFE</hi> and <hi>GOOD</hi> are before us, well to conſider, looking well before us, that we chuſe the <hi>good way, the way of good men, walke therein and keepe the pathes of the Righteous: That wee love the LORD our GOD; obey His voyce, and cleave unto Him.</hi> For it <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 20.</note> followes; <hi>Hee is thy LIFE, and length of thy Dayes:</hi>

                  <hi>Samuell</hi> ſpeakes, and <hi>Saul</hi> hearkens, and all this while it was well: So long as <hi>Samuell</hi> ruled-out the way of government to <hi>Saul,</hi> and he followed the Rule, it was well with <hi>Saul</hi> and with all the people: The Lord made their <hi>Militia</hi> ſtrong and ſucceſſefull to a wonder: When he tranſgreſſed that Rule, his ſpirits fell, and he from his princely dignity, thruſting himſelfe beſides the throne with his own hands.

               <p>We reade on, and find, that after this victory <hi>Saul</hi> enquires after <hi>David;</hi> takes ſo full notice of him now, that, indeed, he <hi>Eyed</hi> him continually, from that day forward; and he bends

God was with <hi>Saul,</hi> proſpered him exceedingly, gave him glorious victories, <hi>Saul</hi> was not aware of all this; <hi>God</hi> anſwered him againe and againe, told him what His expreſſe will was; <hi>Saul</hi> rejected it; now <hi>God</hi> departs from him, and <hi>anſwers him no more:</hi> A man will drive hard for comfort at ſuch a time, but he will miſtake his way as <hi>Saul</hi> did his, goes for the <hi>living</hi> to the <hi>dead,</hi> nay worſe, from <note place="margin">Eſa. 8. 16.</note> God to the Devill, he ſeekes anſwer there at the Devils Oracle; And behold worſe and worſe, <hi>Saul</hi> cannot endure to heare it, but falls ſtraight-way <hi>all along on the Earth</hi>

He was an Enemy to good men while he lived, and now he died, he is an Enemy to himſelfe.

What though no true <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> be imployed in the repairing of <hi>Pauls:</hi> and they that do their own <hi>ſervice</hi> there, have a full and fat requitall: Do's it therefore follow, That no yokes lye upon the necks of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> I doe not ſay, what yokes there are, but I ſay the Labourers there may have their wages for their worke; and they that do a kind of ſervice there, may have a full allowance for that, and yet for all that there may be a greevous ſervitude upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He has not ſpoken to purpoſe; but he has ſpoken,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Not a little to the ſcorne of all</hi> Iſrael. He ſayes the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is ever prone to picke quarrels with their Governours. True, they are ſo; and I adde, <q>never was there any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo eaſie, but ſome have found fault with it, and counted it a yoke.</q> But yet, he muſt not lay this reproach upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> and upon <hi>ALL Iſrael;</hi> but ſo he does: Some may complain, nay many even of, their bleſſings, and account them burdens;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55161:24"/>
but ſurely <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>ALL Iſrael</hi> will not ſo doe; if all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and with one conſent (ſo they did here) charity binds me not to judge raſhly here, for there might be grievances, and but an equall requeſt to their King, that he would lay them untoheart.</p>
               <p>Now let me adde this too, and then I will go-on to proove, <q>That it is ordinary with us, living in proſperity, lightly to paſſe over <hi>Iſraels YOAKES,</hi> and account them feathers; for we have no quick-fleſh, but where we are pinched, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only wherein we our ſelves doe feele.

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Heb 10. 33. 13. 2.</note> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their miſery is a rare grace, and, as faith, ſcarce found in the world.</q> But this is the concluſion; He that is proſperous, and lives at eaſe, cannot judge of <hi>Iſraels</hi> yokes.</p>
               <p>With <hi>GODS</hi> helpe, I will now prove what I did but ſay before, keeping by His good Hand upon me, cloſe to His <hi>Word,</hi> that I may not tranſgreſſe in ſo grave a point, about <hi>yoakes;</hi> and in ſo generall a complaint about them, put-up by <hi>ALL Iſrael,</hi> and ſome amongſt thoſe All, the beſt <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the world, as will appeare anon.</p>
               <p>And what if I ſhould ſay firſt, That the magnificence of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> buildings; The ſtate and glory of his Court; The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance there might be burdenſome to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might prejudice the private wealth, the attendance of private and home affairs: And if ſo, that was a <hi>yoke</hi> to the people: I am ſure ſuch a <hi>yoake</hi> which preſſeth them moſt. It has been ſaid of old, <q>The more ſtate and pride at Court, (which commonly we call <hi>Glory)</hi> The better trading in the City, but the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in the Country.</q> But I paſſe over this, which yet might be a <hi>Greevance,</hi> as not conſiderable in this weighty buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>I have one Reaſon ſo pregnant of proofe, <hi>That</hi> Iſrael <hi>had yoakes upon them in the dayes of</hi> Solomon, That, though all the Biſhops, that were in <hi>England,</hi> the two Arch-Biſhops alſo (I know but <hi>one,</hi> and he has another <hi>Name,</hi> and of another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) doe ſay the contrary, as they have beene bold that way, I dare ſay, no man, that will reade this, will beleeve

them: for with <hi>Gods</hi> help I ſhall prove the contrary to them, from <hi>Gods</hi> own mouth, and then, I hope, <hi>Iſraels petition</hi> then, ſhall be cleared to be reaſonable and juſt now; and every ſuch like <hi>petition</hi> ſhall be gratiouſly anſwered by the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in His good time: I muſt premiſe firſt before I proove, and conclude: And it is no more, but what is legible to all the world; It is this; That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> had married the <hi>Daughter of a ſtrange god</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 2. 11.</note>; She brought her god with her to his Court, for it was a moveable thing, it might be carried in a Cart, or in a Ship, or upon mens ſhoulders, whether the Queen pleaſed; And as legible it is to all the world that there this god was, and well eſteemed of by <hi>Solomon,</hi> for he worſhipped it, and then it ſtole away his heart, and <hi>turned it from the living God.</hi> Nay he had many ſtrange Wives, and as many ſtrange gods, which they had brought along with them, being, as the other was, moveable and portable things.</p>
               <p>If it was ſo, and ſo it was, for he that runnes may reade it, Then we conclude, <hi>That when</hi> Solomon <hi>ſerved ſtrange gods,</hi> Iſrael <hi>was yoaked;</hi> Then they did doe or ſee ſuch ſervices, as were burdenſome unto them, neither <hi>eaſie</hi> nor <hi>ingenious</hi> nor <hi>becomming</hi> Iſraell: Let another thinke, and ſay as he thinks, That the only <hi>drudgery</hi> is to carry burdens for Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building; which, he ſayes, <hi>Iſraell</hi> was freed from: I muſt think that it is an honour to an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to doe any worke there, though it be but for the remooving, or carrying-out rubbiſh thence: as it was to be a doore-keeper there: But this ſerving of Idolls, humbling before them, the creature before the worke of his hands, (an abominable Idolatry) this is <hi>drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery indeed,</hi> a ſervile worke for <hi>Iſraell</hi> (by your leave) not <hi>free,</hi> (though <hi>eaſie)</hi> nor <hi>ingenious.</hi> And ſurely ſuch ſervices were done by <hi>Iſraell</hi> now, now that the <hi>Queens</hi> had turned away the heart of their <hi>King</hi> from the <hi>true GOD,</hi> and were all, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> and all abominable Idolaters, Then <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was <hi>yoaked</hi> ſure, not <hi>affianced,</hi> but <hi>married</hi> to ſtrange gods, Now that their King was joyned to them, and humbled before them: unleſſe we are ſo charitable as to thinke, that the King and his Queens went alone in an Idolatrous way, and none or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55161:25"/>
few of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with them: but that is not imaginable; for Kings and Queen's both are leading hands, or as the Ship Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, <note place="margin">Two perſons ſo eminent are enough to yoake all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and to bring them under a grievous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</note> that carries the Lanthorne, <hi>all steere their courſe after.</hi> Such perſons alwayes carry their traine with them: looke which way they goe, though never ſo wrong a path, we ſhall ſee (anon) companies blundring on in the ſame way, <hi>AND ALL</hi> ISRAEL <hi>WITH HIM</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chro. 12. 1.</note>. Certainely then, even in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes, there were ſervices, if not enjoyned <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet done by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and before the Sun, which were to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (if true <hi>Iſrael)</hi> grievous and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; as goad's to their ſides, yoakes to their necks, and pricks to their eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Yes, this might be; But theſe <hi>yoakes</hi> are too ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall for the people, they can neither ſee them, nor feele them: It is not their <hi>manner</hi> to complaine of theſe: Grant them their outward liberties; <hi>take off</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the yoake on their jawes;</hi> make them free-Men; free from bodily ſervitude; then <hi>lay meate before them,</hi> they will fall too, like beaſts, minding their <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> let their King and his Quenes worſhip <hi>ſtocks,</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> and <hi>Devills too</hi> (the ſacred Scripture ſaith, <hi>ſo they did,</hi> and yet) what care the people, they are in ſervitude to none, and Meate is before them, what care they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true enough, ſo careleſſe and brutiſh commonly we are; but <hi>Iſrael</hi> not ſo; or if ſome, in name ſo, yet not <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But we miſtake the purpoſe of this objection, which is this, <hi>That</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a free people under</hi> Solomon; <hi>he put no heavy yoake upon them, no grievous ſervitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The truth is, for I would carry-on the Readers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cleare in this point, The ſacred Scripture is not expreſſe here, It ſayes not in theſe words, <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>laid a grievous yoake upon his people:</hi> That which is written is not ſo expreſſe, and yet the <hi>ſacred Scripture,</hi> I thinke, is cleare in this matter, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
               <p>In the meane time I would aske the man that is beſt read in the Chronicles, whether ever he read ſuch a thing as this; That the Daughters of <hi>ſtrange gods</hi> came into a Land, brought their gods with them; (for that is the manner) their Lord
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55161:26"/>
joyned his heart to them, and turned away from the <hi>Living God.</hi> (So did <hi>Solomon:)</hi> And yet notwithſtanding all this, the Reader, conſulting with the Records of Time, finds not any <hi>Yoake</hi> upon the people at ſuch a time; no ſervices done by them, but what were <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>ingenious.</hi> I will not truſt to my reading, though this I can ſay, I have read the Chronicles, and this is the reſult from my reading; That, when abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Idolatries were countenanced, were practiſed in a Land, I meane <hi>Iſraels</hi> Land (though I need not reſtraine it ſo, for I have read ſomewhat in the Chronicles of other Nations alſo, but <hi>Iſraels</hi> Land, where Idolatry is eſtabliſhed by a Law, and ſo it might be ſaid to be in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes, for what <hi>Queens</hi> and their <hi>King</hi> do's is a Law to the people; But I will ſay no more but this,) when Idolatry is practiſed, is countenanced in a Land, <hi>Queenes</hi> ſerve abominable Idolls and their <hi>King</hi> too: It followes in the Chronicle, not <hi>Iſraels</hi> only, but <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> 
                  <q>That, at that time, there were grievous Yoakes upon the peoples necks, illegall preſſures, unjuſt commands, that have neither ground of Law, nor reaſon, then neither <hi>eaſie</hi> nor <hi>ingenious.</hi>
                  </q> Nay, let me add this here, from out of the <hi>Sacred Chronicle</hi> (that is the Oracle) he that reads ſhall find it true, That when a Daughter of <hi>a ſtrange god,</hi> came into <hi>Iſraels</hi> Land, ſhe wrought effectually there, to the deſtruction of her King, their ſeed, and the people there. <hi>GOD</hi> is a <hi>Righteous GOD, Holy</hi> and <hi>Juſt.</hi> Thinke we that His Law may be contumeliouſly uſed, trod under foot, and ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and the peoples Law, their juſt Liberties, their heritage, their birth-right; That this ſhall be maintained in honour, ſhall ſtand-up in full ſtrength, force and virtue? Surely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Can <hi>Iſrael</hi> thinke he may provoke <hi>God</hi> to His face, with Images, and ſtrange vanities, and yet feele no yoake upon his neck; nothing that ſhall be to him as Thornes in his ſide, or pricks in his eye! Conſult we with the records of Time, and we ſhall be cleare in this matter, I meane in point of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

both touching ſpirituall cauſes and temporall matters: And theſe would not yeeld, (as we ſhall ſee anon) to thoſe illegall proceedings of <hi>Jehoram:</hi> But he was King, and might doe, he thought, as his Wife counſelled him, (ſhe was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Omri</hi> and Siſter of <hi>Ahab,</hi> (for that muſt ſtill be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, ſhe would counſell him to do) as he liſted; he made <hi>innovations</hi> in Religion, uſed <hi>compulſion</hi> there, and was, if not the very firſt, the firſt that is regiſtred, to have ſet-up irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Idolatrous ſervices <hi>BY FORCE,</hi> and <hi>compelled</hi> Judah <hi>thereto</hi>

Speake to him they dare not, they durſt as well ſhake a Lyon by his clawes: his Queene, a woman of a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine ſpirit, and very wicked, had ſo raiſed the ſpirit of her King againſt GOD and <hi>good Men,</hi> that he was now ſuch a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> that a man could not ſpeake to him <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 17.</note>; A cruell perſecutor he, for he murthered his owne Bretheren, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Princes, as we heard, who then durſt ſtand before him, or ſpeake the truth unto him, or truſt him after theſe bloody executions?

We muſt note here, as we ſhall find it all along, That the Prophets tell the King plainly of his doings; if he be ſuch a ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> as this King was, and will not heare, then they ſent a <hi>writing</hi> to him; If the King be ſo fierce, that a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet dares not ſtand before him and ſpeake unto him; then he will ſend unto him; <hi>And there came a writing to him from the Prophet.</hi> And ſo, having done their duty, the Prophets let the King and the Queen alone joyned to Idols, and traverſing their own way, (they had entred upon and made paſſible by blood, and ſuch ſeldome returne) The Prophets would not weary themſelves about them: In their <hi>Mouth</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 2. 24.</note> they were ſound, for then their pangs came upon them. We will now take our eys off from beholding <hi>Jehorams</hi> way, and behold the <hi>Lord</hi> in the way of his judgments upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

But what exploits did he with his <hi>Princes, and all his Charets with him?</hi> He came upon the <hi>Edomites</hi> by night, and it is like (for he was in a rage) he ſlew many of them: and ſo he gained ſome dead bodies, and thoſe he might keep under his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion if pleaſed him: But ſo long as there was live-blood at their hearts, he ſhould never regain them again; <hi>So the</hi> Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites <hi>revolted from under the hand of</hi> Judah <hi>unto this Day</hi>

This ſounds harſh in <hi>Jehorams</hi> eare; and it is as grievous to his eye.</p>
               <p>It is very likely ſo, but no matter for that; we knew before, ſo ſoone as we read, that he had taken <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Ahab <hi>to Wife,</hi> what would follow, that he muſt be vexed every vaine of his heart. And yet, nothing, not a word or deed doe we find in the Text, ſaid or done againſt them.</p>
               <p>True; but this is cleare in the Text, the <hi>ſame time did</hi> Libnah <hi>revolt from under his hand.</hi> Whoſe hand? from under <hi>Jehorams</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> hand. Then it may be collected from the Text, that <hi>Jehoram</hi> counted them Rebells, and called them ſo too.</p>
               <p>Yes, very likely ſo, though it be not expreſſed ſo; for it is the manner ſo, for a <hi>Rebell</hi> to call others <hi>by his own Name,</hi> Rebels and <note place="margin">Exulem me de ſuo nomine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</note> Traitors all.</p>

We cannot doubt now, but <hi>Iehoram</hi> was a great Rebell, the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was in high place, a great King, and his wife a great Queen, daughter and ſiſter of two great Kings, the greater his Rebellion for that.</p>
               <p>But theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> revolt from their King, are they not Rebels now?</p>
               <p>Judge ye!

It is not poſſible, That they, walking croſſe in the ſame way, ſhould meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in point of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> But the Text is yet clearer. The <hi>Prieſts forſake Iehoram</hi> (nor the King) And why forſake they <hi>Iehoram? Becauſe he had forſaken the LORD GOD of his Fathers.</hi>

               <p>Thus we ſee it cleare now as the beaten way, that here was no reſiſtance of the Kings <hi>Power,</hi> for that is of <hi>GOD,</hi> and for <hi>GOD, holy, iuſt</hi> and <hi>good:</hi> Here was a reſiſtance only of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horams</hi> power, unholy, unjuſt and naught, mannaged cleane againſt GOD, and <hi>forcing</hi> his people to rebell againſt Him too; A reſiſtance, I ſay, not againſt the <hi>officiall power</hi> of the King, but the humane power of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> a wicked and Idolatrous man, and as <hi>

               <p>Thanks be to <hi>GOD,</hi> Who has ſo cleared unto us the pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of theſe Prieſts and Levites in <hi>Jehorams</hi> dayes, that he muſt ſay, as a bold fellow did, <hi>(The ſacred Text is ſeditious)</hi> who will accuſe thoſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and honeſt men of raiſing ſedition, becauſe they forſooke the way of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> when he had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the LORD, and His good way.

Where was he ſlaine? <hi>In the Court of the Houſe of the LORD.</hi> Oh! he ſhould have ſpared him there, for it was neare the place, which was <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his ſanctuary; but when a man is reſolved to doe wickedly, he will make no choice of places; or, if he does, that place pleaſeth beſt, which is moſt before the LORD, and in the face of the whole Congregation of Prophets, conſulting about a way, and reſolving upon it, how they may eſtabliſh his Crowne, and make his Kingdome ſure for ever.

               <p>I ſhall be the longer upon this bloody execution, purpoſely, and, with the more enlargement, That it may ſparckle and flaſh in the face of him, or them (for there are ſuch <hi>ſnakes</hi> in the world) that would burne downe that houſe, which hath preſerved him: would conſume them and their houſes, who would have kept his, not from fire only, but from ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſmoake: would ſhed the blood of thoſe to his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who lay-out themſelves, all they have, and all they are, for the building-up and eſtabliſhing of him and his houſe for ever.</p>
               <p>We proceed, So <hi>Ioaſh</hi> did, ſo bloody was his command. How ſo? the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> gives us the reaſon of that unnaturall and moſt unkingly act; <hi>Ioaſh the King remembred not the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which</hi> Jehojada <hi>his Father had done unto him, but ſlew his Son</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his <hi>Militia</hi> had no <hi>power.</hi> The Army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> come up, a ſmall company of men, and the <hi>LORD</hi> delivered a very <hi>great Hoſt into their hand.</hi> Was not that <note place="margin">ver. 24.</note> ſtrange?

               <p>
                  <hi>Amaziah</hi> do's otherwiſe, cleares his way to his Throne, not only in point of juſtice, but of wiſdome and found diſcretion; and that muſt be noted; The people might have ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies touching the old Kings death; he was a diſeaſed man, a very burden to himſelfe: he lay languiſhing, his bones full of the ſinnes of his youth: might not the ſervants know their young Maſters mind, who was ready for the Crowne, and they looked now upon the Sun-riſing, for it was night with the Father? <hi>Amaziah</hi> now, according to the counſell of the <hi>Heathen</hi> (but it is good counſell) will quit himſelfe from the ſuſpition of wickedneſſe; all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould know, That, what ever <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King was, yet he was his Father; and he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him as a Father. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſee how his heart roſe up againſt thoſe bloudy villains, that ſlew his Father, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him lift up his hand againſt them to cut them off from the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55161:46"/>
Earth. He was now ſtepping to his Throne, and ſitting down there: He had had an uneaſie ſeat of it, had any drop of his Fathers blood bin there for his Cuſhion: And there doubtles it had bin, even the blood of his Father, if he had not waſhed it clean out, by cutting off ſuch notable murtherers: and ſo he cleared his owne Innocency, his diſcretion, and his Throne altogether.</p>
               <p>And now this is not inconſiderable which follows; he waited for a Crown twenty five years; and in all that time it appears not, That he was ſick of the Father; And he wore his Crown four years longer then he waited for it. It is true, The beauty of his Crown withered 15. years before he died, as we ſhall reade anon, he might thanke himſelf for that.</p>
               <p>But this is it, which I would put to the conſideration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, whether he has not obſerved ſome remarkable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing accompanying an obedient child, that had this good in him, if no more, <hi>he did honour his Parents.</hi> Certainly the experience of all ages will evidence this truth, <q>That a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full child never went away without a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> nor a child ſtubborn, and undutifull without a <hi>Curſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Amaziah</hi> has cleared his Innocency and his honour at this point, and how much he honoured his Father. Nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to make all this cleare any other way to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but by ſlaying thoſe wicked Servants, who ſlew their Maſter. It follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amaziah</hi> orders his MILITIA, gathered JUDAH <hi>together</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Amaziah,</hi> hearkning to the Prophet, and diſmiſſing thoſe Souldiers, is the better ſtrengthened for the warr; he led forth his people, ſmites his enemies, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them at a blow: and prevailes over as many more, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them away captives to the top of a Rock, and thence he broke them to peeces <note n="h" place="margin">ver. 11, 12.</note>.

with him, and ſet them up to be his <hi>gods,</hi> bowed before ſuch things, which could not deliver their owne out of his <note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> hands, and ſo he broke himſelfe and his Kingdome; for this the Prophet rebuked this beſotted King, and the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the good Prophet, giving him a churliſh and threatning anſwer; Asking the Prophet, who made him a <note place="margin">ver. 16.</note> Counſellour; and bidding him forbeare, elſe he ſhould feele his hand. See how mad this King is upon his gods! The <note place="margin">Ier. 50. 38.</note> Prophet reproved him from the <hi>Lord</hi> for falling downe before ſtocks and ſtones; and he riſeth up againſt the Prophet, ready <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 13.</note> to ſtrike him in the face. Then the Prophet forbare: and yet, he will ſpeake out his words; If thou art <hi>ſuch a fooliſh King,</hi> that thou wilt no more <hi>be admoniſhed:</hi> it is becauſe thou muſt certainely be deſtroyed: If thy eare be ſhut againſt good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſo as it cannot enter: The judgements of GOD ſhall enter, and thou ſhalt lay thy ſelfe and thy Kingdome open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

               <p>The threatning of the King could not make void the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the LORD: but muſt haſten the execution thereof, as the Prophet knew very well. <hi>Amaziah</hi> had fallen downe in his devotions before the <hi>Edomites gods,</hi> he roſe as high in the confidence of his own ſtrength; as he had dealt <hi>fooliſhly</hi> like an Idolater to provoke the LORD by his deviliſh worſhip: ſo he would deale as <hi>proudly</hi> too after the manner, in provoking an enemy: he that could place helpe in ſtocks and ſtones, the <hi>Edomites gods,</hi> would put truſt alſo in the companies of men, <note place="margin">

Therefore he ſhould be left to his own <hi>ſeekings,</hi> to ſeeke and purſue his own deſtruction; And ſo he did, he thruſt himſelfe into his enemies hands; This enemy carried him captive, and in triumph to the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> forceth the captive King to betray his own City; to open the gates of the ſame, that his enemy, with his Army, might enter-in. When the gates were opened, the conquering King would not enter thereby: But, the more to deſpiſe his cowardly Brother, and the more ſhamefully to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight his <hi>Militia,</hi> he cauſed foure hundred cubits of the Wall to be throwne downe; entred the City in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot (Note how a proud Adverſary will inſult over a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable coward, who had a mighty <hi>Militia</hi> now on foote; but had not an heart to uſe it; his ſinnes had taken off his ſpirit, and made him as a <hi>ſilly Dove</hi> without a heart) through that breach, carrying the King before him in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over thoſe ruines.

We have now paſſed over one or two remarkeables in this Chapter, which we muſt recall.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> had the care of an holy man over him; an honeſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> (to a King, as a Diamond in his Crowne, the glory thereof) was not wanting to <hi>

                  <note n="g" place="margin">Hoſt. 6. 12.</note>: A hard matter, to be lifted up on high in the world, with the glory of the ſame, and yet to keepe the heart low; he muſt be more then a man, that can doe this, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible worke to this heart within us, to aſcribe <hi>ſalvations</hi> all unto GOD. <q>There is a fooliſh, and a wretched pride, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men being tranſported, can ill endure to aſcribe unto GOD the honour of thoſe actions, in which it hath pleaſed Him to uſe their own induſtry, courage or fore-ſight. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is commonly ſeene; That they, who entring into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, are carefull to pray for aid from Heaven, with due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of His power, who is the giver of victory; when the field is won, doe vaunt of their own exploits.</q> Man, when his mountaine is ſtrong, will be ſo ſtrong, and ſtout, and firme upon it, as if it could not be moved; he will cling faſt to the Arme of fleſh, forgetting the <hi>Arme</hi> of the <hi>Almighty;</hi> and then his Arme prooves it ſelfe <hi>fleſh,</hi> no better, but worſe, if worſe can be, like an <hi>Egiptian Reed,</hi> deceives, and pierceth both together.

               <p>But firſt we may obſerve, That the faſhion and manner of worſhip, which <hi>GOD</hi> preſcribed <hi>Ahaz,</hi> do's not pleaſe him; he will have a way of his owne, ſomething like to that <hi>GOD</hi> commanded: So he faſhioned an Altar, and <hi>paterned</hi> it.

               <p n="1">1. Be well aware, whether high or low, great or ſmall, be we aware, That we ſet not our foot in an Idolatrous way; if we doe, likely it is we will walke therein, <hi>ſtand</hi> in it, and then ſit downe there; having made an entrance, we cannot tell where we ſhall ſtay. It were worth the noting, if here were time and place to ſet it downe, the pedegree of Idols, and then the riſe of Idolatrous ſervices. In one word, the Idolater began with the offering a graine of incenſe at the firſt. What <note place="margin">

                  </note> did he offer at the laſt? The ſonne of his body, for the ſinne of his ſoule. <hi>Ahaz</hi> himſelfe is a great example of all this; <hi>Hee walked in the wayes of the Kings of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>he made alſo molten I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>

He that burnt Incenſe but now, now burnes his Children in the fire. When a man has <note place="margin">ver. 3.</note> ſet footing in an ill way, he knowes not where he ſhall ſtop. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware we ſet not up an Altar, which <hi>GOD</hi> commands not, though it be but one, and we can make it a gaudy one, and patterne it, as neare as can be to GODS Altar; yet beware of this one, for this one will draw on a ſecond, and a ſecond a third. <hi>Ahaz</hi> is a great example here alſo; he ſet up an Altar in the holy place; Did he ceaſe there? No; Now he gathers all his precious things together, and all to make and adorne his Altars; <hi>he made him Altars in every corner of</hi> Jeruſalem; nor <note place="margin">ver. 24.</note>

Of all the Creatures <hi>GOD</hi> has created, it is not ſafe to play with the <hi>light.</hi> I have read of one, who would not be beholding to the Sunne, for it's light to walke, or to worke by; he would cloſe up his eyes and put a cover over. At length he be thought himſelfe, and was content to ſee the light, and to take benefit from it; but he had covered his eyes ſo long, that, taking off the cover, he found his eye in the ſame place, but the ſight was gone: He had dallied with <hi>light</hi> too long. It is excellent which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; <hi>what good</hi> doſt thou to the fountaine, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. 5.</note> when thou drinkeſt of it? Thou art refreſhed from it, and that is thy benefit: So alſo, from the fountaine of light, thou ſeeſt by it, thou maiſt walke and worke by it, and that is thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: Be not proud then, doe not ſhut thine eye againſt the light; though it be but the light of nature, yet let it in, and make we much of it, then <hi>GOD</hi> will entruſt us with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light; <hi>He that is faithfull in a little ſhall be Ruler over much;</hi> but <hi>he that improveth not his little, ſhall have that taken from him, which he hath neglected, or not improved to his owne good, and the glory of the giver. Ahaz</hi> is a great example of this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; he playd with light, he thruſt it from him; he would not take the benefit of that common light, which, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dole, the <hi>LORD</hi> gives out to every man. He put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in man, <hi>Come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ſave me;</hi> then in ſtocks and ſtones, abominable Idols, ſaying, <hi>theſe may helpe me;</hi> he truſted in them. How then? Then he had eyes and ſaw not; an heart but underſtood not; as a <hi>ſilly Dove without an heart,</hi> he was as ſenſleſſe as the ſtocks he truſted in; <hi>They that make them are like unto them: So is every one that truſteth in them.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 135. 18.</note> Then, from that time, he ſought helpe from thoſe deſpicable things, to the day of his death, he walked in the world, as a man in a Dungeon, groping his way, as in the thickeſt darkneſſe. So much in way of Caution; now wee muſt receive Counſell hence, and ſound Inſtruction. Firſt, That;</p>

And ſecondly, That</p>
               <p>Idolatry, which is an humbling a mans ſelfe before dumb <note place="margin">2.</note> Idols, is a <hi>ſore tranſgreſſion</hi> againſt the <hi>LORD,</hi> and brings ſore judgements upon a Land, puts it into a forlorne and helpeleſſe condition; from out of the KINGS protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as no perſon nor thing can be a cover unto it, whereby to hide it's filthy nakedneſſe; It brings a Nation low, and makes a people naked.

A man can harden his own heart, and does ſo daily; he can lye in the grave of ſinne, and roule a ſtone over that grave; that he can doe, he can encreaſe the rockineſſe of his heart; he cannot ſoften it, doe he what he can. And that he muſt doe, he muſt uſe the meanes for the ſoftening of the heart, which GOD affords unto him. But all is made effectually by the good Hand of GOD unto him, Who ſpeakes and drawes too, for He ſpeakes with a <hi>ſtrong hand.</hi> The concluſion is; man is as dead as a doore naile to his own converſion; he can no more raiſe himſelfe from the death of ſinne, then a dead man can raiſe himſelfe from the grave of his corruption; But GODS voice he can heare; for that is a creating voice, that called <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave; and that voice he can heare.

               <p>That I may conclude this ſection with the more profit, we will looke back as farre as to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> thence recollect the Story, that we may take a ſhort view of the wayes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thereby amend our owne.</p>

Here the Church is afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, and ſo ſhe is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Eſa. 54. 11.</note> unto and comforted, with an expectation of an interrupted peace, for a time, even here below: but of reſt for ever in Heaven.

We ſhall now reade-on, and this concluſion quickly cleered unto us; <q>That where Idolatry is rooted-into a Kingdome, it will not be rooted-out till that Kingdome be rooted out: ſo it followes.</q>

And it is the complement of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery there: That, though his eyes are out, yet he cannot but behold that woefull ſlaughter in the darke. No more ſorrow can come in by the windowes of his body; more ſhall come-in at his doores; he heares that, which will make his eares tingle; That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is taken, <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>caſt out from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>

               <p>We can proceed no farther; we are come to the utmoſt of evils; a caſting out from the preſence of the LORD: It is next to the caſting into Hell, the very ſuburbs, the brim of that bottomleſſe pit. And who is caſt out I pray you? <hi>Judah.</hi> Give us leave to aske one queſtion more; Why was <hi>Judah</hi> caſt-out; wherefore did the LORD doe ſo and ſo unto <hi>Judah?</hi> The Nations asked this queſtion ſome thouſand yeares ago, and where they asked, there they have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given them, which will ſatisfie all the world.

               <p>This was a City, the <hi>Lord</hi> had choſen for Himſelfe out of all the world: All the world were witneſſes of their favours, their miraculous deliverances and protections: All the world ſhould be witneſſes, and ſtand aſtonied at their juſt confuſion. Her ſiſter

                  <hi>Samaria</hi> was not mentioned by her mouth in the day of her pride: Her Kings alſo would walke in the wayes of the houſe <note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 56.</note> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and after their <hi>counſels,</hi> to provoke the LORD.
