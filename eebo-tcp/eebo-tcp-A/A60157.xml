         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen God hath taken any
of our holy Relations from
us, who were ready for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:37242:3"/>
Manſions, made meet for the
Reſt, Peace and Joy of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
better World, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Grace of God towards
them; with Thankfulneſs owning
our Mercy, that they lived ſo long
to glorifie God here, and be uſeful
to us and others. It would be
very <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to lament their
Departure, out of any Pretence of
our Affection to them; and no leſs
<hi>unkind</hi> to wiſh that for our ſakes
they ſhould not have died, or
ſhould return from Paradiſe to our
ſinful, troubleſome World. But
we know they <hi>ſhall not come to
us;</hi> the only way therefore to meet
them with Comfort, is to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their Inſtructions, follow their
Counſels, and imitate their Faith
and Holineſs, their Integrity and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:37242:3"/>
Self-denial, and reſolved, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering
Obedience to God.</p>
            <p>The Prayers and Pattern of
ſuch <hi>an Husband,</hi> and of ſuch <hi>a
Father</hi> as yours, is a Bleſſing for
which God expects your Praiſes.
Tho' in the <hi>former</hi> Relation it was
enjoyed but a little while; long
enough however to make you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
bleſs God for him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
to value and honour his
Memory while you live. May his
Grace ſupply, and help you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this Breach.</p>
            <p>To you <hi>his Children</hi> I moſt
earneſtly recommend the following
Papers: God and Man will expect
your profiting by them more than
others. You know how much you
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:37242:4"/>
were upon his Heart: You know
his Example and manner of Life,
and how you ought to walk and
pleaſe God: You have ſeen the
Beauty of Practical Godlineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified;
you know how fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was wont to wreſtle with
God in Prayer for you: You know
with what daily Pains and Care,
Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, and Love
he endeavoured your Salvation;
rejoicing in any good Succeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but hardly able to ſupport un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Burden of the contrary
Fears, as to Any of thoſe whom
God had given him. O dread to
think that <hi>either of You,</hi> or <hi>any
of Yours,</hi> ſhould meet him at the
Day of Judgment, and be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Chriſt, among the Workers
of Iniquity, when both your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:37242:4"/>
ſhall be own'd, honour'd, and
rewarded among the Faithful. An
ordinary Hell will not be Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough for the Children of
ſuch Parents, if you miſcarry and
fall ſhort of Heaven!</p>
            <p>But if you ſeek after God with
your whole Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſiring to pleaſe
and ſerve him, who was the God
of your Fathers, for many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
if you are humble and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
and prize the Bleſſing of
the Covenant, keep within the
Bond of it, and mind the Duty
of it; your Way is prepared, your
Acceptance is aſſured, there is a
Proſpect of more Grace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
for you and yours, as <hi>a double Bleſſing</hi> promiſed to the
Childrens Children of ſuch as fear

the Lord. That you may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

that <hi>your Father's God</hi>

            <head>A SHORT
ACCOUNT
Of the Holy LIFE of
Mr. Henry Gearing, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF there be Joy in Heaven among the
Angels, and the bleſſed Inhabitants
Above, upon the Converſion of a
Sinner; we may reckon there is ſo from
time to time, upon the Addition to their
Number of any ſuch, who by the Grace
of God are made meet for the Heavenly
State and Life. Among many others, of
late deceaſed, Mr. <hi>H. G.</hi> was doubtleſs
a very welcome Perſon.</p>
            <p>The too frequent Flattery of Funeral
Orations I know is a common Objection
againſt ſpeaking or writing any thing of
the Dead; becauſe many are commended,
whoſe Names are written in the Duſt, and
deſerve to periſh with their own Dung.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:37242:6"/>
But the Memory of the Juſt ſhall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be bleſſed; their Death is precious,
and their Examples uſeful to all who knew
them, and may be ſo to many others. It
is not, I confeſs, of every good Man or
Woman that dieth, that we can ſpeak
ſuch things as we may to the juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of ſome. Neither is it fit to
publiſh all the Good we can of every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
becauſe it may be they had ſome
Blemiſhes that will make the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
or leſſen its Uſe. But Perſons
of eminent Grace and Holineſs, are the
choiceſt Works of God, the richeſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
the moſt precious Jewels that
can be ſhown: For the meaneſt Saint is
incomparably more noble and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the greateſt Perſonages in the
World, that are Slaves of Sin, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God. But as one Star differs
from another in Glory, there are ſome
more lively Images of God, and who
better imitate the Pattern of Chriſt;
ſome Veſſels of Mercy filled with Grace
above their Fellows. Of ſuch as theſe
we ought to ſpeak, to the Glory of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace. There is an attractive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in their Pattern; ſome good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Impreſſion may be left by the
ſerious Peruſal of their Lives and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
Divers have dated their firſt
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:37242:6"/>
Converſion from reading or hearing ſuch
Relations.</p>
            <p>But as many an upright Chriſtian, whoſe
Funeral Sermon I may be call'd to preach,
will come far ſhort of the Spirit and
Practice of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſo I reſolve to ſpeak
more ſparingly of the Dead, in ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
leſt I raiſe the Expectation of
the like, where I cannot conſcionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. And on the ſame Account, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
the mention of ſome things which
He deſired of me, and I complied with,
becauſe I would not encourage others to
deſire the like.</p>
            <p>I hope the publiſhing of ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
may be one means to confute, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of the preſent Age, as
if there were no Reality in Religion; that
it is meer Notion and Talk, or a Cover for
Hypocriſie. An exemplary viſible Piety
is proper to confute ſuch Cavils, baffle
ſuch Prejudices, and convince the Minds
of Men, and bring them ſecretly to wiſh
that they themſelves were ſuch. It is
certain the unſutable Lives of thoſe who
profeſs Religion, hath greatly ſtumbled
and hardened many in their Profaneneſs.
Some of no ordinary Parts or Education,
under Convictions of Sin, and Fears of
Hell upon a Death-bed, have told me,
that the wicked Lives of ſuch as pretended
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:37242:7"/>
to Religion, had more hindered their
Seriouſneſs than all the Quirks and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
or bold Attempts of ſuch as
would overthrow the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſerious well-diſpoſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will be encouraged by the Example
and Commendation of ſuch, after whoſe
Copy they deſire to write. Thanks be to
God, they are <hi>not a few,</hi> even in this Age,
of whoſe <hi>Exemplary Lives</hi> there are divers
Paſſages fit to be publiſhed: And tho' it
would be endleſs to write all their Lives,
yet now and then to ſet forth a bright
Example may be of ſingular Advantage.
Such as knew this, or the other Perſon in
particular, and were themſelves Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the Truth of ſeveral things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
will be more apt to be influenced
by ſuch an Account, than by the like, or
greater things related of others, who have
been dead many Years ago, or their Lives
written by ſuch who never perſonally
were acquainted with them. And by
ſuch Examples we ſee that ſtrict and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Religion is poſſible; and that if
your Hearts are ſet to pleaſe God, it is
not to be deſpaired of.</p>
            <p>If I can by the following Narrative
excite any to value and improve their
<hi>Time</hi> better, whereof he was ſo very
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:37242:7"/>
choice and careful: If I can blow up any
Coal of that Divine Fervor and Zeal to
God, that warm'd his Heart; if I can
but provoke any to mend their Pace, by
conſidering how ſhort they come of what
he was, and did, I ſhall think I did well
to publiſh it.</p>
            <p>However, as the Word of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Holy Scriptures, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
in the Miniſtry thereof, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and contrary Effects upon different
Subjects, from which God will raiſe his
own Glory; ſo will it be with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
But if the Reader gain no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by the peruſing of it, he muſt
blame himſelf for not conſidering, and
applying it with ſutable Reflections. For
he may here find the Deſcription of <hi>a
Real Chriſtian, a true Nathaniel, an Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite
indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not very ſolicitous to avow my
Integrity as to the Truth of every thing
related; becauſe, beſides what I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
of him from my own Knowledge,
all that have lived in his Family, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others of his Acquaintance in this City,
will readily ſubſcribe to the Truth of
the reſt: Tho' the beſt Diſcovery of him
is what is tranſcribed from <hi>his own Papers.</hi>
For who can know the inward State and
Frame of another Man's Soul, but by his
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:37242:8"/>
own Declaration of it ſome way or other:
It muſt be opened ſome way or other by
himſelf, or it cannot be publiſhed and
made known to others. The inmoſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of a Man's Heart towards God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo well known by the ſtricteſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of other Men.</p>
            <p>What I have gathered out of his own
Manuſcripts, is publiſhed without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing material in the Expreſſions,
unleſs here and there on Word, where
the Phraſe was dark, or ſubject to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity.
If in ſome things there ſeems
not that Exactneſs which ſome Readers
would deſire, it ought to be conſidered, that
there are other Readers to whom they
may be more ſutable, who are not to be
neglected. And as to his manner of
expreſſing himſelf, you muſt remember
he was a plain Citizen, and one who had
no need of a poliſh'd Stile, or any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to gain it. Beſides, what he
wrote was only for the Comfort of his
own Soul; and, if he had any farther
Eye, for the uſe of thoſe of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
whoſe Love and Regard to him
might imprint deeper on their Minds and
Hearts what was done by him, tho' with
leſs Accuracy than by another Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:37242:8"/>
After all, I here pretend not to leſſen
the Honour and Commendation of any
other holy Perſons lately deceaſed, or of
any ſuch yet living: For, in ſubſtance,
the Character of one will ſute the Hearts
and Lives of all the reſt. But all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Chriſtians do not walk with God
in their daily Courſe, as did this <hi>holy
Man.</hi> I may call him ſo, tho' I do not
ſay he was <hi>perfect:</hi> For a greater than he,
<hi>Elias,</hi> was ſubject to like Paſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
with us. The beſt Saints on
Earth are but imperfectly ſanctified, their
Knowledge is imperfect, their Love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
their Self-denial imperfect; they
have Remainders of Corruption, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Temperament
of their Bodies, Circumſtances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Life, they are ſubject to many
Weakneſſes, and are ſenſible of them.
But the Grace they receive by conſtant
Prayer, and Dependance, and the Care
and Watchfulneſs they are enabled to
uſe over their Hearts, and Words, and
Senſes, and againſt the Occaſions of Sin,
preſerves them from any great Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and quickly recovers them from
leſſer ones.</p>
            <p>I therefore hope I ſhall not be blamed
for not mentioning his Infirmities and
Failings, becauſe I know not how the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:37242:9"/>
Reader's Benefit and Advantage would
be thereby promoted: It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to this purpoſe, that the Vertues,
the Graces, the Perfections of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſet before our View, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to nouriſh our Humility, ſuppreſs our
Pride, and invite our Imitation: But to
divulge their Faults would rather further
our Security, and advance our Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
And as to this Excellent Perſon, his
Watchfulneſs and Temperance, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and Diligence, his Mortification
and Zeal for doing good, argued a very
great Purity of Mind and Heart; and his
careful Improvement of his Time left
little Vacancy for Temptation to fill up.
No very great Faults be ſure could dwell
with ſuch ſtrict Examination of himſelf
every Day, as he continued to uſe till
within <hi>four Days</hi> of his Death. But that
being all written <hi>in Short-Hand,</hi> what
might have been from thence added to
his Character, or tranſcribed for the
Imitation or Inſtruction of others, is
wholly loſt. This in the general will be
owned by thoſe who were beſt acquainted
with him, that, human Infirmities and
Imperfections excepted, his Life was one
even Thread of ſerious Godlineſs, from
Morning to Night, from the beginning
of the Week, and Month, and Year, to
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:37242:9"/>
the end, in all Relations, in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and in all Affairs.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Leachlad</hi> in <hi>Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
and baptized there, <hi>March</hi> the <hi>5th.
An.</hi> 1632. His Father, Mr. <hi>Henry Gearing,</hi>
was a Shop-keeper, or Mercer, in that
Town; and for his extraordinary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Piety, reſpected, honoured, and
loved by Perſons of all Perſwaſions. There
are not wanting thoſe now living, who can
ſay of the <hi>Father's Houſe,</hi> what ſeveral
know to be true of the <hi>Son's,</hi> That it was
a Nurſery of Religion, a little Temple of
God, and they thank God they were ever
caſt under that Roof. It was the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of<note n="*" place="margin">My Honoured Friend, Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua Gearing,</hi> Sen.</note> one, whoſe hoary
Head in the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
is a Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with whom our Mr. <hi>Gear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
ſerved his Apprenticeſhip: He in his
younger Years boarded in his Father's Houſe
at <hi>Leachlad,</hi> and reckons the Example of
his holy Life to have been a ſingular Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him in his Youth. His pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died of a Conſumption, when this Son
was about the Age of <hi>Thirteen.</hi> As did
his Unkle, Mr. <hi>Simon Gearing,</hi> his Father's
elder Brother, about ſix Years after. His
Mother, Mrs. <hi>Ann Gearing,</hi> was likewiſe
an eminent Chriſtian, and died at <hi>Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:37242:10"/>
in <hi>Wiltſhire, January</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> 1669,
and was there buried.</p>
            <p>But to return to him of whom I am now
further to ſpeak. It pleaſed God to begin
very <hi>early</hi> with him, before he came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
when he was about <hi>Twelve</hi> or <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi>
Years old. God doth often ſo bleſs a
good Education of Children; and would oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
do it, if Parents would be careful to do
their Duty in this Particular with Wiſdom
and Faithfulneſs. There were ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
as I am informed, of his ſerious
Godlineſs in his Youth, as were obſerved
by many, to the Admiration of the Grace
of God. He began betimes to ſeek after
God and Chriſt: Theſe were his beſt Days,
and he comfortably found him whom his Soul
loved. The Pleaſure, the Advantage, the
Succeſs and Comfort of Devotedneſs to
God in our Youth, is beyond all Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>London,</hi> God directed
and ſettled him as an Apprentice with his
Couſin Mr. <hi>Joſhua Gearing,</hi> already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
where he had the Advantages of a
Religious Family, and conſtantly attended the
ſerious, affectionate Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>James
Nalton,</hi> whoſe Name and Memory is ſtill
precious with many in this City: God was
pleaſed to bleſs his Preaching to his effectual
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:37242:10"/>
Converſion, or rather to nouriſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Seeds of Grace planted before.
He always thought he could never ſpeak
with Honour and Affection enough of
Mr. <hi>Nalton,</hi> whom God had made ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Soul: He would frequently, to
his dying Day, mention with what power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Impreſſions on his Conſciences his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were accompanied, how he thought
himſelf in a Corner of Heaven under his
Miniſtry; that he could many times have
wiſhed to have gone directly to Heaven
from the Place of Publick Worſhip; ſuch
a Preſence and Power of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
did attend the Goſpel-Miniſtrations.
May the Reſidue of this Spirit be more
plentifully poured out on the Miniſters of
Chriſt in this City and Nation, for the like
Effects on the Souls of Men!</p>
            <p>He hath often Spoken and writ, how
ſweet and advantagious a Seaſon for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the Time of his Apprenticeſhip was:
What Heavenly Thoughts and Meditations
be frequently had in the Shop, and behind
the Counter. He hath often profeſſed, that
by reaſon of his Freedom at that time
from Worldly Cares and Buſineſs, it was
the beſt Time he ever enjoyed for God and
his Soul in his whole Life. He had then
nothing elſe to do, but to ſerve God and
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:37242:11"/>
pleaſe his Maſter, who was the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with him, for loving and pleaſing, and
ſerving God. The Converſation he had
in Heaven by <hi>Ejaculatory Prayer,</hi> while
he followed his Maſter's Buſineſs, he hath
often ſince reflected on with Joy and
Thanks, ſaying, He would not for all the
World but be able to remember what he
then enjoyed; for he never had ſuch live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
comfortable, uninterrupted Communion
with God afterwards. Tho' in his After-courſe
he continued in this Evidence of a
Heavenly Mind and Heart, frequently to
lift up his Soul to God, whatever Buſineſs
he was about, and whatever Company he
was in. He hath ſometimes owned, that
he enjoyed as much of God in his Thoughts,
while walking in the Streets, as when he
was upon his Knees.</p>
            <p>When his Time was out, he choſe to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a whole Year or more with his Maſter,
being afraid leſt the World ſhould engroſs
too much of his Heart and Time; and had
almoſt reſolved to retire into the Country,
to be out of the Danger of many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to have more Opportunities for
Meditation and Prayer. But judging (tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough) that that was not the way to be
uſeful in the World, nor could he bring ſo
much Glory to God in a private retired
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:37242:11"/>
Life, as by ſettling in a Family and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he accordingly did both. And choſe
a ſutable Companion out of a Religious
Family, who deſired with him to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
her Buſineſs; and God was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
very kind to him in the like Choice.</p>
            <p>It was his Cuſtom every Night to write
down in Short-hand ſome of the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Things of every Day relating to his
Soul, as his Mercies, his Sins, the Frame
of his Heart in Duty, gracious Returns of
Prayer, ſpecial Providences to himſelf and
others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He deſired every Night to lie
down in Expectation of Death, and Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for it, tho' he were in perfect
Health: And, through the Goodneſs of
God, he enjoyed an extraordinary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it for many Years. So that, till a
little before his Death, I have heard him
ſay, that he had not been above <hi>twice</hi> kept
by Sickneſs, from hearing a Sermon on the
Lord's Day, for the ſpace of <hi>Forty Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thoſe Chriſtians who have full leiſure
for this excellent daily Work of Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and recording the Reſult of it,
this Courſe would be of unſpeakable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
But I urge it not upon all. It
is ſufficient to many to renew their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for daily Failings, and record only
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:37242:12"/>
the extraordinary, and more remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of their Lives, not having time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the ordinary Occurrences of every Day.</p>
            <p>But beſides what he did every Day, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſet apart whole Days with <hi>Faſting</hi>
and <hi>Prayer,</hi> to examine and try the State of
his Soul. Part whereof he tranſcribed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
tho' but a very little part; which is
here added, as containing <hi>the Character and
Trial of a Real Chriſtian,</hi> with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his tranſcribing it. And I am perſwaded
he did it with great <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
the rather, becauſe, when about a Month
or ſix Weeks before his Death, he was under
ſome Darkneſs and Clouds, as to his Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for Heaven, and apprehended his Time on
Earth would be but ſhort, he deſired to diſcourſe
with me, more than once, about the State of
his Soul, (which I ſhall always remember with
Thankfulneſs to God:) in order to my making
the better Judgment of his Caſe, he let me ſee
ſome of thoſe Papers, written many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but ſends me a Letter the next Morning to
recal them, mentioning his great Trouble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I was gone, leſt what he had done ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of <hi>Pride,</hi> and ought rather to have been
concealed. Such was the Tenderneſs of his
Conſcience in this, and in every thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:37242:12"/>
I ſhall ſay the leſs concerning his <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himſelf,</hi> becauſe you have here
annexed a ſhort Account of the manner of
it. The lawfulneſs of trying our ſelves by
Marks and Signs of the Truth of Grace, I
hope will not be queſtioned, when it is but to
evidence the Sincerity of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
and <hi>holy Obedience,</hi> while we
aſcribe unto <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langs
to him, as <hi>our great High-Prieſt.</hi> All
that is done by Chriſt without us, in order to
our Salvation, may and ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from what is done by the Spirit of
Chriſt, and his Grace within us; becauſe
there is a manifeſt difference between what
<hi>cauſeth</hi> our Acceptance with <hi>God,</hi> and that
which is <hi>evidential</hi> of it, in order to our
own Comfort.</p>
            <p>His Example in the <hi>ſtrict Obſervation of
the Lord's Day,</hi> and conſcientious <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his Family-Relations,</hi> hath been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of to the Edification of many. The
Weekly Chriſtian Sabbath was honourable and
eſteemed by him; he made it his Delight. He
remembred it before it came, by ſomething
Preparatory in his Family upon the <hi>Saturday</hi>
Evening. He was early in the Morning on
that Day in his Cloſet, and likewiſe in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Worſhip, with Prayer and Thankſgiving,
and reading the Holy Scripture, (whereof

Children and Servants were to remember ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what)
and ſo prepared for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
He would not willingly ſuffer any idle
or vain Diſcourſe throughout the whole Day;
admoniſhing all about him to take heed of their
Thoughts and Words, in a ſpecial manner upon
the <hi>Lord's Day.</hi> He retired as ſoon as he
came home at Noon for a little ſpace, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of Inferiors what they remembred. He
expreſs'd his Diſlike of thoſe, who had been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
herein, by encouraging thoſe that did better.</p>
            <p>His Diſcourſe was always ſerious, ſavoury,
and ſutable at his Table; often minding thoſe
about him, how many had gone into Eternity
the laſt Week, and of the Bounty and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heaven in the Plenty they enjoyed, both
for Spirituals and Temporals beyond others.
After Dinner, a Chapter or two was always
read, and ſome part of a ſerious Practical
Book, till it was time to go to the Publick
Worſhip. Therein he was always reverent and
ſerious. After he came home, he retired to
his Cloſet for near an Hour, and charged all
the reſt of the Family to go alone likewiſe;
then he called them together, begun with a
ſhort Invocation of God, ſung a Pſalm, and
repeated the Morning-Sermon, and prayed
with them before Supper. Many who lived
with him can witneſs, that in Family-Prayer,
upon the Lord's Day, he had more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:37242:18"/>
Affections and Fervency; and it is
the Experience of other Chriſtians. O that
Heads of Families would but make a Trial!
After Prayer he retired a very little, probably
to reflect on his Frame in the laſt Duty, and
then would ask his Children ſome pertinent
Queſtions concerning the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
After Supper he repeated the Afternoon-Sermon,
and enquired what they remembred
of it.</p>
            <p>He was himſelf the laſt in the Family who
went to Bed, that he might run over the
Heads of what he had heard and repeated.
For theſe he reviewed on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning,
and kept in his Memory all the Week, and
every Day repeated ſomewhat thereof to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he might have the Subject of thoſe
Sermons continually in his Thoughts, as the
Food of his Soul, till another Lord's Day came.
He recommended this Practice unto others,
hereby to live the Sermons we hear, and to be
under an Awe and Influence by them, all the
Week after.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> Mornings, ever ſince <hi>the
Black Bartholomew-Day,</hi> when about Two
thouſand Miniſters were ſilenced (for want of
ſuch a Liberty and Toleration as God is now
pleaſed mercifully to allow us) he did from
that time, until his Death, accuſtom himſelf
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:37242:19"/>
to riſe at <hi>Four a Clock</hi> every <hi>Monday</hi>
Morning, and oftentimes ſooner; ſpending
the time in his Cloſet till Six, eſpecially <hi>in
Prayer for the Nation, and the Church
of Chriſt:</hi> I have heard that ſeveral others
agreed with him in the like Practice.</p>
            <p>But in his ordinary Courſe, he was went
to be <hi>early</hi> every Morning in his Cloſet, and
about <hi>Seven</hi> a Clock would call his Family to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and read a Pſalm or two, and pray
with them. His great Meaſure of Health
was a conſiderable Help to him to do more
than others, in this, and ſeveral Particulars:
And accordingly he improved it, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
any time in unneceſſary Recreations; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he deſired no other <hi>Recreation,</hi> but to
think and ſpeak of God, and mind his Glory.
He often thankfully acknowledged the Divine
Goodneſs, that his Imployment was ſuch, that
he had more time for ſerious, ſolitary Religion
than others; and that he had more time for
reading in his <hi>Shop,</hi> and might have it ſhut
ſooner in the Evening. And he contracted
his Buſineſs, or would not chooſe to hurry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by enlarging of it, with that very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing he did there in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was to read ſome part of <hi>the Holy
Scripture,</hi> with the beſt Annotations he could
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:37242:19"/>
procure upon them, and the like in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And in reading them over again and
again, regularly and in courſe, he found much
Advantage; he ſtill perceived ſuch a Majeſty,
ſuch a Myſtery, ſuch a Depth in them, that
he was never weary of fathoming, tho' he
could never reach the bottom: He deſired to
walk by that Rule, to be guided by that
Light, and to derive his Supports, Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Hopes from thence.</p>
            <p>I hardly ever knew one more <hi>careful of
his Time,</hi> and all that knew him muſt ſay
the ſame. He would tarry but a very little
while in any Company, where he might not do,
or receive Good. He was ſo punctual in his
time of Retirement for <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> about
<hi>Six</hi> in the Summer, and <hi>Five</hi> in the Winter,
(unleſs he were hearing a Sermon at that
Hour) that he would uſually make ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
or other to break away from Company,
tho' he returned to them in Half an Hour.
His Communion with God <hi>there</hi> was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Frame of his Spirit when he
came from thence. It is <hi>there,</hi> we ſpeak our
Minds and Hearts more freely to God, and
there he communicates of his gracious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in a ſpecial manner to us. He found
more Satisfaction and Comfort in one ſuch
Hour, by pouring out his Soul to God alone,
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:37242:20"/>
than in the moſt witty, chearful Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch, whoſe Diſcourſe adminiſters no
Grace or Profit to the Hearers.</p>
            <p>When he hath been deſired to go to Bed
ſooner, or as ſoon as others, he would often
ſay he would do as others, if he were not
certain that he muſt die: But our ſleeping
Time he ſaid was loſt, as to any ſpiritual Good,
any further than it fits us for our Duty, by
preſerving Health. The laſt thing he did
every Evening, was to go into his Cloſet, and
with Prayer and Self-examination to cloſe the
Day.</p>
            <p>Once a Week, <hi>viz.</hi> every <hi>Friday Night,</hi>
(as a little before his Death he ſaid) it had
been his conſtant Cuſtom to review the Mercies
of his whole Life, thereby to promote his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Thankfulneſs, to keep up his Hope
in God, and quicken his chearful, diligent
Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>His Care and Concern for the Souls of
thoſe under his Charge, eſpecially <hi>his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
was very extraordinary, and attended
with good Succeſs, as ſeveral of his Relations
(living and dying) have owned. Of his uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to one related to him, you have ſome
Account in the Narrative of her Converſion
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:37242:20"/>
to God, which is here annex'd. His Counſels
and Example made thoſe in his Family begin
to love Religion for his ſake, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they did for its own. God doth often
bring us to him by Inſtruments of Nature
and Affection, and give the Influence of his
Spirit to carry on thoſe good Beginnings.</p>
            <p>He uſually ask'd <hi>the Aſſembly's Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi>
in his Family, twice every Week, and
encouraged Inferiors by Rewards to learn it,
and to get ſome ſelect Portions of Scripture
by Heart, and ſo he brought them to delight
in it. With what Solicitude, and Care, and
unwearied Pains, with what Compaſſion, and
Pity, and hearty Affection he endeavoured
the Converſion of ſome, and the Recovery
of others related to him, from their Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in Religion, I and ſeveral others can
teſtifie.</p>
            <p>His Piety was uniform, equal and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
and all of a piece; and therefore his
ordinary Converſe was grave and ſerious, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and uſeful; his Diſcourſe becoming a
Chriſtian, that was under the Eye and Awe of
God, and in the Fear of the Lord all the Day
long. He was always ready to begin or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
ſuch Diſcourſe, and greatly lamented that
when good People meet together, they have ſo
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:37242:21"/>
little Talk of Spiritual and Religious Matters.
I wiſh, for my own ſake, I had ſpent more
time with him upon <hi>this Account,</hi> for he
deſired it not on any other. He valued not Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
of <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Complement,</hi> no
not of Miniſters, or any others, that would
not help him as a Chriſtian. I truſt his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
will be a living Sermon to me, and to
many others that knew him.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Trade</hi> he had many and great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments
and Loſſes, and yet bore them
with admirable Patience. He thanked God
that he was carried through them with ſo much
Calmneſs and Satisfaction, that he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſpeak good of God; tho' hardly any, that
trade for more, have been known to have
loſt ſo much.</p>
            <p>He would not buy or ſell without lifting up
his Heart to God for Direction. And as an
Argument of his tender Conſcience, I have
been informed by one (who muſt needs know
the Truth of it) that he would not let his
Silk lie on the damper ſide of the Warehouſe,
leſt it ſhould thereby encreaſe in Weight, and
ſo wrong the Buyer.</p>
            <p>He walked with God in his Calling ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
as a Chriſtian, that I am perſwaded
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:37242:21"/>
he enjoyed more of God in his Shop and Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
in his Trade and Buſineſs, than many
of us do in our Retirements for Prayer and
Devotion, For let him come when he would
from his Secular Affairs, his Mind was more
Spiritual and Heavenly, than moſt ordinary
Chriſtians are, when they come from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Exerciſes of Religion. <hi>In ſhort,</hi> his
Principles, his Thoughts, his Inclinations, his
Affections and Actions, his Carriage and
Converſe in the Whole of them, was ſuch
as might be truly called <hi>a walking with
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ready to do Good to all his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
by <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Reproof,</hi> by ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Admonition;</hi> whereof
divers now living muſt needs be ſenſible; and
ſome of them, I hope, do thank God for his
<hi>Freedom</hi> in that kind.</p>
            <p>His Charity to the Poor was anſwerable to
the reſt, according to his Ability. Many a
poor Family of Country Miniſters, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
Widows, in City and Country, will
feel that he is dead: For what he could not do
of himſelf, he would endeavour to procure of
others, for the Relief of ſuch whoſe Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he knew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:37242:22"/>
He never neglected a Monthly Opportunity
of coming to the Lord's Table, tho' he hath
often complained to me, that he had not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
any ſenſible raviſhing Joy; however
Careful and Strict he was in his Preparations
before, as well as Devout and Reverent when
he came. But he <hi>durſt not ſtay away:</hi>
He came humbly to pay Homage to a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saviour, and to avow to all the World
that he gloried only in the Croſs of Chriſt;
and was reſolved to be found in the way of
his Duty.</p>
            <p>Now it would be expected, that <hi>One</hi> ſo
Exemplary, ſo Circumſpect, ſo much above
this World, One ſo uſeful upon Earth, and ſo
ripe for Heaven, ſhould have lived in the
moſt raiſed Conſolations, and the moſt joyful
Tranſports, as if he had been already almoſt
in Heaven, or juſt come from thence. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>will ſome ſay,</hi> ſuch an one as <hi>He</hi> muſt
have the Earneſt, the Seal, the Fore-taſtes of
Glory, beyond his Brethren; he muſt needs
walk on the Top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> in the Light of God's
Countenance, in the ſight of the Heavenly
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and be paſt the Fears, and Doubts,
and Complaints of other Trembling Chriſtians.
But God did not think this fit for him, in the
latter part of his Life. Nevertheleſs he had
<hi>that</hi> which was equivalent, or better than the
higheſt Flights of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> can be. For
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:37242:22"/>
under his Complaints of Doubts, and Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and want of ſenſible Communion with
God, he had a moſt ſteady Truſt in God through
Jeſus Chriſt, and an uniform Obedience: And,
as he has been often told, his Doubts ſeemed
to proceed from <hi>the Height of his Grace,</hi>
rather than <hi>the Weakneſs</hi> of it. For ſuch
was his extraordinary Love to God, that he
never thought he could have Evidence enough
of the Divine Preſence and Favour; tho' that
was mixed with ſome Error of Judgment, as
expecting more than God hath promiſed in that
kind; and as arguing from ſuch Arbitrary
Diſpenſations of God, unto ſuch Concluſions,
as cannot juſtly be drawn from the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the Want of theſe Things. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
his Judicious Love to God, his inward
Eſteem of Holineſs and Heaven, his fixed
Hatred and Abhorrence of Sin, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Self-denial and Devotedneſs to God,
with conſtant Watchfulneſs and Care to pleaſe
him, and keep a Conſcience void of Offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and Man, is <hi>a better Evidence</hi>
of one beloved of God, than the higheſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
can amount to: Eſpecially in his Caſe,
who, under ſome Darkneſs and Fears, was
able yet to hold on his Way, and his Work,
and to preſevere with unſhaken Stedfaſtneſs to
the very laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:37242:23"/>
Tho' ſomething alſo of his Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and Bodily Conſtitution, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
to abate his Suſpicion of himſelf,
upon the Account of his not having ſuch rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſenſible Conſolations, and Joys, as ſome
others. Beſides that, his Humility in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of himſelf, and his earneſt Deſire of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Communion with God, made him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
what he did enjoy, even in this kind.
For often, when he joined with others, or
when he prayed alone, his Affections were
more lively, after having been <hi>Forty Years</hi>
in Chriſt, than moſt young Converts are the
<hi>Firſt</hi> Year.</p>
            <p>However, in this God was very gracious
to him, that, tho' he feared <hi>the Devil</hi> might
aſſault him at laſt, he did not permit it. But
with a calm Submiſſion, and regular, ſteady
Truſt, and Hope in the Divine Mercy, with
Eyes, and Hands, and Heart lift up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he quietly departed this Life, and is at
Reſt in the Boſom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If I would pronounce a Bleſſing on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and ſurviving Relations, upon his
Wife, and Children, his Friends, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
that love and honour his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
I know not how to do it by a more
profitable Prayer, than to beg of God that
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:37242:23"/>
they may tread in his Steps, and walk as
he walked; that <hi>his God</hi> may be <hi>their
God;</hi> that they may follow him as he was a
Follower of Chriſt; and ſo at laſt be more
than Conquerors over the World, and Sin,
and Death, and him that hath the Power of
it, the Devil. Thanks be to God who hath
<hi>given him,</hi> and <hi>aſſured us,</hi> of the Victory,
through <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> To him be
Glory throughout all the Churches for ever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

manner of his examining his Heart and
Life, State and Frame, and the Reſult
thereof recorded, and written for his
Support in After-Difficulties. Some

               <byline>HENRY GEARING.</byline>
               <p>THO' I have been under much <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>Deadneſs</hi> for many Years,
yet I thought good, for my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
here to record God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to me ſometimes. By looking over
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37242:29"/>
my Books, in which I have wrote down
in Short-hand every Night, how it was
with me in the Day; I find that I have
ſometimes been quickned and affected in
Prayer; often in Family-Prayer at Night
on the Lord's Day. Tho' I began very
much indiſpoſed, yet it pleaſed God to
draw out my Heart in Earneſt Deſires,
and I have had ſome Meltings more than
uſual. At other times, in Family-Prayer
at Night, I have been more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
affected. And ſometimes under
the Word preach'd: Once at the <hi>Morning
Lecture,</hi> when I heard a Sermon of <hi>buying
the Pearl of Price.</hi> At other times I find
I was affected greatly in Family Prayer,
ſo as ſcarce to be able to ſpeak for weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
At another time I have recorded
how I was quickened by hearing a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of Mr. <hi>Swinnock</hi> on that Text, <hi>He
will not break the bruiſed Reed.</hi> At ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other times have had lively Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in ſecret Prayer.</p>
               <p>Often in my Walk to <hi>Clapham,</hi> I have
had my Heart drawn out in earneſt, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Deſires after God. Once repeating
on a Lord's Day Evening, a Sermon on
that Text, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and
knock, and whoſoever opens to me, I will
come in and ſup with him;</hi> I was ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
I could not go on for Tears, but was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37242:29"/>
fain to lay down my Book. At another
time the like in repeating a Sermon of
<hi>the Redemption of Time.</hi> At other times
I find recorded, that on the Lord's Day I
went to Family-Prayer very ſad, but God
did greatly aſſiſt me, and my Soul was
melted, ſo that I could not proceed or
ſpeak for Tears. At other times in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and ſometimes in <hi>ſinging of Pſalms.</hi>
But, for the moſt part, I have been a
great Stranger to Joy and Comfort ever
ſince the Days of my Youth. Theſe
Things I wrote, <hi>March</hi> 18. 1689, being
Remarks in general of near Twenty Years
paſt.</p>
               <p>As to what I have written in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book, it was firſt in Short-Hand, and
never intended to be tranſcribed. But
afterwards I conſidered that many things
in it might be of uſe to me, by another's
reading of it, if it ſhould pleaſe God to
lay his Hand upon me, that I could not
my ſelf read my Short-Hand: And I
know not but ſomething in it may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to others.</p>
               <p>I hope and pray it may be ſo unto many,
if the like ſerious Spirit accompany every
Reader in the Peruſal of the following

                  </gap>aſt in my
Cloſet, chiefly to ſearch and try the State
of my Soul, this Day I did it, and hope
I did ſet about it in the Integrity of my
Heart: My chief Deſign was to examine
how the Caſe ſtood between God and my
Soul, whether I had indeed a Work of
ſaving Grace wrought in me. And that I
might get Corruption that is ſtrong more
mortified, eſpecially the Sin I moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
unto; and that I might be enabled
from God to carry it better in my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Courſe, both in my Family and in
ſecret Retirements, to the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>After Prayer, that God would help
me to try my ſelf, I went to the Work
of <hi>Self-Examination</hi> by the Characters
that Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath given, and by
ſome Characters my Couſin <hi>Calamy</hi> laid
down, and others of Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Swinnock.</hi> I ſpent a good
deal of time herein, and hope I deſired
to deal impartially with my ſelf; and
did beg of God heartily, that I might
make a right Judgment of my ſelf: I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to keep my Heart cloſe to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37242:30"/>
Work; and tho' I could not meet with
great Comfort, yet upon ſerious Search I
cannot find but that God hath wrought
<hi>true Grace</hi> in me, bleſſed be his Name;
I hope I may have recourſe to this Day,
while I live, for Support in any Caſe.</p>
               <p>I did alſo read over the <hi>Covenant</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into with the Lord about nine Years
ſince, and renewed my Covenant, and
gave up my ſelf afreſh to the Lord, and
took him for my God and Portion. I hope
in the Lord that I was ſincere and upright.
I found ſome Eaſe and Quiet in my Mind
afterwards. O that I may not now grow
careleſs, but live anſwerably, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I have renewed my Covenant with the
Lord! and if he hath in any wiſe ſpoke
Peace to my Soul, let me not again return
to Folly, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. 1676, July</hi> 27. Looking over my
Book where I enter at Night how it is with
me every Day, I find I have been out of
order many times in Duty, ſince the Trial
of my ſelf mentioned here, but hope I
did deſire to have my Heart with God.
And the Lord was pleaſed ſometimes in
Duty to draw out my Soul in earneſt
and hearty Deſires after him: My Heart,
through Mercy, hath been ſometimes (tho'
too ſeldom) in a good Frame; the Lord
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37242:31"/>
have Mercy on me, and grant I may be
ſincere and upright with him. He is
pleaſed ſtill (as for many Years paſt) to
withdraw from me, and I do not meet
with much Comfort in his Ordinances.
But I remember what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> uſed to ſay,
that <hi>Grace is better than Comfort.</hi> God
grant that I may make ſure of <hi>Grace,</hi> and
act and exerciſe <hi>Grace,</hi> and wait upon him
for <hi>Comfort.</hi> It is worth waiting for all
the Days of my Life: The Lord help me,
tho' I ſit in Darkneſs and ſee no Light, to
truſt in the Lord, and ſtay my ſelf on my
God. The Lord help me to keep up
Faith and Hope in him, through Chriſt, to
wait and truſt, and hope, and believe ſtill;
againſt Hope of Senſe, to believe in Hope
of a Promiſe. The Lord make me care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to mind his Glory, and doing my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Place in which he hath ſet me;
for I am apt to be troubled, leſt I ſhould
fail of my Duty towards thoſe committed
to my Charge. The Lord in Mercy grant
I may ſet to his Work with all my Might,
and get my Work done before my Day of
Life be ended; and that my Heart may
be throughly taken off from this World,
and I may prepare for publick Calamities,
which are much feared, by reaſon of the
abounding of all Sin and Wickedneſs more
and more. The Lord enable me to do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37242:31"/>
and ſuffer his Will, and let me have his
Preſence, and his Promiſe made good,
not to ſuffer me to be tempted above
what he will inable me to bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
13. and that I may readily let all go for
Chriſt, if I am called to it. The Lord
grant I may be made meet to be Partaker
of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,
and get my Evidences for Heaven ready,
which, through the Aſſiſtance and Help of
God, I deſire to go about. The Lord
grant I may not be deceived, but may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>ſuch Evidences</hi> as will hold out, and
bear me up in the midſt of Troubles, and
Trials, yea, in the Hour of Death, and the
Day of Judgment. The Lord in infinite
Mercy ſanctifie to me the Death of others:
God hath of late taken away many of
my Neighbours, Acquaintance, Friends, and
Relations, Miniſters as well as others (a
little while ſince Mr. <hi>Pledger</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wells</hi>
in one Day.) O that all may be ſanctified,
and eſpecially the Death of my <hi>Wife,</hi> that
I may yet make ſuch uſe of that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as the Lord would expect; and be
ready and prepared for my own Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hence, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe my
dear God and Father to call me home.</p>
               <p>Being now about to enter here, what I
have to ſhew for a Work of Grace in my
Heart, and a Right and Title to Heaven,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37242:32"/>
I deſire of the Lord to help me in this
great Affair, that I may not be deceived;
but that what I here enter may be the
true State of my Soul, and that which
will hold out, and yield me Comfort in
an Hour of Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>It hath been in my Thoughts ſeveral times
to enquire what I had to ſhew for my Hope
of Heaven; that which ran moſt in my Mind
was <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Search of my Heart, I hope I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For <hi>Faith:</hi> If I have true Faith, I
ſhall certainly be ſaved, ſo ſaith the holy
Scriptures, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
Joh. 3. 16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but
have Everlaſting Life.</hi> Now <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi>
is deſcribed in the Aſſemblies Catechiſm
to be <hi>a ſaving Grace, whereby we receive
and reſt upon Chriſt alone for Salvation, as
he is offered to us in the Goſpel,</hi> which I
hope I deſire to do: I hope I do moſt
heartily deſire to take Chriſt on his own
Terms, as <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> in all
his Offices, and am willing to be <hi>ruled</hi> by
him as well as <hi>ſaved</hi> by him: I hope I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and own no other Saviour but him.
I hope I have the Faith of Reliance, to
reſt and center in Chriſt. I hope I can with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37242:32"/>
all my Soul throw my ſelf upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God in Chriſt; and if I periſh, to
periſh there, truſting in him that I ſhall
not periſh. Bleſſed be God! I am often
lifting up my Heart to Chriſt; <hi>O my dear
Jeſus! Bleſſed Jeſus!</hi> on thee, on thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
I reſt, when I am in Fears; and Doubts,
and Troubles. I hope I deſire to ſay with
the Church, <hi>In the Lord have I Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Strength:</hi> Righteouſneſs for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and Strength for Sanctification,
and the ſubduing of Sin. I hope I deſire
to renounce any Truſt in my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and Duties, and wholly to rely
and reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt. When I have
performed any Duty, I deſire to own that
I deſerve Hell for the ſinful Imperfections
of it; yea, for the beſt Duty I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form:
And to have my Truſt only in the
Death and Merits, Satisfaction and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Chriſt. Tho' Spiritual Pride is
very apt to riſe in me, yet I hope I do not
allow it, the Lord ſet my Heart more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. I hope I deſire with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Phil. 3. 9. to be found in him, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my own Righteouſneſs, which is of the
Law, but that which is through the Faith
of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of
God by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope <hi>Chriſt is precious to me,</hi> now that
is an Evidence of Faith; 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 7. To you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37242:33"/>
that believe he is precious.</hi> I hope I deſire
to prize Chriſt above all the World; and
<hi>if I know my Heart, I would not part with
the Hopes I have by Chriſt of Heaven for
ten thouſand Worlds.</hi> I hope I deſire to
prize Jeſus Chriſt, as the Chiefeſt of ten
thouſand, altogether lovely. The Lord
make me upright in this Matter, that I
may ſee the Worth and Excellency that is
in him, ſo as to be in love with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly:</hi> For <hi>Repentance:</hi> If I have that
Grace, I am ſure to be ſaved; <hi>Acts 3. 19.
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that
your Sins may be blotted out, when the Times
of refreſhing ſhall come from the Preſence
of the Lord.</hi> Luke 13. 3. <hi>Except ye repent,
ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> therefore if we
do repent, we ſhall not periſh. Now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is deſcribed to be a ſaving Grace,
<hi>whereby a Sinner, out of the true ſenſe of his
Sin, and apprehenſion of the Mercy of God
in Chriſt, doth with grief and hatred of his
Sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpoſe
of, and endeavours after new Obedience.</hi> I
hope the Lord hath wrought this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in me: I hope he hath given me a
true Sight and Senſe of Sin, and that I
am convinced of the Evil and Danger of
it. I hope I have an apprehenſion alſo of
the Mercy of God in Chriſt: I do not at
all doubt, but there is Mercy enough in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37242:33"/>
God, through Chriſt, to forgive and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the greateſt Sins, if they are repented
of. The Lord hath declared himſelf to
be <hi>the Lord God gracious and merciful, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.
34. 6. I hope I deſire to be truly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for all my Sins, to grieve and mourn
for them; tho' my Heart be hard, yet I hope
I could be glad if it were broken, that I
could mourn more for my Sins. Surely
it hath been a Trouble to me, many times,
in Confeſſion of Sin, that I could not
mourn and weep, and was not affected as
I deſired. I hope I deſire to <hi>hate Sin</hi> alſo,
the Lord work a true Hatred of all Sin
more and more in me: I hope I deſire to
turn from all Sin unto God, with full
purpoſe of Heart to cleave to him: I hope
the Bent of my Soul is right for God;
tho' I have many Failings and Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
I hope the full Purpoſe and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of my Heart is for God and his
Ways.</p>
               <p>It being upon my Mind what I had
further to note that might be an Evidence
of Grace, I hope theſe things following,
which it pleaſed God to bring to my
Thoughts, may be ſome ground to believe
God hath wrought ſavingly upon me.</p>
               <p>Surely I do <hi>confeſs</hi> my Sins often to the
Lord in ſecret, and deſire to have my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37242:34"/>
Heart penitently affected with them, and
hope I deſire to <hi>forſake</hi> all my Sins. Now
the Scripture ſaith. 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from
all Unrighteouſnes.</hi> And <hi>Prov. 28. 13.
Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his Sins
ſhall have Mercy.</hi> I hope I do not allow
my ſelf in any Sin, but deſire Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, as well as Pardon of it; yea, the
Sin I am moſt inclined to, tho' my Heart
is often apt to go out after it, the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
it: Yet I hope it is my earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that I may have Strength againſt it.
The Lord help me to ſay with <hi>David,
Pſal. 18. 23. I was upright before him, and
kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> I hope I
deſire from my Soul to mourn for Heart-Sins,
as Hardneſs and Deadneſs, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
and Diſtractions in Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
hope this is a good Sign that I <hi>am</hi> (if my
Heart deceives me not) <hi>really troubled for
ſecret Sins which the World knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of;</hi> and that <hi>I do not allow ſinful
Thoughts.</hi> I hope I deſire to mourn for
the Sins of the Land, and to lay to Heart
the great Diſhonours done to God by
<hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope there is a Change wrought in
me, and that I am <hi>a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 17. If I am <hi>a new Creature,</hi> then I am
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37242:34"/>
                  <hi>in Chriſt:</hi> I hope ſo, becauſe there are ſuch
ſtrivings and fightings in me againſt Sin,
ſuch ſtrugglings between the Fleſh and
the Spirit. There is certainly a reſiſting
of Sin, if my Heart do not wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me. Now Mr. <hi>N.</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>It is
true Grace to reſiſt Sin, it is ſtrong Grace
to conquer Sin.</hi> I conſider how it was with
<hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. he ſaith there was <hi>a Law
in his Members warrings againſt the Law
of his Mind; and the Evil that he would
not do, that he did:</hi> Methinks it is ſo with
me ſometimes; I hope this ſtriving and
ſtruggling is a Sign I am not dead in Sins
and Treſpaſſes; for a dead Man ſtrives
not, moves not. I beg of God often and
heartily, that I may be ſincere and upright,
and hope I have from my Heart many
times pray'd with <hi>David,</hi> that God would
ſearch me and try me in Mercy, and find
out if there be any way of Wickedneſs in
me, if there be any Sin that lies hid in my
Soul; and have been glad when Miniſters
have come to <hi>Examination,</hi> that ſo I might
try my ſelf, eſpecially in my younger
Years, when I heard Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and uſed to
try my ſelf by Characters, that he laid
down; and have then found Comfort and
great Hopes of a Work of Grace wrought
in me; and wondered how thoſe that
heard that Soul-awakening Miniſter could
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37242:35"/>
bear it, if they did not find God had been
at work in their Souls. I do remember,
when I was young, what Delight I took
in hearing that good Man, and have been
as it were in a Corner of Heaven; I have
often had my Heart quickned, warmed, and
much drawn out to God. Now, tho' to
my Shame I may write it, I have abated
much in my Zeal and Love to God and
his Ways, ſince I have had more to do
with the World, and a Family to provide
for; yet I deſire to remember the Days of
old, the Years of the Right Hand of the
moſt High, and hope I may take Comfort
from the Experience I have had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
remembering where Grace is once
wrought, it ſhall never be extinguiſhed;
whom Chriſt loves once, he loves to the
end; and that God never repents that he
gives Grace to any.</p>
               <p>I hope, tho' by my Sins I have cauſed
the Lord much to depart from me for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, that I do not meet with ſuch
Quickning and Comfort in Duties as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
yet that I do not content my ſelf
in this Condition, but deſire to have my
Soul follow hard after God, to lament
after him; and do I hope, prize a Smile
from him, and the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
above the whole World; and do
often pray with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. <hi>When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37242:35"/>
ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? that
God would lift up the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon me.</hi> And I deſire with the
Spouſe, to ſeek him whom (I hope I may
ſay at leaſt) my Soul deſires to love. I
hope it is a good Sign that I have frequent
Thoughts of God, and do often lift up
my Heart to him; as when I lie down at
Night, and awake in the Morning, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
my firſt and laſt Thoughts may be with
God; I hope I may ſay with <hi>David, I deſire
to ſet the Lord always before me,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8.</p>
               <p>I hope I am deſirous and willing to
yield Obedience to all the Commandments
of God, and not to pick and chuſe: I hope
I would not allow my ſelf in the Omiſſion
of any Duty. Now Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye are
my Diſciples if ye do whatſoever I command
you,</hi> Joh. 15. 14. I hope I have from my
Heart prayed many times that God would
make known to me how I ſhould walk to
pleaſe him. I hope I deſire patiently to
continue in well-doing, and to wait upon
God, tho' I do not meet with him. Now
there is a Promiſe of Bleſſedneſs to them
that wait for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 18. and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is, <hi>Rom. 2. 7. To them, who by patient
continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory,
and Honour, and Immortality, that God would
give Eternal Life.</hi> I hope I deſire my Will
may be according to God's Will, and would
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37242:36"/>
do better than I do. Now if I am but
really willing, tho' I have many Failings,
and fall infinitely ſhort, yet it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.
8. 12. Where there is a willing Mind, it is
accepted according to what a Man hath, and
not according to what he hath not.</hi> And our
Saviour ſpeaks graciouſly to his Diſciples
when he found them aſleep, <hi>Mat. 26. 41. The
Spirit truly is willing, but the Fleſh is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope I deſire to be merciful to them
who are in Miſery, and have ſometimes
been glad of an Opportunity (tho', the
Lord forgive, too backward at other
times.) Now our Lord ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are
the Merciful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy,</hi>
Mat. 5. 7. I hope I deſire to cleanſe my
ſelf from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to have my Heart purified. Now it
is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart, for
they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. 8. I hope I have
counted the Coſt, what it may coſt me to
be a Chriſtian indeed, and am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in the Strength of Chriſt to let all
go for him. It is my Deſire and earneſt
Prayer (I hope from my very Heart) that
if God call me to it, I may be enabled
to lay down my Life for his ſake. Now
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that forſakes Houſes, or
Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother,
or Wife, or Children, or Lands for his Name's
ſake, ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37242:36"/>
Everlaſting Life,</hi> Mat. 19. 29. and <hi>he
that loſeth his Life ſhall find it.</hi> I hope I
deſire, if I am called to it, to bear the Croſs
as well as receive the Crown. Now it is
ſaid, <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign
with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12. Theſe things it
pleaſed God to bring to my Mind as ſome
ground of Hope that my State is good. I
enter'd theſe things here, <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. 1676.</p>
               <p>Now my Intention is, if it pleaſe God,
to make uſe of other Helps, and ſearch
my Heart by them, and enter them down
here, that I may have reſort to them in a
time of need; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Lord help me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this great Work of <hi>Self-Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that I may not be deceived for the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>Having endeavoured to ſearch my
Heart throughly, after earneſt Prayer to
God, I hope I find the Evidences of Grace
in me that Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> hath laid down,
which are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. Where there is true Grace, there is a
hearty Willingneſs to part with every Sin.
Where ever there is this Breach made
between Sin and the Soul, it is Grace that
hath made it. When Sin hath loſt the
Will, it hath loſt the Man; when Chriſt
hath gained the Will, he hath gained the
Man. <hi>Give me thy Heart,</hi> is the ſame as,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37242:37"/>
Be willing to be mine. Reaſon ſaith, I
ought to turn; Conſcience ſaith, I muſt
turn, and yet nothing may follow: But
when the Heart ſaith, <hi>I will turn to God,</hi>
then the Work is done. Reaſon ſaith,
Theſe Idols ought not to ſtand; Conſcience
ſaith, Theſe Luſts muſt be ſubdued: But
when the <hi>Will</hi> ſaith to them, Get you
hence, there is a Work of Grace begun.
This Willingneſs diſcovers it ſelf to be
<hi>prevailing.</hi>—Firſt, When a man is truly
willing to part with Sin, there will be
<hi>Reſolutions</hi> againſt it, he takes part with
God againſt Sin, and uſes all Means for
the conquering of it.—Secondly, This
Reſolution will bring forth <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> An
Heart weary of Sin will fall to ſtriving
againſt Sin, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The Fleſh luſteth
againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the
Fleſh; thoſe two are contrary one to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Where ever there is true Grace,
there is a preferring in the Eſteem and
Choice, of a ſtrict and ſincere Godly Life;
above any other Life in the World. Tho'
the fooliſh World runs a madding after
Money and Pleaſure, ſpend their Days,
waſte their Lives, proſtitute their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
throw away their Souls upon
theſe things; yet one Drachm of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
one Day ſpent in the Fear of the
Lord, is better than all this; <hi>Pſal. 4. 6.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37242:37"/>
There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us
any good? But, Lord, lift thou up the Light
of thy Countenance on me,</hi> ſaith a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul. <hi>Thou haſt put Gladneſs in my
Heart, more than in the time when their
Corn and Wine increaſed,</hi> Pſal. 17. 14, 15.
<hi>The Men of the World have their Portion
in this Life, their Bellies thou filleſt with
thy hid Treaſure; they are full of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and leave the reſt of their Subſtance
to their Babes: But as for me, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy Face in Righteouſneſs; I ſhall be
ſatisfied when I awake in thy Likeneſs.</hi> The
Men of this World as they <hi>ſeek,</hi> ſo they
<hi>have</hi> their Portion in this Life. They have
a gallant time of it here, great Portions,
great Proſperity, enough to ſpend on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and leave to their Children after
them; this they have, and much good
may it do them; let me but behold the
Face of God in Righteouſneſs, walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord in my Integrity, keep a good
Conſcience, live in the Obedience of his
Will, and in the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and then let them take the Corn
and Wine, and what elſe they can get.
<hi>Let the Lord be mine,</hi> and I ſhall never
envy them their Portion; <hi>Pſal. 119. 30.
I have choſen the way of Truth:</hi> V. 111.
<hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as my Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for ever.</hi> Obſerve, 1. That a Godly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37242:38"/>
Man's ſettled Judgment is, That a Godly
Life is the beſt and happieſt Life. 2. That
a Godly Man's Choice is according to his
Judgment: He eſteems the Fear of the Lord
above Gold, and he chooſes it before Gold:
He is better pleaſed and doth rather take
up with the meaneſt and moſt afflicted
Condition in a way of Holineſs, than with
the moſt plentiful and proſperous Eſtate
in a way of Sin: He prefers the Poverty
of Chriſt before the Riches of the World.
3. Godly Men and Worldly Men may be
known one from the other, by the <hi>Choice</hi>
they make for themſelves; he that makes
a Worldly Choice is a Worldly Man,
and he that makes a Godly Choice is a
Godly Man.</p>
               <p>3. Whoſoever hath true Grace, doth
actually live a Godly Life: The Tree is
beſt known by its Fruit; the Sincerity of
our Purpoſes by our Performances. <hi>He
that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 7. A Godly Man makes Godlineſs the
Buſineſs of his Life. Religion is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's
Trade: A Man's Trade is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Work, and not the Exerciſe of now
and then a Day or two. Godlineſs is a
Chriſtian's daily Walk: Do not inquire
only about your Affections, what your
Deſires are, or what your Joys are, what
your Comforts are, or what your Peace
is, but what your <hi>Paths</hi> are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:37242:38"/>
                  <hi>When all comes to all, this is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Mark,</hi> He that hath Righteouſneſs is
righteous, he that doth not Righteouſneſs
is not of God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> in his <hi>Sincere Convert,</hi>
lays down three Marks, wherein a Child
of God goes beyond a Hypocrite; and I
having examined my Heart, hope I find
them in me.</p>
               <p>1. No Hypocrite, or Unregenerate
Man, tho' he goes never ſo far, let him
do never ſo much, but <hi>he lives in one Sin
or other,</hi> ſecret or open, little or great:
Now I hope in the Lord, I do not live in
any Sin.</p>
               <p>2. No Hypocrite, no Unregenerate
Man, ever came to be <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> and
to be carried off from all Duties unto
Chriſt, in regard of Dependance and Truſt.
If it were poſſible for them to forſake and
break looſe for ever from all Sin, yet here
they ſtick. They ſeek to ſave themſelves
by their Duties without Chriſt. Now if
my Heart doth not very much deceive
me, I deſire to renounce all Things, and
reſt only on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. If any Unregenerate Man come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, he never takes up his Reſt in
Chriſt <hi>only;</hi> but he would have Chriſt
and the World too, is not content with
Chriſt alone. But I hope I deſire to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37242:39"/>
                  <hi>content with Chriſt alone;</hi> and to ſay, as
the Martyr, <hi>None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>D.</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
to prove that one hath a Principle
of Spiritual Life, and is not dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
and Sins, writes thus: Canſt thou
groan and cry to the Lord for an Intereſt
in Chriſt, and will nothing quiet and ſtill
thee but Jeſus Chriſt? Then ſurely thou
doſt <hi>live;</hi> all the Creatures cannot quiet
thee, till thou haſt Hopes that Chriſt is
formed in thee. Surely I find this Sign
of Spiritual Life in me. <hi>Again,</hi> Doſt
thou <hi>grow?</hi> It may be thou canſt not ſay
thou haſt more Grace; but this thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
thou haſt more Deſires after Grace;
that is, more Grace. Art thou not only
thankful for a little Grace, but art reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after more? Doſt thou grow more
weary of thy Sin, and more earneſt after
Chriſt? I hope in the Lord it is thus
with me, that I am more weary of Sin,
and deſire more Grace: Now Growth is
a Sign of Life. <hi>Again,</hi> Put this Queſtion
to thy ſelf, Do I hunger and thirſt after
Chriſt? This is an Evidence of Spiritual
Life: Dead Men do not hunger and thirſt
after Chriſt. Now I hope in the Lord I
do hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, and
nothing but himſelf will content me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37242:39"/>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Ask thy Soul, Do I love God
and Chriſt, or do I not? Theſe Marks
he gives of Love to Chriſt. <hi>Lord! I love
thee;</hi> for I am grieved at thy Abſence,
and am rejoiced at thy Preſence. <hi>Lord!
I love thee,</hi> for I love thoſe that are like
Thee. <hi>O my Lord! I love thee;</hi> for I love
the Place and Duties where thou art wont
to meet thy People, and warm their Hearts;
but if thou art not there, I cannot take
up contentedly with them. <hi>Lord!</hi> I
humbly ſay, <hi>I love thee;</hi> for I dare not
deny but I am grieved, when thou art
diſhonoured by my ſelf or others; tho' I
grieve for this leſs than I ſhould, becauſe
I love thee leſs than I ought. <hi>Lord! I
love thee;</hi> for I deſire to have an Heart
that ſhould be willing to part with all
for thee; things ſinful in themſelves at
all times, and things lawful when thou
calleſt me to it. Once more I humbly
ſay, <hi>I love thee;</hi> for I would have an
Heart to love, and long, and look for thy
Coming and Appearance in Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>directing to try our Title
to Heaven, adviſeth,</hi> Firſt, <hi>To write down
the Scripture-Marks or Grace or Glory,
and mentions theſe ſeveral Scriptures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
1 Joh.</hi> 2. 3. Hereby we know that
we know him, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. For our rejoicing is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37242:40"/>
this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that
in Godly Simplicity and Sincerity we have
had our Converſation in the World. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
3. 9, 10. Whoſoever is born of God ſinneth
not, becauſe his Seed abideth in him; neither
can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God. In
this the Children of God are manifeſt, <hi>&amp;c.
1 Joh.</hi> 4. 13. Hereby we know that we dwell
in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given
us of his Spirit. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. We know
that we have paſſed from Death to Life,
becauſe we love the Brethren. <hi>James</hi> 1.
12. There is a Crown of Life the Lord
hath promiſed to them that love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But above all, obſerve theſe Texts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
as containing the ſpecial Goſpel-Conditions,
to which we find ſo often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
the Promiſe of Juſtification and
Glorification. Joh.</hi> 3. 16. God ſo loved
the World, that he gave his only begotten
Son; that whoſoever believeth in him,
ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24. He that believeth, hath Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Life, and ſhall not come into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
but is paſſed from Death unto
Life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. And this is the Will of
him that ſent me, that every one that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Son, and believeth in him, may have
Everlaſting Life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. Theſe
things are written, that ye might believe
that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37242:40"/>

               </p>
               <p>Proceed we now to put the Queſtion
to our ſelves, but be ſure to ſtate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
Let it not be, Whether there be
any Good in us at all? For ſo we ſhall err
on the one hand; nor yet, Whether we
have ſuch and ſuch a degree and meaſure
of Grace? For ſo we ſhall err on the other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37242:41"/>
hand: But, Whether, according to the
fore-mentioned Scriptures, ſuch and ſuch
a ſaving Grace be in us or not? Now I
having begged of God his Help to try the
State of my Soul by what follows, this
<hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1676. and I do hope I find
the true Marks of ſaving Grace in my
Soul, and deſire here to enter them down,
that I may have recourſe to it in time of
need, and the Lord grant I be ſincere.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> haſt thou reſpect to, and
doſt obſerve all God's Commandments?
Doſt thou keep the Law in Truth and
Sincerity, tho' not in gradual Perfection?
Doſt thou know God in part, and love
God truly by a ſincere Obedience? Doſt
thou keep the Commandments in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Senſe? And wherein thou fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
doſt thou acknowledge thy Failings,
and rely upon Chriſt for Pardon? Is thy
univerſal Obedience internal and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as well as external? Is thy Delight in
the Law of God after the Inward Man?
Is thy Obedience to the Duties of both
Tables? Doſt thou make Conſcience of
particular Duties in every Relation?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> haſt thou Sincerity and
Uprightneſs of Heart? Is there a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Change of the whole Man by the Grace
of God? Doſt thou do what is good upon
this account, becauſe God commands it?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37242:41"/>
not becauſe it will agree with thy Ends
and Advantage, but becauſe God hath
required it? Art thou diligent and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
in ſecret Duties to perform them?
and in Spiritual or Heart Sins, and ſecret
Luſts, to avoid them? Doſt thou ſerve
God in Spirit? Doſt thou eye God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in private or publick? Doſt thou ſet
thy ſelf zealouſly againſt thoſe Sins thou
art moſt inclined unto? Doſt thou hate
Sin moſt in thy ſelf, and in thoſe that are
neareſt unto thee? Haſt thou reſpect to
all God's Commandments? but yet to the
Duties of the firſt Table before the ſecond,
to the Commands of greater Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe of leſſer Duties? Or if in all
theſe Particulars thou findeſt not ſuch an
Uprightneſs as hath no Deceit or Falſhood,
or carnal Reſpects, at all joined with it,
(for as all other Graces are but in part, ſo
are we <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> but <hi>in part</hi>)
art thou humbled under thy Hypocriſie
and ſpiritual Guile? And doſt thou truſt
only to Chriſt? And doſt thou cry, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did, for <hi>Truth in the inward Parts?</hi>
Doſt thou obſerve the Frame of thy Heart
in thoſe things which none but God knows?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Doſt thou oppoſe
and abſtain from Sin? And is this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
and Abſtinence ſettled and
fixed in thy Heart, not only for ſome Fits
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37242:42"/>
and Seaſons, but is it the habitual Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of thy Soul? Is there in thee a
Difficulty, yea a kind of Impoſſibility to
ſin with <hi>Wilfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>purpoſed Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
or with ſuch an univerſal Conſent
of Soul as wicked Men do? And doth
this Impoſſibility to Sin ariſe from a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Work of Grace within, and not from
any terrible Reſtraint upon thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
without? Doſt thou in good meaſure
and by degrees not only leave outward
groſs Sins, but even conquer and crucifie
the inward Body of Sin? Doſt thou op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and leave Sin, becauſe of the evil
Nature of Sin, becauſe it is contrary to
God? Is the Bent and Inclination of thy
Heart againſt Sin univerſally? Doſt thou,
with <hi>Paul,</hi> bewail the evil Motions of thy
Heart? Doſt thou, with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> humble
thy ſelf for the Pride of thy Heart? Is
<hi>Pride,</hi> Unbelief, Earthlineſs, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Luſts of thy Soul diſcovered and
crucified? Doſt thou abhor ſecret Sins as
well as publick? and fear God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thy Sins more than all the
Worlds? Doſt thou abhor and lament
Defects in holy Ordinances, as well as
groſs Sins, Neglects of holy Duties, Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs
and Diſtractions therein? Doſt
thou not only oppoſe Sin in thy ſelf, but
ſet againſt it in others? Doſt thou chooſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37242:42"/>
rather to ſuffer Affliction with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, than to ſin againſt God? Art
thou ſuch an one, that thou canſt not ſin
as others, thou dareſt not ſin, thou haſt
an Averſeneſs to Sin? Doſt thou not live
in a courſe of known Sins, thou ſinneſt
not out of Malice, nor makeſt a Trade
of Sin?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Doſt thou perform Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſpiritually? Are thy Motives and
Ends ſpiritual in thy ſpiritual Actions,
ſuch as the Command of God, injoying
of Communion with God, the Light of
his Countenance, Increaſe of Grace? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Is there Zeal, Fervency, Activity in thy
Performance of Duties? Is there in thee
a free Inclination to the Duties that God
requireth? Are there in thee ſtrong Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and Combats againſt the Fleſh,
and unregenerate Part?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Doſt thou love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
Doſt thou love them becauſe of
the Image of God in them? Doſt thou
love them becauſe they are godly? Doſt
thou love all the Godly, Rich and Poor,
High and Low, but them moſt of all that
excel moſt in Purity and Godlineſs? Art
thou ready and willing to own them <hi>as
Brethren,</hi> and to join with them in time of
<hi>Perſecution?</hi> Haſt thou an holy Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Sinners? an Impatiency and holy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37242:43"/>
Grief at the Wickedneſs of others? Doſt
thou procure all ſpiritual Good to the
Brethren as thou art able? Doſt thou
pray for them, exhort them, provoke them
to Good? Doſt thou bear their Burdens,
and forbear their Infirmities? And if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
thou findeſt ſome Envyings, ſome
Impatiencies towards ſome of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
(for in the beſt is Imperfection of
Grace) yet is thy Soul troubled at this?
Doſt thou pray down theſe Sins in thy
Heart? and art thou at no reſt till it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
with thee? Art thou not aſham'd
to be call'd one of the Believers, one of
the holy Brethren in time of Perſecution?</p>
               <p>6. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Doſt thou love Chriſt?
Doſt thou evidence this Love by keeping
his Commandments, and by accepting of
his Rebukes? Is thy Love to Chriſt a ſtrong
and laſting, ever-living and continuing
Love? Doſt thou love him in Sincerity?
Cannot many Waters of Affliction quench
this thy Love, nor the Floods of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
drown it? Is thy Love a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Love, ſurpaſſing all other Love?
Doth the Love of Father, Mother, Wife,
Son, Daughter, Brother, Siſter, yea, and
of thy own Life alſo, give place to this
Love? Doth Chriſt ſit in the Throne of
thy Heart, and do all theſe ſit below at
the Foot-ſtool? Doſt thou bear ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37242:43"/>
warm Affections to Chriſt, that thou
wouldſt be content to part with all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than part with him? Canſt thou ſay
with <hi>David, The Lord is my Portion, and
whom have I in Heaven but thee? and
whom on Earth that I deſire in compariſon
of thee?</hi> The World, it may be, will be
ſometimes creeping into thy Affections,
thou can'ſt not be quite free from the
Love of the World; yet doſt thou, in thy
ordinary, ſettled, prevailing Judgment,
and Affections, prefer Chriſt before all
things in the World? Doſt thou make
Chriſt the End of thy Deſires, the very
Reaſon why thou heareſt and prayeſt?
Doſt thou firſt ſeek the Kingdom of Chriſt
and his Righteouſneſs? If thou doſt not
ſeek it ſo zealouſly as thou ſhould'ſt, yet
hath it the Chief of thy Deſires and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours?
And is nothing elſe deſired and
preferred before it? Is thy Valuation of
it ſo high, that thou would'ſt not exchange
thy Title to it, and Hopes of God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
for any Worldly Good whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?
Nay, art thou willing to labour and
ſuffer for it; and tho' the fleſh may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhrink or draw back, yet art thou
reſolved and content to go through all?</p>
               <p>7. <hi>O my Soul!</hi> Doſt thou believe in the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Doſt thou find that
thou art naturally a loſt condemned Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37242:44"/>
and doſt thou believe that Jeſus
Chriſt is the Mediator, who hath made
a ſufficient Satisfaction to the Law; and
conſidering that in the Goſpel he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Exception to All, doſt thou
heartily conſent that he, and he alone ſhall
be thy Saviour? Art thou content to take
him for thy King, to govern and guide
thee by his Laws and Spirit? Art thou
willing to obey him, even when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the hardeſt Duties, and thoſe which
moſt croſs the Deſires of the Fleſh? Is it
thy Sorrow when thou breakeſt thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
herein, and thy Joy when thou
keepeſt cloſe in Obedience to him? And
tho' the World and Fleſh do ſometimes
intice and over-reach thee, yet is it thy
ordinary Deſire and Reſolution to obey,
ſo that thou wouldſt not change thy
Lord and Maſter for all the World?</p>
               <p>By theſe things he adviſeth to try, and
bring our Hearts to anſwer; ſuffer them
not to be ſilent, nor to think of other
Matters: If any Queſtion be hard, through
the Darkneſs of our Hearts, yet do not
give it over, but ſearch the cloſer, and
ſtudy the caſe the more exactly; and, if
it be poſſible, let not our Hearts give over,
till we have reſolved the Queſtion, and
told us off or on in what caſe we are; yea,
wreſtle with thy Heart till thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37242:44"/>
and ſay, I will not let thee go till
thou haſt anſwered. He that can prevail
with his own Heart, ſhall alſo be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer
with God.</p>
               <p>When we have diſcovered the Truth of
our State, then paſs the Sentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
A meer Examination will do us
little good, if we proceed not to a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Conclude as we find, either we
are true Believers, or we are not; either
we have a Title to Heaven, or that we
have not; but paſs not this Sentence with
Self-Flattery, nor from Melancholy Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Fears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> Not with Self-flattery. Alas! what
will it profit us to think our ſelves the
Children of God, when we viſibly expreſs
the Power of Sin and Satan in our Lives?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> On the other ſide, paſs not this
Sentence from Melancholy Unbelief, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and Fears. As the carnal Man fails
the former way, ſo the tempted Chriſtian
ſometimes fails this way. In this Caſe
run we over our Evidences again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and proceed we from thoſe that are
more difficult to thoſe that are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
One Sign perhaps may be more eaſily
perceived than another; and if we can
but diſcover <hi>ſome,</hi> yea, if but <hi>one,</hi> we may
aſſuredly gather all the reſt are there.</p>
               <p>Come then, paſs on now to <hi>Sentence:</hi> O,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37242:45"/>
but implore the Spirit's Aſſiſtance; now, if
ever, let us deſire him to ſhine on our
Graces, and then ſpeak groundedly and
deliberately, and truly, as we find, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our very Conſciences! Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
as ſome do, I am a good Chriſtian;
or as others do, I am a Reprobate, or an
Hypocrite, and ſhall be damned. When
we have <hi>no ground</hi> for what we ſay, but
our own Fancy, or Hopes, or Fears: let
not our Judgment be any way biaſs'd or
brib'd from ſentencing aright.</p>
               <p>Then he further adviſeth, That we
ſhould labour to get our Hearts kindly
affected with its diſcovered Condition,
according to the Sentence paſs'd on it. Do
not think enough to <hi>know,</hi> but labour
to <hi>feel</hi> what God hath made us to ſee, if
we find our ſelves <hi>renewed</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi>
indeed. O let us get this warm and cloſe
to our Hearts! bethink our ſelves what a
bleſſed Eſtate hath the Lord brought us
into, to be his Children, his Friends; to
be pardoned, juſtified, and entitled to
Life! Why? what is it we now need to
fear, but ſinning againſt him! Come War,
or Plague, or Sickneſs, or Death, we are
ſure they can but thruft us into Heaven.
Thus let us follow theſe Meditations till
they have left their Impreſſions on our
Hearts. Then he adviſeth to record this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37242:45"/>
Sentence ſo paſſed, to write it down,
which now I deſire to do this <hi>18th.</hi> of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1676.</p>
               <p>Having ſearched and tried my Heart
yeſterday, and at this time alſo, after I
hope earneft and hearty Prayer to God,
for the help of his Spirit to try my State
and Condition, I did fall again to the
Work of Self-trial by the fore-mentioned
Particulars; and tho' I cannot fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
a poſitive Anſwer to <hi>every Queſtion,</hi>
yet, if my Heart doth not very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me, I can to <hi>moſt</hi> of them; I hope
I can, I beg of God I may not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
It is ſome Comfort to me, where I
cannot ſo fully anſwer ſome of them; I
hope I can truly ſay, I moſt heartily deſire
it may be ſo with me. And tho' Grace be
very weak in me, (which I hope I deſire
to be humbled and mourn for) yet I dare
not deny God's Work in me; I muſt not
deny the Day of ſmall-Things, but to the
Glory of God muſt own, ſurely there is
ſomething of Good wrought in me by his
Holy Spirit. And my Comfort is, <hi>Christ
will not quench the ſmoaking Flax, nor break
the bruiſed Reed,</hi> Mat. 12. 20. I am not now
affected with the Diſcovery of my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as I ſhould, and do not find at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
inward Comfort in my Soul; I am
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37242:46"/>
and have been much under the With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings
of God for a time, by reaſon
of my Apoſtacy and Backſlidings from
him, and not walking cloſely with him;
yet I deſire, I hope, <hi>to lament after the Lord,</hi>
and not content my ſelf, till I again meet
with him. The Lord give me Grace to
<hi>wait</hi> on him in a way of Duty, and to act
Grace, tho' I want Comfort. O if I am
but ſincere, and wait ſtill upon God, who
can tell but he may return with Comfort
to my poor Soul! The Lord help me to
maintain Faith and Hop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through Chriſt,
<hi>Tho' I ſit in Darkneſs and ſee no Light, yet
to truſt in the Lord and ſtay my ſelf on my
God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. The Lord help me now
to walk anſwerable to the great Things
he hath done for my poor Soul. I deſire
and hope I may have recourſe to this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
as I ſhall have need: And that it
may be of Comfort to me for the time to
come, as Mr. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> adviſeth: His Words
are; This Record will be very uſeful to
us hereafter: If we find we have a Work
of Grace in us, what a help will it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the next Temptation to doubting
and fear, to go and read under our Hands
this Record? May we not think, if at
ſuch a time I found the truth of Grace, is
it not likely to be now the ſame, and theſe
Doubts to come from the Enemy of my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37242:46"/>
Peace? Yet truſt not ſo to <hi>one Diſcovery</hi>
as to try no more: Eſpecially if we have
made any ſoul Defections from Chriſt, and
play'd the Backſliders, ſee then that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Search again: Neither let this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us in the daily Search of our Ways, or
of our Increaſe in Grace, and Fellowſhip
with Chriſt. It is an ill Sign; and a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vile Sin, for a Man, when he thinks
he hath found himſelf gracious, and in
a happy State, to let down his Watch, and
grow negligent of his Heart and Ways,
and ſcarce look after them any more.
Neither ſhould we give over in Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
if we cannot at once or twice,
or ten times trying, diſcover our Caſe,
but follow it on till we have diſcovered
it; if one Hour or Day will not do, take
another; if one Miniſter cannot direct
us ſufficiently, go to another; the Iſſue
will anſwer all our Pains. There is no
ſitting down diſcouraged in a Work that
muſt be done. If we have been Hypocrites,
or ungodly Perſons all our Lives, yet is
the Promiſe offered to us by Chriſt, and
he tenders himſelf to us, to be our Lord
and Saviour; <hi>neither can we poſſibly be ſo
willing to accept him, as he is to accept us.</hi>
Nothing but our own Unwillingneſs can
keep our Souls from Chriſt, tho' we have
hitherto abuſed him, and diſſembled with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37242:47"/>
him. O that the Lord would perſwade
us to the cloſe Performance of this ſelf-trying
Task, that we might not tremble
with Horror of Soul when the Judge of
all the World ſhall try us; but have our
Evidences ſo ready at hand, and be ſo able
to prove our Title to Heaven, that the
Thoughts and Approach of Death and
Judgment might revive our Spirits, and
fill us with Joy, and not apale us, and fill
us with Amazement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>19th.</hi> 1676. Finding my
Heart very hard and dead of late, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill under the Withdrawings of God,
but I bleſs God, I hope ſenſible of it, and
deſirous to wait upon him for Diſcoveries
of his Love and Favour, and to lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and ſeek him in his Ordinances:
(for I hope I cannot take up with Duty
without ſomething of God in it, at leaſt
ſome Quicknings and Drawings out of my
Heart after him in earneſt Deſires, and
Longings, and Pantings after him) yet I
am apt to be caſt down, my Conſcience
is apt to accuſe me, that I do not my
Duty, and am fearful leſt Death come of
a ſudden, and find me unready, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
am greatly troubled; and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to do, methinks I would not be
wanting in my Duty, and often pray that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37242:47"/>
God would ſhew me my Duty, and help
me to do it; yet when I think to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
any thing, there comes ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of things into my Mind, to do this,
and to do the other, (and all cannot be
done together) that I am ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
diſcouraged, and tempted to let all
alone. The Lord in infinite Mercy look
upon me for Chriſt's ſake, and help me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Temptation of Satan, and my
own wicked Heart, and enable me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Lord is gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and accepts of the willing Mind,
where there is Truth and Sincerity. The
Lord help me alſo to remember, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
tho' I muſt be doing, yet I am not
juſtified for it, if I could do never ſo much.
The Lord help me to renounce all, and
truſt wholly to Jeſus Chriſt for Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for Juſtification, and Salvation.
Now this Morning, being in my Shop, and
having nothing to do, (Trading being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dead) I thought with my ſelf what to
ſet about; and tho' I have examined my
ſelf before, yet knowing I cannot be too
much in this Work, I reſolved to go to it
again; and altho' I cannot ſo ſolemnly
ſearch my Heart, as if I were in ſecret,
yet I hope I find ſomething of Mr. <hi>Nal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>'s

               <p>4. Are you deſirous to have Chriſt rule
over you as well as ſave you?</p>
               <p>5. Doſt thou lament after the Lord, and

               <p>6. Do you feel Sin a Burden, and would

the Honour of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>7. Your Lives will run out in lively
actings and exerciſe of Grace upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>8. If you love Chriſt, you will not
think any thing too much to do for Chriſt,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37242:48"/>
or to part with him. <hi>If you love me,
keep my Commandments,</hi> ſaith Chriſt;
ſo that if I keep Chriſt's Commandments,
it is a Sign that I love him.</p>
               <p>Now follow <hi>ſome Characters</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Nalton</hi> laid down <hi>of true Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt;</hi> but before theſe he gives ſome
Rules to help us in trying our ſelves. 1. If
you would judge aright of your <hi>Faith,</hi> be
ſure you do not truſt to your own Hearts.
2. Examine your Hearts when you are in
a calm, quiet, compoſed Frame. 3. Take
heed you do not err in the nature of Faith,
to think there is <hi>no true Faith</hi> where there
is <hi>no Aſſurance.</hi> 4. Judge not of your Faith
by ſome legal Troubles that have been in
your Spirits as a fore-runner of Faith; but
judge by the Conſequents of theſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
whether they bring Chriſt and your
Souls nearer together. 5. Tho' you muſt
judge your Faith by <hi>the Fruits</hi> of it, yet
they are in ſome of a higher degree, ſome
of a lower degree. Joy in Tribulation is
a high Fruit of Faith that every Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain unto. Let not a Man ſay, I
have no Faith, becauſe I cannot ſing in a
Priſon; but if there be but any Fruit of
Faith, that diſcovers to thee thou art <hi>a
Believer,</hi> tho' <hi>not a ſtrong Believer,</hi> thou
haſt cauſe ro rejoice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37242:49"/>
Now I hope my Deſire is to try my
ſelf by theſe Marks of <hi>true Faith</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Lord grant I may find them in
my Soul for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> True Faith may be known by the
efficient or principal Cauſe of it, which
is no other but the holy Spirit of God.
All the Angels in Heaven, and Saints on
Earth, cannot perſwade my Heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
till the Spirit of God draw my Soul
to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Now</hi> hath the Spirit of
God drawn thee to Chriſt? Have you
found the mighty Power of the Spirit of
God overcoming the Pride and Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your Wills, to make you willing
to accept of Chriſt on his own Terms?
Then you have a true Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> True Faith may be known by the
manner of Production, the Spirit of God
hath a previous, or foregoing Work upon
the Soul. 1. The Spirit of God <hi>convinces</hi>
the Sinner; this goes before believing, the
Spirit of God lets a Sinner ſee the inſide
of himſelf. Thou art a Sinner, ſaith the
Spirit of God; ſo that the poor Sinner
ſees himſelf in a loſt and undone Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in himſelf by reaſon of Sin. 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
convincing, the Spirit of God <hi>humbles</hi>
the Sinner; he is humbled to the Duſt.
This Sorrow and Humiliation is in ſome
more, in ſome leſs; but in all there is ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37242:49"/>
much Senſe of Sin and Miſery, as to drive
the Sinner out of himſelf, and to let him
ſee he muſt periſh for ever without Chriſt.
3. There is alſo an <hi>incouraging Work</hi> of
the Spirit of God; having convinced and
humbled the Sinner, he revives him by
ſome Heart-chearing Conſiderations; as,
(1.) That there is a Chriſt, an All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Saviour, by whom he may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from Wrath to come. (2.) The
Spirit of God makes a particular Proffer
of Chriſt, and Pardon, and Grace to him,
and tells him the Promiſes of the Goſpel
are made to him, as well as others; and
that God invites him, poor Sinner, and that
there is Mercy for him if he accept it.
(3.) The Spirit of God doth ſometimes
ſecretly whiſper to the Soul of a Sinner,
by a Voice within him, inviting him and
drawing him to come to Chriſt: <hi>Come to
me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
and I will give you Reſt: Ho, every one that
thirſteth, come to the Waters.</hi> Art thou a
thirſty Soul? Thou art he that is invited,
ſaith the Spirit of God; therefore ſtand
out no longer. (4.) The Spirit of God
doth work Faith by bowing the Will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it pliable, to come and taſte how
good Chriſt is. Well, ſaith the Soul, I am
reſolved to come to Chriſt, tho' I know not
how I ſhall ſpeed. I will caſt my Soul into
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37242:50"/>
the Arms of Chriſt; and if I ſink, I will
ſink with a Saviour in my Arms; I will
live or die with him. Now deal truly
with your Souls, hath the Spirit of God
wrought Faith in you in this manner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> You may know the Truth of Faith
by its vital Act, which is <hi>an hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to receive Chriſt:</hi> It is a Conjugal
Conſent that makes your Faith a true
Faith. 1. That is, when the Sinner hath
regard to his Perſon as well as his Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
2. When we receive him to be our
Lord and Husband; to be ruled by him
as well as to be redeemed by him. 3. It
excludes all other Partners, I will have
Chriſt and none but Chriſt; if I have him,
I have enough. 4. It includes all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
I am content to be his in Want
as well as in Wealth, in Adverſity as well
as Proſperity, in Temptation as well as
Conſolation; I am content to follow him
through Dirt, and Mire, and Blood.
5. Such a Man yields to Chriſt out of
Choice; a Man willingly yields to Chriſt,
he can ſay, I am thine wholly; I have
made <hi>Choice</hi> of thee to be my Portion,
my Redeemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> True Faith may be known <hi>by the
Fruits</hi> of it: Some Fruits in reference to
Chriſt, ſome in reference to our ſelves.
The Fruits in reference to <hi>Chriſt</hi> are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:37242:50"/>
1. True Faith will make you highly to
<hi>prize Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You will ſet ſuch a
Price upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that all the Beauty, and
Bravery, and Pomp, and Glory of the
World, all the Pleaſures and Treaſures
in the World will be but a heap of Dung
in compariſon of him. The Perſon of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is exceeding precious, <hi>Cant. 5. 10.
My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt
of ten thouſand; his Mouth is Sweetneſſes,
be is altogether lovely:</hi> His Blood is very
precious, his Offices very precious, his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
very precious, an Intereſt in him is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
precious: The Purchaſe of his Blood very
precious; the Inheritance incorruptible,
undefiled, that fadeth not away, is very
precious; all the Kingdoms of the World
are not worthy to be compared to it.</p>
               <p>2. True Faith will work <hi>earneſt, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
regular Deſires after Chriſt,</hi> and
Communion with him. This is certain,
where Faith is once wrought, the Soul is
reſtleſs, till it reſts in a Saviour. Theſe
<hi>Deſires</hi> after <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be known by four
Properties. (1.) By the <hi>Ardency</hi> of them;
they are not weak and ſlight Deſires, but
commanding Deſires, like the Deſires of
Hunger and Thirſt, that muſr be ſatisfied.
Tell the Soul who deſires <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he
ſhall have the World and Riches enough.
No, ſaith he, that will not content me;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37242:51"/>
give me <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or elſe I die. Tell him of
outward Comforts and Accommodations;
Theſe are not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he. (2.) By
the Activity of them: Theſe Deſires will
not be ſluggiſh, lazy Deſires, to look that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould drop into their Mouths
without looking after him. But if you
deſire <hi>Chriſt</hi> indeed, you will earneſtly
ſeek him, as a Man that is hungry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
will be ready to break through any
Difficulties for Food. (3.) By the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi>
of them. They will be prevalent
and powerful Deſires; they will make
thee content to part with ſomething for
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, I would have
thee leave ſuch a Luſt: With all my
Heart, ſaith the Soul. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith,
Follow me in any hard Duty, as the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> With all my Heart,
ſaith the Soul. <hi>Moſes</hi> was content to
part with all his Preferment for <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
he counted the Reproach of <hi>Chriſt</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Riches than the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
(4.) By the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of them. If your
Deſires are right, you will ſtill be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
more of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> you will never be
ſo ſatisfied; as to ſay you have enough of
him, but be hungring and thirſting ſtill:
<hi>Pſal. 119. 20. My Soul breaketh for the
longing it hath to thy Judgments at all
times.</hi> A man that hath taſted of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37242:51"/>
Sweetneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> O that I might taſte
more, ſaith he! There is a thouſand times
more Sweetneſs in Chriſt than ever yet
you taſted. He that ſaith he knows <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſo much, that he deſires to know no more,
I dare ſay he never taſted the Sweetneſs
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all: For the more you have
experienc'd, the more you will hunger
after him, and deſire him.</p>
               <p>3. Another Fruit of Faith in reference
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is this, It will work an earneſt,
fervent <hi>Love to Chriſt;</hi> ſo that a Believer
will love <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> above all things,
and ſay, <hi>Thy Loves are better than Wine,</hi>
Cant. 1. 2. It is ſaid the Loadſtone will
not draw Iron in the Preſence of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
ſo no outward Loadſtone of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Contentment can draw the Soul
in the Preſence of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
When a Worldly Man doth boaſt, Theſe
are my Lands, and Houſes, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
A Believer ſaith, All my Pleaſures,
and Riches, and Jewels, are in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
As <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Kings 19. 30. Let
him take all, for as much as I have ſeen the
Face of my Lord the King:</hi> So ſaith a true
Believer, Let worldly Men take all, ſo I
may ſee the Face of my Lord the King of
Saints. When a Believer can draw out
the Quinteſſence of all Creature Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and ſay the Sweetneſs of all is in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37242:52"/>
Chriſt; O how ſweet is he then to that Soul!</p>
               <p>Again: This true Faith will make a
Man love Chriſt againſt all Difficulties
and Temptations, and Diſcouragements
he can meet with in Heaven's way. What
tho' I ſuffer Reproach for Chriſt, ſaith
the Believer, yet I can love him ſtill; nay,
tho' I ſuffer the Loſs of all my Eſtate for
Chriſt, yet I can love him ſtill; nay, tho'
I ſuffer the Loſs of my Life for Chriſt,
yet I will love him ſtill. <hi>Acts 21. 13. I
am ready not only to be bound, but to die
for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> This, I confeſs,
is a high Act of Faith, but no higher than
many Martyrs have attained to: They
felt ſuch a ſtrong and unquenchable Love
in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to their Souls; therefore
their Love was ſo drawn out to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
again, which made them ready to ſuffer,
and lay down their Lives for him.</p>
               <p>Again: True Faith will make a Man
love <hi>Chriſt</hi> without outward Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
A Believer can ſay, What tho' I
want theſe outward Accommodations o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have, tho' I be as poor as <hi>Job</hi> on
the Dunghil, yet <hi>a naked Chriſt</hi> is to me
more welcome than a beautified World,
that is deck'd with all the Plenty and
Proſperity that can be imagined. As the
ſtrongeſt Believer, he that hath Aſſurance
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Love, may love <hi>Chriſt</hi> more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37242:52"/>
ſtrongly; yet it is as true, he that is the
weakeſt Believer, tho' he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be beloved of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he loves
<hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>truly</hi> as the other.</p>
               <p>4. Another Fruit of Faith, is <hi>a Fear of
offending him.</hi> True Faith would <hi>not</hi>
have <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſpleaſed; it is true, Faith
caſts out a ſlaviſh Fear; but a Fear of
Reverence and Watchfulneſs is the Fruit
of True Saving Faith.</p>
               <p>5. True Faith will work <hi>Holineſs</hi> and
<hi>new Obedience.</hi> Hence Faith is called a
<hi>moſt holy Faith,</hi> becauſe it makes us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
we are ſanctified by Faith.</p>
               <p>6. True Faith works <hi>Patience;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patience in waiting, but Patience in
ſuffering: There is a Patience in waiting
for the Accompliſhment of the Promiſes.
Faith ſaith to a Believer, The Things thou
waiteſt for are worth thy waiting for
them; the Comforts thou deſireſt, the
Crown of Glory thou expecteſt, is worth
waiting for. Again, Faith works Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in Suffering, <hi>Heb. 10. 34. They took
joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing
they had in Heaven a more enduring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
Heb. 11. 36. 37. <hi>They endured
the Trial of cruel Mockings, of Scourgings,
of Bonds, and Impriſonments: They were
ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, tempted, ſlain with
the Sword; they wandered about in Sheep-skins,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37242:53"/>
and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
tormented;</hi> and yet their Faith in
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> carried them through all
theſe Sufferings. Faith tells the Soul,
The <hi>Sufferings of this preſent Life are
not worthy to be compared with the Glory
that ſhall be revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. True Faith will work <hi>an undaunted
Profeſſion of Chriſt's Name.</hi> He will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<hi>Chriſt</hi> openly, when called to it. The
Diſciples profeſſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> when it was
Death to do ſo. <hi>I am not aſham'd of the
Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
the Reproach of <hi>Chriſt</hi> better than
the Glory of the World; and the Croſs
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> better than the Crowns of the
World: I eſteem his Crown of Thorns
better than all others in this World. <hi>I
bear about me the Marks of the Lord Jeſus,</hi>
Gal. 6. 17. he calls his Sorrows and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<hi>the Marks of Chriſt;</hi> I eſteem them
my greateſt Honour: <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I
ſhould glory in any thing but in the Croſs
of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee what Fruits
Faith works in reference to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now there are Fruits of Faith in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> as theſe following.</p>
               <p>1. True Faith works abundance of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Peace and Joy:</hi> Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being
juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God.</hi>
And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37242:53"/>
Faith tells the Soul the Bond is cancelled,
that Sin is pardoned, the Burden is taken
off, Wounds of Conſcience are healed
with the Wounds of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A Believer
can ſay, In Peace will I lay down my
Head in the Boſom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When
Storms and Waves ariſe, a Believer can
ſit in his Ark; <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is an Ark for a poor Soul, where
he is ſafe. A true Believer hath always
<hi>the Ground of Joy,</hi> tho' not always <hi>the
Exerciſe</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>2. Another Fruit of Faith in reference
to our ſelves, is <hi>Boldneſs in coming to the
Throne of Grace:</hi> We have Boldneſs and
Acceſs by Faith in <hi>Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12.
A true Believer can pour out his Soul
to God, make his Moan to his Father.
It is his comfort he can go to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Child-like Boldneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
               <p>3. Another Fruit of Faith is <hi>Contempt
of the World,</hi> Acts 4. <hi>They ſold their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
and brought the Money, and laid it
down at the Apoſtles Feet:</hi> They regarded
it no more than the Dirt under their
Feet. Faith hath an Eagle's Eye, it ſees
things a far off; and an Eagle's Wing, to
carry a Man above the Flatteries and the
Frowns of the World. By Faith <hi>Moſes
feared not the Frowns of the King,</hi> Heb. 11.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37242:54"/>
27. Faith lets a Man ſee there is better
to be found in <hi>Chriſt</hi> than in the whole
World. He that can find a World in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> will be willing to part with all
the World for Him.</p>
               <p>4. True Faith will produce <hi>a ſtrong
Deſire of ſtrengthening and encreaſing it,</hi>
and that both in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Growth.</hi> It
will make a Man ſtill be ſearching his
Heart, that he may be ſure he hath the
<hi>Truth</hi> of Faith. It makes a Man prize
a Soul-ſearching Miniſtry, that may
plough up the Fallow Ground of his
Heart: And it works a Deſire of <hi>Growth</hi>
alſo; it makes a Believer pray: <hi>Lord!
encreaſe my Faith,</hi> whether thou encreaſe
my Trade and Wealth, or no; however,
Lord, encreaſe my Faith.</p>
               <p>After I had wrote theſe Things, I went
into my Cloſet, and there begged of God
his Help and Aſſiſtance to try my ſelf by
theſe Characters, and then ſpent a little
time going over them, and trying my State
by them; and, I bleſs the Lord, I now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſay, to his Glory, that I find them
in ſome meaſure in me. I hope that thoſe
I could not ſo poſitively anſwer to, yet I
could in the Deſire of my Soul: I hope in
the Lord I am not deceived. If I am, I
beſeech him, for Chriſt's ſake, to undeceive
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37242:54"/>
me, and let me know how it is with me:
But methinks God hath begun ſome good
Work in me, and wrought Faith in my poor
Soul, tho' it is very weak. The Lord
humble me, and the Lord help me to bleſs
his holy Name for the leaſt Grace; and
earneſtly to endeavour and beg of him the
Encreaſe of it. I hope in the Lord I may
have recourſe to what I have done this
Day (and what is entred before) in a
Time of Doubts and Fears, in an Hour
of Trouble, under God's Withdrawings;
yea, that I may have Comfort from it in
an Hour of Death. The Lord grant I
may not now be ſecure and careleſs, but
that I may walk very cloſely and exactly
before him, to his Praiſe and Glory here,
till at laſt I come to live with him in his
Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> 1678. I ſpent the Day in
a Secret Faſt. One End, among others,
I propoſed to my ſelf in it, was, to
ſearch into the State of my Soul again;
alſo that I may be inabled to ſuffer for
Chriſt, if I am called to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope I deſired to be ſincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I tried my ſelf by the Marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
before ſet down: I hope I can ſay,
upon Search, that the Lord hath wrought
ſaving Grace in me; it was, I hope, my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37242:55"/>
hearty Prayer, that if it was not ſo, I
might not ſo enter it here; but I turſt the
Lord hath turned me from Darkneſs to
Light, and that I am not dead in Sins
and Treſpaſſes, but there is a Principle of
Life in me; the Lord grant I may not be
deceived. Towards the cloſe of the Day
I read over my <hi>Covenant,</hi> and hope I did
from my very Heart deſire to bewail the
Breach of it, and renew it with the
Lord; which I did, I hope, in the Strength
of his Grace: deſiring Chriſt may be my
Surety, being much affraid of my being
deceived, leſt it ſhould be with me as
heretofore. I hope I did heartily take the
Lord for my God, and give up my ſelf
unto him; and bind my ſelf to forſake all
Sin, and to live more to his Glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Covenant I entred into
with the Lord about eleven Years ſince,
(<hi>taken out of Mr.</hi> Allen<hi>'s Book.</hi>) I bleſs
God I was aſſiſted to Day in the Work I
undertook; the Lord accept of me thro'
Chriſt, and let not this Day be loſt. O
that I may not prove falſe and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
with him! but go away enabled to
live more to his Praiſe here, till I come
to be for ever with him hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> 1682. I ſpent this
Day in a Secret Faſt in my Cloſet; the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37242:55"/>
main End I propoſed to my ſelf, was, to
ſearch again my Heart, to find out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was a Work of Grace wrought
in me, or no; alſo, that I might get Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
more ſubdued, that is yet ſtrong
in me; and that I may be inabled to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for Chriſt, if I am called to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
hope I deſired to be hearty in the Work,
tho' Hardneſs and Deadneſs was too much
upon me. The Lord forgive; I hope I
may ſay, to the Glory of God, that he hath
begun that good Work in me, that he
will perfect of the Day of Chriſt: I did
earneſtly beg of the Lord that I might
not be deceived, and hope I am not. I
truſt the Lord hath pluck'd me out of a
Natural Eſtate, and turned my Heart from
Sin unto himſelf. The Lord grant I may
now live anſwerable to the great things
he hath done for me, and keep the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
I have this Day renewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> 1684. I kept as a Faſt,
and ſpent a good part of the Morning in
Secret Prayer: After Family Duty, I went
to hear a Sermon, and then back to my
Cloſet, where I ſpent the reſt of the Day.
The Ends I propoſed to my ſelf were, That
God would help me againſt Worldlineſs,
and diſtruſt of his Providence (for I have
been much troubled of late by reaſon of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37242:56"/>
many Loſſes, and Trade being fallen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to nothing) and quiet my Mind, and
enable me to truſt him, and withal, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me how to proceed as to Earthly
Things; having ſome Thoughts of leaving
this Houſe. And I deſired alſo to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Lord's Supper, and that I
might have Strength to ſuffer whatever
God ſhould call me to. And in reference
to the Publick, I deſired to ſeek God for
Mercy to his Church, and to theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>I began with reading ſome Portion of
God's Word, then examined my ſelf of
the State of my Soul, by ſome Characters
of Grace in this Book. I hope I deſired
heartily the Help of God, and earneſtly
begg'd I might give a right Judgment of
my ſelf, and was affraid of doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
I hope I may ſay to God's Glory,
Surely there is ſomewhat of a Work of
Grace that he hath graciouſly wrought
in my Soul, and that I am not dead in
Treſpaſſes and Sins. Bleſſed, O bleſſed,
be his Name!</p>
               <p>I am not affected, as I ought, but am
apt to fear ſtill, knowing my Heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.
The Lord help me to be much
in this trying Work; for I cannot make
too ſure of my Salvation. The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
Doubts and Fears, and ſtrengthen
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37242:56"/>
my Faith in him and in his Promiſes.
After <hi>Self-examination,</hi> I ſpent the reſt
of my Time in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and hope I was
hearty therein. The Lord hear my poor
Prayers for my ſelf, for my Children, and
for the Publick. I alſo read over <hi>my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
entred into with the Lord many
Years ſince, and I renewed Covenant with
God. The Lord help me to live anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and that Sin may be more ſubdued,
and Grace ſtrengthened; that I may find
the Benefit of this Day, while I live, and
be fitted for the everlaſting Enjoyment
of God in Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>February</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> 1685. I kept a Faſt
by my ſelf. The main thing I had upon
my Heart, was the low Eſtate of the
Church, and of theſe Nations; as alſo to
ſearch into the State of my Soul, to get
my Heart more taken off the World, to
have Corruption mortified, and be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to ſuffer for Chriſt, if called to it,
and never to forſake him. I bleſs God, I
had his Aſſiſtance, and hope I was hearty
in the Work; and that upon Trial I may
ſay, God hath begun a good Work, which
he will carry on and perfect to the Day
of Jeſus Chriſt. O that I might make
more ſure of Chriſt, and Grace, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
eſpecially when I can make ſure of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37242:57"/>
nothing below, but am at ſuch Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as to all outward things. The Lord
help me to live in ſome meaſure anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his great Mercies, and to keep the
Covenant with him that I have this Day
renewed.</p>
               <p>Things whereby a Man may examine
and judge of himſelf. 1. If you would
be ſaved, you muſt by deep and ſerious
Repentance forſake the World and Sin,
and turn to God in Chriſt, and firmly
believe in him. 2. You muſt reſign and
devote your ſelf to be the Lord's. 3. You
muſt take the Favour of God for your
Happineſs. 4. You muſt be diligent in
the Uſe of all holy Means and Duties.
5. You muſt ſtudy the Scriptures, to know
God's Mind, and do it. 6. The whole
Courſe of your Lives will be ſet to pleaſe
and honour God. Now examine whether
you are like to be ſaved. How is it, O
my Soul, as to theſe things? Do I go in
the broad Way, or not? Let not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
keep you from this Self-Examination;
if he can prevail for that, you may make
a great Profeſſion, and do many things,
and yet periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>Judge of thy ſelf by theſe things, and
ſeriouſly enquire; 1. Whether Eternal
Salvation have the Preheminence of your
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37242:57"/>
Eſteem and Choice, that you prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Wordly Proſperity? 2. Is the
obtaining of this Salvation, and preparing
for it, the great Buſineſs of your Lives?
3. Under the Senſe of Sin, do you give
up your ſelves to Chriſt, as the only Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
of Souls, to heal, and help, and ſave
you? 4. Is it the ſincere Deſire of your
Souls, that you may be ſaved from <hi>Sin,</hi> as
well as <hi>Hell?</hi> From the Power and Practice
of Sin, as well as from the Wrath of
God? 5. What is the Matter of thy
<hi>Comfort?</hi> Is it to converſe with God? To
look up to him with Hope of his Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Doth the Light of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
give thee more Joy than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Riches? Canſt thou ſay from
thy Heart, thou hadſt rather be poor, and
deſpiſed, and miſerable in this World,
with God's Favour, than to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Perſon in the World, and God to be
thine Enemy? Examine by ſuch Things
as theſe.</p>
               <p>O let me be in earneſt for Chriſt and
Grace, and never reſt till it be put out
of Doubt, that God in Chriſt is my God,
and that he hath made <hi>an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
with me! If this be not, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for ever! But this I muſt obtain, or
my Soul ſhall be in Bitterneſs before the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37242:58"/>
Lord while I have a Being! Nothing
ſhall comfort me while I am Graceleſs,
and without Chriſt! I am reſolved for
Him, his Grace and Favour againſt all
Denials. If God will not let me ſee the
Good of his Choſen, and reveal his Chriſt
and Grace in me, <hi>I will mourn, I will mourn,</hi>
while I live! If God will not comfort
me, nothing elſe ſhall! If I may not find
Reſt and Peace in Chriſt, I will have none
at all! If God will take no Pleaſure in
me, I will take none in my ſelf! My Tears
ſhall be my Meat continually! I will go
mourning in this World, while I have a
Day to live, till Chriſt ſhall pleaſe to
caſt an Eye of Grace and Mercy on me!
Nay, let it come to this, <hi>I cannot live</hi> if
God be not reconciled! If Chriſt be not
mine, my Spirit fails! If the Lord do not
relieve me, there is nothing! No abiding
for me, unleſs he ſpeak a Word of Peace!
When the Soul is brought to this, I muſt
have an Intereſt in Chriſt, or nothing
will ſatisfie me; ſuch an one ſhall find
Acceptance: Therefore be in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and let the Deſires of the Soul riſe
up to an holy Reſtleſneſs. O wretched
Negligence, that we can let the greateſt
Concerns of our Souls lie at Hazard all
our Days!</p>

Ten Queſtions to ask our Hearts. Thus
Mr. <hi>Steel</hi> advis'd we ſhould often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with our Hearts. I. What have I
been, if now I am changed? I was a
wretched Sinner! II. What Good have I
done, that God may have the Glory, and
I the Comfort? III. How have I done it?
IV. What have I neglected? The ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant is condemn'd, who had Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
but did no good with them. What
Duties have I neglected, and how many
Opportunities of doing good omitted?
V. What State am I in? Am I in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
or ſinful State, in Chriſt, or in my
Sins? If I am in Chriſt, he rules; if in
Sin, that reigns. VI. What Frame am I
in? Am I in a gracious or worldly Frame
of Heart? VII. What do I? Am I in
my Calling, and in the way of my Duty?
Am I now doing the Will of God?
VIII. Whither am I going? Towards
Heaven or Hell? Every Moment I take a
Step to one of them. IX. How far am I
on my Way to Heaven? X. What ſhall
I do to be ſaved? Salvation is to be had,
how ſhall I attain it?</p>

               <p>O bleſſed Jeſus! I come to thee hungry and

Come now, my Soul, look yonder, thou

Ah me! he is not quite dead; look how he

What Gaſps and Groans do I hear him

What ſaith my Lord? What? <hi>My

He hath been all this while a drinking up
the Cup his Father gave him; the bitter,

I and all the World had elſe drank. But
muſt he endure all this? Muſt he be
crowned with Thorns, and ſweat, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37242:62"/>

for all this; either he muſt be thus dealt

He muſt drink up this bitter Cup,
with all its Dregs, or elſe I muſt have

proud, and earthly Heart of mine rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

he not let me die? But he loved me: I
was a polluted Sinner, methinks he ſhould
have loathed me, but he did waſh me and
make me clean again. But why did he

I know not why; O inexpreſſible Love!
O Love paſt Thoughts! He Loves becauſe

up thy drowſie Head, I will make thee
look and love, and e'er I leave thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
thou loveſt him! Suppoſe now, for
thy Sins, the Vengeance of God was juſt
ſeizing upon thee, turning thee into Hell,
and Chriſt comes and reveals himſelf

ſhalt not die; Come, feel my Heart how

I have left my Throne, and am come down

But why doſt thou weep?
Come, let me wipe thine Eyes, and bind

tell thee thou ſhalt not die. If Heaven
will have Blood, it ſhall have mine, ſo it

not a Word to ſpeak againſt this Love.
Thy Son, O God, hath offered Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and if I go undreſs'd, he will ask me where

O, holy Father, pardon this time,

               <p>Such is the infinite Extent and Value

Blood of Chriſt to take away the Guilt of
all thoſe Sins; and when that is done,
Merit enough left to purchaſe as great a

of all his Servants; to record his
Loving-kindneſs, and to make mention of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37242:69"/>
the many and great Deliverances I have
had. I know not where to begin, nor
where to make an end: I am even ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in Admiration, and ready to cry
out with <hi>David, What ſhall I render to the
Lord for all his Benefits?</hi> eſpecially when
I conſider my own Vileneſs by Nature;
and how I deſerved to be caſt into Hell
as ſoon as I was born, as having an Heart
full of Sin, Vanity, and Rebellion againſt
God, being conceived in Sin, and born in
Iniquity. And, as if this had not been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
I have added numberleſs moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Tranſgreſſions. I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the Sins of my Thoughts; I was
thinking Thoughts of Pride and Vanity as
ſoon as I could think: I was running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God as ſoon as I could go, with
my Back towards Heaven, and my Face
towards Hell. After I came to Years of
Diſcretion, the more I knew of God, the
more I ſinned againſt him. The Sins of
my Youth have been innumerable, and
very hainous in their Nature; ſo that I
have cauſe to pray with <hi>David, Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not againſt me the Sins of my Youth.</hi>
O the precious Time I have loſt! and the
Golden Opportunities that I have ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
away! The Light and Love, the
Mercies and Means of Grace that I have
ſinned againſt! I have ſpent the beſt of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37242:69"/>
my Years in the Service of Sin, and in the
Neglect of the great Concerns of my Soul.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, when I was but a Child, ſince
I had any Underſtanding, I had always
ſome Love to the Ways and People of
God, and ſome Delight in Holy Duties,
and was fearful of Sin, eſpecially of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Stealing, and playing upon the
Sabbath-Day. I delighted to read the
Word of God, and good Books, to others,
but I did not apply it to my ſelf; as when
I read that Scripture, that <hi>except we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
we ſhall all periſh; Except we are
born again, we cannot ſee the Kingdom of
God: That the Wicked ſhall be turned into
Hell,</hi> &amp;c. I thought theſe did not concern
me, becauſe I was guilty of no groſs Sin;
I reckon'd my Condition was good, and I
was ready to pity others; but I was not
ſenſible of the Corruption and Defilement
of my Nature: I did not ſee the Need of
a Change, I was not ſenſible of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Condition without Chriſt; I ſaw not
his Excellency, nor had any Deſires after
him; I knew not upon what Terms I
muſt take him, if I would be ſaved.</p>
               <p>As to the outward Duties of Religion,
I lived in the Performance of many of
them; but as for the more inward and
ſpiritual Duties of Chriſtianity, ſuch as
Self-examination, Meditation, Self-denial,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37242:70"/>
mourning for Sin, and watching over my
Thoughts, Words, and Actions, ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Lord's Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to theſe
I was altogether a Stranger. Thus I went
on in Rebellion againſt God, having a
Form of Godlineſs, but denying the
Power: And if God had then cut me off
in my Unregeneracy, certainly Hell-Fire
muſt have been my Portion. He might
have ſworn in his Wrath that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enter into his Reſt. O the wonderful
Patience and Forbearance of the Lord
towards ſuch a ſinful Creature! It is a
Miracle of Mercy, I am yet on this ſide
the Grave and Hell! It is of the Lord's
Mercy that I am ſpared ſo long, and that
he gives me ſpace to repent; that he
ſhould afford me the Means of Grace, and
ſend his holy Spirit to ſtrive with me, and
give me many Convictions, and all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
me, and bring me home to himſelf!
And that he ſhould not only give me ſpace
to repent, but an Heart to repent! That
he ſhould not only ſtand waiting, and
knocking at the Door of my Heart ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, calling on me to repent, but
that he ſhould give me the Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance!
This is undeſerved Love, and
diſtinguiſhing Mercy: For I was dead in
Treſpaſſes and Sins, and had nothing but
my Miſery to move his Compaſſion. I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37242:70"/>
walked according to the courſe of this
World, I was inſenſible of my Danger,
tho' ready to drop into Hell every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And I ſhould certainly have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
had not the Lord been pleaſed to
open my Eyes, and to pluck me as a Fire-brand
out of the burning, and ſet me in
the way to Heaven; for which I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſufficiently adore and praiſe his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Grace in Chriſt to me a vile, ſinful
Creature.</p>
               <p>Great was his Mercy towards me, for
he hath delivered my Soul from the loweſt
Hell; which makes me ſay with <hi>David,
Come and hear, all ye that fear the Lord, and
I will declare what he hath done for my Soul,</hi>
and the Way and Means whereby he was
pleaſed to work upon my Heart. The
Manner of my Converſion, which I hope
is true and real, is as follows.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed the Lord, by a ſad Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Sickneſs at <hi>London,</hi> to
bring my Unkle <hi>Gearing,</hi> and his Family,
from thence to my Father's Houſe, where
they continued about half a Year. My
Unkle being a good Man, I could not but
take notice of his ſtrict and circumſpect
Walking, and was much affected with it:
And I began to think, ſurely the Way
that I am in will never bring me to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
I thought I muſt live another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37242:71"/>
of Life, if ever I would be ſaved. I
had many <hi>Convictions,</hi> but there I ſtayed,
but went no further; I kept on in my
former careleſs courſe. When it pleaſed
God to put a Stop to the Plague at <hi>London,</hi>
my <hi>Unkle</hi> returned with his Family; and
I went with him, and continued at his
Houſe about two Months; in which time
it pleaſed the Lord to follow me with
new Convictions; partly by the good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of my Unkle, partly by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Sermons; which I heard when I
was there; ſo that I began in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
to look after the Salvation of my
Soul, and to ſay with the Goaler, <hi>What
muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I began to be very deſirous to hear the
Word I took all Opportunities to hear,
and gave Attention to what was preached,
after another manner than I was wont to
do, and laboured to make Application of
it to my ſelf. I heard Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> preach
upon <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Follow Holineſs, without
which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> urging
the Neceſſity of it, as the only way to
Heaven. I was much affected therewith,
and began to think I muſt ſet about the
Work of a thorow Repentance. I began
to be ſenſible of my Original Corruption,
and that I had been guilty of thouſands of
actual Sins: Thoſe which before I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37242:71"/>
ſmall, I now look'd upon as great;
and upon my ſelf, by reaſon of Sin, to be
in a lamentable Condition. I knew not
how to get out of this ſinful, miſerable
State; and the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew
me that there was no Name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by which I could be ſaved, but only
by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> I thought, if I could
have an Intereſt in <hi>Him,</hi> and his Favour, I
ſhould be ſaved; but I feared God would
not thus have Mercy upon me, becauſe I
had gone on ſo long in Sin.</p>
               <p>I heard an excellent Sermon upon <hi>Mat.
11. 28. Come unto me all ye that are weary;
and heavy loden, and I will give you Reſt?</hi>
Proving, <hi>firſt,</hi> that Sin is a Burden: And,
<hi>ſecondly,</hi> that burdened Sinners are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to come to Chriſt; and then, that
thoſe that come to him, ſhall find Reſt for
their Souls. This was a ſutable Word, to
my Soul, I was much affected in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of in; for I felt Sin to be a Burden no
my Conſcience, and I would fain have Reſt
to my Soul. I was ſenſible of my Want
of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to be intereſted in him; I began to
ſee his Worth and Excellency, as the
chiefeſt of Ten thouſands altogether, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And then, and not till then, I had
Hungerings and Thirſtings after him; ſo
that I could ſay, <hi>None but Chriſt, give
me Chriſt, or elſe I die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:37242:72"/>
Thus it pleaſed the Lord by his Spirit
to work upon my Heart, by degrees to
open mine Eyes, and to let in ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light into my Underſtanding, which
was <hi>dark</hi> before; and to give ſome Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life to my Affections, which were
<hi>dead</hi> before. But O the Enemies that did
then labour to hinder my Converſion, and
ſtop this Work! <hi>The World,</hi> by Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Diſcouragements, ſought to
keep me off from Chriſt: <hi>My own deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heart,</hi> and corrupt Diſpoſition within
me, were no ſmall Enemy and Hinderance
to the Work of Grace in my Soul. <hi>The
Devil,</hi> the great Adverſary of God's Glory
and our Happineſs, came like a roaring
Lion ready to devour me; ſo that I had
certainly been foiled, if God by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
Grace had not ſupported and
delivered me. When Satan ſaw me firſt
ſet my Face towards Heaven, he employ'd
all his Skill and Diligence to hinder it.
Formerly he had told me I needed <hi>not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
becauſe I was not guilty of groſs
Sins; but now he ſaw that I was ſenſible
of my Vileneſs and Sinfulneſs by Nature
and Life, he ſaw that Sin was my Burden,
and that I was convinced that I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
or periſh, he left off this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and told me <hi>it was too ſoon to repent
yet,</hi> that I was young, and might live
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37242:72"/>
many Years, and take my Pleaſure; that
I might repent when I was old, or upon
a ſick Bed. To that end he ſuggeſted to
me, that the Life of a Chriſtian was a ſad
uncomfortable Life; that if I entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Courſe, I muſt bid Farewel to all
Mirth and Pleaſure, and ſpend my Days
in Sorrow. But then I began to think
with my ſelf, that it was better to do ſo,
than lie down in Hell-Torments to all
Eternity.</p>
               <p>When Satan ſaw that he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in this Temptation, he found out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
he went about to perſwade me;
That if I began to walk in the Ways of
God, and did hold out a little way, it
was a thouſand to one if I held out to
the end; <hi>I ſhould certainly fall away,</hi> and
turn <hi>Apoſtate:</hi> And this was the worſt
Condition of all, to return with the Dog
to the Vomit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He brings that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to my Mind, <hi>If after we have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the Pollutions of the World, we are
again entangled therein, the latter end is
worſe than the beginning: For it had been
better not to have known the Way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
than after we have known it to
turn from it.</hi> He followed me with
this Temptation, but it pleaſed God by his
Spirit to enable me in ſome meaſure to
reſiſt it and repel it; for I was perſwaded,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37242:73"/>
If God had begun a good Work of Grace
in me, he was able to carry it on, and to
keep me from falling away, tho' at that
time I was not acquainted with thoſe
Scriptures that prove the <hi>Perſeverance of
the Saints.</hi> Thus was I troubled and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with various Temptations, and no
ſooner rid of one, but another came.</p>
               <p>I heard a Sermon upon <hi>Matth. 13. 45.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man,
ſeeking goodly Pearl: Who,
when he had found one of great Price, went
and ſold all that he had to buy it.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
much Light and Comfort from this
Sermon, and ſaw more of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Excellency of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was
<hi>the Pearl of Price,</hi> and I thought I could
moſt willingly part with all, even Life
it ſelf, for him.</p>
               <p>Then he tempted me <hi>to queſtion the
Truth of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> and I was
put upon it to prove them to be the Word
of God. This I was not able to do, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Temptation was the longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, and I was much perplexed about
it: And had the Devil prevailed with
this, he needed not have followed me
with any other Temptation.</p>
               <p>When this was a little over, he came
like a roaring Lion ready to devour me,
not as an Angel of Light; but ſhewing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37242:73"/>
himſelf in his own Colours like a <hi>Devil,</hi>
he aſſaulted me with the <hi>moſt Horrid, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical,
and Blaſphemous Temptations,</hi>
that were poſſible for him to invent. He
ſtruck deep, and went about to deſtroy
the Foundation of all Religion: He temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to that which I am aſhamed to
think of, and even tremble to mention, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to believe there was <hi>no God, nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
Heaven, nor Hell:</hi> Tho' I did not
believe his Temptation, nor willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it, yet could I by no means be rid
of it; it came very ſtrong upon me, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me from Bed to Board; and tho'
I was terrified with the Thoughts of it, I
could not put it out of my Mind, and I
was in great Perplexity of Spirit: But
the Lord was pleaſed ſecretly to preſerve
me, and ſupport me under theſe grievous
Aſſaults, and in ſome meaſure to repel
them. But behold the Policy of Satan!
tho' <hi>this Temptation</hi> did not prevail, it
made way for <hi>Another,</hi> which preſently
followed. For he who had tempted me
to have ſuch horrid Atheiſtical Thoughts,
now began to terrifie me for them; he ſet
Sin before me in its Aggravations, and
told me, that now I was worſe than the
very Devils, for they believe that there
is a God, and tremble; therefore I then
thought I ſhould certainly be damned,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37242:74"/>
that I was paſt all Hopes of Salvation; I
looked upon my ſelf as ripe for Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ready for Hell-Torments. He
had often told me it was <hi>too ſoon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
now he told me it was <hi>too late.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Scripture. Threatnings were brought to
my Mind that did exceedingly terrifie
me, as that in <hi>Iſaiah, There is no Peace,
ſaith my God, to the Wicked.</hi> And that
<hi>the Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and
all the Nations that forget God,</hi> as I knew
I had done of a long time. Likewiſe
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 22. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. to the end.
When I went about to read the Scripture,
then that Place came to my Mind, <hi>What
haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or to
take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</hi> Pſal.
50. 16. When I had Thoughts of praying
to the Lord for Grace, that Scripture
came freſh into my Mind, <hi>The Prayer of
the Wicked is an Abomination.</hi> Theſe,
with many other Scriptures, did affright
and terrifie me, I knew not what to do.
I ſaw my ſelf utterly undone without an
Intereſt in Chriſt, and yet I durſt not lay
hold on him for Salvation.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs the Sorrows of my
Mind under theſe ſtrong Convictions, and
various Temptations. My Heart was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Horror and Terror Day and
Night for ſome Weeks together. O the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37242:74"/>
Depth of Satan's Wiles! He that had led
me along all my Days in <hi>Preſumption,</hi>
now he went about to drive me to <hi>Deſpair.</hi>
How hard a thing is it to keep between
theſe two Extreams! Had not God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
me by his Power and Mercy, I had
certainly been daſhed in pieces between
theſe two Rocks.</p>
               <p>Satan has tempted me to think I had
committed <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
by my atheiſtical and blaſphemous
Thoughts, and becauſe I ſinned againſt ſo
much Light. This was a great and ſore
Trouble to me, and an heavy Burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Conſcience. This Scripture did
much terrifie me, <hi>Repentance is hid from
thine Eyes;</hi> and another, <hi>He that believeth
not, is condemned already, and the Wrath
of God abideth on him.</hi> I looked upon
all the Threatnings as ſpoken to me; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing added to my Sorrow. When
I read <hi>the Promiſes,</hi> they adminiſtred no
Comfort to me, but rather Terror, becauſe
I thought I had no right to them, or to
thoſe things they aſſured us of. When I
heard of <hi>the Joys of Heaven,</hi> and of the
Glory of it, it increaſed my Trouble to
think there ſhould be ſo much Happineſs,
and I have no ſhare in it, but muſt be
baniſhed from God and Happineſs for e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver.
And when I thought of <hi>the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37242:75"/>
of Hell,</hi> the Fire that muſt never
go out, and the Worm that ſhall never
die; this I looked upon as the due De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of my Sins, and as my Portion.</p>
               <p>I had renounced all my own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I could ſee nothing in my ſelf but
what deſerved Hell; I wondred at the
Patience of God to me, I could juſtifie
him tho' he ſhould damn me. I thought
my ſelf unworthy to eat, or drink, or
breathe, or tread upon the Earth: I looked
every Day when God would glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in my Damnation; but this I kept to
my ſelf: Tho' others could not but take
notice of the Sadneſs of my Spirit, and
wondred at it; yet I did not tell any how
it was with me. My Heart was very full,
and I longed to vent it, but I knew not
how. <hi>To God</hi> I durſt not go, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of my own Vileneſs. I was aſhamed
to make known my Condition <hi>to Man,</hi> it
was ſo bad, I thought none ever had ſuch
blaſphemous Thoughts as I had. I wiſhed
ſome of the Saints did know my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they might direct me, and pray
for me; but I could not tell to whom to
apply my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus was I in Perplexity, toſſed to and
fro, and not comforted. And tho' the
Lord was pleaſed to uphold me, and keep
me from falling into the Pit of <hi>Deſpair,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:37242:75"/>
yet I was very near it. I was encompaſſed
about with ſo many and great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they came ſo ſtrong upon me,
that I could not hold out any longer to
conceal my Trouble: Then the Lord put
it into my Mind to acquaint my Unkle
<hi>Gearing</hi> with my ſad Condition; but the
Devil endeavoured, all he could to hinder
it, by perſwading me that it was a fooliſh
thing to declare my Wickedneſs to one
that was ſo holy; that I ſhould but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
his ill Opinion of me, and cauſe him
to hate and abhor me, and do my ſelf no
good at all by telling him of it: Yet,
ſtill I had a Deſire to do it, and I had no
Reſt in my Spirit till I had done it. But
ſometimes I wanted an Opportunity, and
ſometimes when I would have ſpoken, I
could not. But at laſt a fit Opportunity
was preſented upon a Sabbath-Day Night,
all being in Bed except my Unkle and my
ſelf. I was reſolved to open my Heart
freely to him.</p>
               <p>When I began to ſpeak, my Mouth was
as it were ſtopped, but with trembling I
forced my ſelf to ſpeak, and made known
my ſad Condition. I told him what grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Blaſphemous Thoughts I had, and
that I was affraid I had committed <hi>the Sin
againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhould certainly be damned, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37242:76"/>
had no Hopes of Salvation; but I deſired
his Prayers for me, and his Advice in a
Matter of ſuch Conſequence. It pleaſed
the Lord to affect his Heart with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
He told me it was not my Sin to
be tempted, if I did not yield to the
Temptation: And therefore it ſhould not
drive me to deſpair of God's Mercy. He
ſaid it was a Sign I had not committed the
Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe I was
affraid I had committed it. He ſpoke
much of the gracious Nature of God,
and of his Willingneſs to ſave Sinners;
and, as I remember, he told me of many
and great Sinners in Scripture, to whom
God had ſhewed Mercy, as <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>the Thief upon
the Croſs.</hi> He alſo directed me to many
ſweet Promiſes in Scripture; but that
eſpecially which is never to be forgotten,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 25, 26. Then will I ſprinkle clean
Water upon you, and you ſhall be clean; from
all your Filthineſs, and from all your Idols
will I cleanſe you. A new Heart alſo will I
give you, and a new Spirit will I put within
you,</hi> &amp;c. He told me every one might
lay hold on this Promiſe. When he read
theſe Scriptures to me, my Heart rejoiced,
and I began to hope God would pardon
me, and give me a new Heart, and cauſe
me to walk in his Ways. He alſo gave
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37242:76"/>
me very good Counſel, particularly to be
conſtant in the Excellent Duty of <hi>Secret
Prayer,</hi> and told me the great Benefit I
ſhould find thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now having made known my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and declared my Trouble, and hearing
theſe gracious Promiſes to poor Sinners, I
found ſome Eaſe and Satisfaction in my
Mind, and the beginning of Comfort in
my Soul. I reſolved to put theſe Duties
in practice, Secret Prayer, Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Stranger to theſe inward Heart-Duties,
I knew not how to perform them
as I ought. How many times have I
kneeled down to pray, and knew not what
to ſay, but wanted not Sighs and Tears?
And ſo my Neceſſity, and the Senſe of my
Vileneſs, my earneſt Deſires after Chriſt
and his Grace, put Words into my Mouth.
Tho' my Duties were miſerably lame and
defective, yet they were performed with
much Earneſtneſs and Importunity, and I
think I may ſay <hi>in Sincerity;</hi> ſurely then
my Heart was in every Word, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Duty; I did not then dally with God,
I was in good earneſt for my Soul; and
that Promiſe was comfortable to me, <hi>If
there be firſt a willing Mind, it is accepted
with God,</hi> &amp;c. I found that Scripture
made good to me, <hi>Then ſhall we know,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37242:77"/>
if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi> And
that in <hi>Iſa. 40. 16. I will bring the Blind
by the way that they knew not; I will make
Darkneſs Light before them, and crooked
things ſtrait: Theſe things will I do unto
them, and not forſake them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
Theſe, and ſuch Scriptures were ſweet,
and I began to ſearch the Bible to find
them. And when the Lord was pleaſed
to ſet them home upon my Heart, they
were as Cordials many times to my faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul.</p>
               <p>But tho' I had ſome Comfort and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
yet was I not free from Temptations
and Trouble of Mind. My ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
ſtrove hard to hinder my Godly
Courſe, and turn me from it, had not the
Lord been ſtronger than they. My Sin
was a heavy Burden to me, and I had
earneſt Deſires after Chriſt; yet I found
it very hard to believe. Satan laboured
to perſwade me, that <hi>I was not elected to
Salvation;</hi> and therefore, whatever I did,
I ſhould never be ſaved. This was no
ſmall Trouble to my Spirit, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Lord to direct me to a Book, in
which I found much Satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Satan told me,</hi> He that believeth
not, ſhould be damned; <hi>and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I was full of Unbelief and Doubting,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37242:77"/>
I was condemned already. But when I
was in great Trouble about this, it pleaſed
the Lord to caſt in this Scripture,</hi> If we
believe not yet he abideth faithful, he cannot
deny himſelf. <hi>This did very much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
me, and ſo did theſe following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
which I had not taken notice of
before, nor applied to my ſelf,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1.
<hi>and all this Chapter; and</hi> Mat. 11. 28.
Joh. 7. 37. Rev. 22. 17. Joh. 3. 16. Mat.
7. 7. Pſal. 30. 18. Joh. 16. 24. Pſal. 84.
11. Iſa. 40. 27. Pſal. 27. 14. Lament. 3.
24, 25, 26. Pſal. 147. 11. Pſal. 26. 3, 4.
Iſa. 50. 10. Iſa. 41. 10. Iſa. 43. 24, 25.
Iſa. 44. 22. 1 Joh. 1. 9. 1 Joh. 2. 1. Mark

6. Joh. 10. 7. Rom. 16. 20. Heb. 4. 15.</p>
               <p>Theſe Promiſes, with many more, was
the Lord pleaſed to give me in the time
of my Diſtreſs and Trouble of Spirit, and
I found them reviving Cordials. O how
welcome was a Promiſe to me! When I
have been ready to deſpair, and to give up
all for loſt, and had nothing to ſupport
me; then did I take the Bible into my
Hand, and deſire God to direct ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Promiſe to me; and opening the
Bible, the firſt place I have caſt mine Eye
upon, hath often been a precious and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Promiſe, and hath been ſet home
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37242:78"/>
with ſuch Power as wonderfully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Once, being under great Fear and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
I opened the Bible, and the firſt
place I fixed my Eye upon, was</hi> Iſa. 54. 4.
Fear not, for thou ſhalt not be confounded,
nor put to ſhame; thou ſhalt forget the
Shame of thy Youth; thy Maker is thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, and
thy Redeemer the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the
God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called: for
the Lord hath called thee as a Woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
and grieved in Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For a
ſmall Moment have I forſaken thee, but
with great Mercy will I gather thee. In
a little Wrath I hid my Face for a moment,
but with everlaſting Kindneſs will I have
Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord, thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<hi>&amp;c. I was wonderfully affected in
the reading theſe ſweet Promiſes, and took
it as a Voice from Heaven to me, becauſe
I had deſired ſome ſuch ſutable Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another time, being in great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and fearing I ſhould never hold out,
but be overcome by Sin and Satan, I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Bible, and the firſt place I fixed
my Eye upon, was <hi>Iſa. 41. 10. Fear not,
for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I
am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I
will help thee, yea will uphold thee with
the right hand of my Righteouſneſs.</hi> I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37242:78"/>
cannot expreſs the Comfort I received by
this ſutable and ſeaſonable Promiſe.</p>
               <p>One Sabbath-Day Night, being ſtill
followed with Temptations; full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Doubts and Fears; I was much
troubled about it, that I who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſuch great Mercies, ſhould have ſuch
vain Thoughts, and be ſo full of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
Notwithſtanding the Experience I
had of God's Goodneſs and Mercy to me,
and the Aſſurance I had before of his
Love, I was tempted to think that <hi>I was
not elected,</hi> and that therefore all I did
was to no purpoſe, and that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſaved. This was a ſubtile and
ſtrong Temptation: Satan did not only
labour to drive me off from all Duty, but
to weaken my Faith, and bring me to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair:
But the Lord, who had many
times before wonderfully reſcued me from
the roaring Lion, would not ſuffer me to
be foiled by him, but was pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that Scripture to my Eye, <hi>There is
no Temptation has taken you, but ſuch as
is common to Men; and God is Faithful,
who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above
what you are able, but will with the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
make a way to eſcape, that ye may
be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At another time, being greatly troubled
with Unbelief, that Place in the</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37242:79"/>
                  <hi>was terrible to me,</hi> The Fearful and
Unbelieving ſhall have their part in the
Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone,
which is the ſecond Death. <hi>This made me
exceedingly affraid: I thought if the</hi> Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>and</hi> Unbelieving <hi>ſhould periſh, then
ſurely I ſhould, becauſe I was ſo full of
Fears, and Doubts, and Unbelief. But the
Lord did not leave me in this great
Streight, he would not ſuffer me to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed
with Sorrow, but quickly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
me to a ſutable and ſeaſonable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that was as comfortable as the other
was terrible,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13. If we believe
not, yet be abideth faithful, he cannot deny
himſelf. <hi>This Promiſe was very ſweet, and
ſutable to my preſent Condition; neither
did I remember there was ſuch a Place
before. Theſe, and many of the fore-named
Promiſes were given me in my Trouble
and Diſtreſs; and the Lord enabled me by
his Spirit to make Application of them
to my own Soul for my Conſolation.
Certainly I may ſay with</hi> David, I had
fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the
Goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the
Living. The Sorrows of Death did compaſs
me about, and the Pains of Hell got hold
upon me, I found Trouble and Sorrow. Then
called I upon the Name of the Lord, O Lord,
I beſeech thee, deliver my Soul! Gracious
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37242:79"/>
is the Lord, and righteous, yea our God is
merciful; I was brought low, and he help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me. Return unto thy Reſt, O my Soul,
for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with
thee. In the multitude of my Thoughts
within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul.
In the Day when I cried, thou anſweredſt
me, and ſtrengthenedſt me with Strength
in my Soul. Bleſſed be the Lord, becauſe
he hath heard the Voice of my Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the Lord is my Strength and my
Song; my Heart truſted in him, and I am
helped. If it had not been the Lord who
had been on my ſide, when Satan roſe up
againſt me, he had ſurely ſwallowed me up.
The Lord has called me out of Darkneſs
into his marvelous Light. He hath pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me as a Fire-brand out of Hell, and ſet
me in the way to Heaven: <hi>So that I may
ſay again and again,</hi> Great is his Mercy
towards me, for he hath delivered my Soul
from the loweſt Hell.</p>
               <p>But, O! why is it that I am ſo little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of this great Deliverance! How can
I look back upon all this without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Free Grace, and undeſerved Love
of God towards ſuch a worthleſs Worm as
I, who was an Enemy to him, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt him, and had nothing in me
but what deſerved Hell? O that ever the
Lord ſhould from Eternity elect and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37242:80"/>
chooſe me to Salvation, through Jeſus
Chriſt! That God ſhould paſs by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
and let them alone to periſh in
their Sins, and caſt a Look of Love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, and when I was in my Blood, ſay
unto me, <hi>Live!</hi> That he ſhould not only
give his Son <hi>for me,</hi> but <hi>to me!</hi> That he
ſhould take me, with the Prodigal, from
the Trough, and with the Beggar from
the Dunghil, and make me an Heir of
Glory! When I read that Chriſt's Flock
is but a little Flock, and that <hi>ſtrait is
the Gate, and narrow is the Way that
leads to Life, and few there be that find
it;</hi> I cannot but wonder that I ſhould be
in that Number! And becauſe I cannot
ſufficiently admire, I will therefore adore
my Good God. But what Returns ſhould
I now make to the Lord for all this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!
Of my ſelf I am not able to think a
good Thought, it is unlikely then I ſhould
make any ſutable Return! I have nothing
of my own but Sin, and that is God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
which he perfectly hates. I am not
my own, for I am bought with a Price:
Therefore, if I give my ſelf to him, it is
but that which was his own before: Yet
this will I do, becauſe I have nothing elſe
to give; I will give my Soul and Body
to be the Lord's, expecting Acceptance
only for the Sake and Merits of Jeſus
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37242:80"/>
Chriſt. Surely God requires nothing of
me, but what he hath firſt given to me.
All that he requireth, is but the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Love back again, when I have
had the Comfort of it. O what Thanks
and Praiſe ſhould I render to the Lord,
and ſay with <hi>David, Bleſs the Lord, O
my Soul, and all that is within me bleſs his
holy Name! Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and
forget not all his Benefits! He forgiveth
all thine Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art my God,
and I will praiſe thee; thou art my God,
and I will extol thee: O give Thanks unto
the Lord, for he is good; for his Mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever! For he ſatisfieth the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul, and filleth the Hungry with good
Things. I will bleſs the Lord at all times,
and his Praiſe ſhall be continually in my
Mouth. I will love the Lord, becauſe he
has heard the Voice of my Supplication;
becauſe he has inclined his Ear unto me,
therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live. I will extol thee, my God, O King, I
will bleſs thy Name for ever and ever! I
will praiſe the Lord while I live, I will ſing
Praiſe to my God while I have any Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, when I look back upon this,
I cannot but rejoice in the Lord, and joy
in the God of my Salvation; becauſe I
hope I have gone through the Pangs of
the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and truly enter'd in at the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37242:81"/>
ſtrait Gate, and am now going the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Way that leads to <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> which
I hope to obtain through the Merits of
Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour.</p>
               <p>And again, When I reflect and look
back upon all theſe Things, what Cauſe
have I to bewail the Sins of my Youth,
and the State of my Unregeneracy, which
was ſpent in Sin and Vanity, and in thoſe
things wherein there is no Profit? If God
ſhould remember againſt me the Sins of
my Youth, he might write bitter things
againſt me. If I ſhould live the Age of
<hi>Methuſalah,</hi> and ſpend all my Time in
weeping, the Tears of my Life to come
were not ſufficient to bewail the Sins of
my Life paſt. O what did I loſe, when I
enjoyed no Communion with God! How
much richer might I have been in Grace
and Holineſs, and I ſet out in the Way to
Heaven ſooner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this is my Comfort,
tho' I did not come in at <hi>the firſt Hour,</hi>
yet I did not ſtay, till <hi>the laſt.</hi> This was
the Lord's Mercy. But my Sins <hi>before
Converſion,</hi> are not all the Sins which I
have to mourn for, but the Sins which I
have been guilty of <hi>ſince;</hi> and in ſome
meaſure my Sins are greater <hi>ſince,</hi> than
they were <hi>before.</hi> For I have now ſinned
againſt clearer Light, dearer Love, more
Manifeſtations of God's Goodneſs, more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37242:81"/>
Experience of his Kindneſs, more Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to obey him, greater Obligations to
ſerve him; ſo that I am aſham'd to think
how unthankful my Walking hath been,
ſince the Lord hath given me ſome Deſires
to ſerve him, ſome Care to pleaſe him,
and ſome Fear to offend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he was pleaſed firſt to lift up the
Light of his Countenance upon me, and
ſpeak Peace to my Soul, after ſo many
Temptations, and Troubles of Conſcience;
then I did not only ſerve him with Joy and
Thankfulneſs, but alſo with Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor:
O how was my Heart affected with
Spiritual Things! When I prayed, it was
with Senſe and Feeling; it was not only
in Word, but I poured out my Soul before
the Lord. When I heard the Word of
God, how did I hear as for my Life,
and performed every Duty as for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!
I did not look upon Duty meerly
as a Taſk, but accounted it a great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
to draw nigh to God in the Ways
of his Appointment. I found it was not
in vain to ſeek him, I was even filled with
the Admiration of his Love, and the
Conſolations of the Spirit; and my Heart
was enlarged, and ran the Ways of his
Commandments with great Delight and
Comfort: I could ſay with the Church,</hi>
As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37242:82"/>
Wood, ſo was my Beloved Jeſus to my Soul;
I ſate down under his Shadow with great
Delight, and his Fruit was ſweet unto my
Taſte. <hi>I could in ſome meaſure ſay with</hi>
David, As the Hart panteth after the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brooks,
ſo panteth my Soul after thee,
O God: My Soul thirſteth for God, for
the living God; When ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before God? O God, thou art my
God, early will I ſeek thee: My Fleſh
longeth for thee in a dry and thirſty Land
where no Water is. How amiable are thy
Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts! My Soul
longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts
of the Lord; for a Day in thy Courts is
better than a thouſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My Soul wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for God, from whom cometh my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He only is my Rock and my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he is my Defence, I ſhall not be
greatly moved. In God is my Salvation,
and my Glory, the Rock of my Strength,
and my Refuge is in God. Becauſe thy
Loving-kindneſs is better than Life,
my Lips ſhall praiſe thee; my Soul ſhall
be ſatisfied as with Marrow and Fatneſs,
and my Mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lips. With my whole Heart have I
ſought thee, O Lord; let me not wander
from thy Commandments. Thou art my
Portion, O Lord, I have ſaid I will keep
thy Precepts, for with them thou haſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37242:82"/>
quickned me. O how love I thy Law! It
is my Meditation all the Day. How ſweet
is thy Word to my Taſte! yea ſweeter than
Honey to my Mouth; therefore I love thy
Commandments above Gold, yea above fine
Gold.</p>
               <p>Thus was my Heart filled with Joy, and
my Mouth with Praiſe; and tho' my
Dwelling was on <hi>Earth,</hi> yet my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
was in <hi>Heaven.</hi> I looked upon all
things here below with an indifferent eye;
I could in ſome meaſure ſay with <hi>Paul,
None of theſe things move me, neither count
I my Life dear to my ſelf, ſo I may finiſh
my Courſe with Joy.</hi> I was then able to
make a ſpiritual Uſe of every Providence,
and of every Mercy, and of every thing I
met with. I found the aſſiſtance of the
Holy Spirit to perform ſpiritual Duties
in a ſpiritual manner, and helping and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
me to ſome Duties which I never
knew to be my Duty. And tho' I cannot
ſay I was wholly free from Temptation,
yet I can ſay, whenever Satan began to
ſet upon me, I was enabled to ſee that it
was a Temptation, and preſently to run
to Jeſus Chriſt for Succour and Relief,
and to apply the Promiſes unto my Soul;
and I quickly found Comfort, and was
ſoon freed from Temptation.</p>
               <p>But in this <hi>my Proſperity</hi> I was ready to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37242:83"/>
ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be removed,</hi> I began to
think I ſhould never be in Adverſity; and
ſometimes I was ready to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was one of God's Children, becauſe
I had no Afflictions? I thought God did
not love me, becauſe he did not chaſten
me; I thought I could bear any thing he
ſhould lay upon me. As I valued not
<hi>Life,</hi> ſo I feared not <hi>Death;</hi> I thought I
could freely and willingly lay down my
Life for Chriſt, if I was called to it. But
this joyful, lively, active Frame of Spirit
did not long continue; in about a quarter
of a Year it began to abate, and I began
to be more cold and indifferent in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, and not to be ſo active and
lively as before. This was a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to me, and made me to queſtion all
that was paſt. I thought I ſhould ſtill
have grown better and better, and not
worſe. Then that Scripture was terrible
to me, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 29. If after they have
eſcaped the pollutions of the World through
the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, they are again entangled therein,
and overcome, their latter end is worſe than
their beginning.</hi> And that Scripture, <hi>Heb. 6.
4. It is impoſſible for thoſe that were once
enlightned, and have taſted the good Word of
God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if they fall away, to renew them
again to repentance.</hi> Alſo that Text, <hi>Rev.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37242:83"/>
3. 15, 16. Becauſe thou art neither hot nor
cold, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth.</hi> I was
much ſenſible of my Backſlidings, fear'd I
ſhould turn <hi>Apoſtate.</hi> Had not that ſweet
Promiſe interpoſed, <hi>I will heal their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings,
and love them freely:</hi> I had been
certainly ſwallowed up in Deſpair. Satan,
that roaring Lion, came upon me very
fiercely; but that Scripture was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to me, <hi>I will put my fear into their
hearts, and my ſpirit into their inward
parts, and they ſhall never depart from me.
And whom he loveth, he loveth to the end.
And he that hath begun a good Work, will
perform it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.
And faithful is he that hath called you,
who will alſo do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and other Scriptures did ſupport
me, but I could not attain to my former
lively performance of holy Duties, nor
had I that Communion with God in holy
Duties as formerly; which was no ſmall
trouble to me, and kept me from rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in God: Yet I cannot ſay but I had
ſometimes <hi>Aſſurance of God's Love,</hi> but
<hi>not conſtantly,</hi> as I had before.</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>my Grandmother</hi> being ſick, I
went to be with her at <hi>my Uncle</hi>'s Houſe:
He being a very good Man, his Company
was no ſmall Comfort to me: My Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
alſo being a very pious Woman,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37242:84"/>
was always ſpeaking of what was good.
I enjoy'd much of God while I was there;
but yet was many times in fear about my
Spiritual State, and much troubled with
the Temptations of Satan.</p>
               <p>After I had been there a quarter of a
Year, it pleaſed the Lord to viſit me with
<hi>the Small Pox,</hi> which was a very ſore Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
to me. I was brought ſo low, as to
be given over for dead by moſt, if not all
that ſaw me; and once they thought I
had been actually dead. When I was
firſt ſick, I began to be in great fear what
would become of me if I ſhould die; but
this Cloud was ſoon blown over, and the
Lord was pleaſed to ſhine upon me with
the Light of his Countenance, and ſpeak
Peace to my Conſcience: And when I was
as weak as I think any could be, and live,
yet had I then much inward Joy and
Comfort; the Promiſes were as Cordials
to my fainting Spirits. That Promiſe,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 10 did often refreſh me, <hi>Fear not,
for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I
am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee, I will
help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the
right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> That alſo
<hi>Pſal. 73. 25. My fleſh and my heart faileth;
but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.</hi> So <hi>Pſal. 43. 5. Why art
thou caſt down, O my Soul? Why art thou
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37242:84"/>
diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God,
for I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the health
of my countenance, and my God.</hi> Theſe,
and many other Promiſes, were my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
in the Day of my Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I had then ſuch aſſurance of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Love to me, and of the Pardon of
my Sins, and of my Intereſt in Chriſt, that
<hi>I longed for Death,</hi> and could not bear the
thoughts of living any longer. I had ſuch
Fore-taſtes of Heaven, that I cared not for
the Earth: I earneſtly deſired to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of
all. I thought if I ſhould live any longer,
I ſhould but ſin againſt God, and that I
could not glorifie him in my Life, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.
I thought if he ſhould reſtore me, I
ſhould not be enabled to walk anſwerably
to ſo great a Mercy. Theſe, and other
ſuch Reaſons, made me impatient of Life,
and long for Death. I was angry with
any that prayed for my Life. I now fear
that I did ſin in being ſo deſirous of
Death, and not ſubmitting my Will to
the Will of God, to be at his Diſpoſal,
whether for Death or Life.</p>
               <p>So it pleaſed the Lord, after a long
and tedious Sickneſs, to raiſe me up from
the very Gates of Death: This was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as almoſt <hi>a Reſurrection from the
Dead;</hi> for which great Deliverance I can
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37242:85"/>
never be ſufficiently thankful. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſo much deſired to die, I did not
prize my Life, and this Deliverance as I
ſhould have done: Neither did I render to
the Lord according to the Mercy I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from him. I deſire now to be truly
thankful to the Lord for all his Mercies,
and to ſhew forth my Thankfulneſs, by
walking more cloſely with him all the
Days of my Life.</p>

It is one thing to have an Intereſt
in Chriſt and Salvation, and another to
know it. It is poſſible for many a good
Chriſtian to truſt in God, and believe in
Jeſus Chriſt, and yet in time of Deſertion
and Temptation, he may not know it. A
Soul under the Eclipſe of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
may think himſelf in a loſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I ſaid I am cut off from
before thine Eyes,</hi> Pſal. 31. 22. but it was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37242:87"/>
not ſo, for God then heard the Voice of
his Supplication. A man may truly fear
the Lord, and obey the Voice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and yet <hi>may walk in Darkneſs and

Lord hath forſaken me, my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
me,</hi> Iſa. 49. 14. but it was not ſo.
There may be Faith of <hi>Adherence,</hi> where
there is not Faith of <hi>Evidence.</hi> The Soul
may cleave faſt to Chriſt, and ſay, <q>
                        <hi>If I
periſh, I will periſh at thy Foot, hoping,
waiting, truſting;</hi> tho' thou killeſt me,
yet I will truſt in thee, tho' I know
not whether thou loveſt me, yet I will
endeavour to love thee.</q> There may be
Faith without Aſſurance, otherways true
juſtifying Faith may be <hi>loſt;</hi> for Aſſurance
is with ſome quite <hi>loſt,</hi> at leaſt for
a time; but true Faith cannot be loſt; it
may decay, but not fail. <hi>I have prayed for
thee that thy Faith fail not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to
<hi>Peter:</hi> This Prayer he makes for all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
They alſo that have ſome Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Salvation, have it not in
the ſame meaſure.</p>
                  <p>There may be a good meaſure of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
tho' not full Aſſurance. There is a
<hi>probable Aſſurance,</hi> I mean when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
comparing his Heart and Life with
the Example of Chriſt, and Rule of the
Word, finds, that tho' he hath ſome reaſon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37242:88"/>
to fear leſt he ſhould be <hi>an Hypocrite,</hi> yet
he ſees more cauſe to hope than to fear.
When after he hath ſearched himſelf,
made an impartial Trial of himſelf, he
comes to this Concluſion: Tho' I am not
as confident I ſhall go to Heaven, as I am
that there is a Heaven; yet I bleſs God,
I ſee more ground to hope that my Sins
are pardoned, and that I am in a ſtate of
Salvation, than to fear it is otherwiſe.
When I reaſon the caſe with my Soul, I

Aſſurance. There may be <hi>Doubts</hi> and

Doubts and Fears do not always
proceed from the Weakneſs of Grace, but

A Man that hath but a <hi>weak Faith,</hi>

                  <p>The greateſt ſenſe of Sin and Guilt

<hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor my

than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than
your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 55. 8. When Conſcience is

God will pardon us; therefore he fetches
Arguments from his gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

If you repent, your Sins ſhall infinitely

like our ſelves; but the bleſſed God is of

yours, as between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>

Sinner, the Promiſes of the Goſpel belong

It was a memorable Anſwer of Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> to
a godly Miniſter, that ſaid to him a little
before his Death, What will you ſay to
me, who am going out of the World,
and can find no Comfort? He replied,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37242:92"/>
What will you ſay to <hi>our Saviour,</hi> that
was going out of the World and found no
Comfort? but he cried out; <hi>My God, my
God</hi> ſtill. This Speech much refreſhed
that godly Miniſter. Others of God's
Children have wanted ſenſible Comfort
at their Death, yet they have been able to
act Faith, and to ſay, <hi>My God, my God</hi>
ſtill. Tho' God's <hi>ſenſible Preſence</hi> is not
ſtill <hi>the ſame,</hi> yet <hi>his Word</hi> and <hi>Promiſe is;</hi>
he ſpeaks as comfortably in his Word as
ever, he cannot deny his own Word.
God ſometimes withdraws Comfort, that
we may prize his Word more, and depend
more upon that: You pleaſe and honour
God moſt, when you can venture your
Souls on his bare Word and Promiſe. A
Faith of Recumbency on Chriſt in the
want of Comfort, doth more honour God
than the higheſt Faith of Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould <hi>Death</hi> be a Terror to them
that fear God? none need to fear Death,
that are eſcaped from the Dominion of Sin
and the Devil. Can you ſay you do not
love Chriſt, and that you do love Sin?
then there is cauſe enough for fear; but
this were to bely the bleſſed Spirit: <hi>The
godly hath hope in his Death:</hi> A hope of
Life, even at the Point of Death. A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Man's hope can never fail him, he may
want ſenſible Comfort, but he doth <hi>hope</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:37242:92"/>
ſtill. Death, 'tis a going to God; and
ſhall a godly Man be afraid of going to
his God? Again, it is a Sleep, a Reſt; are
weary Men afraid of rheir Reſt, and of
going to ſleep? If Death be an Enemy, 'tis
a ſlain Enemy; Chriſt hath been the Death
of Death: And why ſhould that have Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in it, that hath no Life in it? A godly
Man is a real Gainer by Death: He gains
more by his Death, than ever he got all
his Life long, <hi>viz.</hi> Happineſs and Joy that

Relations here, yet Death can never

Grace doth this for Believers: The Curſe,

they are Gainers by all, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. Tho'
our outward man,</hi> &amp;c. All works for their

Curſe, but Believers have Croſſes with a
Bleſſing. The Guilt of Sin, the Grace of
God in Chriſt doth quite take away from
all Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. Pardoning Mercy
clears the Soul of Guilt. What Comfort
is this to ſuch, that by the Grace of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

of Chriſt their Righteouſneſs, they may

the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking
Flax. Tho' thy Faith be ſo ſmall, that it
yields not Light to others, nor Heat to thy

it.</hi> But can a Man have the Exerciſe of
Grace, and not know it; fear God, and
not diſcern it? I anſwer, Yes, ſome Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may then be acted, and diſcerned by
others, as well as at any other time. He
