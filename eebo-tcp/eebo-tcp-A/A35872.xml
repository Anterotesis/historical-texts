         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I and my Ally <hi>Sultan,</hi> are both come <hi>in propriis Personis,</hi> to thank the Master of the Christian Temple for his late Book, which perhaps may do us more Service than all the Mercenary Pens of <hi>France,</hi> or than all our Dragoons and Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries. I have now God Almighty's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and an irresistable Power in <hi>Lorrain, Franch Comte, Strasburgh, Treves, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi>; though I confess, I ravish'd them away from their legal Owners, contrary to my own Oaths and sacred Treaties; yet Heaven justifies me by her Oracle Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> who proclaims to all the World, that Providence brought these things to pass, and that God has deputed me his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent with an uncontroulable Commission. The <hi>Lorrainers</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> must now fight against God, if they fight against me or for their lawful Dukes.</p>

               <speaker>Great Turk.</speaker>
               <p>My Case is the same; this Christian Priest has pleaded my Divine Authority over the Holy Land, and Christ's Sepulchre: If the <hi>Vizier</hi> had taken <hi>Vienna</hi> in the year 1683, and had swallowed all the Roman Empire, where could have been the Perfidy, and the Treachery, which <hi>Christendom</hi> brands us <hi>Mahometans</hi> with, and which our <hi>Mufti</hi> has often thrown in our faces; seeing the great <hi>English</hi> Apostle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes all to Providence, and seals all Success with the Finger of God Almighty? Upon our Settlement in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives had been oblig'd to bear Allegiance to us, and never to restore their Emperor and Electors.</p>

               <p>Pox, Catzo; my Brother Dr. stole that School-boy's Notion out of <hi>Lucan; Victrix causa dijs placuit</hi>: But yet the great <hi>Cato</hi> (whom Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> might have plac'd in his immortal Essay of Heroick Vertue) was of another Opinion, and could by no Flattery nor Promise, be brought to call <hi>Caesar</hi> a Ruler. If his Priests had told him, that the Gods had brought all that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and that Heaven had Ordain'd and Commission'd <hi>Caesar</hi> to be Irresistible Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Rome,</hi> how would his Vertue, and his Constancy, seated on the true brow of Majesty, have thrown disdain upon those vile Sycophants, and Betrayers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? <hi>Si quis potestatem Populi Romani laeserit, Is morte puniendus.</hi>

               <p>Methinks, Gentlemen, you are very merry, and familiar, considering you are God's Representatives. How came that impudent Dr. of Divinity into your Company?

one day <hi>Christian,</hi> another day <hi>Turk,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neither. Now, Brother Doctor, I never fill my head with these Chimerical, Fairy fancies of things done in Heaven, I look only upon Men and Things, upon Laws and Compacts; whilst thou, poor man, dream'st in thy Study, all vapour'd with Hypocondriack Enthusiasm, tickled with Visions, or else swell'd with Envy, Pride or Ambition; I drink Coffee amongst the <hi>Beaux Esprits, mores hominum video &amp; urbes,</hi> and hear more truth in one day from those fellows you call Atheists, than from a 130 Pulpits in a Year; they all believe in one God, are of no Sect, or Cabal, under no prejudice of Education or Interest, are neither Jews, Turks, nor Christians, but all <hi>Tamerlanes.</hi>

               <speaker>French King.</speaker>
               <p>This Pillory-Doctor has the most Wit of the two; I perceive he has had better Education: However Brother <hi>Sultan,</hi> the Visionary Doctor is for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for he Damns the <hi>Huguenots</hi> now in Arms against me, all the <hi>Vaudoies,</hi> and all the <hi>Prince of Orang</hi>'s Friends, who took up Arms against God's Authority; but the Devil is in this Doctor, who at the same time runs down my dear Ally <hi>Teckely,</hi> and sets up my mortal Enemy <hi>Frederick William</hi> with God's Commission; tho' that's my comfort the Doctor unmans the People of <hi>England,</hi> puts them all into Hell, takes away their Arms of Laws, and the Weapons of their Senate, destroys the basis of their State, Acts of Convention and Parliament, and sets the Prince up in a floating Enchanted Castle in the Air, built by <hi>Centaurs, Hobgoblin</hi>'s, <hi>Bo</hi>'s, <hi>Nick,</hi> &amp;c. As for the Doctor's new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Heaven that he fastens to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> whether he will or no, I care not a rush for it; my Friend <hi>James</hi> will soon cancel that, for he still retains his Right, and wants nothing but Possession. I'le see next Summer what 120 Men of War, and 30000 Land-men will do; but then this Divelish Doctor robs me of all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of all the Power; for Providence must do the feat, and <hi>James</hi> derive all his Authority from God; no thanks to my Arms, or Money; and the Doctor curses the People that shall offer to assist his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Legal <hi>James</hi>; so that in the main he breaks our heads, and then gives us a Plaister, and seems resolv'd to fall like a Cat upon his Feet: Sometimes he plays the <hi>Williamite,</hi> but in a fools Coat, sometimes the <hi>Jacobite</hi> under a Vizard; sometimes he tells the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 'tis Damnation to Fight for the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>; then a little while after 'tis Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Fight against him: 'Twas Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Year 88, to Fight against <hi>Jemmy</hi>; and now 'tis the same Sin to fight for him; so that this famous Doctor plays the Merry Andrew with the World, and like the <hi>Powder of Pimper le Pimp,</hi> turns up what <hi>Trump</hi> the Knave of Clubs calls for.</p>
