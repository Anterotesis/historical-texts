            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVICE TO THE ARMY, On their Going to France and Ireland.</head>
            <p>IF I had not known (my Brave and Valiant Soldiers) that your Spirit and Courage deſireth rather the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Renown of God, than your own proper ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I would never have ventured my ſelf under your Affiance and Valour. And for that I well know the Renown and Fame of our Predeceſſors, who have obtained in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo many Victories, will ſtir up in you (my Loving Companions) Courage to follow their Steps and Honourable Endeavours, and that the Memory of their Exploits, and Glorious Acts, may be as prevailent in you, as they have been in your Predeceſſors, in conſidering the things which may now Eternalize you; I doubt not at any Hand, but you will cauſe your Valiantneſs and Vertues to appear through the World, and eſpecially in thoſe Quarters, where we ſhall ſee more ſtore of Enemies than Friends, and where we muſt with the Edge of our Sword make our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; being in a Countrey which moſt of us have never ſeen; where is no great Surety to repoſe any Confidence; and where Infinite Dangers do abound; and the Armies which already are prepared againſt the French, and Popiſh Party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are Motives which may Induce them to fear, of which we ought to make our Benefit; to cauſe our Prudence, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Dexterity of Spirit to be known (which are Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues more deſired than any other) in that thereby men ſhall ſee the Boldneſs and Courage of you, and the Faith and End of that Inviolable Oath, which we all have made to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religion:</hi> Behold we are ready to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark, which ſhould cauſe us all to rejoyce; and not to follow Corporal and Effeminate Pleaſures, which make a Man weak, ſickly, and Tender; but to aſpire to Honour, Riches, and Victory, and to have the Reward of our Honourable Deeds, ſuch as ſhall be yielded to us by Proſperous Fortune; which I doubt not but It will be ſuch towards us, that of Terreſtrial Men, it will make us Coeleſtial, and Sound in the Air ſo Honourable a Bruite of our worthy Names, that neither Time nor Death ſhall obſcure, nor rake it up in Oblivion; but we ſhall live time out of Memory, yea Eternally. And for that we are now to deal with People, who differ not much from our Cuſtoms and Manner of Living; of whom it behoveth us to win their Love and Liking by Policy and Diſcretion, to our Devotion, Will, and Friendſhip; we muſt be very Modeſt, Temperate and Quiet, and muſt baniſh Avarice, deſpiſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, and contemn the Pleaſures of the Body; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all muſt fly all Idleneſs, which how hurtful it is to an Army, and how many Evils it bringeth with it, you ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conceive. Beſides, we muſt avoid Robberies, preſerve the Honour of Women, reſpect Ancient Perſons, have care of poor Children, to live amongſt your ſelves as obſervers of true Religion, to favour the Friends thereof, and purſue the Enemies; and think that we being in a ſtrange Country, and in another mans Houſe, to do but that which you would do at home: We ſeeing by experience that every Beaſt, though never ſo little, being in his Den becometh as a Lyon, in defending himſelf from the injury and oppreſſion, which is offered him; and Judging thereby how much more they ought, and will become Couragious and hardy in their own Houſes, if they ſee, or feel themſelves Out-raged by us. Beſides, ye ought in all your Actions, to have God always before your Eyes, for the Love and Honor, of whom we ought to expoſe our Bodies and lives; and thereby manifeſting our ſelves meek and curious, one to another; and towards our Enemies, Fierce, Bold, Terrible Fearful, Prompt, and Hardy; to cauſe others to Know that we are Couragious without Fear, Wiſe, and full of Underſtanding; that by ſuch means, you may always have together with Health, a high way to Virtue, ſet open before you; and that every one of you may with me, carry into his Country, Renown and Eternal Memory: not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any Pain or Travel; for that no Wearineſs, nor any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, or Croſſes, can, or ought ever to enter into ſuch Vigilent or Heroical Spirits, whereby to darken or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the deſire, and earneſt affections, which proceedeth from true Honor, and Glory: And eſpecially, I being with you; not as a Commander amongſt you, but as a Father, or Brother, and Companion, as well in adverſity as in proſperity. And to that end you may aſſure your ſelves, that it's true I have ſaid, my ſelf will be the firſt, and will not refuſe any danger that will befall me; to the end, that by this Example, every one of you may learn, rather to eſteem Honor and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then his own proper Life, and prefer an Honorable Death, before a vile and diſhoneſt Life.</p>
