         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet <hi>I</hi> ſay not, that you have been the fountain of all this. For you my lay-children (for the moſt part) cannot complain for want of teaching, ſince you have followed ſo little, and plaid the wantons with your bread.</p>
            <p>And if their ſins would ſpur away as faſt as they, <hi>I</hi> ſhould complain of no other infirmity.

Thus having reduced my ſelf to the Proverb, <hi>Like People like Prieſt</hi>; and no ſooner did thoſe ſons of <hi>Corah</hi> blow the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of ſedition, but preſently my multitudes and ſtrength, which ſhould have been a Safeguard to the King and Kingdom, <hi>I</hi> did rebelliouſly ſacrifice

to the ruine of both: And the better to make Religion and Reformation a pretence for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, <hi>I</hi> impoſed Oaths and Covenants on my children, contrary to the Lawes of God, the Command of my King, the Law of the Land, and mine own Conſcience. <hi>I</hi> no ſooner had brought to paſſe that wicked device which I had plotted againſt the Church, my King, the Kingdom, and mine own ſoul, but preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe Oaths and Proteſtations wickedly betrayed the beſt of Kings into the treacherous hands of the worſt of men. And though with <hi>Judas</hi> I repented my ſelf, and would have no hand in his death, yet when it was done I was not truly humbled for ſo grievous a ſin, but ſtill with <hi>Ahab</hi> went on to do wickedly. And ſince, though God hath by a marvellous hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, reſtored our Gracious Sovereign, whom God long preſerve, unto the Throne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Judges being as at the firſt, and my Counſellors as at the beginning, the Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in its primitive Purity, by enjoying its Liturgie, teaching my children as well how as to whom to pray; or if they would be ſo pious as to <hi>pray by the ſpirit,</hi> our Holy Mother the Church hath ſufficiently provided, they may <hi>pray with underſtanding alſo</hi>; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have remained as ſchiſmatical as ever, being as unthankful under Mercies, as <hi>I</hi> was incorrigible under Judgments.

taken us in hand himſelf; as <hi>David</hi> calls it, <hi>the Chaſtiſement of his own hand, Let me fall into the Hand of God.</hi> A diſeaſe, that was the laſt blow that God took at <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the common ſcourge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and uſually ſet on by an Angel, whoſe ſtroak moved the mud of mans nature to his own ruine, which elſe lyeth ſtill and ſetled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes man ſome other way in time. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe, that <hi>I</hi> have heard related, that ſome of my Siſter Cities have been infected by ſtrange accidents: but <hi>God is my Maſter,</hi> and not Fortune my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, ſome ſay the Infection hapneth by conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latious, ominoes aſpects, evil conjunctions, unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable weathers, but theſe muſt extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then beyond a City, and her Suburbs, becauſe in theſe occurrents the aire is rainted, and then not kept within the compaſſe of one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Hemiſphere.</p>
            <p>Some have been (they ſay) infected by meer ſtinks: they are noiſom indeed, but have no more relation to kill this way by a Plague, then by other wayes and diſeaſes, which they may breed and bring to paſſe. Bad fumes are diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that I am much troubled withal by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my noiſom children, and idle ſervants, but yet my breath is not ſo obnoxious as is reported: for if it were, five would die to one that doth die, it being the common breath, by which all with me doth live; and being there is two weak bodies for one ſtrong (counting women and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And beſide, if my breath were infectious, then would thoſe creatures, whoſe nature have affinity with man (as Swine, Cocks and Hens) receive

ſuch infections in the ſtreets, as would forthwith ſlay them, though they were not kept up in Plagued houſes. Therefore do not ſcandal me, and adde affliction to the afflicted, but conſider <hi>God is my Rock, and his Word is my Pillar, and the ground of Truth.</hi> I know that God may uſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means to infect and ſuffocate. But leaſt we ſhould lean too much to nature, he doth not (in Scripture) reveal this diſeaſe ſo executed: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth expreſs it done by an Angel,<note place="margin">Numb, 19.45.</note> or elſe doth ſilence the execution thereof in a mute anger. <hi>Job</hi> was ſmitten with ſcab<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. And therefore for Gods cauſe, leſt you detract from his honour, lay it upon me. <hi>I</hi> know that thoſe houſes, wherein God hath ſmitten one (for want of care and means,) may and do taint others, but what is this to my breath, or that men ſhould think therefore that <hi>I</hi> am totally infected. Or if one go abroad out of ſuch a houſe into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and there (becauſe they have not been aired firſt) taint an other (as we ſurmiſe): or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one being afraid of another, their heart faint, and their blood turnes, and they die of the <hi>plague,</hi> their paſſions (though not ſtrucken) helping to work the humours of their bodies to a ſore; is this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

to forget the operation of God in this <hi>Plague,</hi> or condemn me, or leave me utterly deſolate? God hath ſaid, that <hi>he will ſend evil Angels</hi> among us, yet theſe can but vex them to whom their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence extends; yet <hi>I</hi> make no doubt, but God makes the Peſtilence ordinarily to cleave to a man by infection, but this doth not hold always that he doth ſo, and when it doth take one by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is not always mortal.</p>
            <p>And this is the infirmitie, with which I am at this time afflicted. And that <hi>I</hi> draw you not into error, take the judgment of other Ancients, and let none think by an obſcure evaſion, to make me the more to be ſhunned in neceſſary neighborly comfort, by ſaying the <hi>Plague</hi> in Scripture and ours were not all one; becauſe theirs were ſudden, ours were lingring. For God made thoſe ſharp, that <hi>wee</hi> which were to live under the times of mercy, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.11.</note>
               <hi>might be warned by his Severity to them.</hi> And if he had ſuffered them to have lived under the ſtroak as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, it would have broken out of them, as it did on him and us at this day. God is more merciful to us then, who by ſpace between his ſtroaks calleth to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But let not us abuſe this mercy, and cry out raſhly, and childiſhly (before God toucheth us) that all <hi>London</hi> is infected. Indeed lying and breathing under Gods ſtroak, oftentimes infects others: hath not God therefore given you learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to your brethren, to help you with Preſervatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the infection, though they cannot recover the fiſh that is ſtrucken? And if we uſe theſe good means, hath not God given us his Word, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110426:9"/>
declares his power, in reſtraining not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but the violence of his <hi>Devouring Angel alſo,</hi> as our King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory called it in his Parliament-Oration. And have not our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> moſt worthily and carefully provided to ſhut them up, or diſpoſe of them elſewhere, who have been ſtrucken: Which courſe might do ſome good, but that we lack perſons and purſes to keep in, and keep the ſick when they are within. All theſe things being obſerved, <hi>I</hi> need not be left like <hi>Job on a dunghil,</hi> nor my infirmity be ſo much ſhunned, that I and my children ſhould be ſo many miles ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>The Venereal Pox is ten times a baſer diſeaſe and more abſolutely infectious, yet my ſonnes (I ſhame to own them) that have it, are called <hi>Good-fellows.</hi> Men will not ſtand upon it to drink either Wine or Tobacco with them, who are more fit (not for the <hi>Peſthouſe</hi>) but the <hi>Piſtrinum,</hi> the <hi>Bridewel.</hi> The <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions</hi> never ſhun to cure theſe, but becauſe the hand of God is upon me, and a leſs infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, though more pernitious; <hi>I</hi> am ſhunned of ſom <hi>Pastors and people, Phyſicians and Chyrurgions,</hi> as if they ſtayed, they ſhould be all dead men; whereas this diſeaſe is a picking and culling out of men, to ſet forward (as in a muſter) which cauſeth it to take at the beginning one here, and another half a mile off, then leap thither again, where it was firſt, and take them away, which at firſt it left, (as the weekly Bills teſtifie) neither can it be proved, that all theſe have by any contracting or conventing ever met together, eſpecially ſince houſes were ſhut up. So that (as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>

ſaith) this diſeaſe hath an hidden beginning, and why not an hidden proceſſion? But only that in continuance, ſome accidents do befall, upon which our reaſon hath more ground to traverſe and diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But ſom will ſay, the <hi>Plague</hi> is mortally infectious, and therefore it is wilful murder to ſtay if <hi>I</hi> may go. <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay ſo, <hi>If it be thy place and calling to ſtay</hi> But <hi>I</hi> ſay, thou then doſt kill them wilfully (by thine own argument) whom thou leaveſt behind, or ſetteſt to keep thy ſick: except thou thinkeſt that ſervants and poor keepers may be killed up by authority.</p>
            <p>But ſurely, if it were but well obſerved, my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie rather deſerveth an humble reverence, then to breed a ſcandal, or an offence.

But as it is ſecretly hidden from the Heathen (as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates)</hi> who grant the beginning thereof to be very ſecret: ſo the Scriptures declare unto us that hidden beginning, that ſo we might know under what covert to hide us. The 91 <hi>Pſalme</hi> tells us in verſe the 1.4. <hi>Of the ſhadow and wings of the Almighty.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlates that <hi>Pſalm</hi> where we find the word <hi>Pestilence,</hi> by the word (<gap reason="foreign">

The Scriptures call us to an outward admiration of this wonderful work, and an inward adoration of God who is the Enlarger and Reſtrainer hereof, who makes ſuch ſweet Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the 91 <hi>Pſalm</hi> concerning deliverance from it; as, <hi>Thou ſhalt go on the Aſp and the Dragon.</hi> Which <hi>Mellerus</hi> on that <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſaith, ſignifies <hi>the Pestilence,</hi> and uſed by the <hi>Pſalmiſt; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vim veneni ſignificantius exprimeret</hi>; yet not the force of it to infect, but to kill; for the ſting of the <hi>Aſp</hi> poiſons but thoſe whom it ſtrikes, it imparts not the ſame force to another, not <hi>contacta,</hi> no not by touching of the body ſo ſtung.

My tinckling feet, and my tiptoe pace, my horned Tyaraes, and criſped curled locks, ſhinne-pride and ſhooe pride, fullneſſe of bread hath made me lift my heel againſt my Maker. <hi>I ſaid in my proſperity I ſhould never be moved; but thou, O Lord, haſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy face, and I am troubled.</hi> My children have bin ſo full fed, that they have fallen out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the meaneſt thinking themſelves as good as the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and the <hi>mighty</hi> refuſing to look upon the cauſe of the <hi>mean.</hi> My <hi>Merchants</hi> have been the <hi>Companions of Princes,</hi> but now are gone, their place is ſcarce to be found. How hath my back groaned with heavy burdens, and now <hi>Iſſachar ſtands ſtill for want of work.</hi> One waine may carry all <hi>I</hi> ſell in a day. <hi>I</hi> have had ſuch trading that I could ſcarce finde time to ſerve God, but now every day is an Holy-day, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have prophaned his Holy day</hi> (even his bleſſed Sabbath) <hi>which have been dedicated to him, as a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his glorious Reſurrection.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> have lyen dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes. I <hi>have given libertie to my ſervants to execute their wills in Sabbath-breaking, and deceiving:</hi> now God hath <hi>proclaimed libertie for them to the Peſtilence, to wandring, to idleneſſe</hi> My ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices

have been the <hi>children of Knights and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Countrey,</hi> (which they accepted at my hands joyfully) but now my children are caſt out by <hi>thoſe ſwains like dung, rated like beggars, ſerved like ſwine in hogſtyes, buried in the high way like Malefactors.</hi> But whither doth my grief tranſport me? <hi>This the Countrey ſhall hear of hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have opened my <hi>Coffers</hi> to the <hi>Countries wants</hi> full often, and have ſom of them <hi>in bonds still,</hi> but now <hi>I</hi> want it for my poor Children, and they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look to diſcharge their debt, nor in requital of my kindneſſe will ſhew pity to my diſperſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have had feaſts admired at, whoſe very ſight hath cloy'd the appetite, and my very <hi>Reaſon</hi> hath turned <hi>Ccok</hi> to cocker the p<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>late of my Wantons, I would thoſe feaſtings had ſtocked my poor <hi>kindred</hi> in my <hi>Suburbs,</hi> and ſet them to work, <hi>that there might be no complaining in my ſtreets: with which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice God would be well-pleaſed.</hi> The worſt ſervant in my houſe hath had <hi>bread enough,</hi> and <hi>now</hi> I <hi>starve for hanger:</hi> for many of my children cry for bread, and <hi>I</hi> feare me die of the <hi>Stomack Sickneſſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>Spotted Sickneſſe,</hi> if there were a Bill could be gotten of all diſeaſes. <hi>Davids</hi> tears are my repaſt; his ſighs my repoſe. <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſage is the newes moſt rife on my Exchange. One robs me of my Aſſes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Camels, my Sheep are conſumed, my Children are bruiſed, my ſelf ſtrucken with boiles and ſores. <hi>I</hi> ſee nothing but my nakedneſs. <hi>Thoſe great Gates</hi> which were wont to be furniſhed with ſpangled ſtar-like beauties, are now the lodging for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110426:13"/>
poor Children, or places for dung and draught. <hi>My Chamber and Treaſury,</hi> which was wont to be my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, can no more ſupply my wants, it hath been ſo ſwept; Beſide, the <hi>ſtock of my Corporations</hi> hath been broken to maintain my wants, and yet my Children <hi>cry for bread:</hi> and their brethren that remain are preſſed with their maintenance, and urged almoſt beyond their ability to finde them neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>This miſery makes me again remember my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who have wiſhed for ſome meanes that might conſume ſome of my Children, <hi>I</hi> being not able to maintain them, and <hi>God</hi> hath now ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to my ungracious deſires; for he hath taken them away who might have ſerved for my defence. And now <hi>I</hi> ſee, when God ſends mouths, he ſends meat alſo, for though <hi>I</hi> have buried ſo many thouſand, <hi>I</hi> have nothing more then I had in wealth or trading; Nay, there are many who would be glad their houſes were viſited, that they might be kept by the pariſh, becauſe they have nothing to eat. Yet <hi>I</hi> have ſome wicked wretches, who have learned of ſome <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-farmers when they want, to grumble againſt God for ſomthing, and when they have Gods plenty to murmur for nothing.</hi> For their eye is evil becauſe Gods is good.</p>
            <p>When they have Corne enough, they ſay it is worth nothing, and they can make no money of it; but they can make themſelves Curſes with it, for hording it up, when they ſhould make bread of it for the poor. It they have bread for their Babes, and food for their Hinds, and proviſion for their Beaſts, and a reaſonable price for the remainder; have they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110426:14"/>
not ſufficient? Yes more then they deſerve, Such as theſe have helped to hale a Curſe from God, and by their means it is I am ſo lean in looks, ſo lank in purſe, ſo emptie in ſtomack. But <hi>I</hi> have deſerved my ſelf more then all theſe puniſhments doubled, yet ſhall they ſcape who help to encreaſe them? No. That is my feare, that God hath not yet done, and my grief, that mine own Children ſhould far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke him, and help to aggravate my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</p>
            <p>For <hi>I</hi> am not only weak by ſickneſſe, poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of meanes, but forſaken, being deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and forlorn of Company. But here lies my Comfort.<note place="margin">Pſalm 9.18.</note> 
               <hi>The Poor ſhall not alwayes be forgotten; the expectation of the needie ſhall not periſh for ever.</hi> And although it may be asked in reſpect of my <hi>Babylouiſh ſinnes,</hi> how is <hi>that golden Citie ceaſed?</hi> Yet I have this <hi>hope</hi> in Gods mercy, that <note place="margin">Iſa. 14.4, 30</note>

            <p>There be others whoſe company I miſſe, namely, thoſe whom God hath given in great abundance, whoſe very Houſe keeping might have relieved ſome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed others: but their countenance and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of faſting and praying, would have encouraged all, but they are gone, and they neglect to employ that Talent which God hath given them in charge; But ſome Charitable and ſincere perſons ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with us, <hi>He that giveth to the Poor lendeth unto the Lord:</hi> the Charitable perſon ſhall be bleſſed, and happy are thoſe perſons that ſhall fully execute their

            <p>But the higher my childrens groans riſe, the more I look about me, and the more help I ſtill miſs.

            <p>One of my worthy Sonnes, a Doctor of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> did much blame you in a time of the <hi>Plague,</hi> for your unnatural ſtarting one from another.

We do the <hi>Pagans</hi> wrong to put this fearfulneſſe on them, for they ſtrive to do the uttermoſt duties to the ſick, and the dead. It is now Chriſtian fearefulneſſe, the more our ſhame.</p>
            <p>Some of you will ſay, that God it may be ſent it to ſcatter the Cittie, and puniſh the pride thereof that way: that is hidden from thee, though likelie: but thou knoweſt, that <hi>God uſeth to ſend croſses for ſinne, and yet withal to try us whether we will cleave to him or no.</hi> But you have forſaken him, his Word, and me alſo.

be endangered. Beſide, their affairs are ſuch as that they may be conſidered of in other places as well as here. For want of theſe conſiderations <hi>I</hi> am almoſt beggered, <hi>I</hi> was at a <hi>low ebbe before,</hi> by an unnatural rebellion againſt my Sovereign, but <hi>now it is full flood with me, but of miſerie,</hi> becauſe of my ſin.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, I</hi> hope it will purge my body from bad humours, as vitious perſons: Nay, I know it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of abundance, and the reſt will ſtand (<hi>I</hi> hope) in more awe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>again,</hi> It ſavours of mercy, in that the poor is taken from him, that is to ſtrong for him (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this hard world) and God hath made more room under me.

            <p>Some good men are taken away, and many lay it not to heart. <hi>I</hi> could not well ſpare them, but only for the Lord, here is ſo few upon the earth.
