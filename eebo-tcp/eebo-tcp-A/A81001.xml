            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T having pleaſed the Lord, by the manifold Mercies and Deliverances which he hath wrought in and for theſe Nations of late Years, and the Bleſsings wherewith he hath bleſſed the Endeavors of the Good People thereof, in making them Succeſsful againſt his and their Enemies, to crown Vs with this, as not the leaſt Token of his Favor and Good Will to Vs, That there is a free and uninterrupted Paſſage of the Goſpel running through the midſt of Vs, and Liberty for all to hold forth and profeſs with ſobriety, their Light and Knowledge therein, according as the Lord in his rich Grace and Wiſdom hath diſpenced to every man, and with the ſame Freedom to practice and exerciſe the Faith of the Goſpel, and to lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, without any Interruption from the Powers God hath ſet over this Commonwealth, nay with all juſt and due Encouragement thereto, and Protection in ſo doing by the ſame; A Mercy that is the Price of much Blood, and till of late years denyed to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at this day it continues to be to moſt of the Nations round about Vs, and which all that fear God amongſt Vs ought duly to conſider and be thankful for in this Day, wherein God hath ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Viſited and Redeemed his People; His Highneſs, as He reckons it a Duty incumbent upon him, and ſhall take all poſsible Care to Preſerve and Continue this Freedom and Liberty to all Perſons in this Commonwealth fearing God, though of differing Iudgements, by protecting them in the ſober and quiet exerciſe and profeſsion of Religion, and the ſincere worſhip of God, againſt all ſuch who ſhall; by impoſing upon the Conſciences of their Brethren, or offering violence to their Perſons, or any other way, ſeek to hinder them therein; So likewiſe doth He hold himſelf equally obliged to take Care, That, on no pretence whatſoever, ſuch freedom given ſhould be extended by any beyond thoſe bounds which the Royal Law of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Moderation</hi> have ſet us in our walking one towards another; Or that thereby occaſion ſhould be taken by any to abuſe this Liberty to the diſturbance or diſquiet of any of their Brethren in the ſame free Exerciſe of their Faith and Worſhip, which himſelf enjoies of his own. And His Highneſs cannot but ſadly lament the woful diſtemper that is fallen upon the Spirits of many profeſsing Religion and the Fear of God in theſe dayes, who inſtead of a ſuitable return to the Lord our God for this Liberty, and all our other Mercies, and appearing in an anſwerable carriage by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of tenderneſs and forbearance one towards another, and provoking one another to Love and good Works, are found in a Spirit of bitterneſs towards their Brethren, biting and devouring, hateful and hating one another, and whileſt they pretend the Liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his People, do openly and avowedly, by rude and unchriſtian Practices, diſturb both the Publique and Private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for preaching the Word, and other Religious Exerciſes, and vilifie, oppoſe, and interrupt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Preachers in their Miniſtery, whereby the Liberty of the Goſpel, the profeſsion of Religion, and the Name of God, is much diſhonoured and abuſed, and the Spirits of all good men much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. His Highneſs therefore, having had many informations from divers parts of this Commonwealth of ſuch Practices by divers men lately riſen up under the names of <hi>Quakers, Ranters,</hi> and others, who do daily both reproach and diſturb the Aſſemblies and Congregations of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in their Publique and Private Meetings, and interrupt the Preachers in diſpenſing the Word, and others in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, contrary to juſt Liberty, and to the diſturbance of the Publique Peace, Doth hold himſelf obliged by His Truſt to Declare His diſlike of all ſuch Practices, as being contrary to the juſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Liberties of the People, which by the Laws and Government of this Commonwealth they ought to be Protected in; And doth hereby ſtrictly Require and Command all Perſons whatſoever, That they forbear henceforth all ſuch irregular and diſorderly Practices. And if in Contempt hereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons ſhall preſume to offend as aforeſaid, We ſhall eſteem them as Diſturbers of the Civil Peace, and ſhall expect, and do require all Officers and Miniſters of Iuſtice to proceed againſt them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
