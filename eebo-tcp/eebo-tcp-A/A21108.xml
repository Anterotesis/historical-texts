            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:5744:3"/>
remedie thereof: and yet the notorious neglect and wayward vnwillingnes of the people of this Land, our English Nation, to regard and accept such Offers, and to seeke and take their own good: I thought I might doe a worke worth the labour, and (in all likely hood) gratefull and vsefull to my Country and Countrimen, to write something, (and the rather, for that none that I know, hath yet trauelled this way) that might stirre and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, specially the common and meaner sort of them, as whom chiefly, and most of all it doth concerne, to make better vse of these faire, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and necessary opportunities.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I haue in a plaine and familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (as one that intended to submit himselfe to the capacitie and vnderstanding, euen of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,<note place="margin">The summe of he whole Treatise.</note> for whom specially this my labour I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.) First, declared and iustified these kinde of Attempts, Plantations, to tend notably to the glory of Almightie God, the enlargement of the Kings Maiesties Dominions, and the manifold and inestimable benefit of this whole Land, the Realme of <hi>England;</hi> and to bee in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lawfull and iust, ancient and vsuall. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I haue shewed some particular meanes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour courses, how and whereby, both men and
<pb facs="tcp:5744:3"/>
money, the two principall things that must plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully be had for Plantations, may easily and speedily be raised and procured in and out of our Land for this purpose. And thirdly, I haue giuen and set downe some particular Instructions and obseruations touching these Actions, not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy happely the Notion and Consideration of many such as yet are little acquainted with them; and added some speciall <hi>Motiues,</hi> for a present Plantation in <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> before and aboue any other place of Plantation yet attempted. Withal, in euery of these passages, I haue answered all such, either <hi>reall</hi> (or rather <hi>Regionall</hi>) or <hi>personall Obiections,</hi> as commonly are made against the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes themselues, why they should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, or by persons that should employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the enterprizes, why they should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture therein?</p>
            <p>These plaine, but I hope plausible and profitable Labours of mine, I am bold, and humbly desire your Lordships both, that I may be bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the open view and consideration of this Land, vnder the Patronage &amp; protection of your Honourable Names: The one of you being my much &amp; worthily honoured Diocesan; the other my worthy and fauourable Patron: both speciall
<pb facs="tcp:5744:4"/>
Fautours of all good Learning, and furtherers of all goodly Indeuours; and therefore, such as I hope and presume will vouchsafe these Labours of mine, and these worthy, pious, and religious (if they be worthily, piously, &amp; religiously handled) these notable Attempts, and for our Land at this present most necessarie and expedient, your best furtherance and countenance: not doubting but that thereby both my Indeuours shall the better be respected and receiued, and the Actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the more aduanced and followed, I shall be shielded from the malicious enuie of the carping Cauiller, that takes more delight, and can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bestow more labor and time in deprauing what others haue done, then in setting forth and publishing, I say not any better, but any like and as good of his owne: and they (the Actions) shall be shrowded from the <hi>canine</hi> vnkindnesse of those lazie Lurdans that will neither take the good of them themselues, nor suffer, by their good will, any other to doe it.</p>
            <p>One reason more particular hath moued me to tender to your Lordships these my Labours, and that is, for that the one of you is resident in that Citie, as in his proper and <hi>Episcopal Sea:</hi> the other in the next neighboring both Citie and Country,
<pb facs="tcp:5744:4"/>
which either by it selfe in generall, or by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of the worshipfull Citizens thereof, in particular, hath alreadie begun, and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent continueth a Plantation in <hi>New-found-Land:</hi> which I therefore hope will be an occasion that may moue your good Lordships both, this way to doe to the Places of your owne aboad (which truly by reason of the number of people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are cloyed and ouerlaid, doe as greatly need these helps, as any Cities or Counties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) much good and benefit. Which thing, I am perswaded, you may easily and greatly effect, if you will be pleased, but to shew your selues in countenancing and assisting me and others, that doe and will employ our selues in them, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and fauour, to allow and like of these kind of Labours and Indeuours, and namely, that wherein your owne people and so neere Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are alreadie so farre interessed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Iesus, the high Bishop of our Soules,</hi> vouchsafe vnto your Lordships, whom he hath called to be <hi>Principall Pastors</hi> in this his Church of England, such plentifull store of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gifts, and so guide you by his Holy Spirit,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ther men, diners, haue laboured seuerally in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and commending, one this Countrey, another that: as Captaine <hi>Whitbourne, New-found-Land;</hi> Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> his <hi>New-England;</hi> Master <hi>Harecourt Guiana;</hi> and some others, more then one or two, <hi>Virginia</hi> And euerie of these hath vsed sundry Motiues for the aduancement of a Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the place by him most affected; all tending to this maine end: <hi>To moue our people of England, to plant themselues abroad, and free themselues of that penurie and perill of want, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue at home.</hi> But none that I know hath handled the point in generall, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew the benefit and the good; the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the ancient and frequent vse; the facilitie and necessitie (that is indeed, if I may so speake, <hi>the Doctrine) of Plantations.</hi> That taske therefore, haue I vndertaken, which how I haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I leaue to others to iudge; requesting this at your hands <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolent and curteous Readers)</hi> that you obserue and consider: First, That I am the first that hath broken this Ice, and searched out this way; and that therefore it must needs be to me more rough and rude, then if I had passed a smooth water, and gone along in an vsuall and beaten path. Secondly, That my whole purpose and intent is, principally and specially to doe some good this way, for and with the meaner sort of our people: to whose capacitie therefore, it was fit, and more then fit, necessarie, that I should fit and frame my speech. That obserued, I doubt not but you will, not onely beare with, but also approue of my plainnesse, as best befitting my purpose to worke; and my subiect to worke vpon: the more learned and iudicious sort, I freely and ingeniously acknowledge my selfe more desirous to haue my Teachers and directours in this kind of Learning, then my Readers and Followers.</p>
            <p>If any thinke it a point beyond my Compasse, for a Diuine by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to deale with an argument of this Nature, <hi>viz. to intreat</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5744:6"/>
               <hi>of Plantations,</hi> which are commonly taken to be a matter altogether of Temporall and Secular right. Let him be pleased to know: First, That I am not alone, nor the first in this attempt, but haue for my president the precedent examples of some farre before me in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Knowledge; as Master <hi>Hackluit,</hi> who long since wrote a great Volumne of <hi>English Voiages,</hi> Master <hi>Crashaw</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> in <hi>Virginia;</hi> who haue both employed their Pens and paines for that Plantation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Plantations are Actions wherein we also of the Cleargie are as farre interessed as any other. They are as free for vs, as for others: and, if men will haue any hope that they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in their hands, we must haue a distinct part, a certaine share, and Cleargie-like Portion in them, as well as men of other places and qualities haue theirs. And therefore, to write and discourse of, and for them, it behoueth, and becommeth vs of the Cleargie, as well, and as much as any other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That one proper, and principall end of Plantations, is, or should be, the enlargement of <hi>Christs Church</hi> on Earth; and the publishing of his Gospell to the Sons of Men: and therefore in that respect, it cannot but properly and directly belong vnto them, to whom <hi>Christ</hi> hath giuen commandement and authority aboue others to take care of his Flock, to seeke the furtherance of the Gospel, and to sound forth the glad tidings of Saluation to all Nations, to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Agents therein, and speciall furtherers thereof.</p>
            <p>That my proofes and examples are most out of the <hi>Bible</hi> and Sacred Histories, I haue done it of purpose, not onely because they are with me most familiar and of best authoritie, but because they should be so with all Christians; euen the Lay sort likewise. As I am not of the Papists opinion, that is, <hi>to care little for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> so I like not to be of the Popish fashion, which is, to fill the peoples eares with sound of the Names of Fathers, Councels, and others-like, which they nor are, nor can be acquainted with but to let them heare little and see lesse the Word of God, in which they easily might, and certainly should be ripe and ready, and well both seene and read.</p>
            <p>Besides, for this present argument, it is so frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that there is not any substantiall point thereabout, for, or of the which (because the practice thereof was verie much in those
<pb facs="tcp:5744:6"/>
times) there is not some, either precept or president to be found.</p>
            <p>If I haue any where dissented from the common practice, and shewed some dislike of the ordinarie proceedings in these Proiects, I desire but so farre to be borne with and accepted, as I bring good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, and declare or intimate some iust and reasonable cause thereof.</p>
            <p>Though I haue not presumed to set downe any certaine and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar platforme of a good and right Plantation which happely to haue done, would haue seemed in me too much either boldnesse or rashnesse: yet thus much I presume to affirme of that I haue written, that if any will read and consider it well, he may, without any great labour, collect and find out a true and good platforme of such an Action.</p>
            <p>I haue so answered many and most of the common Obiections made against and about these attempts, that out of, and by the same, an answer may likewise be shaped to any other obiection that lightly can be made there-against.</p>
            <p>The whole I haue so drawne vnto certaine heads, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rted againe into seuerall parts, as I thought might best accord with the matter haudled, and be most likely to yeeld ease and delight to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Wherein that I haue digested all into the forme of a Conference or Dialogue, hauing so many examples for it, and most of them from the best of all Ages, I am so far from fearing lest thereby I should offend any, that I presume rather, that in that point and paines aboue the rest, howsoeuer I be a little the larger, because of the Interlocution, I shall be the better accepted, my meaning and drift the sooner percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and my Labours and Lines the oftner lookt vpon and perused.</p>
            <p>And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I may reuert my speech to you my countrimen and friends, you, I say, of the meaner sort, for whose sake chiefly, out of the abundance of my ardent loue and feruent desire to doe you good, I haue put my selfe to all this paines, I haue vndertaken this worke. Be pleased, I pray you, to peruse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, to reade, and cause to be read to you, ouer and ouer this booke, which I haue written to you, and for you. The Argument whereof I intreat therein, is, of <hi>Plantations,</hi> which howsoeuer attempted by many worthy, great, and honourable Personages, yet seeme little to bee accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of you, for whom, of all other, they are most necessary, and to whom properly they are intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5744:7"/>Looks vpon the miserie and want wherein you doe, and abiding in <hi>England,</hi> you cannot but liue. Looke vpon the plentie and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherein going hence, you may liue. Preferre not pouertie before riches, nor your perpetuall euill and wretchednesse, before perpetuall good &amp; happines. Now is a time wherein you may do you and yours nitie, for euer, if you will. Now God doth offer you that Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good with choice of place, to rid your selues from your present mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and distresse, which if you neglect to take, and refuse, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you doe, to make vse of and embrace, will neuer, happely can neuer be had againe.</p>
            <p>Beleeue not the idle tales and vaine speeches of such, as knowing not, and caring not to doe, either themselues or other good, perswade and tempt you to abide at home, that is, to dwell (as many of you doe) in famine and penurie, and to die in need and miserie. Harken vnto me, read, heare, and consider what I say for your better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to stirre vp and animate you to accept your good, while you may, and to stablish your Happinesse, while Opportunitie serueth. Neuer can, or shall you doe it with lesse labour and trauaile, with lesse charge and expence, with lesse perill and hurt, with lesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incombrance then now you may. My words and speeches are plaine and familiar, my reasons and arguments are strong and euident, and my answers to the vaine Obiections of the contrary minded are sound &amp; solid. Let truth take place within you, let reason moue, and let euidence of the cause sway and settle you.</p>
            <p>Bee not too much in loue with that countrie wherein you were borne, that countrie which bearing you, yet cannot breed you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and is indeed, weary of you. Shee accounts you a burthen to her, and encombrance of her. You keepe her downe, you hurt her and make her poore &amp; bare, and together with your owne, you worke and cause, by tarrying within her, her misery and decay, her ruine and vndoing. Take and reckon that for your Country where you may best liue and thriue. Straine not no more to leaue that Country wherein you cannot proue and prosper, then you doe to leaue your fathers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the parish wherein you were borne and bred vp, for fitter places and habitations.</p>
            <p>And if you will needs liue in <hi>England,</hi> imagine all that to bee <hi>England</hi> where English men, where English people, you with them, and they with you, doe dwell. (And it be the people that makes
<pb facs="tcp:5744:7"/>
the Land English, not the Land the people.) So you may finde <hi>England,</hi> and an happy <hi>England</hi> too, where now is, as I may say, <hi>no Land,</hi> and the bounds of this Land, of <hi>England,</hi> by remouing of your selues, and others the people of this Land, to bee speedily and wonderfully remoued, enlarged and extended into those parts of the world, where once the Name of <hi>England</hi> was not heard of, and whereon the foot of an English man (till of late) had not troden.</p>
            <p>Be not so vaine-minded or weake-hearted as to thinke or beleeue that you shall doe better in this <hi>England</hi> with little or nothing, then in any other with something: here with an house and a backeside, then otherwhere with fortie or threescore, with one or two hundred acres of ground. It is the meanes and not the place that keepes and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines men well or ill. And Englishmen aboue many others are worst able to liue with a little.</p>
            <p>Know and consider, that as it is the same Sunne that shineth there, as well as here, so it is the <hi>same God,</hi> (that God in whose name you are baptized, in whose Church you haue, and doe, and shall liue, whose seruants you that remoue are, shall, and may be as well as they that remoue not) <hi>that God,</hi> I say, that ruleth and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things there as well as here. And doubt ye not, but that if you feare and serue him there, if there you keepe his commandements and walke in his wayes, as here you haue beene, and there you shall stil be taught and directed. (For the Arke of God, and the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> and seed of <hi>Leui,</hi> must and will goe ouer with you) The hand of his all-guiding Prouidence, will be stretched out vnto you, and the eye of his all-sauing mercie, no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Will be, say you?

                     <p>But for all that, till there be <hi>Christians</hi> inhabiting there, wee cannot say properly, that the Gospell of Christ is planted there, or that it is any part of Christendome.

                     <p>I cannot dislike that you say. And indeed any man may<note place="margin">By the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Countries to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> see, that this must needs bee a great aduancement to the honour of God, when as the Scepter of his Sonne is extended so much farther then it was, as is from hence to those remote and vnknowne Regions. Christendome will then be so much the larger. And it seemes to me it will be in a goodly order, seeing that as I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, from England to Newfoundland, and so to the Summer Ilands, and thence to Virginia, all is in one tract, no Turkish, no Heathen Countrie lying betweene. But proceed, I pray you.</p>

                     <p>This is, as you see, greatly to the honour of God,<note place="margin">And by the Conuersion of infinite hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie.</note> but it will be much more, if when and where our people doe plant themselues in such countries where already are an infinite number of other people, all Sauages, Heathens, Infidels, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, &amp;c. this in the Plantation may principally and speedily be laboured and intended, That by learning their languages, and teaching them ours, by training vp of their children, and by continuall and familiar conuerse and commerce with them, they may be drawne and induced, perswaded and brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish and renounce their owne Heathenismes, Idolatries, Blasphemies and Deuill-worships. And if (for that I take it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">The Papists haue much endeuoured this way.</note> be denied) the Papists haue done much good that way, by spreading the Name of Christ, though but after their corrupt and superstitious manner, into so many vnknowne Nations that liued before altogether in the seruice and captiuitie of the deuill, (for <hi>Better it is, that God bee serued a bad way, then no way at all.)</hi> How much more good must it needs be, if the Name of the true God, <hi>in a true and sound manner,</hi> might there be published and spred abroad?</p>
                     <p>To which purpose, I would to God, there were among vs, vs <hi>Protestants,</hi> that professe and haue a better Religion then they the <hi>Papists,</hi> one halfe of that zeale and desire to further and disperse our good and sound Religion, as seemes to be among them for furthering and dispersing theirs.

for our zeale is coldnesse, and our forwardnesse, backwardnesse in that behalfe, in respect of theirs, I need not say, <hi>we may feare;</hi> but rather, <hi>we may assure our selues,</hi> that they shall <hi>rise against vs</hi> in the day of Iudgement, <hi>and condemne vs.</hi> As they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, so let them haue the <hi>Palme and Praise</hi> in this point.

                     <p>And who can tell? (I speake this to prouoke ours the more withall) who can tell, I say, whether God hath euen therefore, as to <hi>Iehu that rooted out B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>I easily perceiue that this might redound not a little to the glorie of God, if the Conuersion of such People and Nations might be accomplished. Lord, How many thousands and millions of soules might so be saued, which now run headlong into hell! It were a glorious worke, imitating notably that of the blessed Apostles, which conuerted the world so long agoe, from dead Idols to serue the liuing God. And in so holy and religious a labour; I am sorry to heare that we should not be as forward as Papists, but that to be verified twixt vs and them also in this case, which our Sauior said in another: The children of this world are in their generation wiser then the children of light. But as I must needes confesse, that the worke were a worthy piece of worke, if it might be wrought, and that happy were our Land, if the children thereof might be made of God, Agents therein. So me thinkes, we had need to haue some assurance of the will of God, that it should be done. For as you know better then I can tell you; If the time of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion be not come; or if God, as he hath wrapped them hitherto in vnbeliefe, so he be not pleased nor determined to release them, to call them to the knowledge of his truth, and to manifest his Son vnto them at

For God in all his works is wont to effect a thing successiuely, and therefore first he sends to those Nations some light of his Essence and Truth by the Papists, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward will make these things shine more clearely vnto them by the true and faithfull Ministers of the Gospell.</hi> Thus farre he.</p>
                     <p>So that in their opinion, as well as mine, this is a worke that <hi>must be done</hi> before the end can be. Wherefore since it is a worke, and a most holy and necessary worke, which must be done, before the day, the great day of the Lord can come, I see not how we can, without sinne (hauing any thing to doe in those parts) withdraw our shoulder from this burthen, or with-hold our hand from this plough. And so much the more will the sinne be, by how much it is farre more easie for vs this to hold and vndergoe, then it was for those that did vndertake the like taske for vs, I meane, the Conuersion of our Ancestors and predecessors in this land, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as rude and vntractable, at the least that way, as these now, in as much as they were to preach and not to subdue: but wee may plant as well as preach, and may subdue as well as teach, whereby the Teachers shall need to feare no losse of goods or life, no prison nor sword, no famine or other <hi>persecuting</hi> distresse for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels sake.

                     <p>These could not but much augment and increase the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>We see the Euidence and certaintie of this Assumption as cleare as the Sun-shine at high Noone, in the person of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whose Predecessours and Progenitors accepting that which others did refuse, and making better vse of such Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then any else haue done; he is thereby become <hi>Lord,</hi> not onely of Territories, almost innumerable, but also of Treasures and riches in them inestimable.</p>

                     <p>Yes verily. Whosoeuer shall but lightly consider the<note place="margin">3. By them the good of this Land may no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</note> estate thereof, as now it stands, shall plainly see, and will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to confesse, That the prosecuting, and that in <hi>an ample mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> of those worthy Attempts, is an enterprise for our Land and common good, most expedient and necessarie. For,</p>
                     <p>First of all, whereas toward the Supportation of their Regall<note place="margin">1. In the easier supportation of the Regall state.</note> estate, for many and vrgent Necessities, the Kings of this Land are oft occasioned to demand and take of their Subiects, great summes of money by Subsidies, and other like wayes, which to many of the Subiects, specially the Clergie (who for the most part, to such payments, as things now stand, pay eight or ten times as much proportionably, as other Subiects doe) is somewhat hard and heauy to endure. This Burthen would be more easily borne, and could not but become much the lighter, if by the accession of more kingdoms to their crowne, store of treasures being brought into their Coffers, the same were borne by diuers other lands and Subiects, as well as of this, and the rest, yet vnder their subiection.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whereas our Land, at this present, by meanes of our<note place="margin">2. In ridding out of the land the great and superfluous multitude thereof.</note> long continued both <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> freed from any notable, either warre or Pestilence, the two great deuourers of mankinde, to both which in former Ages it was much subiect, euen swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with multitude and plentie of people, it is time, and high time, That like Stalls that are ouerfull of Bees, or Orchyards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne with young Sets, no small number of them should be transplanted into some other soile, and remoued hence into new Hiues and Homes.</p>
                     <p>Truly, it is a thing almost incredible to relate, and intolerable to behold, what a number in euery towne and citie, yea in euery parish and village, doe abound, which for want of commodious and ordinary places to dwell in, doe build vp Cotages by the high way side, and thrust their heads into euery corner, to the grieuous ouercharging of the places of their abode for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to the very ruine of the whole Land within a while, if it be not looke vnto; which if they were transported into other regions, might both richly increase their owne estates, and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ease and disburden ours.<note place="margin">3.

                     <p>These be motiues of some weight and likelihood: but let me heare more to these, if you haue them.</p>

                     <speaker>Enr.</speaker>
                     <p>Next. Thirdly, Whereas at this present, the prices of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5744:15"/>
things are growne to such an vnreasonable height, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that is, the meaner sort of people, <hi>are euen vndone,</hi> and doe liue, in respect of that they did for thirtie or fortie yeeres past, in great needinesse and extremitie, that there is neither hope, nor possibilitie of amending this euill, but in the diminution of the number of people in the land. Which, if men will not, by depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hence, elsewhere effect, we must expect that God, (they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first eaten out one another) by warre or pestilence doe it for them.</p>
                     <p>I know, that much helpe in this case might be had, if our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and great ones did take some good course (<hi>cum effectu</hi>) for the encrease of Tillage. But neither thereof is there any (great) hope, nor therein a sufficient helpe, since it is out of all doubt, that vnlesse it be in an extraordinary fruitfull yeere, and of them now a dayes, God for our sinnes, sends but a few, our land is not able to yeeld corne and other fruit enough, for the feeding of so many as now doe lie and liue vpon it. And when it which was wont to helpe feed other countries, must, as of late we haue to our cost both seene and felt, bee faine to haue helpe and food from others; how can our state bee for the commons, but wofull and ill? Likewise, if some good course might bee taken for restraint of excessiue Fines and Rents, whereby Landlords now a daies, <hi>grinde the faces of the poore,</hi> and draw into their own hands all the sweet and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>at of the land, so that their poore Tenants are able, neither to keepe house and maintaine themselues, nor (as anciently such houses did) to relieue others, then could not the prices of all things but much abate and come downe. Yet this were but an <hi>imperfect Cure.</hi> The true and sure remedie is, <hi>The diminution of the people,</hi> which reduced to such a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as the land it selfe can well maintaine, would easily cause, not onely the excessiue height of Fines and Rents, but also the prices of all things else, to fall of themselues, and stay at so reasonable a Rate, that one might (which now they cannot) liue by another, in very good sort.</p>
                     <p>4. Consider also the great riches, wealth, and good estate which<note place="margin">4. In enriching the poorer sort hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</note> such who here liue, and cannot but liue <hi>parcè &amp; duriter,</hi> poore and hardly, might by Transplantation, within a while rise vnto: while as they may haue otherwhere, for their bad cottages, good houses; for their little gardens, great grounds; and for their small
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5744:15"/>
backsides, large fields, pastures, meadowes, woods, and other like plentie to liue vpon.</p>
                     <p>5. The benefit that might that way accrew vnto Merchants,<note place="margin">5. In amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Trade and Traffique of Merchants.</note> and all kinde of Aduenturers by Sea, is infinit. For Traffique and Merchandize cannot but by meanes thereof wonderfully be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and increased. And withall, which is not the least point in Obseruation, most commodious and delightfull must merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing and traffique needs bee, while it shall be exercised for the most part, betweene one and the same people, though distant in Region, yet vnited in Religion, in Nation, in Language and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Which surely is a thing likely to proue so materiall and beneficiall, as may turne the greater part of our Merchants voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages that way, and free them from many of those dangerous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which now they are faine to make by the Straits and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas; may finde them out their rich and much-desired com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and greater store, and at a better hand then now they haue them other where, and vent them many a thing, which now doe seldome, or not at all passe their hands.</p>
                     <p>But of all other, I need speake little of the Merchants good, as who can, and I am perswaded, doe so well know it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and thereupon affect the enterprise so much, that if other mens desires and endeuours were correspondent, it would take both speedy and condigne effect.</p>
                     <p>6. The last benefit to our Land, but not the least, is the curing<note place="margin">6. In rooting out Idlenesse out of this Land.</note> of that euill Disease of this Land; which, if it be not lookt vnto, and cured the sooner, will bee the Destruction of the Land, I meane, <hi>Idlenesse the Mother of many Mischiefes,</hi> which is to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and may be rooted out of the Land, by this meanes, yea by this onely, and by none other, <hi>viz.</hi> by Plantation.</p>

                     <p>Questionlesse, The best and the onely Cure thereof <hi>by the hand of man,</hi> is this way, and none other. The diminution of the people of the Land vnto a due and competent Number will doe it. This is apparant by Experience. For, looke we backe to the state of our Land for 40. 50. or 60. yeeres agoe, before it did thus exceed in multitude, and we shall see, that few or none of these vices did then abound, nothing in Comparison of that they doe now, as which haue since sprung vp out of Idlenesse, that since that time, together with the multitude and increase of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is risen and increased.</p>

You haue your selfe a great many of Children, if you should keepe them all at home, and haue not wherewith to set them to worke, nothing to employ them in (for all the worke you haue to doe ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not enough for aboue two or three of them) must they not

Now, to preuent and auoyd this, what other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie haue you, but either to get worke for them into your own house from other men, if you can haue it, or else perforce to place them forth of your owne house into other mens, one to this trade or occupation, another to that, where they may be set aworke, and kept from Idlenesse.</p>

                     <p>Very much. For the cases are very like. Thereby you may plainly perceiue, that, as the onely way to rid Idlenesse out of your house, hauing no worke for them at home, is, to place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad your children into other houses, as it were, into Colonies, where they may be set aworke; so the onely way to rid Idlenesse out of a whole parish, towne, countie or countrey (the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to set th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> that are idle therein aworke. And it is a thing so euident, that for the idle people of our Land, what by the great number of them, which is almost infinite; and what by the present dampe and decay of all Trades and employments, the Land is not any way able to set them aworke, that it needs no proofe, is to place abroad the Inhabitants thereof, which therein be not nor can be set aworke, into other parishes, townes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and countries.</p>

                     <p>If this Course should be taken, it would touch very neere a great many of the best liuers in the Countrey, who, both themselues, and their children be as idle as any can be, and yet would be loth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so good meanes here to liue by, to be remoued into Plantations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>

                     <p>These might be brought from Idlenesse, and yet abide at home too. For, if the superfluous multitude of our Land were remoued, those which you speake of, would for their owne need fall to worke, and leaue Idlenesse, because that multitude remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they should haue none to doe their worke for them, as now they haue, while they goe to playing, potting, and other like vaine and idle courses.</p>
                     <p>The Magistrates of our Land haue of late made many good statutes and prouisions, for the beating downe of drunkennes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for setting the poore and idle people to worke, and other like: but how little effect hath followed?

and idle people still doe multiply. Other sinnes and disorders are sometimes punished, but yet they still remaine, and, as it were, in despite of Lawes, they spread more and more abroad. The reason is, (if a man may be bold to giue the reason of it, <hi>They strike at the boughes, but not at the Rootes.</hi>) If there were the like good Orders taken for the rooting out and beating downe of <hi>Idlenesse it selfe</hi> in our Land, which can be done no other way, but by Plantations, both Idlenesse it selfe, and all the rest of the Euils beforenamed, and other like that arise out of it, would vanish away as smoake before the winde, and melt as Waxe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Fire.</p>

                     <p>Your speeches are very probable: but by this meanes, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle people of our Land, as you intimate, being remoued, the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will then be pestered with them there, as much and as bad as we are here; and so, those good workes be discredited, and haply euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne thereby.

                     <p>Howsoeuer, such a Remouall made, our Land (which is the poynt in question) shall be cleared and cured. But of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hurt to the Plantations that you fore-cast, there is no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5744:17"/>
feare. For, whereas there are in our Land at this present many idle persons, some are such as gladly would worke, if they could get it. They are idle, not for any delight they haue in idlenesse, but because they can get no body, nor meanes to set them on worke. Some are idle indeed, as may worke and will not. They haue wherewithall to keepe themselues from idlenesse, that is, worke enough of their owne to doe, but, delighting in idlenesse, and counting it a disgrace to men of their meanes, to worke and labour in their vocation, they will haue and hyre others to doe their worke, to be their seruants, and labourers, which they needed not, and which other men of like quality and ability, that are thrifty, and good Common-wealths men indeed, doe not, nor will doe, and they themselues the while liue idlely, spend their time vainely, lye at the Ale-house, or Tauerne, bibbing and bowzing beastly, sit at Cards or Tables loosely, haunt idle and lewd company shamefully, and giue themselues to no good pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or exercise commendably, but runne on from ill to worse, to the shame and discredit of themselues and their friends, and many times to the vtter vndoing and ouerthrow of them and theirs miserably. A third sort there are, as it were a mixt kinde of people, neither altogether idle, nor yet well and sufficiently set aworke. Of these, some worke at a low and small rate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times glad to serue for any thing, rather than to begge, steale, or starue: and some of them set vp idle and pelting Trades, as it were shifts to liue by, for lacke of better imployment, that so they may haue one way or other somewhat to liue vpon.</p>
                     <p>Of all these, if the first and third sort were remoued into Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where they might haue either good Liuings of their owne to liue vpon, or good imployment by others to labour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is no doubt, but that the most part of them, would be glad of the exchange, and proue laborious and industrious people, to their owne good, and the good, not the hurt, of the Countrey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they shall be remoued. And then for the second or middle sort, it is not much to be doubted, but that the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their idlenesse taken away, as I said but now, they also will leaue to be idle, fall to doe their owne worke as they should, learne to thriue and become profitable to themselues, and this our Countrey, wherein they remaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ashamed to be idle and vaine henceforth, as heretofore they were to worke and labour.</p>
                     <p>If any continue their former lewd and disordered courses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a few, so many of their wonted Companions being seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gone from them, there is hope that a little seuerity of the Laws, which easily reclaimeth a few, when on a multitude some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it can doe little good, will and may bring them also to a better course.</p>
                     <p>And thus I hope you see, That it is not impossible the idlenesse that is in our Land, to be notably cured and expelled: and that this may be done either onely, or at least no way so soundly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and speedily, as by Plantations. And therefore, the slate of our Land considered, if there were no other benefit that might arise of Plantations, yet this alone, <hi>viz.</hi> the rooting out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of idlenesse out of the Land, which else <hi>Uiper-like,</hi> will in time root out, and destroy the Land it selfe, wherein it is bred, were cause all-sufficient, and reason enough, why such attempts should be vndertaken, and by all possible meanes furthered and hastened.</p>

                     <p>I cannot but like well of all that hitherto you haue said, touching the goodnesse and necessity of these Actions. But yet, mee thinkes, there may be a Question, Whether they be lawfull or not?

                     <p>It cannot be, but that those countries, hauing either not at all, or but little as yet beene inhabited, must needs be much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne with woods, and no small part thereof to be a very Forrest and Wildernesse, yet certaine it is, that there are (a thing very admirable, and almost beyond expectation:) there are, I say, in them to be found many goodly parts of those Countries, that are very cleare of woods, faire and goodly open champion ground, large Meadowes and Pastures many hundred, sometimes thousands of Acres together. So that besides the wood-lands there is abundantly roome, and ground enough to build and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit vpon, for more people, I beleeue, then will hastily be gotten ouer to dwell there: and more ground open and cleare already rid for pasture and tillage, then yet there will be people and cattle enough had thither to such vses, the same to conuert and employ.</p>
                     <p>And therefore there needs not, either that Complaint which<note place="margin">The spoyle of woods in those countries not sufferable.</note> they make, of the excessiue store and encomberment of woods, nor, which is worse, of that present and hastie spoile, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of woods on the sudden, for making of roome, that some doe talke of, and would haue to be made; and, as it is reported, haue already made by burning vp thousands of Acres together. This, truly in my opinion, is a thing very wicked, and such as cannot but be displeasing to Almightie God, who abhorreth all wilfull waste and spoile of his good creatures. <hi>Gather vp that which is left,</hi> saith our Sauiour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>that nothing be lost:</hi> and a thing that in common ciuilitie, and humane policie, should not be suffered to be done, or being done, not passe vnpunished.</p>
                     <p>Wee may know by our owne present want of wood here in <hi>England,</hi> what a pretious commoditie wood is, and be warned by our owne harmes, to make much of it, if we haue plenty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5744:22"/>
and no further nor faster to cut it downe, then present vse and good occasions from time to time shall require. We should not be so blinde as not to foresee, that if the countries come once to be inhabited, there will be so many, and so great occasions of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe wood and timber trees, as will quickly cause infinite store thereof necessarily to be imployed, and so the grounds from, time to time speedily enough to be made cleare and ridde for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vses.</p>
                     <p>For, first, the very building of Houses, to which adde the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary making of fences about houses and grounds, will vse an infinit deale of Wood and Timber.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The store that will daily and yeerely be spent in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vses for fire, which at the first specially, till houses bee warme and drie, and the ayre corrected, will and must be more than ordinarie, cannot but, if once any number of Inhabitants goe ouer, be exceeding great.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The building and making of Ships and shipping, will require and consume very much there. And such order may bee taken, that by the woods there, great spare (a thing very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) may be made in <hi>England,</hi> of our Woods here for that vse.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To these places may be transplanted, the making of Glasse and Iron, as well for <hi>England,</hi> as for the same Countries: two things, that as it is well knowne, doe deuoure (yet vpon necessary vses) wonderfull store of Wood continually.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, The Trades of Potters for earthen vessels, and of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for treen Vessels, both very necessary, specially at the first, will and must still from time to time spend vp much Wood and Timber.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, And little behinde them in expence of Wood, will be that very necessary Trade of making of Salt, considering how great vse there is and will be thereof there, for the fishing voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, besides all other vses thereof, both there and else-where.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, No small quantity thereof likewise may be cut vp and transported into <hi>England,</hi> for our Buildings, for Coupers, Ioyners, and Trunk-makers trades heere, which now at a daerer hand, wee buy and fetch out of other Countries.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Besides, the Woods standing are of themselues, and by industry more may be made, a great fortification for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants against man and Beast, till the Countries be, and can be better employed and fortified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:5744:22"/>These, and other like necessary and great vses of wood consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which either must, or may be made thereof, little reason or cause is there, why, as if it could, like the waters in the riuers, neuer be spent while the world stands, there should any sudden and needlesse spoile by fire or any other wastfull hauocke be made thereof: and seuerely deserue they to be punished that shall make it, and sharply the rest to be restrained, that none like hereafter be made.</p>

                     <p>1. Many fore-cast perils where they need not: and so, many times are more afraid than hurt. As <hi>Salomon</hi> obserued long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>The slothfull saith, A Lyon is without, I shall be slaine in the streetes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Our life and state is not without perils at home: and I tell you, if these Aduentures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you call them, be not better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed than yet they are, they will, and cannot but more and more increase.</p>
                     <p>3. No Action of such a weight and worth as these are, can bee without some perils, hurts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and losses, which yet must be aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and indured in hope of a greater good, and ampler recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence another way.</p>

No Bees, (for feare of sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) no Honie.</p>
                     <p>5. Of perils and misaduentures, some are meerely <hi>Casuall,</hi> and not to bee auoyded, some are altogether <hi>needlesse,</hi> and might haue beene preuented. The former of these must be borne with, as a part of that common calamity, whereunto the life of man is subiect, and of those crosses and afflictions wherewith God doth either try his Children, as Gold in the fire, or afflict and punish them and others. For these, no man ought to bee troubled and dismayed in these courses, more than for the like in any other, nor dislike them one iot the worse.</p>
                     <p>Wee finde, when God would bring his owne people the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> into that good Land, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which so oft &amp; so solemnely he had promised to them and to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he did it not without letting them passe, and feele some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils by the way; as the stopping at the red Sea, the pursuite of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> one while the want of flesh, another while of water in the Wildernesse, the terrour of fiery Serpents, and the assault of many and mighty enemies, with other like. Wee finde also, that he was much displeased with, and sharpely sometimes did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those of them that murmured because of those things, and would haue returned backe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> regarding not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and accept that Land, that good Land, which the Lord their

God had giuen to them and their seed. And may not this teach vs, That we must not looke to haue the hand of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence extended vnto vs without some dangers and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And that the Lord is not pleased with those that for feare of euery mis-hap and trouble, will bee discouraged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or will dis-hearten and discourage others from such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts?</p>
                     <p>Christ likewise the Sonne of God, sending abroad his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to preach the Gospell, is so farre from securing them of all troubles and dangers in their indeuours thereabout, that hee fore-tells them, <hi>He doth send them forth as Lambes among wolues.</hi> That they should be <hi>hated, persecuted, and put to death for his sake, &amp;c.</hi> But were the Apostles by this dismayed? Did they therefore refuse to vndertake their charge, and proceed in the worke of the Lord? Wee know the contrary.

Of the Iewes fiue times receiued. I forty stripes saue one, I was thrice beaten with roddes: I was once stoned: I suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thrice Ship-wracke.

                     <p>The other sort, which I called needlesse or wilfull, by which I meane such as men wilfully, through their owne fault doe cast themselues or others into, by their euill mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of any such businesse, by rashnesse, disorder, ouer-sight, or the like, ought not to be imputed to the Actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as which doe not necessarily draw any such after them, but to the Authors and Actors of the same. As if men meete with dangers at Sea, by setting forth at vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable times, in the Winter, in foule weather, or other like: If they bee surprized by an Enemy at Sea or Land, they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without sufficient forces, both of men, and munition, for such an enterprize: If they be distressed with want of victuals, and other prouisions, when they set forth slenderly, poorely, and ill prouided, with other like.</p>

                     <p>For, first, Our Passage to any of the places intended, is very easie, open, and cleare, Sea-roome at will, and, if we take time and season conuenient; as nauigable and pleasant as need to be desired. Few Pyrates on those coasts, and fewer it is probable there would be, if some good course were taken for their repulse and dissipation.</p>
                     <p>2. Our Accesse and Entry is free and facile for the most part. No man once offereth to forbid or hinder our landing there.</p>
                     <p>3. The people of those Countries, if any bee, ready either for loue and hope of good from vs, kindly to receiue and entertaine vs, or for feare and weakenesse of their owne accord to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>For, first: It is not long that any haue beene in any of these Plantations, and there must be a time for euery thing. They

                        </gap>e from the ground, must tarry the ripening of it. It is not one yeeres worke or two, to get a good state in Lands, and to get some store of wealth about a man in the same likewise. They that goe ouer to such a businesse, haue many things to doe first, before they can haue time to gather wealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; as to build, to rid their grounds, to make fenses to destroy wilde and hurtfull beasts, to get ouer good and profitable cattell, to plant and sow their grounds, and the like: All which be matters of great labour, time and expence. We see in daily practice with vs, a man that is a Purchaser, till he hath recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Fine, and stockt his Liuing, cannot be aforehand and get wealth about him: nor can they there, till they haue done those and other like things, which are to them, as it were, their Fine and In-come. It is well if seuen, or ten, or twentie yeeres hence, happely in the next generation, men can attaine vnto riches. It is enough for the fathers to take in the grounds, and settle the lands and liuings for them and theirs against the time to come, though for the present, and for their owne time, they hardly stand vp, and meet with some difficulties.</p>
                     <p>2. Men there, can, making nothing of their grounds yet, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any can themselues employ them to pasture or tillage. It is not there as in <hi>England,</hi> where, if a man haue little stocke or imployment of his owne for his grounds, yet he may let them out at a reasonable rent; but there, more then a man can stocke and till himselfe, lies still, and will yeeld him nothing at all. Make it your owne case. If you had the best Liuing in this parish in Fee simple, and had little to put vpon it, nor could get any to rent it, at your hands, could you grow rich in haste? This is their case.</p>

                     <p>3. All in manner that haue gone ouer hitherto into any of these parts, are poore men, men of small meanes, and therefore with little or nothing, it is not possible they should in a little time attaine to any store of some thing: And the lesse possible, for that the benefit of their labours redounds for the most part, not to themselues, but, as in regard of their great aduentures and expenses, reason is it should, to the benefit of rich men here, that haue sent them thither.</p>
                     <p>4. Diuers of them that haue gone ouer, haue beene Banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rutps
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5744:27"/>
and Spendthrifts, Idlers and Loyterers, who, as they thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not in <hi>England,</hi> (for how should they thriue that run thrift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and heedlesse courses?) so will they not commonly in any Land. <hi>Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt:</hi> as saith the Poet, Weeds will be weeds, where-euer they grow.</p>
                     <p>When men of fashion and meanes doe go ouer, that are able to set vp themselues and others, and that will be industrious to take the benefit of the time and place, then I doubt not but it will soone appeare what good may be done in those places, and that men may, if they will, easily and quickly proue rich and wealthy there. Then, and not till then, if riches arise not, let men blame the places from whence it was expected they should arise.</p>
                     <p>6. The manner of proceeding in these attempts, may also be a great cause, why men attaine to riches there more slowly, then they might and should, if they were otherwise managed.</p>
                     <p>As, First, If the Plantation begin with a small number, farre too little for such a businesse. For then neither can they bee able to extend themselues farre into the Countries in a long time, and so not to finde out the goodnes, sweetnesse, and benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: nor to set vp all kinde of necessary trades and faculties among themselues, whereby they may bee able to assist and set one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a worke.</p>
                     <p>2. If they that remoue hence, goe sparely and ill prouided of cattell, corne, and other necessaries for Plantation and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which those countries afford not: impossible it is for them to make that profit, and get that increase by their Lands and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings there, which they might, if they were well and throughly prouided of such things at the first.</p>
                     <p>7. This is the onely way which men in ancient time did finde out and obserue to get riches and wealth withall, to increase and amend their estate by, when as by multitudes of people their country was, as ours now is, so ouerlaid, that they could not thriue and prosper therein. Neither were they euer lightly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but the euent and computation did answer their intent and expectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no doubt, if the like courses bee now attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they may and will, if they be well carried, produce the like, or rather better and speedier effects to vs then to them. For we haue many helps for peace and warre, for shipping and nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for defence and fortification, for traffique and negotiation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5744:27"/>
for building and habitation, for religious and ciuill conuersation, for skill in many needfull arts and occupations, which they had not, to further vs withall.</p>

that Money was neuer plentie here since, and for that we neuer heard of any good that was done with it.

And I am verily perswaded there is not a Parish in the Land, that would not willingly be at any reasonable charge for the setting forth of any such poore bodie, as should either volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offer himselfe, or by authoritie be taken vp, to goe in that Action from time to time.

A thing so materiall as nothing more, for without infinite store of Money can be no good Plantation any where.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such as passe ouer, should be occasioned to lade away with them store of our English commodities for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for houshold, &amp;c. which happely they would not haue done, if they might carrie with them their English Moneys, and once hauing such things there, they will doe them more pleasure and good, then till they come there, they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Such as are there, should be the more occasioned to vse all industrious meanes to get vp the commodities of those Countreys, to barter and trucke withall for such things as shall <hi>merchantwise</hi> be brought to them from hence, knowing well that their Money will not much be regarded nor receiued of our men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It would make them delight the more in Tillage and breed of Cattell, because Siluer and Gold Coynes the very begetters of <hi>hoarding couetousnesse</hi> wanting, their chiefest riches must needs consist in <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Cattell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They being rich within themselues (for such Money while it holds value, is as good, where it is currant, as any other) should yet be poore to others-ward among whom it is not currant, which would make them the lesse desired of, and the lesse to feare any such as seeke for spoile and prey.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, By this meanes, we should oft receiue from them good store of forraine Coynes, receiued by them for Fish and other commodities sold to such as come to trade there.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, Moreouer, Hereby the great hurt that some imagine is to be feared by those Plantations in carrying away of our Gold and Siluer, would easily, and that

This way present tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all would be made, who <hi>would giue in their names,</hi> to that end: and if the Inland doe not, yet the Seacost townes like enough would somewhat hearken vnto it.</p>
                     <p>2. Thereto it would also further much, I suppose, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall some good order might bee setled in euery Citie and Hauen towne within the Land, whether they that dwell neere thereto might repaire, for Conditions and Agreements about theirhabitation otherwhere, &amp; Transportation thither. When men must seek for very notice only of these matters 100 miles or more, it makes them weary to thinke of it. All the helps that can be had, for easie, safe, certaine, and commodious notice and remouing, will be all little enough, and exceeding requisite and behoouefull.</p>
                     <p>3. Likewise, if order could be taken that the remouing of those that depart hence, might bee principally made in some parts of the Land one yeere, and in some another, that so all that vpon good notice thereof had and taken, be fet therehence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5744:38"/>
to be remoued, might be remoued all together at once, or at twice at the most: This, probable it is, would cause many to be more willing, then otherwise they will be, to depart hence, while they shall see some good store and companie of their kinsfolkes, friends, neighbours, and acquaintance, to goe away together with them. For, going into a strange place, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but as it were naturally desire both to goe, and to be there with such as they know before and are formerly acquainted with, rather then with meere strangers; and be fearefull to commit both themselues and all that they haue, wholy, to those that they neuer saw before.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This could not but be a good motiue and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement<note place="margin">Fourthly, By prouision sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> to many, but a farre greater this, if speciall order shal also be taken, that those that shall depart hence, be supplyed most carefully and sufficiently with all kind of prouisions fit and necessarie for the life of man, which those parts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys yeeld not; as Food and Apparrell, Corne to sowe and plant, Cattell great and small for breed and other vses, Iron, edge-Tooles, Armour, &amp;c. that so hauing all such necessaries duly and ordinarily brought vnto them, they may haue euerie thing in their Markets to be bought and sold, some-what like as they were vsed to haue them here in England.</p>
                     <p>And this must be continued not for once or twice only, nor at an Harbour or two, but in euerie part of the Plantations, and from time to time, till the Plantations shall be able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to stand vp, and continue without them.

                     <p>This matter is of that moment, that it is the first thing and the greatest that troubles the minde of any, when speech is made to them of departing hence into any new Countrey, of dwelling in a forraine Land: What they shall do there? How they shall liue when they come thither? And it takes that deepe impression in the heart of many, that vnlesse they may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5744:39"/>
foresee a cleare and euident resolution thereof, there is no more possibilitie to perswade them to remoue, then to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the Fire, or cast themselues headlong into the Sea. This doubt therefore being once well cleared, and people made to see that they shall not need to feare this way, people will be three times more willing to goe then yet they are.</p>
                     <p>It is not all one for men to goe into any of the present Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as it hath beene to goe into Ireland, whither if any could goe prouided of Money in any measure, he needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. For there he was sure to haue any thing he needed for his Money, at a better and cheaper rate then in England. But in these places he must haue all things either carried along with him, or brought thither after him, and that at a dearer price and higher reckoning then in England.</p>
                     <p>People of our breed cannot liue as the Saluages and Natiues there do, that is, more like beasts then men. Whatsoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Countreys yeeld not, and people in these haue beene vsed to haue, must most carefully be prouided them, lest left destitute that way, they seeme as cast out into wild and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wildernesses, and exposed to famine and other miseries too grieuous to them to beare.</p>

Eccl. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> manner they could, informe and perswade many of them to the Christian faith, and found the people very tractable. At length returning home, one of them, whose name was <hi>Frumentius,</hi> comming to <hi>Alexandria</hi> his citie, goeth vnto the Bishop of the place, which at that time was <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that renowned Clerke surnamed for his great learning &amp; sincerity in faith <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus mundi,</hi> the eye of the world, &amp; acquaints him with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, praying him withall, that he would send a Bishop and other Teachers thither, that might goe forward with that worke of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5744:44"/>
the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he said, there was great hope. <hi>Athanasius</hi> hauing called together for that purpose the Clergie of his citie, considering a little of the matter, stands vp and saith; <hi>And where shall we finde such a man, so fit for this imployment, as your selfe</hi> (Frumentius) <hi>are, in whom is the spirit of our God?</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon presently all the rest approuing it, he made him a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and a Bishop, and sent him backe (with others) forthwith to furnish what he had begun, and the Lord made the worke to prosper in his hand, confirming the word with many signes and wonders following, saith the Historie.</p>
                     <p>By this story you may see, that holy men of God, euen in the primitiue Church, did not stand much vpon it, to admit meane men, and not professed schollers onely into the Ministerie, where they saw other gifts correspondent: and withall, that Bishops vsed in those times, and had power and authoritie, to send forth men into forraine countries, to preach and plant the Gospel. And of these kinde of men let this suffice.</p>
                     <p>13. But then farther, besides these last mentioned, and aboue<note place="margin">13. Men of name and note to be Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, &amp;c.</note> all these hitherto spoken of, I adde, there must bee, by some meanes or other, drawne and induced to goe, as Gouernours and Leaders of the rest, <hi>some store of men of Name and Note,</hi> men by whose power and authoritie, greatnesse and grauitie, purse and presence the multitude afore mentioned, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, ordered, and guided. Common sense and reason can sufficiently enforme euery man, that no body can consist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Army without a Generall, no company with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Conductor, and no societie without a Ruler. And Nature her selfe teaching the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Bees, not to swarme without their Ladie, and the <hi>Cranes</hi> not to flie without their Leader, may easily teach vs, that we shall transgresse the very order of Nature, and neglect that instinct which is ingraffed in all, if we shall make such a remouall without the conduct of such men, as for their place and power, birth and breed, may be fit to order and rule, to support and settle the rest And if men of this ranke would once roundly set their foot to this way, and their hand to this worke, as <hi>Moses</hi> did with the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Land of <hi>Canaan, Aeneas</hi> and the noble <hi>Troians</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> and his <hi>Allies</hi> for this Land, it were not to

                     <p>It is indeed: But thereof say I, First, Many a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<note place="margin">Answ.</note> will beare and disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Secondly, A great part of the expences will soone be repaid againe: some, in the Commodities thence returned: some, in the easement and disburdening of their wonted charge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance here at home.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, People cannot liue any where without expence.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Be it a matter of some good quantitie, that must arise out of the Common Purse, is not our whole Land able to beare it? Suppose there should goe ten or twentie thousands yeerely for a time vnto our Plantations, what were that, with the helpe of particulars, to <hi>Englands Purse?</hi> If in time of war, it were able without any grieuance, almost any feeling, to maintaine sixe or seuen, yea, ten or twelue thousand Souldiers in the Field the whole yeere, from yeere to yeere for a time; as easily might it be able, or else I am much deceiued, to transport, and that with verie competent prouision yeerely, twice as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand persons at the least, into those Plantations.</p>

                     <p>I will not say, but I may be deceiued: But surely in my<note place="margin">Answ.</note> conceit, It were <hi>necessarie</hi> that there should goe rather more then fewer then I haue said. My reasons are:</p>
                     <p>First, The multitude that aboundeth in our Land, is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, that without great riddance, the benefit thereof at home, will be little seene, and lesse felt. For more will yerely

arise then are remoued. To draw out a proportion some-what fit in this case; there are in <hi>England</hi> onely at this present, eight thousand Parishes at the least, as I coniecture, and certaine it is, as all the Church Registers in <hi>England,</hi> I thinke, will iustifie, there are more borne euerie yeere, then buried. Say, but two in a Parish one with another, and that is with the least, I am sure, yet that amounts to sixteene thousand in one yeere. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease being such, what decrease there had need be made to bring the whole to abide some-what equall, may soone be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Farther, let men looke backe to the beginning of the late Queenes raigne, or there-about, and see in what state the Land stood then for people, and he shall perceiue, that euen then it did begin to exceed: so that vnlesse it may againe be reduced <hi>to that mediocritie at least,</hi> and there stand, it can be in no tolerable estate. This cannot be effected, but by such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at least, remoued as I haue intimated.</p>

                     <speaker>Resp.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed within my remembrance, that is, within these fourtie or fiftie yeeres, our Parish is increased in such a sort, that there be now almost twice as many Houses in it, as once there were, and these newly encreased, but Cottages most of them set vp in waste places of the high-waies: the Inhabitants whereof, are nothing but a burthen vnto vs, and doe verie much trouble and annoy vs, that be the ancient Tenants, and true Housholders: and I perceiue that the remouing of one or two of them, were to little purpose. The greatest part of them, or rather all, if it were possible, must be rid away, or else we shall be little the neere for it. And so it had need be, in your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the whole Land ouer.</p>

                     <p>You conceiue me aright. Secondly, Farther, the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations now in hand are diuers: these all cannot be setled in any forme, nor brought to any good estate, without the like numbers transported, whereby they may be enabled in euerie of them: First, To occupate or take in forthwith, such a large continent of ground, as may be fit for setling the bounds of their Plantation there.

                     <p>This would require a greater number then yet you haue<note place="margin">3 Obiect.</note> spoken of, I thinke: so great out of all question, as in all England is not to be had.</p>

                     <speaker>Enr.</speaker>
                     <p>I am not of your mind: Few men doe well consider<note place="margin">Answ.</note> what a number for such a purpose in all <hi>England,</hi> is to be had, if there were once good courses taken for the hauing of them. For my owne part truly, I am fully perswaded, <hi>That there are few Townes and Parishes in England, but haue in them of all sorts</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How great a number in England may be spared for Plantations.</note> 
                        <hi>one and other that might to such a purpose be spared, enough to make and plant in such a sort as I haue said before, as great a Towne and Parish in some new Plantation, as that within England, in which at this present, they doe dwell and abide.</hi> A number I suppose suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient presently to furnish at large, <hi>more then all</hi> any one Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is now in hand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The attempts, at the beginning specially, cannot but be liable to some dangers of the Enemie. If then their number be but small, and they goe forth, as hitherto by scores or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Alas, what strength can they be of, either to subdue the Borderers, or resist the Inuaders? The Aduersarie may wait a time at his best leasure, when they are growne a litle worth the rifling, to <hi>displant them</hi> of their seates: and as to <hi>the French,</hi> in <hi>Terra Florida,</hi> the Spaniard did, to <hi>dispatch them</hi> of their liues. Whereas, if they goe out by thousands, or ten thousands, as all <hi>good Plantations should, and euer haue done.</hi> First, They shall be able to withstand, and (if need be) to subdue the Naturalls adiacent: and then within a few yeeres, partly of themselues, and partly by the assistance of their Confederates, which the stronger they see ours to be, the firmer no doubt will they be vnto them, they will by Gods blessing and aid, be so well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Land, and prouided by Sea, that they shall as little need to feare any forraine forces there, as we, God be praysed, doe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5744:47"/>
here: and happely, grow no lesse famous for martiall and ciuill policie both, in that <hi>Continent,</hi> then our Nation is in this.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Now it is a fit time, and we are well at leisure for such a purpose, to attend such an employment, whereas, if any trouble, if any warres, by Sea, or by Land, should arise vs here, (And doe we thinke, or are we sure, <hi>these Halcion dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> will euer hold?) we should haue neither time, nor meanes to spare, to prosecute any such businesse abroad. As therefore, a man that will build a great House, must follow it closely, while the Summer lasteth, and the weather is faire, lest the Winter come on, which will both hurt and hinder his worke: so, it is good for vs, in this faire time of Peace, and Summer like weather of leisure and libertie, to follow these businesses with speed, lest in time we say: <hi>Had we thought this.</hi> We know, <hi>Pòst est occasio calua.</hi> This is a point of that worth, and weight, that it alone, me thinkes, should be enough to stir vp <hi>all England,</hi> to take heed that <hi>she doe not sit still, Iudg.</hi> 18. 9. and let it slip out of her hands. For, as saith the Poet:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Nec quae praeterijt, cursu reuocabitur vnda:</l>
                        <l>Nec quae praeterijt, hora redire potest.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>That is:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Nor can the tide that's eb'd and gone, int's proper course reuoked be:</l>
                        <l>Nor can the time when once it's past, returne againe, we plainely see.</l>

But not resting thereon, though these natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall experiments are not to be despised, I will remit them to one of the greatest Politicians that euer was among men, I meane <hi>Moses,</hi> a man full of the Spirit of God, and all wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who conducting the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of promise, a Land formerly inhabited, a Land alreadie builded and planted, a Land reasonably well cleared of Woods and wild-Beasts; yet tels them (whose number was not small, as this one instance may declare, <hi>viz.</hi> that when they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there were of them, men, besides Children and Strangers, <hi>Sixe hundred thousand,</hi> and this withall, that when they passed into the Land, fourtie yeeres after, vnder the hand of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> out of two Tribes and an halfe, that dwelt on this side <hi>Iordan,</hi> there went, fourtie thousand men of warre to assist the rest) that therefore the Lord would not destroy their Enemies all at once, but by little and little, <hi>lest the wild-Beasts of the Field should increase vpon them, Deuter.</hi> 7. 22. Whence

they may gather, That if so great a multitude were, in <hi>Moses</hi> opinion, with the least, to inhabite an emptie Land, of no greater Continent and spaciousnesse then that was, and it were but for feare of the increase of the wild-Beasts against them, and therefore vpon good pollicie, and for a time, it were better some of the men of that Land, the former Inhabitants, were suffered to remaine among them, till themselues were more increased, then may not so small a number, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly send into our Plantations, suffice thereto, and that some greater number then any yet I haue intimated, rather then a lesse (all things considered) were rather more requisite and necessarie.</p>

Now, whoso will not be blind, cannot but see, that this multitude, whose remouall should chiefly be intended, is neither <hi>apt,</hi> for want of educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being of the ruder sort; nor <hi>able</hi> for want of meanes; being for the most part, of the poorer sort, to strengthen vs. There may be more doubt of them rather, lest in time of Peace they raise tumults, and fall to vproares for their bellies sake, and in time of Warre lest they ioyne with the Enemie, and take parts against vs, for our pillage and liuings sake: then hope that in Peace, they will inrich and benefit; or in trouble, assist and strengthen our Common-wealth and Countrey.</p>
                     <p>2.

Indeed, if such a number and multitude, as is needfull to be remoued, should either <hi>die in our Land,</hi> or be translated <hi>out of our Land,</hi> into some other Princes dominion, the want of them might happely be some losse and lacke vnto our Land: yet when for forty or fifty yeeres agoe it was not so ouercloied and pestered with multitude, as now it is, it was not found, God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

to want strength: but abiding still subiects to the same king and members of the same dominion, being made by the benefit of Plantation more auaileable to the one, and seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the other, then before, so farre is it off, that the absence and want of them shall weaken, that out of all doubt it shal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably strengthen our Land.</p>
                     <p>3. As for the impouerishing of the Land this way, there is thereof, nor probabilitie, nor possibilitie, seeing the greatest number of them, whose Transplantation is most necessary, are they that aboue all other, doe for the present, by their abiding here impouerish and begger it. For on them is bestowed yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the greatest part of all that money, the summe where of is almost inestimable, which is by Ouerseers and Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, in euery seuerall parish of the Land collected and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. And whereas, of this sort of people, this superfuous number, there are increased among vs, out of all doubt, here in <hi>England</hi> alone, within these fiftie yeeres, <hi>not so few as an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand</hi> (I say not persons, but) <hi>families,</hi> I presume, if view thereof were made, it would appeare, that <hi>among them all, there would hardly be found one thousand of subsidie men,</hi> as you may perceiue by the state of our owne parish and others neere-adioyning, wherein if there bee now any more subsidie men then were in the <hi>Queenes time,</hi> they are such onely, as are of the ancient inhabitants, and tenants, and not one, or scarce one of the late and new increase.</p>

If there doe remoue hence any of the better and richer sort that shall, and may carry some store of wealth with them, as there must, <hi>if euer there be any good Plantation indeed any where,</hi> yet the number of them, both will, and need be but few in respect of the rest: and whatsoeuer the Land is damnified by that they carry with them, it will soone be recompensed, partly by their absence, partly in the estates of those which shall be, by hauing their liuings and some other of their meanes inriched &amp; bettered by their remouall, and lastly, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and benefits which from and by such cannot to this Land but redound againe out of the Plantations.</p>

                     <p>Whether it be possible, God knowes, but surely in mine opinion, it is somewhat vnlikely. It is not good to haue many works, great workes in hand a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>A time may come for the filling vp, and full storing of them all.

And therefore it were not amisse, but a thing to be wished and endeuoured, that though the full finishing of some one or two Plantations be chiefly for the present followed and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet vpon a prouident, or (if I may so speake) <hi>a preuident</hi> consideration of our occasions and wants for time to come, some both Possession and Plantation might be continued in all those Countries, which by Gods speciall fauour to vs ward, doe at this present rest, and remaine as it were offered to and into our hands.</p>

There are Countries<note place="margin">Plantation by Inuasion dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked.</note> cnow besides (and such are all those now in hand) in which we may safely plant, either by our selues, or with others, without any Inuasion or warre at all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we needed it, or any would goe that way to worke, yet our people generally will not endure it. Wee see they can hardly, nay, they cannot be gotten to goe and plant themselues

where they may doe it with all ease and freedome that can be, and therefore there is no probability, they will once moue a foot, to goe and seeke out a Country by the sword.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, that were a double charge. For so our people must goe first, they that are men onely, as an Army of Souldiers to subdue the Inhabitants and take the Country, and then after to goe, men, women and children, to inhabit, and keepe it, if they can. For many times in such cases, the euent of warre proues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, whereas going where needs no <hi>Inuasion,</hi> they may make theirfull remoue, young and old at first, and rest secure of setling there.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and for mine owne part, I doe not like it. I nor am, nor can be perswaded, that it may be lawfull for one Nation to fight against and destroy another in that sort, and vpon no better title then the desire of their lands and goods, to bereaue each other of their rights and liues.</p>

                     <p>There be fiue things wherein these two actions doe very much accord, and which the one must vse as well as the other, or else they cannot prosper.

The same must they doe, that will plant in another Country. They must know certainly the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, the largenesse and quantity thereof, the nature and quality of the Soile, the state of the Climate, the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Aire, the easinesse or difficulty of accesse and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto it, the most conuenient places for erecting Cities, Townes, and Fortifications there.

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:5744:56"/>The second is, people to make the attempt withall. They that<note place="margin">2. Number of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And they that will plant other-where, must raise such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as in all probabilitie may be able for number and industry, in some measure to take vp and inhabit the Countrey they goe to. To goe downe as <hi>Iacob</hi> did into Egypt with seuentie soules, and within a few scores of yeares, to multiply and increase vnto six or seuen hundred thousands and aboue: and to giue an onset and preuaile, as <hi>Gedeon</hi> did, with three hundred halfe armed men, vpon two or three hundred thousands of well appointed Souldiers, is a matter of <hi>Admiration,</hi> shewing vs what God can doe, not of <hi>Imitation,</hi> what we may or must doe.</p>

                     <p>That cannot regularly and certainly be determined.

And they were so precise vpon the point (as they that knew well, without a number somewhat great, their Colonies could not possibly stand and prosper) that though they planted diuers Colonies in one yeare, as somtimes they did, yet they failed not of that number, that is, to send forth to euery seuerall place <hi>three thousand</hi> a peece at the least.

                        <q>what it is likely they in their policy could haue thought to haue beene a sufficient number, to send forth to plant a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey withall, wherein they were to settle and imploy diuers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Townes and Villages at once: and doe rest the more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That I am not in an error when I doe intimate or moue that into our Plantations, being so spacious and ample as they are, our people should goe forth by thousands, and not by hundreds.</q>

                     <p>This is it, as some thinke, that marres all.

                     <p>The fift is <hi>Policie:</hi> which in both these Cases must much<note place="margin">5. Policie.</note> be vsed. There must be policie for the getting, and policie for the keeping of that which is gotten. For getting victory against those they did inuade, good Martiall Commanders, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and indeuour hath euer beene to performe more <hi>Concilio quam vi,</hi> by policy and good aduice, then by power and force, haue vsed in former times a three-fold policie, <hi>Honour, Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi> 1. <hi>Honour,</hi> He that first climbed the walls had his Crowne. 2. <hi>Preferment,</hi> He that shewed most valour, was euer aduanced to higher place and office in the Campe and Armie, and sometimes to incourage them all. 3. For their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> they gaue them the spoile of the enemy. The whole boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was theirs if they could win the Towne. The like must be vsed in a Plantation. That the better sort, men of dexteritie, industry, and vnderstanding, be preferred to places of Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Authoritie: and that all that will aduenture to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Plantation, be vouchsafed by a liberall distribution of the Lands and Commodities of the Countrey planted vnto them, riches and meanes for them and theirs abundantly and gallantly to liue vpon. <q>Such liberalitie and aduancement will incourage men to goe, and will quickly make a good Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Couetousnesse and neglect of persons will neuer doe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. For keeping of that they haue gotten, Martiall men doe vse a two-fold policie, <hi>viz.</hi> to strengthen themselues, and to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the enemy. 1. They strengthen themselues by making for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications and setling garisons, if need be, to keepe the Citie or Countrey gotten. 2. They weaken the enemy, by taking from them their Armour, that they shall not be able to resist, though they would, and by taking of them their children and others
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5744:58"/>
for Hostages, that they may not dare to resist though they could. And they that will make a good Plantation must (as occasion shall require) vse the very like.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the people of those parts are all, or for the most part destitute of Armour, and vnskilfull in feates of armes, by all meanes it is expedient so to keepe and continue them. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they doe, for the most part, in number of persons, and strength of body already exceed vs, if we suffer them to haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and inure them to vse it, probable it is that within a little time, they will in valour too excell vs, and so beat vs with our owne weapons. These be the things wherein betwixt Inuasion and Plantation, there is so much affinity. To which I might adde two more, <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> without the former whereof, an <hi>Inuasion</hi> is not <hi>bellum,</hi> but <hi>Latrocinium,</hi> not a warfare but a robbery, and Plantation, not a lawfull Possession, but a cruell Oppression: and without the latter whereof, neither can an Army be leuied for Inuasion, nor will a multitude of people be gotten to set forth for a Plantation. But I passe by these, both because of the one I spake but little before vpon another occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the other, needs no question, seeing it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that all the places and Countries intended for Plantations by vs, are such as in all equity we may, by the Law of God and Nations enter vpon.</p>

                     <p>That I will doe willingly. The summe is this. First, it is the neerest place that now is to be planted, not aboue 14. or 15. daies saile with a good wind: whereas <hi>Virginia,</hi> and some of the rest, are twise as far at the least, and more dangerous for passage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is the safest place for Plantation, as which is out of the Road, as I may say, both of the Spaniard to his Countries and Plantations, and also of Pirats at Sea, who are most for the Straights. And, if need should be, whither soonest, [<hi>viz.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5744:59"/>
a few daies warning, they there may haue succour from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> againe from it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is the cheapest and readiest for passage and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, both of men and meanes of all sorts to plant with, both because our ships doe yeerely and vsually, two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred saile of them goe thither on fishing voyages, and that most of them but halfe loaden, and some with no lading at all: and by Plantation no doubt more may and will.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it may soonest be finished, and so we freed againe for some other Plantation, because it is but an <hi>Iland</hi> of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; not so big as <hi>England,</hi> but neere about the greatnesse of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Country it selfe is healthy and temperate, very agreeable to the Constitution of our <hi>English bodies,</hi> as which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere in the same temperature for heat and cold, that <hi>England</hi> is, rather warmer then colder, as which lieth aboue foure degrees neerer the South then <hi>England:</hi> and is incumbred with no noisome beasts or vermine whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the soile of the Country is very fat, rich, and good: fit for pasture and tillage, equall to most of our grounds in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, the whole Country is rich, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sea coast with fish beyond measure, as where our Nation and some others haue fished these fourescore yeeres, and where there is neuer like to be an end or want of that Commodity. The Land stored with beasts, birds of the field; fish of the riuers, water-fowle, wood, grasse and fruits of the earth, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, the Country, for the most part, is vtterly void of all Inhabitants, <hi>Saluages</hi> or other, so that there is no feare of <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> in it, nor of <hi>Corruption of Language or Bloud</hi> from it. Little Armour will suffice there for offence or defence.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, It lieth very neere vnto some parts of <hi>America,</hi> as neere as doth <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and therefore may be a good meanes for our possessing of some other and neerer parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then any we doe yet, and for conuersion of the people thereof to the <hi>Christian faith</hi> hereafter, and for our present and continuall hauing of such Commodities, as those parts may, and doe afford.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:5744:60"/>Tenthly, it is not farre also, <hi>viz.</hi> not a daies saile from an Iland called the <hi>Banke,</hi> an excellent place for fishing all the yeere: and not aboue foure or fiue daies saile from the Ilands of <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Azores,</hi> which are very rich and well stored with Wheat, Beeues, Sheepe, Goats, Hogs, Hens, and many other good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for a Plantation, which from those parts may be had, easier, sooner and cheaper then from <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. It is a Country very strong by Nature, as which is stored with many goodly Harbours so well made and fenced by Gods handy-worke, with Rocks and Cliffes, that a little For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification will make the whole, being but an Iland, and that not great, <hi>inuin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>12. It may be a meanes to increase the shipping of our Land, which is as it were, the wall thereof, wonderfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all our Seamen and Souldiers, for seruices by Sea, and so to gaine vs in time the freedome, soueraignty and safety of the Seas beyond all other nations whatsoeuer.</p>

But young men and single men, besides the want of experience in them, they can doe little good to the Plantation but in their owne single persons at most. Being vnmaried, if they continue so, they will hur and hinder the Plantation thereby, which will be no lesse hindred by the vnmaried there, then our land is hindred by the (poore) maried here. If they will marrie, they shall not easily finde with whom, vnlesse it be with the Natiues of those Countries, which haply wil be nor handsome nor wholesome for them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly profitable and conuenient (they hauing had no such bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as our women haue) i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

will be able and readie in a little while, some one yeare and some another, to enlarge and fill vp the Plantation, by addition of new families, as it were little new Colonies, euery where.

                     <p>But by your owne saying, if you should die within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, (and what Charter haue you of your life more then other men?) You must needs leaue them ill prouided for, and most of them either to the mercy of the world, which is little, or to the courtesie of their friends, which haply will bee lesle. And what need this, when by your remouing you may prouide for them your selfe, and see them in that good state, that they need not be beholding to any others, but rather able to helpe others.</p>
                     <p>4. Farther, the best prouision you can possibly prouide them here, if you might liue yet these twentie yeares, can be but for their owne time: but remouing as you may, it is very probable, hauing that meanes which you haue now, you may be able to settle both your selfe and euery one of them, though they bee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5744:63"/>
halfe a dozen, or halfe a score of them, in as good a Liuing or better, as your Farme that you now dwell vpon, for you and yours, and for them and theirs <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> for euer.</p>
                     <p>5. Consider also. 1. That it is so hard a matter to place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad a childe well here, that the placing but of one of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may bring you so farre behinde hand, that you may not be able to doe any thing for any other of them in seuen yeares after, there they may all be prouided for in some measure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. 2. How grieuous and reproachfull a thing it would be to your children, if hauing liued well in your time, they should come to liue in a poore, needie and beggerly fashion. To arise from a poore estate to a richer, is commendable and delectable: but to fall from a good estate to a worse, of all gricuous things it is one of the most gricuous and misorable. 3. Whether it be not an euill thing and vnaduised to put that vpon vncertainties, which a man needs not, but may be assured of, and put out of all doubt.</p>

                     <p>None at all. But of good estate and prouision for you and yours exceeding much more. For whereas though by the course of Nature and present state of your body, you may haply liue yet these ten or twentie yeeres, yet that is exceeding doubtfull and vncertaine. For of one that liues to that age, there bee an hundred that doe not: but that you may liue yet ten, or twelue, or twentie moneths to an end, there is great probabilitie by the helpe of God: and within that time you may haue gotten and setled a good estate in a Plantation to you and yours. For if you liue in the Plantation but one moneth more, if you but once remoue hence, and bee but on ship-board for the Plantation, though you die before you come there, (for I suppose such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be taken, if euer there be good order taken for a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) you and yours shall enioy, and be assured of the benefit thereof, as well as if you had liued therein seuen yeeres.</p>

                     <p>Is this the point you thought would plunge me, or set me a stand? This something is as much as nothing.</p>
                     <p>1. Now adaies indeed, and with vs, it is not very vsuall. But in ancient times, when Plantations were better followed then now they are, it was very vsuall, as you may see in the persons of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who were all men of great state, and in the men of <hi>Ioseph, Iosh.</hi> 17. 14. and in the men of <hi>Iudah, ludg.</hi> 1. almost thorowout. And as I could shew by the practise of<note place="margin">The manner in ancient times, how to raise people for a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> many Nations, who vsed when they intended a Plantation, to consider what number it were expedient for them to remoue, and that was vsually one halfe, a third or fourth part of the whole, both great and small, and then to cast lots, and as the lot sell so they went away, were they rich or poore, whether they had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings or not.</p>
                     <p>2. If the custome be otherwise now, that custome may and must bee broken, because it is not good: All good Lawes and Policie intending alwaies this, that <hi>Customes which are good and</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:5744:64"/>
                        <hi>landable onely, should be kept and continued:</hi> The other that are not such, as diseases, though of long continuance out of the bodie, should be expelled. Now certaine it is such a custome, that is, that none but the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>oter sort should goe ouer, and none of the better sort that haue any Lands or Liuings here, would proue very hurtfull and pestiferous to the Plantation. For who shall be Gouernors and Rulers in the Countrey, as I said the last day, and all men know some there must bee? What, poore, needy, and ignorant fellowes, that haue neither learning nor vnderstanding to such a seruice? Doth not very reason shew, that there must goe some of better breeding and experience, <hi>Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Further, what shall the poorer sort doe there by themselues without some, and that some store of others better stored in money and meanes then they, that may employ the poorer sort, and set them on worke, whereby they may be able to get money to sustaine them and theirs?</p>
                     <p>3. And euen in our times, it is not so vnusuall a thing as you seeme to vnderstand it to be: for you may soone learne, if you will but a little inquire; That in our time also, diuers men that had reasonable good meanes and Liuings here, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and planted themselues there to their great good and preferment. And thus you see that the cloake you haue made you of vsage and custome, will doe you as little seruice to couer your backwardnesse, as <hi>Adams</hi> and his wiues aprons made of Fig-leaues to hide their nakednesse.</p>

                     <p>My answer is this. First, though it be not of necessity that euery one must goe himselfe, that perswadeth or moueth others thereunto: For <hi>Plantation is no matter of our Faith and Saluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Instrument among the <hi>many thousands</hi> of our English Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that shall betake and bestow themselues in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the enlargement of Gods Church, of the Kings domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and of our owne English habitations. But I say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Secondly, I cannot goe as yet, because I haue not my meanes and estate so setled and prouided, as it is fit for one that will goe well. Thirdly, if I goe, it shall bee (partly) in hope by Gods mercifull prouidence toward me and mine, <hi>to better mine estate,</hi> and to doe good, as to others, so specially to those that are mine owne, or doe otherwise depend vpon me. And therefore I haue no reason to goe, till I see some good likelihood of probability and assurance that it may and will be done. Fourthly, I will not goe, by my goodwill, till I finde some good course taken for a good Plantation in that place or Country, wheremy desire and purpose is, aboue any I heare of yet, to plant my selfe. When some such course shall be taken and followed effectually, I will not (God willing) be one of the last, that shall make vse of it. Fifthly, I suppose I ought not either to tempt God, by going without good and necessary meanes; nor seeke my owne destruction by running before I am sent in good order: And therefore expecting a conuenient and appointed time, it is enough that I doe for the present prepare my selfe to be ready prepared against that time, and hauing my minde and affection setled that way, doe hearken as the good Souldier for the sound of the trumpet to the battell, for the publishing of that decree, that may rouse vp all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to such an attempt and expedition.</p>
