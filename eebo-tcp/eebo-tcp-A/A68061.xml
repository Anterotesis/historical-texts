            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus the Lord alwaies armed his Church, but moſt carefully in theſe laſt times, vnder the Goſpell. Which albeit it might appeare to haue beene leſſe needfull, for the huge meaſure of light and gracefull diſpenſation, therein beyond all former ages; yet, in reſpect that Satan, ſeeing his time to be ſhort, then chiefly bended his whole rage and full force of deceit (ſpecially in that huge myſtery of iniquity growing on ſo in all effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual working, with al power, ſignes, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in all deceiueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe and ſuch ſtrong deluſion, the ſonne of perdition ſitting as God, euen in the Temple of God, that, if it were poſſible, the very elect might haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) therefore the Lord himſelfe in the daies of his fleſh, gaue hereof not obſcure warnings; his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles diuerſly thereafter; and laſtly, in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, is the whole miſchiefe, in the parties, their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, the Church, her condition thereby, God his manifold wrath thereupon, to the full ouerthrow at length of all the enemies, and deliuerance of his Church; ſo at large and cleerely ſet forth; as we are not onely now to beleeue the things told vs before; becauſe they are alredy in a great part come to paſſe: but alſo, by the cleere light here opened to ſee what yet reſteth to be performed: &amp; with calme and ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minds (in a moſt delightfull light) to behold and diſpiſe all this preſent terrible and reſtleſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour of Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, by their emiſſary frogs: as where by they are but haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Wherein, as the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> ſeeing <hi>Salomon,</hi> by helpe of God, and to the praiſe of his truth in this, I found ſo much more then I preſumed, as <hi>no ſpirit was left in mee.</hi> Now, here withall, the earneſt petition of Saints pouſſing thereto, and after the ſtory of Chriſt in the fleſh, and of his Church raiſed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike labors, this falling in fitly in the courſe of my trauels to bee handled: yet nothing ſo much carried me to the publike reading thereof, as a holy indignation at the dealings of Romaniſts in our quarters too careleſly expoſed to their ſeduction. They had nothing more frequently in mouth then the antiquity, glory, &amp; multitude of their Church, the conſent of Nations, Counſels, and ſucceſsion of many Ages, with diſdaineful demands, where our Church was before Luther; and whether we eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

all our Forefathers ſo many ages paſt to bee condemned, who liued and died all in the faith and Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> with ſuch ſpeeches largely amplified and cunningly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, amongſt a ſimple people; as ſheepe for the moſt part without ſhepheards; I found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and credible information, that not onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny altogether ignorant were corrupted, but euen diuers inſtable ſoules, who had ſhewed ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of learning, and louing the way of truth, were rather quite alienated therefrom, or caſt in dangerous doubts: ſo as oftner then once, men otherwaies well ſtabliſhed, haue euen with ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude both by word and writ required of mee how the hearts of the weake might be ſtaied againſt theſe obiections. To whome as both waies, in the time, I gaue ſatiſfaction, ſo, it haſted me to the publike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this prophecie: whereby euen the moſt ſimple, not wilfully ſhutting their eies againſt an ingyring light, may cleerely ſee how that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they glory moſt, turneth moſt to their ſhame, and that, wherwith they moſt reproch our Church ſpeaketh ſtrongly for vs. If this ſeemeth ſtrange to any, they haue not yet learned, that, as great is the miſtery of godlineſſe, ſo alſo is that of iniquitie: and to know the hid ſecrets of either, none euer ſhall attaine: who by the heauenly light of the word, goeth not higher then all authority, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, cuſtome, or conſent of men. Now, albeit, at firſt, I minded nothing leſſe then to write any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereon, but ſome ſhort note for mine owne vſe, of ſuch things wherein my iudgement did vary
<pb facs="tcp:2565:7"/>
from moſt part, or all enterpreters: yet cloied with continuall requeſts to write at large, what by voice I deliuered, I was induced to take a mid courſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to write ſo ſhortly as I intended, nor at ſuch length as they required: but ſo, as who were my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, reading it, might remember what further they had heard, and others might ſo farre bee ſet in way, as by their owne eaſie paines, to find out what for more cleere explication is requiſit. I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored, though not ſo farre as my owne diſpoſition would haue carried mee, yet ſo farre as giuing to ſuiters ſome contentment I could, to be ſhort, and not burthen the reader with any tedious diſcourſe of commonly knowne matter.</p>
            <p>On the firſt three Chapters to buſie my ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo farre as was neceſſary for coupling them with the reſt of the prophecy. I thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: ſo much being already written thereon, and by ſo many both learned and godly men. Whoſe trauels on the reſt of this prophecie, by this my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am ſo farre from either deſpiſing or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that from my heart I both reuerence their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned labours, and ſincerely acknowledge my ſelfe to haue beene much helped thereby. But this being ſuch a worke, as wherein one wrong ſtich will carry thorow all the ſeame a ſenſible errour, and being of ſuch ineſtimable worth, as meriteth ſtill to be wrought on, till, in whole and each part, it keepe ſentence, I haue, hereto, in all ſinglenſſe and ſound affection contributed my ſparkle: expecting and hartily wiſhing others after me to doe the like, for more and more cleere light, till the Whore bee

               <hi>All the time of this preuailing euill, euen in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt height thereof, Chriſt had ſtill his true Church firſt lurking; and albeit not perceptible to the world, yet inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſence of her head, hauing powerfull and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpenſation of grace from him, and worſhipping him heartily and truly.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This ſummary propoſition is at length handled in the 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. and 20. Chapters: and thereupon the gracefull eſtate of the Church ſhewed Chap. 21. and 22.

Thirdly, euen their grounds and chiefe Doctors are ſeen corrupted &amp; deadly: and therewith in God his iustice, becauſe they had been bloudy murtherers of the Saints, they in their courſe get bloud to drinke. Fourthly, the ſtill waxing light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,

This miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable euent in the enemies, prognoſticated againſt all their buſie indeauors in the ſixt Viall, is now in the ſeuenth fully executed, with ſo ſtrange a commotion, alteration and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturning of the ſtate of the earth, by ſo vncouth plagues, as was not ſince the beginning of the world.

maugre all his endeauours, the reſt of men who haue long laien dead in blindnes and error, riſe alſo the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: there is a new face of a world, all enemies being ſo ouerthrowen, as the Church hath a moſt grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and quiet ſtate, for that Satan is now taken againe this ſecond time, and ſo as hee neuer getteth any liberty hereafter, either by errour to deceiue, or perſecution to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the Church her quiet; hee being now not onely bound vp for a thouſand yeeres as that firſt, but ſo as his deſtruction now begunne holdeth on till that full point it ſhall haue in the laſt iudgement, and the Church her raigne hereupon ſhall accordingly, not be for a thouſand yeeres onely, as at the firſt, but for euermore; hauing now performed in her and to her whatſoeuer reſted (foretold by the Prophets) vnaccompliſhed for her gracefull and quiet ſtate and her enemies full deſtruction here; and, in that, the myſtery of God is fulfilled: ſhee hauing no more to expect but the comming of her Lord for tranſlating her to glory.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke is the third part of the Euangelike Story, and hath the condition of the Church, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opſtolike times, till the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the myſtery. It is for the moſt part Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and accordingly, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a ſtile agreeable to the maieſty of ſo high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which were reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the beloued diſciple, and in goodly and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent types, in one continuall trance exhibited: with commandement of ſending a writen record thereof to the ſeuen. Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and vnder their names, the whole militant.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Of this it is, that beſides the inſcription, in the firſt three verſes, the whole is an Epiſtle: whereof, the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2565:16"/>
is to the 9. of the firſt Chapter. The valediction in the laſt verſe of all. The reſt is a narration of things heard and ſcene, to the 6. of the laſt Chapt. Whence is the generall concluſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Theſe things, for their diſtinct time, end, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reuelation, are two, and accordingly, the parts of narration. The firſt, is of things <hi>which are, and which ſhall come heereafter,</hi> that is, which both, in propriety of <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 19.</note> ſtory, then were exiſtent, according to the conſtitution of theſe ſeuen Churches trewlie expreſſed, and for their particular inſtruction: and yet ſo, as the things to come are therein alſo reuealed, for that the promiſes or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to, and againſt each, according to the good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, praiſed or taxed in them, are future: and for that, in theſe ſeuen Churches, the holy Ghoſt hath, in great depth of wiſdome, ſo liuely paterned the diuers caſes that may befall, as none euer hath beene, or in any age ſhall bee, which in one of theſe, as in a liuely example, may not clearely read her owne cauſe, and learne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherethrough it is, that this firſt part of narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the firſt three Chapters, for end and manner of reuelation, differeth from the ſecond, in that, albeit in ſome reſpect, the firſt be of things to come, and for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole Church, yet it is properly, of things then exiſtent, and firſt, for the vſe of particular Churches: whereas the ſecond thorow the reſt of the booke, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of <hi>things which muſt bee done heereafter;</hi> and whoſe vſe, is firſt and properly, for the whole militant Church, and therefore, to the perception thereof, <hi>Iohn</hi> behooued to goe vp to heauen, Chap. 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Before the firſt part is a goodly and glorious viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, not acording to the proper verity of his perſon, but according to his preſence and operation in, and towards his Church, and in ſpeciall regard of theſe ſeuen of <hi>Aſia:</hi> and therefore, commonly concerneth them all, as we ſee that from it are taken theſe properties
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2565:16"/>
and attributes which are fit to expreſſe his particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation towards each, and ſeuerally applied, as in them he worketh.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is commended, in that ſhee hath ſuch a preſence of Chriſt, ſo painefull, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, zealous, watchfull, patient, and conſtant a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that albeit the myſtery of iniquity was working, and falſe teachers were buſie to aduance it, yet they were ſo watchfully marked, and mightely reſiſted, that errour was borne downe, and truth helde place: but ſo, as at length, through falling from the firſt loue, a ſtep was made to Apoſtaſie. And therefore ſhe is warned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and doe the firſt workes vnder paine of remoouing the Candleſticke.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> errour and lies did ſo farre preuaile as heretikes durſt blaſt of the name of the true Church, and depiſe the pouerty and abiect ſtate of true profeſſors, yea cruelly perſecute and blaſpheme the way of truth.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Pergamus</hi> is praiſed, that, albeit, ſhee dwelled where Satan his throne was: yet ſhe kept God his name, but hauing this note of weakenes, that albeit they kept themſelues pure, yet Idolatry and ſpirituall fornication was tollerated by them, euen the doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> Againſt them and their followers, the <hi>Lord fighteth with the ſword of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>Thyatira</hi> is praiſed for her workes and loue, and ſeruice, and faith and patience, and that her workes are more at the laſt then at the firſt. But hath this note of infirmity, that albeit ſhe dranke not of <hi>Iezabel</hi> her cup, nor committed fornication with her, yea and was wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in loue and workes thereof, yet ſhee had not either the knowledge or the courage to challenge her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as ſhee ought, but euen tolerated, that Whore, whom God will caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, euen the bed of torment, as alſo hee threatneth that hee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2565:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will caſt into great affliction that commit fornication with her, except they repent, and kill her children with death.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In the Church of Sardis, if they could remember what they haue receiued and heard, they were happy: but vpon defect hereof they are taxed, that hauing a name that they liue they are dead, &amp; that their works are not perfect in Chriſt his ſight: Howſoeuer among them God hath his number, whoſe hearts and liues are anſwerable to their profeſſion. To whom is promiſed that they ſhall walke with Chriſt in white. And the reſt are warned to repent and watch; leaſt he come vpon them in an howre that they know not,</p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>Philadelphia</hi> hath an open dore ſet before her, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which to enter for any humane aide, ſhee is of little ſtrength, but what Chriſt <hi>openeth, none ſhal be able to ſhut; and what he ſhutteth, none ſhall be able to open:</hi> ſo that at the feet of this Church, notwithſtanding her little ſtrength, yet the enemies, are faine to bow and giue their names. And hereupon ſhee hath the promiſe to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed as a pillar, <hi>not to goe out any more,</hi> and that on her Chriſt will <hi>write his name, &amp;c.</hi> So as to haue this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour permanent to bee Chriſt his true Church, that new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from heauen, which ſhall neuer be moued.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In <hi>Laodicea</hi> they thinke themſelues ſo ſetled, gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſtrengthned as they become ſecure and vainely preſumptuous. This bringeth in a cold indifferency, in matters of God his worſhip, men beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming <hi>Luke warme and neither cold nor hot,</hi> the very next ſexe to plaine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme. Chriſt, for ſoueraigne medicine againſt this euill, calleth vp to his true riches, wiſdome, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and hope of his throne whereto we attaine by fighting and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming, as did our Head.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond part of this propheticall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is henceforth to the 6. of the laſt Chapter, of things to fall out after the time wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> had this reuelation, and concerning, firſt and properly, the whole militant Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In this, is firſt, the preparation of the Apoſtle to the perception of theſe myſteries, and then, the things reuealed. The preparation is in the firſt and beginning of the 2. verſ. of this Chap. and is, by ſight, by inuiting voice, and the euent of both in <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 In the firſt, beſides the thing which he ſeeth, are two circumſtances; of time, and the ſeer his diſpoſition. The time, is after the perception of the former things, wherein no intermiſſion is to be imagined, but onely the order of manifeſtation noted, all being but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trance, vpon one and the ſame Lord his day. The ſeer his diſpoſition is, that he yet looked, ſhewing a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire and earneſtneſſe, not reſting in things already ſeene, but intending ſtill his eies to ſee more. Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, beeing in ſobriety and ſincere affection, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fruitleſſe in any. That which, for preparation, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeth, is an open doore in heauen, a ſigne of an entrie, opened vnto him to the ſight of heauenly things, which neither are earthly, nor of earthly mindes comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16. Acts 7. 56. Gen. 28. 17.</note> Thus, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaw the heauens opened, ſo did <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt Martyr: <hi>Iacob,</hi> vpon ſuch a ſight, called <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>z, Bethel,</hi> the houſe of God and gate of heauen: and the Lord moſt plainely, ſhewing what by this frame of ſpeech is meant, when hee would tell of a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpenſation and ſight of heauenly things: hereafter, <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 51.</note> ſaith he, <hi>yee ſhall ſee the heauens open.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 In the inuiting voice, are two, what the voice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2565:18"/>
was, euen one and the ſame of a trumpet, which firſt ſpake to him Chap. 1. And next, what the voice vttered: wherein, is the commandement, and end thereof. The commandement is, <hi>Come vp hither,</hi> whereby is required, in <hi>Iohn</hi> and all hearers and readers hereof, a riſing aboue themſelues, from the earth and all earthly affections, to enter at the doore, opened by God, to ſee his ſecrets. For as God his true Church, conſiſteth of ſuch as are not <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> of the world, ſo neither is God his diſpenſation towards them, neither their gracefull ſtate thereby, to naturall and worldly men perceptible. And heereof it is, that throughout this Propheſie, heauen, in oppoſition to the earth, is taken for the ſtate of the true Church, as the earth is for the worldly ſort. The end of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, that he might <hi>ſhew him things which muſt bee done heereafter;</hi> which ſort of things, are moſt difficile to know, and yet we muſt deſire to vnderſtand. But the Lord doth nothing, but that <hi>he reuealeth to his ſeruants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Amos 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 The euent, in <hi>Iohn,</hi> cleereth the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. This euent is, he is rauiſhed in ſpirit: not as if this were an other trance the former being paſt; but, to ſhew a further intending of ſpirit and degree of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhment, now requiſite, for perception of more hidde and retired matters then were the former; which were, firſt &amp; properly, of things then in earth exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned particular and viſible Churches: whereas the things following are not only future, but concern, firſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the whole militant, which with the eies of faith, we muſt behold, as alſo her condition. And this is, to all fleſh impoſſible, to whom God openeth not heauen, yea and whom he bringeth not vp, and to whom he ſheweth not the ſame, when they are come thither. For in theſe matters, before we enter in the Lord his Sanctuary, wee are but beaſts, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. 17. 22.</p>
            <p n="6">6 This is the preparation. The things offered to <hi>Iohn</hi> his perception, follow thorow the reſt of the booke
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2565:18"/>
and haue two parts. For as the whole, concerneth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtate of God his Church, and God his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in grace towards her, and wrath againſt her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers: ſo before the ſtory of ſpeciall euents, is put, in this and the next Chapter, a goodly viſion of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition of God his Church, and his adminiſtration for and towards her. As we ſee in the beginning of the propheſie of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> the like viſion of God his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> adminiſtration in the world: and as, before the firſt part of this propheticall narration, a viſion was put, to ſhew the operation of Chriſt in his Church. The firſt part then of the two, is in this and the next Chapter, and may well be called a generall introduction to the ſpeciall ſtory. The other part, hath the ſtory of ſpeciall euents, to the 6. of the laſt Chapter.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In the introduction, are firſt, a goodly type of the Church militant, as in, and againſt all troubles, it hath, and euer ſhall ſtand ſtable, through God her King, in the midſt of her reſident, and his generall diſpenſation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her gratious, and for her terrible, in this Chapter. And next, his particular diſpenſation of this preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation and things therein, for her inſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: the excellent dignity, of which particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, is by many arguments, ſhewed in the 5. Chap. And both theſe, are here for great vſe. The firſt, for ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart of <hi>Iohn</hi> and all Chriſtians, againſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dangers, wreſtlings, decaies, and apparent eclipſes of the Church, in the courſe of the ſubſequent ſtory, by ſetting downe in type, ſuch a ſtate thereof, as whereto alwaies, at leaſt with the eie of faith, wee may looke in the midſt of moſt deſperat calamities. The other againe, endeareth the particular gift, and ſhould greatly ſtirre to ſtudy, as whereof, with good reaſon, it was ſaid in the beginning, <hi>Bleſſed are all that read and obſerue, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 In this type of the Church in this Chap. her grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate is ſhewed: firſt, in the preſence of her King, euen God himſelfe, dwelling and ruling in the midſt of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2565:19"/>
her: ſecondly, in her dignity, which ſhe hath of her Lord: thirdly, in God his diſpenſation for, and towards her: fourthly, in her dutifulneſſe againe to her Lord, in al true worſhip and hearty praiſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 God is deſcribed from his office and from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His office, in that, as onely King, Lord, and Head of his Church, he ruleth therein, and ſteadfaſtly fixeth his habitation in the midſt thereof, as which he hath choſen to be the place of his feet, euen the mountaine wherein hee delighteth to dwell, yea wherein hee will dwell for euer. This is ſhewed by one onely throne ſet in heauen, <note place="margin">Ezek 43. 7. Pſal 68. 16.</note> and one onely ſitter thereon; the other thrones being in the circle, but His onely in the center. His nature, more to our capacitie, then as it is in it ſelfe, incomprehenſible, is ſhadowed by three iewels; all of great worth; a Iaſper, Sardine, and Smaragde: the Smaragde hath this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is diffundit in manner of a Rainebow about the throne. Now, albeit I am perſwaded that the perfit knowledge, of the natures and vertues of theſe iewels, would giue a ſight of ſome analogy to God his nature, ſo farre as earthly and ſenſeleſſe things may expreſſe him to whom nothing is like, and that ſome thing alſo might be pretily ſpoken hereof, yet in ſo high a matter, beeing my ſelfe in expert in the nature and qualities of pretious ſtones, I dare not be bold: and what others, perhaps vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more knowledge deliuer, I rather it bee ſought in themſelues, then I ſhould ſpeake in ſuch matters, vpon any man his credit. This ſeemeth certaine, that heerein, the holy Ghoſt giueth vs to take vp, the trinity of that one, who accordingly, after, of the beaſts, is praiſed thrice holy. Wherein, as the Father, by the Iaſper, and Sonne, by the Sardine, ſo the holy Ghoſt, by the Sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragde is ſignified: Whoſe ſingular note, of beeing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit about the throne as a rainebow, hath a ſweet ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy both to his proceſſion and name, particularly giuen him by the Lord, of Comforter. Neither is this to bee eſteemed a vaine ſpeculation, becauſe in this ſame Chap.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2565:19"/>
the holy Ghoſt is ſet out in ſeuen burning lamps, and the Sonne at length, in the next: for the conſideration is much diuers, and no leſſe neceſſary, for a diſtinct vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the perſons, as in them, and each of them, one and the ſame deity ſubſiſteth, according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relation, ſo, ſitting in the throne: and for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, according to the outward oeconomy or diſpenſation towards vs. For hereafter in this Chap. the holy Ghoſt is deſcribed, more according to his graces and vertue in vs, then in the former conſideration: and the Sonne in the next Chapt. is deſcribed, as Chriſt and Mediator betwixt God and man: in the firſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both being one with the Father, ſit in the thron; in the ſecond, for expreſſing God his outward diſpenſation of grace, in the Mediator, by the ſpirit of ſanctification, they are deſcribed before the throne.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Thus is the preſence of God the King of his Church. Now her goodly and graceful ſtate, herethrough is ſet out, in the type of twenty foure elders; whoſe place, number, and dignity, are to bee obſerued. Their place is round about the throne, noting their attendance, open ſight, and eaſie acceſſe. Confer with this whole type, the forme of the campe of Iſrael <hi>Nomb.</hi> 2. Their number is twenty foure, for all elect, (for this is the type of the true Church, according to the purpoſe of grace) who are of Iſrael his twelue and Iſraelites indeede, and who are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the foundation of the lambe his twelue Apoſtles: for theſe are the firſt borne written in heauen to whom <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> we all come. For as none had lot of inheritance in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who could not deduce his pedigree from one of the <note place="margin">Chap. 21. 14.</note> Patriarchs, ſo the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is builded on twelue foundations, bearing the names of the twelue Apoſtles. This Church is larger then that of Iſrael properly. And as of Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ſtate was a <note place="margin">1. Chron. 24. &amp; 25. &amp; 26. &amp; 27.</note> type, ſo accordingly, hee not onely diſtributed all the Prieſts, ſingers, and porters of the Temple in twenty foure orders, but alſo the King his ſeruants monethly were

The firſt is expreſſed by lightnings, thundrings, and voices comming out of the throne; as in Scripture commonly, his terror in iudgement, is by theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. At the giuing of the law, God gaue out his terrour <note place="margin">Exod. 19. &amp; 20 Heb. 12. 18.</note> in a mount that could not bee touched, in blackneſſe, darkneſſe, ſound of trumpet, and in voice of words, which they who heard, beſought they ſhould heare them no more.

            <p n="12">12 The other part of God his diſpenſation is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in threefold graces, as the firſt was in threefold iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The three graces, are the ſpirit of ſanctification, the pure word of God, and the faithfull Miniſtery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The type of the ſpirit of ſanctification, are ſeuen Lampes burning before the throne; ſeuen for perfection of all graces: burning, both for illumination, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging power: Lampes, for this worke in our hearts, in which hee infundeth and nouriſheth the oile of grace to faith and loue: our ſound ſtate wherein, is compared <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> by the Lord to wiſe Virgins, hauing oile in their lamps, and wee are warned to haue our lamps burning, and that wee quench not the ſpirit.

And this is the third great grace of God vpon his Church, that hee hath giuen gifts to men, and raiſed vp to vs Prophets of our Brethren. In them are ſhewed firſt their properties, common and ſingular, and next their function. Of their common properties, the firſt is their place, betwixt the throne and the Elders, as Miniſters &amp; diſpenſators of grace from God to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as alſo for al their function, whereof hereafter. Thus placed, their number

is foure, as ſufficient to go to all quarters, like theſe foure Miniſters of God his generall prouidence and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. foure Chariots of Braſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6. the 4 Angels, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. Their next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon property is, that they are full of eyes, noting vigilancy and knowledge, for they are Watchmen, and ſhould bee able to teach, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, rebuke, improue and conuince. For their place, and calling, whereby they haue to looke continually to the Throne, to the Elders, the Church, and to themſelues, as placed for lights and examples to their flockes; they are full of eyes before, behind, and within. <hi>Act. 20. 28. 1. Tim.</hi> 4. 16. Their laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon property is, that each hath ſixe winges in all, anſwerable to the number of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo placed, as all are for flight (not as of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim, Iſai</hi> 6.) in ſuch ſort as they can intend flight no where, whether they haue not wings to carry them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wings round about as well as eyes; to ſhew, aſwel as knowledge and care, ſo promptitude and fitneſſe to helpe diligently, and miniſter a word in ſeaſon to the weary, to ſtrengthen the weake, to confirme the ſtrong, to raiſe them who are fallen, to bind vp the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to beate downe the lofty, to ſeeke what is looſed, and bring home what is ſtrayed. The ſingular property of each is: the firſt, had the face of a Lyon, ſhewing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; the ſecond, the face of a Bullocke, noting pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and labour; the third, of a man, for prudency: the fourth, of a flying Eagle, to ſignifie, as a contempt of baſe, ſo, a ſharpe ſight in heauenlie things; as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſoareth high, and is able to looke in the Sunne at No one-day. Now, theſe are not here ſo attributed, ſingularly, to each; as if they were vtterly depruied of the other properties, which cannot conſiſt with their vertues, which euer draw all theſe together in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as theſe foure. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. are deſcribed, each to haue all the foure faces: but here, they are diſtinctly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ſhew God his wiſe diſpenſation in his Miniſters of grace, ſo dealing aboundantly to all, as yet his diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2565:22"/>
of graces is to bee ſeene in each one. Further, if we conſider rightly, ſince the Apoſtles who excelled in all: the firſt ſucceeding Miniſters of the Goſpell, were like Lyons for courage, ſubduing all, and taking the ſpoile, none able to reſcue it. The next, for bloudy perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſtant ſuffering, were bullockes. The third, for prudent ſpying out of Antichriſt, were men. And therefore Chap. 13. to count the number of the beaſt, is counted wiſdome, and the witty are inuited thereto, and Chapter 17. the mind which hath wiſdome, findeth out who the beaſt is. The fourth ſort are of them, who, Antichriſt being reuealed and knowne, ſhall ſee as Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and ſoare vp to the beholding of the hid ſecrets of God his word; when the Angell ſtandeth in the ſunne, Chap. 19. as the dayly growth of knowledge in theſe and other miſteries of the Kingdome, giue not onelie ſure eſperance, but already great proofe. Now this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of gifts, God giueth as hee findeth expedient, and as they may beſt ſerue for his honour and good of his Church, hee requireth the vſe: ſometime courage, ſometime patient ſuffering, ſometime prudency in both, ſometime a deepe ſearch of Scriptures, and of the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God; as according hereto, we ſee theſe foure to vtter themſelues, at the opening of the Seales, Chapter 6. Conſider alwayes, how conueniently theſe eyed and winged wights are ioyned to the glaſſie Sea: as the ſea in <hi>Solomon</hi> his Temple was ſet on twelue buls, and on the borders of the baſes for the Caldrons were Lions, <note place="margin">1. King. 7.</note> Bulles and Cherubins: the Cherubins, for their face &amp; flight, anſwering to both the man and flying Eagle, in this place. So ſweet is the conſent of Scripture. Thus are their properties common and ſingular. Their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is firſt deſcribed in generall, and next, from the ſpeciall end thereof. The generall is, God his worſhip, wherein, are two things; Firſt, their continuall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence night and day, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on nothing elſe: for who is ſufficient for theſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2565:22"/>
things? ſee <hi>Paul</hi> his example, Act. 20. Secondly, is the function or worſhip it ſelfe, wherin they kith ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which is, they are publike Heralds of God his praiſe, euen thereby teaching others to doe the ſame: according to the ſpeciall end we ſee hereafter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the forme is ſubſtantially framed. For they aſcribe to God all holineſſe, euen triple holineſſe to that triple one. Now, if our God bee holy who ſanctifieth vs, that, as he is holy, wee may bee holy alſo; this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to ſtudy to our ſanctification; for holineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth his houſe. Hee is onely Lord, therefore to bee ſerued; hee is God therefore to bee feared; and as <note place="margin">Pſal. 93. 5.</note> hee is not holy without authority, but is Lord and God, ſo hath hee not authority without power, for hee is almighty: ſo that we may and ought to put our whole truſt in him alone; and as hee hath all power, ſo is hee conſtant and true, as hee who is eternall and without ſhadow of changing, who, yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for euer, is, was, and to come: his holines is the more admirable, as ioyned with abſolute power, and ſuch a power as is not alterable: his truth giueth aſſurance of his promiſes, to repoſe thereon: here is all Religion. Thus is their function in generall. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall end is, to bee leaders of the Elders, that is, the Church, in this ſame duty of publike worſhippe and thankſgiuing, by going therein before them. This end is clearely ſhewed in that when the foure beaſts gaue praiſe, the twenty foure Elders fell downe, following their very words, as it were, ſaying Amen to them: and this is that fourth point which wee noted to bee in this Chapter, the worſhippe returned to God by his Church.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Their worſhippe is by outward geſture, and by ſpeech. The geſture is threefold, proſtrating, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and caſting their Crownes, all down to him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to none elſe, in caſting their Crownes, confeſſing their vnworthineſſe in themſelues,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2565:23"/>
of that high honour whereto they are called. Their ſpeech, hath the honour giuen to God, and the reaſon thereof: for, God will haue all our worſhippe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſeruice to proceed of knowledge, not as the Samaritanes, who worſhipped they knew not what. The honour giuen to God, is, all whereof, by ſigne they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 22.</note> themſelues vnworthy. The reaſon is, for that hee created all things, and that for himſelfe, as whereto no forraine cauſe, but his owne will ſtirred him, aboue which to ſearch any cauſe, is not onely groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but preſumptuous impietie. And this reaſon concludeth ſtrongly: for hee, of whom are all things, &amp; for whom are all things, ought onely of all things to receiue all honour.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Thus haue we the type of the true militant church of Chriſt vpon earth, but heauenly, ſuch as alwayes, by powerfull protection, and gracious diſpenſation of his Spirit, Word and Miniſtery thereof, hee hath preſerued in the greateſt power of darkenes, which, though the World cannot ſee, nor learne their ſong; yet the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by faith will perceiue and reioyce.

               </gap>hurch, and God his generall diſpenſation in her. The ſecond part is in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: wherein is ſhewed, in whom, for whom, and by whom it is that the Church hath all this preſence, protection and graces: and in ſpeciall, (for bringing on the ſecond part, in the ſtory of ſpeciall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents) by whom, and for whom, ſhee hath this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefite of this Reuelation; the great dignitie whereof, albeit it appeareth ſufficiently by that which in the former Chapter was ſeene, it being from ſuch a King as God, to his owne Church; yet here it is more plainely ſhewed in two great points. The one is, the retired highneſſe of the matter, ſurpaſſing the reach of all Creatures: the ſecond is, the ſingular worth, and prerogatiue of that perſonage by whome it is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The retired height of the matter, is declared firſt by the naturall condition of it, in it ſelfe: and next by the imbecility of all Creatures in attaining thereto. The condition of the matter is, according to the manner of men, ſet forth in foure circumſtances. 1. That it is in the hand of him that ſitteth on the throne. 2. It is a book. 3. Copiouſly written. 4. It is moſt ſurely ſealed. That it is in the hand of God, not onely is ſhewed the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency thereof, but alſo that the whole caſe of his church, and wrath on the world for her hard entertainement, are directed by him as the worke of his owne right hand; as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2565:24"/>
alſo his carefull memory of it, keeping the record ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his right hand, as men doe of theſe things they hold moſt deare. It is a booke, for the certainety of things, regiſtred in God his booke: Pſal. 139. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of men, who carefully put in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter that whereof they would haue the record abide ſure. For properly God hath no booke, but is his owne booke. It is copiouſly written, in that the inſide of <note place="margin">Fzech. 2. 10.</note> the roll (for bookes muſt bee vnderſtood, according to the manner of that time) not ſuffiſing to containe the whole; it is written alſo on the backe: and this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, beſides the certainety of the matter, ſo carefully and amply recorded, the ſpeciall prouidence of God in al the particular caſes of his Saints, as, whoſe wandrings are counted, teares are regiſtred, and haires are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. It is ſealed with ſeuen ſeales, to ſhew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe <note place="margin">Iſai 29. 11.</note> ſecreſie, as perfectly cloſed vp, which the number of ſeuen implyeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now beſides this condition of the matter in it ſelfe, the retired eminency thereof is declared alſo by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of all creatures to attaine thereto, proued by a moſt ſure argument, euen experience, which is heere ſet out after the manner of men: in that all beeing by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like edict prouoked to the opening of the booke, all come ſhort of it. Which firſt euent of imbecility of all Creatures, is more cleared by a ſecond euent in the Apoſtle, who thereupon mourneth a ſore mourning: Here then are to bee obſerued, the Herauld, the tenor of the Proclamation, and the double euent aforeſaid. The Herauld is a ſtrong Angell, hauing a ſtrong voice, ſuch as becommeth the Herauld of a great King, for making all Creatures heare him. And euen herein is implyed an amplification of the imbecility of creatures, as which all are prouoked, and haue lawfull warning. The tenor of the Proclamation is, <hi>Who is worthy to open the booke, &amp; looſe the ſeuen Seales thereof?</hi> ſhewing, as a free eſſay offered to all, yet that to atchieue it, was required great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2565:24"/>
worthineſſe. The firſt euent, is the inſufficiencie of all creatures, whereof, according to the ordinary maner of Scripture, is put a perfit enumeration, of thoſe <hi>in heauen, in earth, and vnder the earth:</hi> neither Saint nor Angel being found worthy of this work. And their weaknes is amplified, in that al were ſo far from the worthines of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and opening the booke, as none were able to looke vpon it. The iudgements of God are ſo great a depth. Vpon this firſt euent, followeth a ſecond, in <hi>Iohn:</hi> who hauing beene called vp to heauen, to ſee ſuch things as afterwards were to be fall the Church, hee is at the firſt, brought almoſt to deſpaire of ſeeing ought: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a holy, albeit infirme, affection (hauing forgot on whoſe breaſt hee had leaned) as zealous of the Church her good, and hartely ſorry ſhe ſhould remaine depriued of ſo great benefit, hee mourneth, and mourneth much; an affection now rarely found in any. And certainely, ſo long as, for obtaining ought out of God his hand, for our comfort, wee looke to any creature, wee ſhall reape but mourning, till wee ſee him, who onely is worthy, to bring vs grace from the father.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſecond great argument, of the dignity of this reuelation, is the worthy perſonage by whom it is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to whom God gaue it Chap. 1. And of him are to bee obſerued two things. Firſt, his performing of that, wherein all creatures had ſuccumbed; and ſecondly, the euent and effect following thereupon.

In the information, are the occaſion, the informer, and what he informeth. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is <hi>Iohn</hi> his mourning, whereof the informer would comfort him. For it is moſt true, that as, holding our eies on creatures, we can reape but ſorrow: ſo, till in conſcience of our owne wants, and felt experience of the vanity of all refuge to any creature, wee learne to mourne and mourne much, we finde no ſolid ioy, either

Our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels are not caſt out but by praier and faſting. <hi>Daniel</hi> had then greateſt reuelation, when he had bene in heauineſſe <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 21.

Now heauen and the twenty foure el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are the type of God his true Church, as hath beene cleared. As then, the true Church is the pillar and ſtable ſeat of truth; ſo without it, is neither ſaluation, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true knowledge: for <hi>God is knowne in Iuda.</hi> Hereby <note place="margin">1.

Where, take heed, wee eſteeme not, this to bee the reaſon of his worthineſſe abſolutely, but in relation onely to this fact, and all grace procured to his Church. For that we haue any acceſſe to God, or that any bleſſing is obtained to vs from God, it is through the ſlaughter of the Lambe, and merite thereof; &amp; this is that prerogatiue which the Lambe hath: the third point which I ſhewed was to bee obſerued in the Elder his information, in theſe words, <hi>Hee hath obtained, &amp;c.</hi> And great reaſon is there, why his ſlaughter ſhould bee of ſuch merite For the onely begotten ſonne of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and none tooke his life from him, but hee willingly gaue it, as who had power to lay it downe, and take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <note place="margin">Ioan 10. 18.</note> The effect and fruit of his ſlaughter, is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2565:27"/>
which is amplified, firſt, by that which buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing implyeth: albeit not put here expreſly, that is, our wretched ſtate, from which hee redeemed vs: for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, of neceſſity, preſumeth bondage, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was our bondage. Secondly, to whom wee are redeemed, to God. Thirdly, by what price, neither gold nor ſiluer, nor any corruptible thing, no bloud of Goates or Bullockes, but by his owne, that is, God his <note place="margin">1 Pet 1. 18. Heb. 9. 12.</note> bloud. Fourthly, is the large extenſion of his benefit, euen to all peoples, kindreds, tongues and nations; not as that of the Paſchall Lambe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> onelie. Neither thus, for that all, of all peoples, &amp;c find the fruit, but the elected of all, Therefore it is ſaid, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs out of all, &amp;c. The fift and laſt point, amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the effect of the ſlaughter, is to what condition &amp; eſtate wee are redeemed: euen to be Kings and Prieſts, <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 9.</note> to raigne euen here vpon earth, where we haue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, vnder hope of that of glory. Now, by all theſe, conſider if his ſlaughter be not of great worth, why hee onely ſhould obtaine to take the booke, &amp;c. and therefore, alone to haue the praiſe of it. In all this ſong and tenor of it, are diuers infallible Arguments, that theſe foure beaſts bee no Angels, but Saints redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as this whole type is euidently of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, and not of any ſtate in heauen.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Thus was the ſong of the foure beaſts, and twenty foure Elders: the Angels in courſe ſing the next part: in whom, are notable three things. Their place, their number, and their ſong. Their place is about the throne, beaſts and elders, for two reſpects: one of protection, and defence, <hi>The Angels of the Lord pitch round about</hi>

But hee hath alſo all wiſdome, &amp; with wiſdome ſtrength: ſo as nothing is lacking to him, or can let him to performe what him pleaſeth: therefore of all to bee honoured, in all things to haue the glory, &amp; of all things to report the praiſe. Next to the Angels, all Creatures ſing their part, of whom a perfect enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is put, as verſe 3. and in their ſong, they affirme what the Angels had ſung before them. This they haue ſingular, that to the Lambe they ioyne him who ſitteth on the throne; to ſhew that they are one, and their praiſe one. That ſinging of praiſe is attributed to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and inſenſible Creatures, it is the ordinarie frame of Scripture ſpeech; to ſhew that all things, in their

All which euils are againſt the world and worldly ſort, in vengeance of the Goſpell and true Church, perſecuted and contemned by them: till, by finall deſtruction of all enemies and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhe be beautified with fulneſſe of grace here, to the attent expectation of glory hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſixe ſeales opened in this Chapt. afford ſixe types of the enſuing euils: to all which, this is common, that the lambe openeth, and, that to each proceeding type, is ioyned a ſpeech, giuing the ſignification. To the firſt foure, is common, firſt, that their types are horſes and riders; and next, that to each of them is adioyned a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2565:29"/>
wakening voice of one of the foure beaſts, to ſtirre to attendance and perception, as of things, whereof, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it many felt the ſmart, yet none could diſcerne the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the valiant, patient, wittie, and ſharp-ſighted, and ſuch as by them were wakened to perceiue. Horſes (whereby not vnlike euents are in <hi>Zacharie</hi> expreſſed) as ſwift, fierce, and couragious beaſts, ſhew the celerity and the irreſiſtable inuaſion of theſe iudgements. The rider, guiding the horſe, and receiuing power to worke, ſheweth God his prouidence, directing and ruling all theſe euents. What in each type, is ſingular, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars will ſhew.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The firſt ſeale opened, bringeth out a white horſe and his rider armed with a bowe, and adorned with a crowne. To the beholding whereof, the firſt of the foure beaſts warneth. Whoſe Lions face, as it ſheweth cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſo his voice like thunder, ſheweth powerfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: ſuch as were the miniſters of the Goſpell in this time, abaſhed with no feare. The ſpeech giuing the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, is, that <hi>Hee went out conquering and that hee might ouercome.</hi> White coloure, beſides that it is the note of gladneſſe, truth, and ſimple pureneſſe, both in Scripture and heathen ſpeech: it is alſo, a note of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe. And ordinarily, triumphing Captaines rode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or had their triumphing Chariots drawen by white horſes. The bow, is a weapon ſmiting ſwiftly, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both neere and farre off. The crowne giuen him, ſheweth vndoubted preuailing, for victors are crowned. The type, thus we ſee, accordeth fully to the ſpeech vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of it. This is the type of the power of the Goſpell preached, whereby Chriſt ſubdueth all to his obedience, as <hi>riding on the word of truth and meekneſſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>

            <p n="4">4 To the perception of the ſecond type, vpon ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond ſeale, the ſecond beaſt like the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, giueth warning: while the patient ſufferers, and who, as calues, yeeld themſelues to be ſacrificed for the Goſpell; both themſelues ſee, and ſtirre others to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in this ſecond type, a iuſt recompence, on the world, for their bloud ſhed inhumanly. The type is a red horſe, with a rider, to whom is giuen a great ſword. A fit type for expreſſing, both in colour and kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that, which the ſpeech, ioyned for explication, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: that, <hi>to him was giuen power to take peace from the earth.</hi> This is the type of bloudy warres, a iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpell perſecuted.

horſe, with a rider, hauing a ballance. The opening ſpeech, hath this, ſingular, that it is vttered by a voice from the midſt of the foure beaſts, euen the voice of the Lambe, who ſtandeth amidſt the throne, beaſts, and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 6.</note> to ſhew, that by his direction, all theſe euents are directed and ruled, who hath <hi>the ſeuen hornes and ſeuen eies the ſpirits of Iehouah ſent thorow all the earth.</hi> This is the type of famine, fitly expreſſed by a blacke horſe, a dolefull colour. And what more lamentable caſe can fall, then that a mother ſhould eate the fruit of her owne wombe, euen <hi>her children of a ſpan long?</hi> Famine, maketh <note place="margin">Lam 2. 20.

Agreeably whereto, the voice denounceth ſtrange ſcarcity; but with a caution of not hurting wine and oile: ſo as the want, ſhould be of wheat and barly, the ordinary repaſt of all men, and which might worſe be wanted then wine and oile, which ſerue for the great and dainty ſort, and are ſpent commonly, more for ſuperfluity then naturall neceſſity. Heere then, is a grieuous famine, when the moſt neceſſary things for fuſtenance are abſtracted. The degree of ſcarſity is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that a meaſure of wheat ſhould giue a penny, and three meaſures of barly a penny, three of barly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing one of wheat: the Roman penny beeing in value neere our teſton or tenne pennies ſterling: and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Chaenix, beeing of all meaſures the ſharpeſt, as which was the ordinary ſtint of a bondſlaue his daies allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, out of which, at moſt, foure bread could bee baked.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To the perception of the fourth type, vpon ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fourth ſeale, the fourth beaſt warneth, like a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eagle: to ſhew, that albeit God, now, vpon conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in rebellion and contempt of his former iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2565:31"/>
bringeth on heauier: yet the induration of mens hearts ſhould bee ſuch, as none ſhould bee able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue God his working, but ſuch as riſing aboue the earth with ſharpe ſight looked on his dealing. The type is a pale horſe, a deadlie colour, and well fitting ſuch a Rider as death, and who is accordingly accompanied, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the graue, to expreſſe great mortality; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the commiſſion is large ouer the fourth part of the earth, the executors many; in reſpect that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chiefly here meaned (peſtilence) which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth vpon famin, as famin vpon war, commeth ſeldom out ſingle, but accompanied with the former, both ſword and famine, and moreouer with noyſome beaſts, God his foure great plagues, to ſhew here a heape of all iudgements iointly on the world for their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <note place="margin">Ezech. 14. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 That to the perception of the two types following, none of the foure beaſts giueth warning, it is becauſe the fift type it ſelfe ſpeaketh, and the ſixt bringeth ſo ſenſible a iudgement for greatneſſe and ſtrangeneſſe, as all, how endured ſoeuer, are compelled in it, to ſee &amp; acknowledge the day of the Lambe his wrath: ſo in it Chriſt his dealing ſpeaketh for it ſelfe, and theſe who made the ſoules of Martyrs cry in the fift type, in the ſixt againe, by iuſt recompence, are made to cry in their courſe, and that iuſtly, to the confuſion of ſuch as would rather heare the beaſts crying, at God his firſt and gentler ſtrokes, than regard the pittifull cry of the ſlaine ſoules. The fift type then vpon opening of the fift Seale, are the ſoules of Martyrs, lying vnder the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, crying, receiuing anſwere, and White robes. The ſpeech opening the ſcope of the type, is the tenor of their cry, and anſwere made thereto. Then to come by the right ſenſe of this type; wee muſt weigh the ſoules their demand, and anſwere made vnto them. In the demand conſider, firſt, who cry; ſecondly, the place at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them: and thirdly, their demand or petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2565:31"/>
The Cryers, are the ſoules of theſe who were ſlaine for the word of God; as to which they gaue teſtimony, &amp; held that teſtimony; for it is the cauſe that maketh the Martyr; and hee that perſeuereth ſhall bee ſaued. Their place is, that they lie vnder the Altar, by frame of ſpeech from the Legal worſhip, wherein no ſacrifice was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or accepted but at the Altar: at the foot whereof, round about which, and vpon which, the bloud and offering in diuers reſpects were powred, ſprinckled, and offered. For it is the Altar that ſanctifieth the offering. From thence hither a typicall ſpeech is borrowed, to ſhew, that all our obedience and ſacrifices of praiſe yea the offering of our liues and bloud for the honour of God and teſtimony of his truth, is onely accepted in Chriſt, who is our Altar, and ſanctifyer of all our oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For properly, neither, ſoules lye nor cry, nor haue robes: ſo as the Romans groſeneſſe, who hereupon build their ſuperſtitious laying of Saints Reliques vnder Altars, is not onely ridiculous, in that vpon things ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically ſpoken, they build Arguments of exiſtence in propriety; but alſo impious and idolatrous. In their demand, is firſt their affection or diſpoſition, in that they <hi>cry,</hi> and <hi>with a loud voice:</hi> and next, the ſubſtance of their demand. <hi>How long Lord, &amp;c.</hi> This their demand is ſtrengthned with an Argument from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, who is <hi>holy and true;</hi> whereto it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very agreeable that ſpeedy vengeance ſhould bee taken vpon <hi>men of the earth</hi> for ſhedding their bloud ſo cruellie and aboundantly. Now this cry is not here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſoules for any ſuch affection in them, who are farre from that, as reſting from their labours, &amp; free of all perturbation: but by this frame of ſpeech, to ſhew, that notwithſtanding all God his preceeding iudgements againſt the world for cruelty againſt his Saints: yet now it had come to ſuch a height therein, as it might well ſeeme that no longer it could ſtand with God his iuſtice, to delay the finall ouerthrow of that

bloody ſtate, by which the Martyrs ſuffered: whoſe bloud now ſeemed to cry for no leſſe, and to cry loude; as crying is attributed to the bloud of <hi>Abell,</hi> as the cry of <hi>Sodome</hi> is ſaid to haue come vp before God, and as the <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 10 &amp; 18. 20. &amp;c.</note> earth is ſaid to cry out of violence.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Thus was their demand. The anſwere hath in it a two-fold conſolation againſt the reiourning of the ſought vengeance. Firſt, by word, and next by ſigne. The firſt hath two arguments of comfort, one, that the delayed puniſhment of their perſecutors ſhould bee but a ſpace. For <hi>the hope of the righteous ſhall not periſh for euer.</hi> And the iudgement of the wicked ſleepeth not. The ſecond is, the reaſon of the delay, the perfecting of the number of their Brethren in the ſame honour of ſuffering: whereby, as the guiltineſſe, ſo the iudgement of the enemies behooued to grow. Thus a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite it is to die for Chriſt, and fooliſh is the world, in troubling the Church, but haſtening on ſo their owne deſtruction: from which it hath no reſpite, but till the Saints bee fulfilled, as had <hi>Sodome</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was in ſurety. The other conſolation, by ſigne, ſheweth a preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite giuen to the Church, the more patiently to attend the reuenge of their bloud on the world. The ſigne, is long white robes, which in Scripture haue a triple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: Firſt, they are the note of our State towards God: in which conſideration Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, put on by faith, is our white garment. The ſecond is our condition towards men, where our inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, through Chriſt dwelling in vs, and making vs to ſhine as lights in the middeſt of a froward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to the conuiction of gain-ſayers, is our White robe; God bringing forth our righteouſneſſe as the light, and our innocency as the noone day. The third reſpect, is to our ſelues, in which, our garment of glory, in heauen is vnderſtood. Of theſe three, in this place. The ſecond is meaned, as a moſt neceſſary conſolation to the Saints of that time, who were not onely murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2565:33"/>
in heapes, but alſo traduced with horrible calumnies, to eclipſe the glory of their ſufferings: whoſe innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, God now would bring to light, euen in the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and confeſſion of thoſe who had perſecuted them, to the great glory of their ſufferings, and high account of Chriſtianity, which had beene ſo farre abhorred. In ſumme, the euent ſignified by this fifth type, is, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the former iudgements of ſword, famine, and peſtilence, ſeuerally &amp; iointly executed againſt the world, for reſiſting the victory of the white horſe, and his Rider, whereby they ought beene terrified; yet the furie of the enemies ſhould ſtill increaſe, and that to ſuch degree of crueltie, as in God his iuſtice required their ſpeedy and finall deſtruction, which neuertheleſſe ſhould bee delayed for a time, but ſo, as the rage of perſecution being mitigated, the Church ſhould become of great account euen before men. Therefore, in this fifth Seale, is put the cry of Soules againſt cruelty, not that here it beganne, but for the hight whereto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were come now therein; as alſo a reaſon of God his patience in ſuch meaſure of wrong, was needfull. And further, hearts are hereby wakened to ſee the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the great plague in the ſixt Seale, when God in a great degree performeth the promiſed vengeance, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it then fully it ſhall bee executed, when vpon powring out of the ſeuenth Viall, they ſhall bee abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed who deſtroyed the earth, and the kingdomes of the world ſhall become our Lords: the reſt of Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine by the beaſt, euen the reſt of the womans ſeed, Chap. 12. 17. and 13. 7. and 14. 12.</p>

The firſt, is of theſe, who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues to more ſtrait rules of interpretation the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Spirite hath laid to them, will needes haue theſe ſeuen Seales, as alſo the Trumpets and Vials to bee ſo many knots or periods of time exactlie cutted, within which, the accommodation of each is to bee ſought; whereas they are no knots of time, but types of diſtinct matters; and the whole matter comprehended in ſeuen Seales (whereof, the ſeuenth affording the trumpets &amp; vials, hath the matter of foure times alſe much time, as all the former ſixe) ſheweth the weakeneſſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture; yea, the effects of them are ſeene clearely, to bee often of one time, the former holding out long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beginning of the next.

Then let vs hold this rule, that theſe ſixe Seales haue the ſtory of the firſt ſorrowes, as Chriſt calleth them, <hi>Mathew</hi> 24. 8. as the ſeuenth Seale hath both the ſecond ſorrowes in the ſixe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the laſt wrath in the ſeuenth, by ſeuen Vials.

            <p>That which hath ledde exceeding learned men in this errour of accommodation, both heere and in other parts of this Prophecie, is that wrong conceiued ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake before, that theſe ſeales and trumpets are ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of time; and, finding, that at the opening of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth ſeale, ſuch effects enſue, as are anterior in time to this fall of the Weſterne, and great weakening of the Eaſterne Empire, they drawe backe the accommodation. But, as the euils of the ſixe ſeales, which from Chriſt his owne words, I called the beginnings of ſorrowes, being taken whole and together, are anteriour, both in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and in time, to the euill of the ſeuenth ſeale and ſixe trumpets thereof: (as whereby are ſhewed the iudgements of God againſt the open rage of the Dragon in his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Roman Emperours, by all the degrees thereof, till induration, at length bringeth this ruine) and as the the ſecond great euill, of the ſeuenth ſeale and ſixe trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets thereof, taken whole, according to that height of miſchiefe whereto it grew, is poſterior, both in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and time, to the former: ſo in comparing parts, the ſecond in ſome firſt degrees of her grouth, is before the full end of the firſt. Heere is the deceit, that men thinke the effects of the ſixe ſeales muſt haue a full end, before the opening of the ſeuenth, vpon their forelaid preiudice. For, euen in the time of Satan his firſt open rage, he was buſie hatching the ſecond euill, the myſterie of iniquity working, euen then; albeit before it could be reueled, or come to any great height, that which with-held, behoued to bee taken out of the way: the ſixt head behoued to be wounded deadly, and the ſeuenth, riſing by the wound, euaniſh in a ſhort ſpace: that the eighth, by <note place="margin">2.

And the next Chapter, containing ſummarily the whole ſtory of the ſeuenth ſeale (before it bee opened for particular explication) ſheweth, that as that miſchiefe was in ſome degrees working on, in time of the ſixt ſeale: ſo, this Prophecie is penned for clearing of matter, and not for calculation of times. Albeit each euill (conſidered in the height thereof, and taken whole and together) is deliuered according to their order in time.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The ſumme then of all this Chapter is, that the Goſpell, going forth in power, ſhould by Satan, ſtirring the Empire of Rome againſt it, ſo bee reſiſted; as God in his iuſtice ſhould puniſh that ſtate, with ſending bloody both inteſtine and forraigne warres, ſtrange famines, and grieuous peſtilences, ſeuerally and iointly, and all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary plagues.

Their action, is to hold the forue windes, &amp;c. Windes when they are tempeſtuous, are noyſome, but blowing temperately and mildly, they bring a ſweet influence of fertility to the earth, and of purification both to ſea and aire.

in the Temple at all to worſhip, but when the Prince was in the midſt of them: they came in together and went out together, yet at the Eaſt doore, none but hee. And out of the Eaſt doore came the waters, which did grow to a Sea.

The commandement is, <hi>not to hurt,</hi> &amp;c till <hi>we haue ſealed &amp;c.</hi> His commandement ſheweth authority, whereby he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things in heauen and earth, both in mercy and iuſtice. As our brother, God is his God. <hi>I go to your God, and my God, your father and my father, Iohn</hi> 20. 17. The end of the commandement is, that the ſeruants of God may bee in ſuretie through his Seale in their fore-head. The ſpeech is from the 9. of <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> where, vpon, the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Temple, and all to enſue by the ſtate of <hi>Babell:</hi> ſuch a type of caution is put for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of ſuch as mourned, and ſighed for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed in that City: ſo, here a ſpirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and Captiuity being to come on the viſible Church by myſticall <hi>Babylon:</hi> the like Caution is proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the like ſort. The marking on the fore-head, is put but according to the manner of men, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a conſpectible mark on what they wold haue eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned from common, ſo as the beholders cannot miſſe to ſee it. Not that this Seale was perceptible to Antichriſt, or Miniſters of his deceit and cruelty. For the world ſaw not theſe ſealed ones, neither could learn their Song, Chapter 14. 3. but as I haue ſaid, by this frame of ſpeech, to ſhew their ſure protection by the prouidence of their God.</p>

For properly it cannot here bee taken: but the ſpeech is from the Church of Iſrael, and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner of the Propheticall denunciations: for, as when the Church conſiſted onely of Iſrael properly, the ſame was little in compariſon to that time, when by the Goſpell the Gentiles ioyne thereto; and as, euen of the Church of Iſrael, though their number were as the ſea-ſand, yet but a remnant was ſaued: euen ſo, in time of Antichriſt his darkeneſſe, the true Church of God <note place="margin">Iſai 10. 22.</note> ſhould bee narrow (as Iſrael, yea, but a remnant of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, as the Temple, while Court and Citie are giuen to the Heathen, Chapter 11.) in compariſon to the ſtate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the victorie, when (as by ioyning of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Church of Iſrael was enlarged) by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of theſe out of great tribulation, who with palms and white robes celebrate the victory, and by riſing of the reſt of the dead after a thouſand yeeres, an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude ſhall fill the Church.

Their coming out of great affliction, is the comming from vnder the bondage of Antichriſt: which how great ſpirituall affliction it is, they know who haue gotten the victory, in whoſe mouth God hath put this ſong, <hi>Saluation is of our God, and of the Lambe.</hi> For this tribulation, ſee the fift Trumpet, Chapter 9. And when God openeth the eyes of the Iewes to ſee their common Sauiour, then ſhall they well vnderſtand what both ſpirituall and bodily affliction they now are in which ſhall endure, ſo much the more their victory: Hee ſheweth their long white robes to bee their iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the bloud of Chriſt apprehended by true faith, expreſſing the action of faith in theſe words, <hi>they haue drpt, &amp;c.</hi> Thus noting a great difference betwixt them now, and when their garmentes were dipte in the mire of mens merites, in the filthy ſincke of Antichriſts Indulgences, and puddle of Purgatory: and in Iewes now a great change, no more ſeeking to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, which is by the law, or placing it <note place="margin">Rom. 103.</note> in diuers waſhings, rites and carnall ceremonies, which cannot purge from ſinne: but dipping their robes <note place="margin">Heb. 9. &amp; 10. 4</note> alſo in the bloud of the Lambe. So liuely the holy Ghoſt painteth out theſe things. Thirdly, hee ſheweth of them, that their ſtanding before the throne, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the true Church of God, worſhipping him in truth.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thus is the victory, now their gracefull ſtate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is ſhewed in a freedome from all euill, and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all good, and that through God his preſence, and protection, and the Lambe his gracious diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet out in ſo goodly a manner, as many thinke the things here promiſed to bee of the Kingdome of glory; but here in magnifike termes, the goodly ſtate of the

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſixth ſeale being opened, firſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the proper euent thereof in the end of the ſixth Chapter; and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapter, a ſummarie view giuen (for ſtrengthning hearts againſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour thereof) of the whole matter of the ſeuenth ſeale; which heere, now is opened, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all euents thereof declared, through the reſt of all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall narration. Of theſe, wee haue, firſt, a generall preparation; and next, the perticular execution. The preparation, hath an incident effect immediatly following vpon the opening of the ſeale: which is, <hi>Silence about halfe an houre.</hi> To ſhew an attent expectation of great things; whereto well, the portending of them in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, might haue erected the mindes. And the waiting for rare or fearefull euents, worketh a ſilent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. When the wiſe ſpeake, then all keepe ſilence: and <note place="margin">Iob 29. Habac. 2. 20.</note> when the Lion roareth, all the beaſts of the forreſt hold their peace. Beſides this, great things commonly come foorth with proceſſe and preparation. And truly, God who is ſlow to wrath, is, in a ſort forced to poure out hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie indignation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 After this incident effect, is the preparation in the miniſters, and in the orderer of the whole errand. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are deſcribed by their nature, <hi>Angels.</hi> Quality, miniſtering Spirits, as who <hi>ſtand before God, Luke</hi> 1. And inſtruments of miniſtration, <hi>Trumpets.</hi> In the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are noted two things. Firſt, that they are trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and ſecondly that they are giuen to them. That the inſtruments are trumpets, it ſheweth that their miniſtry in this enſuing matter, is to be ſounders of the alarume, and giuers of the figne for inuaſion of the world by each woe, as als many armies of him who is Lord of hoſts: as alſo,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2565:43"/>
that they are denouncers, &amp; that of great and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, Trumpeters are meſſengers of great things, and, but for great perſonages. In this alſo is implied, that the end of their miniſtry and of theſe iudgements denounced and executed, is to waken vp the dead world to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or make it inexcuſable againſt finall wrath. See the end of Chapter 9. Therefore when the world is not wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Trumpets, it feeleth iuſtly full cups of wrath tumbled out. That theſe Trumpets are giuen to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it ſheweth them to doe nothing without ſpecial war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and mandate.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thus are the miniſters; the maſter and orderer of the errand, is deſcribed by his office, and his actions. His office, that he is an Angell: for that, is heere the name of office and not of nature. And this angell differeth farre from the other ſeuen: for he is the Angell of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, cleerely by all his notes. He ſtandeth as the other ſeuen, for hee alſo, in ſome reſpect, is a miniſter: but hee hath a particular ſtand, which is at the Altar, as High Prieſt. He is furniſhed alſo with an inſtrument, but which is proper to the Prieſt, and belonging to the moſt holy place; to wit, the golden Cenſer. He hath alſo ſomewhat <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 4.</note> giuen to him, but a rare gift; that is, <hi>Many odors,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the praiers, and of all Saints is acceptable. For by him we offer vp ſacrifices to God. In the fifth Chapter, <note place="margin">Ebr. 13. 15.</note> the praiers of Saints are called Odors, and heere the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours are diſtinguſhed from the praiers: onely to ſhew, how it is, and in whom that they are odors; that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. Theſe odours are ſaid to be giuen him, according as he acknowledgeth all things to be giuen him of the Father; as he who is both ſealed and ſanctified, and as mediator, hath receiued the ſpirit without meaſure. This is by alluſion to the Leuiticall miniſtrie, and not to the Maſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 His actions are two: one, of gracious diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of wrath; as hee, who is both the propitiation for Saints, &amp; trcader of the winepreſſe of Gods indignation:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2565:44"/>
both an elect precious ſtone, and a ſtone of offence. And our conſolation heerein is great, that to him all iudgement is committed. His action of grace, is the offering vp of the Saints praiers, and making the gratefull ſmoke of them goe vp before God through his odors: and this hath a double conſolation: firſt, that God alwaies in the midſt of wrath remembreth mercy, and is neuer ſo carried in wrath to poure out heauy indignation on the ſinful world, but that the louing care of his elect commeth firſt in place: ſecondly, that the praiers of Saints haſte on indgement on the world, while they ſend vp ſighes and groanes for God his diſhonour, a great incouragement to prav. <hi>If Iſrael had turned to mee, how ſoone would I haue humbled their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 13. 14</note> His ſecond action, is a ſigne giuen to his trumpeters, who ſtand attending it from him, to ſet too, to particular execution. The ſigne is, <hi>Hee filleth the Cenſer with fire, &amp;c.</hi> In token of burning wrath: and <hi>with fire of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi> For, as the acceptation and ſanctification of all the Samts and their offerings is of him, who is the true golden Altar, ſo all his wrath on the world is from him: in whom, all men, in God his predeſtination, are ordered to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ends, according as they are either giuen to him, and builded on him, or paſſed by, and ſtumble at him. This fire, is alſo from the Altar, for the ſpiritual iudgements that it worketh. For the fire of this Altar hath double effects. It is gracious, nouriſhing, purging, renuing, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the elect, Iſai 6. And it is a fire deuouring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, &amp; burning vp the world as ſtubble: for our God <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 24.</note> euen a conſuming fire. Chriſt, comming into the world, brought both the one and the other, though the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. Thus, from one and the ſame Cenſer, and one and the ſame Altar, one and the ſame fire, both ſendeth vp a ſweete perfume, and downe a conſuming wrath. As the praier of <hi>Elias</hi> brought both fruitfull raine and deuouring <note place="margin">1. King. 18.</note> fire: and as the two witneſſes, Chapter 11. are to the godly, candleſtickes and refreſhing oliues; but, with fire out of their mouthes, ſlay their aduerſaries. <hi>If I bee the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2565:44"/>
man of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliah) let fire come downe from heauen,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. King. 1.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vpon this fire caſt on the earth, follow <hi>Lightnings, Thundrings, Voices and Earthquakes,</hi> euident types of horrible iudgements and commotions, Chapter 4. And ſo heereby the attending Trumpeters get ſigne to blow the alarum, and denounce particularly the iudgements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God was now to plague the blind and obſtinate world. And vpon the ſigne thus giuen them, they ſet too in order to blow. See Ezech. 10 for this caſting of fire, in ſigne of wrath and God his departing from his ſanctuarie.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thus farre is the generall preparation. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular execution, hath in each, the denunciation, by the trumpet, and the effect inſuing. And are diuided in ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſe woes, and heauier and greater. The firſt ſoure, in degree of compariſon, are lighter, and are in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The three other, are heauie: whereof, two are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the 9, 10. and a good part of the 11. Chapt. The laſt holdeth to the end of the whole narration. The firſt foure, are als many degrees of the myſtery of iniquity wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on to that fearefull height, which is in the fifth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet accompanied with a no leſſe deadly euill, for iuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof, in the ſixt trumpet: which being inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to worke repentance, commeth on the laſt wrath in the ſeuenth trumpet.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Vpon the firſt ſound, are ſeene haile and fire ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blood: which, caſt on the earth, that is, in the viſible Church, Chap. 7, Section 2. Produce then a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effect, <hi>That all greene graſſe, &amp;c.</hi> The iudgements of God in Scripture are ordinarily expreſſed by haile, fire, <note place="margin">Pſal 11. 6.</note> and ſtormy tempeſt. God borrowing ſpeeches from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things to ſet foorth his terror. But this ſpeech heere, hath a ſpeciall alluſion to that plague on Egypt, Exod. 9. and Pſal. 105. Now then, to finde the analogy, as heere the burning vp of graſſe and trees, is to expreſſe the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cay of ſpirituall life, and moiſture in all true Chriſtianity: and that not onely in weake ones, as graſſe; but in the ſtrong, as trees: ſo, heere we are to ſearch, agreeably to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2565:45"/>
this effect, what is anſwerable to haile and fire. It is the fire of God his ſpirit, begetting in vs faith and loue, which maketh vs Chriſtians weaker or ſtronger, according to the meaſure of grace giuen vs, and our grouth therein: and that by the watering &amp; moiſtening of ſweet ſhowers of grace, as dew vpon the mowne graſſe, or raine on the thirſty ground. For of heate and moiſture commeth all flouriſhing greenneſſe. Hereof it is, that ſo often, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are exhorted to edifie on another in loue. This burning heat did eat vp our Lord, and in it the Apoſtle burnt: this fire of loue is the band of perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we grow vp, as one man in Chriſt. And hereupon, are <note place="margin">Col. 3. 4.</note> in Scripture, ſo many atteſtations to be like minded, and deteſtations of debate and diuiſion. Now when this fire of loue is turned into the fire of contention: then they, from whoſe mouthes ſhould droppe, wiſdome and refreſhing ſhowers, ſend out the could haile of their owne affections and froſty ſhowers of ſelfe-loue: which in place of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and nouriſhing the hearbes and trees, by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome word and ſound example of life; in contrary, burne them quite vp, as doth haile and fire. This was the firſt euill, which entred into the Church, for the firſt degree whereof, the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was taxed. Which degree betime growing, not only to coldneſſe in loue, but alſo to fiery contention, and mixed with froſty haile, wrought this fearefull effect, and firſt ſtep to antichriſtianiſme, euen want of true religion, and of the life of God in a great part.

For Riuers and Fountaines are in a degree of purity and ſubtle Nature, aboue the Sea, as the Sea is aboue the earth.

            <p n="9">9 The fourth Trumpet bringeth a darkeneſſe in part vpon Sunne, Moone, Starres, day and night. A kindlie degree of euill to follow on the former: and there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al noting yet a higher degree of Apoſtaſie, and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the myſtery of iniquitie, as the heauenly lightes are aboue fountaines and riuers. This is the type of darke ignorance, comming on the world, firſt in a great part. The former euils aroſe, more vpon contention, pride and bitter deſpite, then vpon ignorance (while men either not aduerting, or maliciouſlie miſcarried they tooke place) but now together with theſe, commeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo groſſe ignorance in a great part, darkening all true knowledge. Chriſt is our ſunne whom wee behold in the true light of his Goſpell, whereof when the third part is darkened, ſo farre is our ſunne darkened to vs. The Moone and ſtarres are they in whoſe hearts God ſo ſhineth, as they are able to make the light of the knowledge of God, to ſhine in the hearts of others, in the face of Ieſus. The day is that light, thus mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from our ſunne by theſe ſtarres, wherein we walke,

who are children of the day, and not of the night. For ſtarres here muſt bee conſidered, more as receiuing light from the ſunne, they diſpenſe it to vs, then for that they ſhine in the night, And here the night ſignifieth that light which naturall men who are not children of the day but of the night, yet haue in humane ſciences &amp; liberall arts (in compariſon to the light of the Goſpell. but a night of darkeneſſe) whereof now by this Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet came a great decay, as in ſtory is more then manifeſt. Now as theſe euils are ſaid to worke but on the thirde part in each kind, to ſhew that the firſt degrees came on but in part: ſo as firſt the loue and life of God abode in the moſt part of the Church, as in the ſecond degree, yet the moſt part worſhipped purely: and in the third, held ſtill the Orthodox faith: like as now in the fourth yet continued great meaſure of learning, both in diuine and humane ſciences. Whereas, in the next Trumpet, al falleth to the height of euill, and a totall and common Apoſtaſie is ſet downe. And therefore for preparation to it, a heauie warning is giuen of a triple woe. But this warning is by an Angell flying through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of heauen, and ſo farre remoued from the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of earthly men, it being ſo farre and obſcurely deliuered, as few were capable thereof, or aduerted it: ſee Chapter 14. and 18. 1.

Of theſe three, the firſt is in this fift Trumpet: euen that huge miſchiefe of Antichriſt, to which height of iniquity, the former euils were als ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſteppes. The other two woes, following in the 6. and 7. Trumpets, are the conſequences in God his iuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, of this great woe: the one, for puniſhment, to prouoke repentance in the 6.

            <p n="2">2 In this euill, are the origine whence it ariſeth, and the euill it ſelfe, the origine, is firſt and ſecundarie ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the firſt. The firſt is the fall of a great ſtar from heauen to the earth, the type of Paſtors of great marke falling from being heauenly, to becom earthly, from the true ſtate of Saints to the ſtate of the world, and to the loue thereof: from light to darkeneſſe, from the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, to the keyes of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit. Now as this fall was not in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or point of time <hi>(nemo repente fit turpiſſimus)</hi> but by degrees, ſo is it not to be taken of one man perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but is the generall type of that euill, wherein Paſtors falling, they became ignorant, and miniſters of darke ignorance: out of which aroſe the miſchiefe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2565:49"/>
and his poyſonable Armie: the euill is the loue of the earth, where through cometh this change of Keyes, by an Apoſtaſie and falling away of theſe who had beene ſtarres of heauen and miniſters of light, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, to bee the miniſters of other Keyes, euen theſe of <hi>Gehenna.</hi> This is that ſucceſſion, and theſe are the Keyes, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Biſhoppes thereof ſo much bragge of, as this whole propheſie euinceth clearely. The ſecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry origine of the euill, is darkeneſſe ariſing through this fall and change of Keyes, and that in a ſtrange degree; for this darkenes is not in part, as that of the fourth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, but it eclipſeth all light, actiue and paſſiue, ſunne and aire. Chriſt is our ſunne, whoſe beames lighten our ſpirituall aire, whereby wee both walke in light, and draw in a pure breath for intertainement of our ſpirituall life. This by this darkeneſſe of the bottomleſſe pitte, (which aroſe through that paſtors falling to the loue of earthly things, loſt the key of knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Miniſters of darkeneſſe) is wholy eclipſed, ſo as all the face of the viſible Church is darkened, and common life in it corrupted The euill of the third Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, was by fall of a great ſtarre, but that fell in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and riuers, ſo making them in a part bitter: but here the deſire of riches and loue of the earth maketh all erre from the faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Of theſe beginnings ariſeth the miſchiefe, wherein are two things, the abhominable Army of darkeneſſe poiſoning all: and the head of ſo damnable a band, the Army is deſcribed, firſt ſummarily by their quality, and their annoying power, verſe 3. Hereafter more at large, this their annoying power is exponed, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, whereby they are inabled to the harmeful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, are declared. In all which is a moſt liuely repreſentation, and moſt conuenient type of the Romane Clergy, who are euidently this army of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoſe monſtrous ſwarmes nothing but helliſh
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2565:49"/>
ignorance brought in the Church: as earthlineſſe of great Paſtours, brought the ignorance. Their qualitie, firſt is ſhewed, in that they are Locuſts: both, for their ſwarming multitudes, and for their deſtroying and eating vp al green <note place="margin">Nahum. 3.</note> thing in earth: as, who not onely deuoure the beſt of things belonging to this life, but alſo deſtroy all ſpirituall life in men. For their grouth and ſucceſſe in both ſee the Story and be amazed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Their annoying power is ſummarily ſet foorth, in that <hi>they ſting as Scorpions.</hi> A venemous and bitter kind of Serpent, walking waiwardly, and ſtinging when it would appeare leaſt to doe ſo. This their power (in the larger expoſition thereof) hath this generall note, that it is limited and not abſolute. The firſt point of their limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, of ſuch as they are permitted to harme. The next is, in what degree they might doe it. As for the firſt, they are reſtrained wholly from hurting the ſealed ones, of whom Chapter 7. Which reſtraint, is heere pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie recorded, both to ſhew that this euill, is the height of that miſchiefe portended in the 7. Chapter. Againſt which the elect were ſealed: and alſo, to ſhew heere the truth of their preſeruation; and ſo, how it was, that Chriſt, in this totall eclipſe of light by Antichriſt his darkeneſſe, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued a Church. Wherein yet, be not ſo groſſe as to thinke that one number ſtill of the ſame perſons continued all that time. But it is to ſhew God his continuall courſe in helping his owne, all the time of this miſcheife on the world. Obſerue heere alſo, that by graſſe and trees, men are meaned, as I ſhewed Chapter 7. And, as fitlieſt thus <note place="margin">The alluſion is to Ioel 1. &amp; 2.</note> expreſſed, in the euill of locuſts. Now, of theſe, in the firſt trumpet, onely the third part was burnt: heere all feele this plague, except the ſealed ones. The ſecond point, in their limitation, is the degree of hurting. Wherein are two cauſions. Firſt, the quality of the harme permitted them to practiſe: and next, the time limited to their working. The quality of their harme is cleared by a diuers kind, from which they are reſtrained. For it is permitted them to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2565:50"/>
men but not to ſlay. This their tormenting, againe is cleared by a compariſon, that it is ſuch as ariſeth vpon the ſting of a Scorpion, that is ſo painefull, as death is more tollerable, as the effect thereof well ſheweth. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, that this torment and plague is on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, and, heere to be taken vp as God his iudgement on the world, whereof the true Church is free. And ſo, this army hath not power to ſlay: as neither, that way, plague they the men of the world, as doe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the ſixth trumpet; who, both ſting with poiſoning tailes, and ſlay with heads, as hauing power in both. But, theſe haue their power in their tailes, onely to torment with poiſonable ſting, and not to murther openly. For other waies, as they are conſidered in their dealing againſt the Saints (which is not in this place) their blood is found with them: yea and all the blood ſhed on the earth: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it not for direct profeſſed power and practiſe of the ſword: <note place="margin">Chap. 18. 74.</note> but, as on the Iewes came all the blood from that of <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous to the blood of <hi>Zachary:</hi> who, yet <note place="margin">Math. 23. 35.</note> profeſſed that it was not lawfull for them to put any man <note place="margin">Iohn 18. 31.</note> to death. This is heere put for an euident note of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his dealing: of purpoſe, to diſcerne this euill from that of the ſixth ttumpet: and that ſo eleerely, as it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how, men of learning and iudgement could confound things ſo notably diſtinguiſhed, and which can receiue no other accommodation. Now, that this their tormenting of men, is leſſe tollerable then death. We know, that no vexation is comparable to that of a conſcience, wherein is put the ſenſe of God his terror and eternall wrath, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the true remedy be not applied.

               <hi>his owne ſorrow which offereth to an other God.</hi> Hence aroſe, painefull pilgrimages, deuoting to ſacred wartes, Kings bequeathing their Crownes: husbands their wiues and children: wiues their children. Hence were ſo many erections, and fond donations for ſoule Maſſes: if ſo be after death they might finde that repoſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which they neuer felt in their life. Heerefore is this vexation fitly compared to the ſtinging of a Scorpion, moſt painefull of any. How many ſtrange policies and treacherous deuiſes (as of walking ſpirits, and forged mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles) theſe Locuſts haue practiſed, and ſtill doe, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due to themſelues the conſciences of men and hold them in torment, is more then manifeſt. And by ſuch as they haue ſtung deepely, it is that ordinarily they acchiue all their deſperate Treaſons and murthers of Princes: Acts, forſooth, of ſuch merit as will obtaine heauen to a perſon otherwaies condemned. And what is it; that vpon this preſumption, the tormented ſpirit will not runne to? what a ſtrange practiſe is that (amongſt many moe) of the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its with their nouices in their chamber of meditations?</p>

For cleering then, of an <note place="margin">The times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation.</note> obſcure matter; In this whole booke, are but ſeuen times recorded. That of tenne daies, Chapter 2. That of halfe an houre, Chap. 8. This of fiue moneths, heere. Thatof a yeere, moneth, day, and houre, in the ſixth Trumpet. That of fourty two moneths, Chapt. 11. and 13. with which, that of 1260. daies. Chapt. 11. and 12. And of a time, times, and halfe a time, Chap. 12. are all one. That of three daies and a halfe, Chap. 11. 9. And that of a 1000. yeeres, Chap. 20. Of theſe, all ſound interpreters, (for how maliciouſly the Romans, to obſcure cleere ſtory, doe expound them, ſhall appeare after) fall to one of two
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2565:51"/>
opinions. Some taking theſe times indefinitely. But, while they bring no reaſon, why ſuch and ſuch, are put of the holy Ghoſt for indefinite times, they rather cut the knot then loſe it. Others, and ſome of the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, take theſe times for definite, in exact calculation, but that they are not to bee taken in propriety of ſpeech, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the laſt: and that by a Propheticall frame of ſpeech, a day is to be taken for a yeere, and ſo by conſequence, a moneth for a moneth of yeres, and a yere for a yere of yeres. But in my iudgement, there is hereof, neither ground nor example in all Scripture. The 4. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> whereon all this opinion is builded, yeeldeth to it no ground at all. Where God commanding the Prophet, in a typicall action, to expreſſe the long rebellion of the people, being impoſſible to doe it ſo many yeres: that ſome analogy at leaſt, might bee, hee biddeth him lie ſo many daies: and therefore the interpretation is added, that a day was inioyned him for a yere. But that in any part of Scripture, calculation of time, either prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyforetold, or hiſtorically recorded, is thus expreſſed, I ſee it not. That place <hi>Nom.</hi> 14. 34. maketh leſſe for it; God ſhewing but the analogy of his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the peoples rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereon, if any thing of this ſort might be built, it ſhould rather ſeem that a yere were for a day then a day for a yere. Now, vpon this weake or rather no ground, to infer, that as a day in Scripture, is found put for a yere; ſo heere by conſequence, a moneth is put for a moneth of yeeres, and a yeere for a yeere of yeeres: without ſo much as a ſhew of example; for me, I thinke it too great licence in interpreting God his Oracles. As for theſe places in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where yeeres ſeeme to bee, by daies, calculated: they are of the moſt learned, taken in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and the accommodation of ſtory fitly giuen. which maketh me much maruell, that an exceeding lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, euen ſo, interpreting <hi>Daniel:</hi> yet in his notes vpon this place, for warrant of the other interpretation, ſhould ſay, <hi>apud Danielem paſſum.</hi> And for what reaſon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2565:51"/>
ſhall daies in <hi>Daniel</hi> be taken for yeeres in other places, more then Chap. 10. 13? that he counteth yeeres by the hebdomades, and onely Chap. 9. it ſtrengtheneth their opinion nothing. For, in the common vſe of Hebrew ſpeech, hebdomades, are no more properly of daies then of yeeres, but alike of both, as the count falleth, either for the ſabbath day or ſabbathicall yere, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the ſeuenth yeere, or great in the Iubily: and, as in the 9. Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the matter euidently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the account, to be of yeeres, ſo Chap. 10. 2. (where doubt might haue troubled the Reader, with an apparent ſtrange thing, if they had beene taken of yeres, as in the former Chap.) hee addeth the interpretation for a cleare diſtinction. If it had bene the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt, through all the reſt of this Propheſie, to ſet downe in theſe formes of ſpeech, the exact ſupputation of time: I ſee no reaſon why in the laſt, of a thouſand yeres (which only of them all, is to be taken definitely, and for great reaſon, as ſhall beſhewed) hee ſhould haue altered his ordinarie manner of ſtile. This wrong conception of theſe times, hath marred all the accommodation of this Propheſie: making euen notable learned men, and who otherwaies haue had deepe inſight in theſe myſteries, to iumble and confound diſtinct matters; while ſtill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this forelaid preiudice of definite calculation, they apply things, but giue no ſatisfaction: and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here handled, and the manner of leading, being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp, will ſhew cleerely, how by this preiudice, they haue laide, both before themſelues and others, great blockes, to impede a cleare way. This time, then here, of <hi>fiue moneths,</hi> is to be taken indefinitely, and put here, for a conſolation: to ſhew, that this terrible plague, ſhould not alwaies preuaile ouer the world. But beſides this, we muſt finde out ſome reaſon agreable to the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and wiſdome of the holy Ghoſt, why this time, in this place, and the other, in their places are taken of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, more then any other time. As for that of tenne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2565:52"/>
daies, Chapt. 2. it is eaſie, by common frame of Scripture ſpeech, both for time and number. The parents of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becha</hi> intreated her abode <hi>tenne daies: Iacob</hi> his wages were changed <hi>tenne times:</hi> Wiſdome ſtrengtheneth more then <hi>tenne Princes: Ruth</hi> to her mother in law, and <hi>Elkana,</hi> to his wife, were better then <hi>tenne ſonnes:</hi> tenne Virgins haue <hi>tenne lamps:</hi> and Chapt. 11. the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the great City falleth: <hi>tenne men</hi> take hold of the skirt of a <hi>Iew,</hi> and many ſuch. So as for this number, or of ſeuen, in matter or time, the ordinary vſe of Scrpture anſwereth. The reaſon of others is more difficulte, and moſt of all, that of this time here put: why it is (ſeeing this euill of the fifth trumpet, is all one with that beaſt which worketh 42. moneths, Chap. 13. All which time accordingly, the heathen trod vnder foot the holy City, and the Prophets propheſie in ſackecloth 1260. daies, Chap. 11. and the Church is ſo long, fed in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Chapt. 12.) that here, to the Locuſts ſhould bee attributed <hi>fiue moneths:</hi> a time, through all this booke, no where elſe recorded. And this is indeed wiſdome, for perceiuing whereof, we muſt vnderſtand, that as all the types, yea and frames of ſpeech in this Propheſie, are from the old Teſtament; the collation whereof, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to both great light: ſo theſe times heere, are put by alluſion to the like times there: not onely to ſhew, that theſe euils ſhould haue an end, as had the others: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by the ſame time attributed, to take vp the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of caſe, in things here propheſied, to thoſe, to which, the ſame time in the old Teſtament is giuen, for more cleare light in both. And to ſtirre vs to aduert this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the holy Ghoſt in vſing theſe times, not onely is the ſame time, but alſo the ſame ſpeeches put: to moue vs to the collation of things, and ſo, therein to finde, both great light, and delightfull ſatisfaction. Now then, albeit this time, as the others laſt mentioned, bee of the working of Antichriſt, yet the euill here, hath a farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſideration from the ſame euill, where the other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2565:52"/>
times are thereto attributed. Here it is deliuered to our conſideration as the plague of God vpon the whole world, from which the ſealed ones (the true Church) are free; as the other times are attributed to it, it is put, as the wreſtlings, ſufferings, and troubleſome ſtate of the true Church, vnder, and by this euil are to be conſidered. Therefore to the euill here ſuch a time is giuen, as may leade vs by the like time and like frames of ſpeech ioined therewith, to find out and conſider ſuch a like caſe in the old Teſtament, of a generall plague on the world, which yet the ſealed ones eſcape; that by comparing, wee may finde what a huge wiſdome here in two words is compriſed Now in all the ſtory of old, no ſuch caſe occurreth, but onely the deluge of <hi>Noah,</hi> in all things ſemblable to this. That was the onely generall plague wherewith euer at one time the whole world was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and this darkeneſſe of Antichriſt is a ſpirituall plague, ouergoing once all the Chriſtian world. In that onely they eſcaped whom God ſealed vp, and incloſed in the Arke (the type of his true Church) here none eſcape but the ſealed ones who are on Mount Sion with the Lambe, while all the earth follow the beaſt. That plague ouerwent the earth by opening the fountaines of the great depth, <hi>Abyſſi magnae, Tehom Rabbah,</hi> &amp; of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of heauen. This by fall of a ſtar from heauen, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bottomles pit, &amp; ſmoake bullering out therat, ouergoeth all. That by degrees grew, till at length, it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwent the higheſt mountaines <hi>fiue times three cubits:</hi> this by degrees roſe to ouerwhelme ſunne and aire. Theſe waters preuailed ouer the higheſt mountaines <hi>fiue times thirty dayes,</hi> that is <hi>fiue monethes:</hi> this euill growing by degrees to a height, ſhall haue a time of preuayling, and obtaining place ouer all. Theſe waters preuailed not ſtill, but after an hundred and fifty dayes, that is, <hi>fiue monethes,</hi> they beganne peece and peece to decreaſe, til at length the earth was dried, the Arke opened, and the cloſed and ſealed vp ones came forth, and repleniſhed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2565:53"/>
the earth. This euill after a time of preuailing ouer all, ſhall abate, and by the light of the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and wind of God his mouth by degrees bee conſumed, as by degrees it did grow, and the true Church ſhall breake forth, the Tabernacle of Teſtimony ſhall bee opened in heauen, and theſe 144000. hid ones ſhall become a number innumerable with palmes in hands. And as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the mother of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reproch of barrennes, hid her ſelfe <hi>fiue Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,</hi> thereafter to appeare with big bellie: ſo in this preuailing euill of Locuſts, and their King <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 24.</note> the true Church as barren ſhall lurke <hi>fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes</hi> (that is, for a time) to breake forth thereafter big with child. Of theſe, who ſhould bee preachers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from Antichriſtian workes, and forerunners of the Lord his laſt comming, as <hi>Iohn</hi> was of the firſt. Finally, as the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> was ſuch an euill, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Gen 9 11.

And for this it is, that agreeably thereto, the great Angell comming to his ouerthrow in the next Chapter hath the <hi>Rainebow</hi> about his head. Now weigh what plenty of light and depth of wiſdom lye hid in theſe two words, of <hi>fiue monethes,</hi> which the ſpirit repeateth twice, of purpoſe to waken our negligence, to take it vp.

            <p n="6">6 This was the generall note of their limitation.

Hereto they are ſtrengthned by vſurped ſpirituall authority, expreſſed in Crownes, which are neither vpright in forme nor matter. With this is ioyned hypocriſie; for they look like men, who meaſure their affaires by iudgement, as

full of reaſon and humanity. For ſimulate modeſty and ſimplicity, and for force of alluring inticements, they haue haire like women, with faire and flattering ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, deceiuing the hearts of the ſimple, and prouoking to ſpirituall fornication.

            <p n="9">9 In this ſixt Trumpet then are the euill, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. In the euill, are noted how it is brought on, and the particular deſcription of the miſchiefe. It is brought on by commandement from Chriſt, who is the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to the Angell of the ſixt Trumpet; the tenor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to looſe the Miniſters of this woe, for working of it. The reaſon hereof we touched. The Miniſters of the woe, are the heades, and the deſtroying armie. In the heades are noted their number, condition, place, and end of looſing. In number they are foure, as a number competent, yet not for that reſpect which is of the foure, Chapter 7. (for the foure corners of the earth) for this plague goeth not ſo wide, being but againſt the third part of men (a cleare diſtinguiſhing note of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme from Antichriſt) but here, they are foure, for all occaſions, as the other were for all places: and therfore foure times are put (an howre, a day, a moneth, a yeere) not to deſigne the ſpace of this woes durance, but to ſhew that theſe were ordained, and in number compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenr, to execute God his wrath at all occaſions, ſhort, or long, as God ſhould bee ſtirred to indignation, and ſend them forth. Agreeable hereto the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commeth from the foure hornes of the Altar, to ſhew Chriſt his ſufficiencie of power, to raiſe vp inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his iuſtice according as by the ſinnes of men he is prouoked. For, from this Altar both the prayers of Saints, goe vp before God, and the fire of vengeance is powred downe on the world, Chapter 8. this maketh the alluſion, and conueniency in number of foure Angels, foure hornes, foure times.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The condition of theſe heades is, that they are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2565:55"/>
bound, whereupon is the commandement of looſing; this ſheweth the ſeuerity of theſe foure Angels of wrath, in that they are bound vp as ragefull beaſts, and giueth certaine expectation of cruell effects, they being loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. God his patience is here alſo noted, reſtraining his iudgements, till the wickedneſſe of men extort them from him. Theſe foure Angels are the heades of the Mahometane and Turkiſh Armies. Not for ſo many heades in proprietie, as many vainely vexe themſelues to finde out, but for the reaſon aboue touched; who how they were tied vp at <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that is, reſtrained in the Eaſt parts about <hi>Babell</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> partly by their owne inteſtine diſcords &amp; wars, partly by ſome great victories of Chriſtians, from working this horrible deſolation which now vpon this their looſing enſueth, is cleare in the ſtory. <hi>Mahomet</hi> aroſe ſoone after the open and auowed beginnings of Antichriſt, and ſpred his poyſon, aduancing it ſo with fire and ſword, that in ſhort yeers his Succeſſors ouerranne all <hi>Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> This ſwift courſe was after tied vp; (as the commandement of looſing them from their binding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implyeth, ſhewing that both before this they were, and from raging tied vp) for a good ſpace, till at length Turkes ioyned with Saracens, and becomming one people, and of one poiſonous religion, vpon huge encreaſe of Antichriſtian impiety, they gotte free ſcope from <hi>Euphrates</hi> in God his iuſtice, to ſlay the third part of men, from which kind of working the Locuſts were reſtrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="11">11 Thus are the heades, their army is deſcribed from their number, kind, diſpoſition, horrible effects, and power of working, their number is huge, to ſhew their innumerable forces, wherein the Story is cleare. Their kind is that they are horſemen: both becauſe their chiefe forces conſiſt of ſuch, as alſo to ſhew their fiercenes and irreſiſtable inuaſion. Their cruell diſpoſition is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2565:55"/>
in that their habergeons were of fire, brimſtone, &amp; Iacinth. For when the Scripture deſcribeth horrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions, it is ordinarily by fire and brimſtome, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending ſmoake, as in the Pſalmes and Prophets often. Now brimſtone inflamed, yeeldeth both a flame and a ſmoake of a Iacinth colour, and accordingly they are here put, to ſhew in theſe a bloudy diſpoſition to worke vtter deſolation, like that of <hi>Sodome.</hi> For this, their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alſo are ſaid to haue heads of Lions, to deſigne open rage and profeſſed cruelty, whereas the Locuſts coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Lions teeth with faces of men, and haire of women. Fire, ſmoake and brimſtone are ſaid to come out of their mouths, not onely to amplifie this their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell diſpoſition, as breathing nothing but vtter deſolation; but alſo to ſhew their facility of deſtroying all thinges, as with a breath or word. The third part of men are ſaid to be deſtroyed by them, to ſhew according to the Phraſe aboue in the firſt foure Trumpets, that this plague ſhould not ouergoe al, as did that of the Locuſts, but yet ſhould worke a horrible and great vaſtation, conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their cruell diſpoſition, ſet forth in three things, &amp; this effect is moſt euident: for neuer any conquering people before them wrought ſuch deſolation as they in the parts which they haue ouerrunne; ſo as in the moſt plentifull and beſt peopled parts of the earth, they haue ſcarſe left ſo many villages, as were ſometime famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publikes. Theſe are their effects.

This is the weapon of his victory. It is little, in compariſon to Antichriſt his great booke of humane Traditions, vnwritten Verities, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphe Scriptures, Decretals, Canons, and manifold Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, all ioined and equalled by them in their practiſe, at leſt, with this booke. It is open for that cleere vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of holy Scripture which now Chriſt ſhould bring: whereas, in Antichriſt his darkeneſſe, the ſame was buried in ignorance, which, with them is the mother of deuotion, it being held capitall for common laicke men

to read Scripture in vulgar tongue.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The actions of this great perſonnage, thus furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, are in his geſture and in his voice. His geſture is, that he ſet his right foot on the Sea, and his left foot on the Land: as he who hath power ouer all creatures. Who ſtabliſheth the mountaines by his power, and appeaſeth the noiſe of the Seas, the noiſe of the waues thereof, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 89: 9.</note> the tumults of people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. His right foot is ſet on the Sea, as whoſe rage is moſt terrible, and the left, on the earth, to ſhew that he is ſufficiently furniſhed with all ſtrength, and accordingly vttereth it, as for the party op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner is requiſit. In the 13. Chapter, to expreſſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his eſtate, two beaſts arriſe, the one out of the Sea, the other, out of the Earth. Theſe he commeth to vndoe, and conueniently therefore ſetteth his feet in this manner. So is his geſture. His voice, is a loud cry. Wherein, as the little booke is the weapon of his warfare, ſo the vſe and welding of it, is heere expreſſed; to wit, Preaching. Whereof to ſhew the boldneſſe, his voice is compared to the reoaring of a Lion. And to expreſſe the power, and that, perfect, accompanying the bold Preaching of the Goſpell now reſtored, ſeuen thunders are ſaid to ſpeake. As at the going out of the Goſpel in the firſt ſeale, the firſt beaſt hauing the face of a Lion, <hi>Spake like thunder:</hi> So, now at reuiuing of the Goſpel to Antichriſt his ouerthrow, it ſhall be accompanied with boldneſſe and perfection of of power. <hi>The great Angell comming downe to fight for Sion and the hill thereof, Iſai</hi> 31 4. Now, conſider that Chriſt is heere deſcribed according to his vertue working in his ſeruants: whoſe voice, if it be his, is bold and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, If their voice be, as it ought, the eccho of his cry, it will be like thunder. For thunders ſpeake as he roareth <note place="margin">Amos 3. 8.</note> and except he roare, no thunder vttereth any voice. His ſheepe know his voice and not the voice of a ſtranger. All <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 4. 5.</note> this is, to ſhew, that the miniſtery of the Goſpell, through the power of Chriſt accompanying it, ſhal conſume Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to powder. That notable things were vttered by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2565:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe Thunders, <hi>Iohn</hi> his readineſſe to write, argueth cleerely. From which hee is ſtaied by commandement, not to write, but to ſeale and cloſe vp what they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Wee muſt be ſober, and contented with what it pleaſeth God to open, as not able at all times to receiue al things. I doubt not, but now in cleere manifeſtation of Antichriſt, theſe thunders haue beene, and are ſtill thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that openly, which heere for the time was ſealed vp. But, for this time their ſpeeches haue beene, as I thinke, ſo plaine, as Chriſt thought not meete to put in regiſter. For theſe myſteries are (as it becommeth) ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, that the wiſe, in time, ſhall vnderſtand them, but the wicked ſhall do wickedly. To them things are ſpoken <note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> by parables, that, hearing they may heare, and not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and, ſeeing they may ſee, and not perceiue. That <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 10.</note> theſe ſpeeches were vttered, and yet cloſed vp, was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for <hi>Iohn</hi> his particular information and ſtrengthning. As to ſuch effect, God in reuelations, ſheweth to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of high imploiment, ſometimes, more then in either, <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 9. 2. Cor. 12.</note> lawfull or poſſible to vtter. And truly, I am of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that none can be an able miniſter of the Goſpell, who, for his owne both light and feeling, hath not more then he can publiſh. It is partly alſo, for all readers and hearers of this Propheſie, to exſpect and aduert, in their time theſe thundering ſpeeches: as to the praiſe of God, we now doe cleerely. For, that heere Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſeale them vp, and that, heereafter in this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie (which is but one continuall trance) they are vttered, I neither ſee any reaſon of it, nor any place yeelding any probability that ſo it is.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Thus is the great perſonage inſtructed with his weapon, the word, vnderſtood and preached in all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power. The end of his comming thus inſtructed, is to <hi>Finiſh the myſtery of God,</hi> and that without longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay <note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note> or protraction of time: So, as vpon the ſound of the ſeuenth trumpet, and in the daies thereof, all ſhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, whatſoeuer the Prophets had foretold either
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2565:58"/>
of the deſtruction of the enemies or the Church, or of God his plentifull mercy and grace, in her deliuerance, and her goodly, gracefull, and peaceable condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. For this is the miſtery of God, which in the daies of the ſeuenth Trumpet ſhall bee fulfilled. Which trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet as it hath begunne to blow long agoe, and (praiſed be our God) we ſee the effect of it in good degrees aduanced: ſo how long it ſhall blow, God onely knoweth. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies is certaine, that Antichriſt his deſtruction, already begunne, ſhall hold on to euerlaſting woe; neither ſhall he recouer ſtrength. As alſo the increaſe of light and grace towards the Church, ſhall continue, till Antichriſt being ouerthrowne, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ning to the faith: ſhe inioie a gracefull and peaceable ſtate heere, as a Bride prepared for her husband. This to be the minde of the Holy Ghoſt, the whole courſe of this propheſie ſheweth euidently. And the many goodly promiſes of the Prophets gathered together in the Church her deſcription, Chap. 21. and 22. proue cleerely that therein is the myſtery of God ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled according as hee foretold, <hi>By his ſeruants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Now, the things in this Chapter, and to the 15. verſe of the next, hauing ſuch congruity of argument with that of the ſeuenth Trumpet and laſt woe (as whereof, they are not onely the preparation, but euen ſuch great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings) yet notwithſtanding, they are deliuered vnder the ſixth trumpet, and ſecond great woe. Becauſe, albeit it be true that theſe Trumpets no more then the ſeales or Viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be put for knots and periods of time exactly cutted, but for diſtinguiſhing diuers matters: yet thus farre in them, time muſt be looked to, that they fall out in courſe after other, as they are heere ordered by the ſpirit. For, though the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of the ſixth Trumpet was euer in time of the fifth: and the euils of both fifth and ſixth Trumpets hold on in ſome degree in the beginning, yea a good ſpace of the ſeuenth,: yet the world, felt firſt, the fifth Trumpet, and woe thereof; whereupon, the ſixth Trumpet and ſecond great woe, inſuing, albeit the firſt woe ceaſed not, yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2565:59"/>
when the world felt moſt the ſecond, as in the height of it, beeing then the moſt ſenſible plague, all euils and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments whatſoeuer of whatſoeuer kinde, are ioyned with the greateſt woe in the time. And thus is it, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe beginnings of Antichriſt his fall heere, and to the 15. verſe of the next Chapt. agree, in argument with the matter of the ſeuenth trumpet: yet, becauſe theſe beginnings &amp; firſt degrees fell out in the greateſt height of the ſecond woe, and were yet of no ſuch weight or meaſure as the worldly ſort and Antichriſt, feeling a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier woe vpon them, did ſo much regard: therefore they are put vnder the ſecond woe and ſixth trumpet. But when theſe ſmall beginnings grow on ſo farre as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and the worldly ſort following him, become firſt afraid, Chapt. 11. 11. and vpon the ſeene danger of his kingdome already begunne to fall, then falleth to count light of the other woe in reſpect of this: then is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth trumpet ſaide to blow and the ſecond woe to bee paſt, the third now comming in place. And this order of deliuery, which the ſpirit vſeth, as it is exceeding arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious and pleaſant, ſo being well aduerted, it bringeth great light and ſatisfaction. Now, becauſe this end, of this great Angel his deſcending, ſeemeth incredible, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his kingdome being ſo ſtrongly ſetled, as the ouerthrow thereof appeared impoſſible: the great Whore preſuming thereupon, to ſit <hi>ſtill as a Queene, and</hi>

            <p n="5">5 As we haue heard the end of this great Angel his deſcent, ſo is ſhewed how this end is effectuate. And this is, by fitting and preparing fit inſtruments thereto: who are ſtirred vp by diuine inſtigation, to take the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke from him only in whoſe hand it is open, to eat it vp, <hi>receiuing in their hearts all God his words, &amp;c.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2565:59"/>
ſweetneſſe and delight in the mouth, and of bitterneſſe in the belly; that ſo they may be meete for that effect ſet downe in the laſt verſe, where is the interpretation of all this ſigne. Shewing in <hi>Iohn,</hi> (who here, is the type of theſe whom Chriſt ſhall thus, and to this end, ſtirre vp) that, for raiſing againe the true light of the Goſpell, and by the powerfull and wide preaching thereof, gathering of his Church and defeating darkeneſſe: hee will raiſe firſt in mens harts a loue of knowledge, and of the booke of God, who thereupon, by his motion ſhall ſtudy the ſame moſt diligently, as eating it with appetite: and ſhall finde in ſtudying it, exceeding ſweetneſſe and ſpirituall ioy to their ſoules: and letting it as it were downe in their ſtomachs, and filling their bellies with it, they ſhall bee ſo filled, as not able to containe it, they muſt burſt foorth; though the preaching thereof beget them of the world great trouble, and many teares. For all this frame of ſpeech, ſee <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2. and 3. and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 15. and 20. and withall, obſerue herein the diſtinct degrees of a true inward calling, whereof none can be lacking in the true miniſter of Chriſt. Firſt, a loue of God and of the knowledge of his word, begotten in the heart by diuine motion. 2 A heart to pray for light. 3 A diligent and carefull ſtudy of Scripture. 4 A ſweet delight and taſte found therein of ſpirituall ioy to their owne ſoules. Now all theſe any good Chriſtian may haue: but, to make a Paſtor, thou muſt alſo find the laſt, that is, bitterneſſe of belly. The accommodation of this is ſo cleare in ſtory, of theſe, whom God thus firſt ſtirred vppe to the loue of learning, and by whom the true light both of diuine and humane ſciences was reſtored, ſo as Antichriſt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and noted for the <hi>man of ſinne;</hi> that it needeth not here to be inlarged.

So great light commeth by the little booke eaten, and rod applied. The firſt of the three conditions was, of the Church before this time of application of the rod, but the meaſuring and finding it out, is of this time. The other two conditions, come now, vpon this applying of the rod, by ſuch as through eating the little booke were inabled thereto: which Antichriſt perceiuing, they are killed and lie dead, &amp;c. And as, for courſe of time and ſtory, this Chapter is orderly put, ſo alſo exceeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently for order of matter. For where, by the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of propheſie, in the laſt Chapt. it might bee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that no true Church could bee before, ſeeing, that where no propheſie is, the people periſh; and this doubt, might greatly trouble the reſolution of a godly ſoule: for clearing this doubt, and ſhewing how alwaies, euen in the midſt of Antichriſtian darkeneſſe, when no ſuch thing appeared to the eies of men, yet the rodde rightly applyed, made the applyers to ſee, that God alwaies had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2565:61"/>
a true Church, in which was a diſpenſation of grace, though vnſeene. And this Church breaking out, firſt in few, and outwardly weake perſons, albeit it receiued ſo hard entertainement by Antichriſt, as it ſeemed euen vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguiſhed in the riſing; yet ſtill it preuailed by euident degrees, till manifeſtly at laſt the Temple was <hi>opened in heauen, and the Arke of the Teſtimony ſeene.</hi> The accommodation hereof ſheweth it ſelf: and the two laſt caſes are ſo much the more cleare, as they were <hi>ſeen,</hi> and are of recent memory. To cleare the firſt ſtate and ſecret diſpenſation of grace, and light when it appeared impoſſible, a ſpeech is taken from <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and hauing alluſion to the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as hath all this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory. <note place="margin">Zach. 4.</note> For as light in the Temple by burning lampes of the Candleſticke, was ordinarily entertained through bringing in oyle, dayly to keepe them burning; ſo the Temple being cloſed, and not onely the City, but euen the Court of the Temple (except through which no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was thereto) being poſſeſſed and trod downe ſo long of the Gentiles; it might appeare impoſſible that any light could hee preſerued in the Temple; thus clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and compaſſed.

The time then attributed to Antichriſt his whole rage, is forty two monethes, all one with the 1260. dayes of the two Witneſſes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying (to ſhew that all that time God had them, and continually, therefore is the time counted by dayes) and all one with the <hi>time, times, and halfe a time</hi> of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her abode in the wilderneſſe, Chapter 12; all alike making vp halfe a weeke of yeeres, or three yeeres and a halfe.

And this in ſtory is moſt cleare. For as their cruell and open murthering beganne with the reuiuing and new breaking out of the Goſpell, what time Sathan was looſed the ſecond time, Chapter 20. And the beaſt became of his colour, Chapter 17. So, as the truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth by increaſe of light, they are faine to relent though nothing in malice and rage, (which groweth more and more, they euen blaſpheming and gnawing their tongues for ſorrow) yet from vnbrideled libertie, in murthering the Saints in this degree. To the laſt condition is attributed no circumſcription of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the beginning of that victory to the Saints, &amp; fall to <hi>Babell,</hi> which ſhall haue no end of time.

Chapters) but onely ſo farre as was requiſite for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtory of the witneſſes, how the world is plagued

by them: which is here the ſcope of the ſpirit, See vpon Chap. 14 Sect. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Thus was the ſixth Trumpet, and the ſecond great woe, followeth the ſeuenth: to which we ſee how faire a way is made in the ſixth; to make vs vnderſtand, that euen in time of the ſecond woe, and greateſt height thereof by the Mahometanes let looſe againe from their binding; this laſt woe was working in ſuch degrees as haue beene ſhewed; as in like manner in the ſixth ſeale was giuen a view of the miſchiefe of the Trumpets, to learne vs, that euen then, before the ouerthrow, and ſhaking of the Empire, the myſtery of iniquity was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.

Now maruaile not that, here that which is to the Saints, chiefe ioy, is a woe to the World: for our victory is the worldes ruine.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Vpon the blowing of the ſeuenth Trumpet, the effect thereof is, in the reſt of this Chapter, ſummarily denounced, by a gratulatory ſong of praiſe of the Church to God for the ioyfull effect to them, though wofull to the world, which now they preconceiue is to enſue. And this effect ſummarily here denounced, is through the reſt of all the Propheticall narration expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at large. The ſumme and matter of their fong, which ſtirreth them to thankſgiuing is in this, that God now raigneth. And this raigne is cleared by two great effects, the one is the deſtruction of all enemies, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a ſequell hereof, the good eſtate of God his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the time of whoſe reward now is come. The Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God in the deſtruction is ſhewed, in that theſe enemies were angrie, and had in their fury deſtroyed the earth, and murthered the Saints: ſo as now God had iuſt reaſon to be angry in his courſe, and to iudge and reuenge his dead fully on the world, by proſecuting
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2565:63"/>
ſtill his, now begunne wrath and iudgements againſt the aduerſaries, till they be cloſed vp in euerlaſting torment: and redreſſing the eſtate of his Church in continuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance and encreaſe of grace, till as a Bride fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, ſhee be receiued to glorie; all being here perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med now in the dayes of this Trumpet whatſoeuer by the Prophets was foretold, either of the Church her perfection in grace and peaceable ſtate, or of the enemies deſtruction. And this is that finiſhing of the myſterie ſworne, Chapter 10. this is that vengeance promiſed to the ſlaine ſoules, in the 5. Seale, but which they were to attend till the reſt of Saints were ſlaine: and this the Gentiles in their anger hauing performed (hauing trod downe the holy City, euen that beaſt that worketh forty two monethes, making warre with the Saints, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming them, Chapter 13.) Now the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in great indignation to repay the world their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. This double euent thus denounced, is by figne alſo forſhewed, to ſignifie the riſing of the Church in great light and deepe ſight of the moſt hid myſteries, the Tabernacle is open in heauen, and the Arke (which ſtood in the moſt holy place) is openly ſeene. Here is a great degree of knowledge. In the end of the ſixt Trumpet, was a great meaſure, euen that firſt viſible ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from <hi>Babel,</hi> and her earthly ones, when to the witneſſes it was ſaid, <hi>Come vp hither:</hi> but her cleareneſſe of light is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced greatly, and the truth hereof is euident All praiſe to him who hath taken his Kingdome; for ſince the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Trumpet began to blow, the Antichriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thinketh light of the ſixt Trumpet, and now this is their heauieſt woe, as wil appeare in the effects of the Vials; but it is our ſong. The ſigne of the other effect, in the deſtruction of the enemies, and God his horrible iudgements to that end, are thunderings, lightnings voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, earthquake, and much haile See vpon Chapter 4.

Now hence through this Booke (to the generall concluſion of al) that is largely and particularly exponed: in the ſtory of two <hi>great wonders or ſignes in Heauen.</hi> The firſt in the 12. 13. and 14. Chapters: the other thence to the end. The firſt ſigne or wonder hath the ſtory of the enemies, and condition of God his Church oppreſſed by them, &amp; in ſome degrees comming out vnder that bondage. The ſecond hath the ſtory of full victory, in the perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the aduerſaries, and the Church her goodly and gracefull ſtate thereupon. The firſt in the 12. 13 and 14. Chapters, is of one time with that ſtory, which in the fixe ſeales and ſixe trumpets of the ſeuenth hath beene ſhewed: but yet is not the ſame. And where it would appeare to haue but one and the ſame matter; yet the purpoſe and reſpect of handling is much different, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſee more vpon Chapter 14. Sect. 10. And here this Narration commeth exceeding fitly, both for time and matter. For time, becauſe, albeit it be of things fallen out before the ſeuenth Trumpet, yet ſo cleare a ſight of them was not got, till vpon the blaſt of it the Tabernacle of teſtimony opened in heauen, afforded to God his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a more plaine ſight of the enemies, their courſe &amp; ſucceſſe of working. For matter, becauſe, that vpon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2565:64"/>
the ſouuding of the ſeuenth Trumpet, ſo great a ioy of the Church vttered in ſuch a ſong, vpon preception of ſo great a deliuerance to her ſelfe, and deſtruction of her enemies, requireth for cleare vnderſtanding thereof, and how great the worke is, that theſe enemies be knowne, and their dealings: and to endeare the more to the Church her owne; deliuerance, that her troubles and wreſtlings with theſe enemies bee alſo ſeene: that ſo, both the equity of the former iudgements, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this laſt and finall wrath to come on them, may bee cleare. Till now the Story hath beene of wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, from which the ſealed ones were free, the Church her ſufferings nothing, or but ſparingly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Story of the Witneſſes, Chapter 11. being deliuered but as they were a Woe vpon the world; but now in theſe three ſubſequent Chapters, the Story of the Church her ſufferings, and of the parties by whom, (vpon whome, and for which came all the former woes, and now finall wrath is denounced) is moſt pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both for time and matter inſerted. The not aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt hath bredde to many in reading this Booke great obſcurity, while they tooke not vppe the ſweet and plaine way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo ledde, as falling in againe, in the end of the ſoureteenth Chapter, to the point where it left in the end of the eleuenth, (for inſerting of this neceſſary Story) the ſummary execution is, their preponed of that which in the end of the eleuenth Chapter, was ſummarily denounced. And ſo in the ſecond <hi>great Wonder</hi> or <hi>Signe ſeene in Heauen,</hi> throughout the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, ſixeteene, ſeuenteene, eighteene, nineteene and twenty Chapters, this effect of the ſeuenth Trumpet, as touching the deſtruction of enemies, and Church her victory is largely exponed, and in the twenty one, and twenty two, as touching her gracefull and peaceable ſtate thereupon.</p>

2 The firſt wonder or ſigne is double, according as therein the enemies inuaders, and partie aſſailed, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. The party aſſailed is the woman and her ſeed, firſt and laſt. The aſſailing enemy, is the Dragon, by himſelfe openly, and by his Lieutenant, the beaſt of his power, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly. Againſt the woman and her firſt ſeede, is ſet the Dragon, directly in this Chapter. Againſt her in her other ſeed, the beaſt of his power, throne and authority, in the next Chapter. This is that warre proclaimed in Paradiſe. <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> In this Chapter are; firſt, the deſcription of the parties by their habit, and diſpoſition to doe. Secondly, the euent; which maketh way to the next enemy in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The party aſſailed, is the woman, in habit clothed with the Sunne, treading the Moone, crowned with twelue Starres. In diſpoſition of preſent endeuour, big with child, trauelling, pained, and crying through paine. The aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling party, for habit, is a great redde Dragon, hauing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heads crowned, tenne hornes, and a taile. His endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to doe, is, he caſteth ſtars from heauen with his taile, and ſtandeth before the woman to deuoure her child with his heads.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The euent hereof is (according to the ordinary forme of Scripture) firſt Summarilie proponed in the 5. and 6. verſes. And next, thenceforth more largely cleered. And this euent is double. The childe is borne and exalted: and the woman flieth. In the ſummarie propoſition of this double euent, the childe his quality, dignity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation to high eſtate is proponed: and the womans flght, by the place, whither; her condition in it, and time of this her condition, is deſcribed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Hauing, thus ſummarily in the 5. and 6. verſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned this double euent: he ſheweth after, how it fell out, and by what meanes. And firſt how it came, that the childe ſo narrowly watched, and by ſo ſtrong an enemie, yet, not onely eſcapeth, but is exalted to great honour. This, of the childe commeth by a great battell in heauen.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2565:65"/>
wherein are the Captaines of either ſide, their Armies, and the euent of the conflict. The Generall Captaine of the one ſide is <hi>Michael:</hi> his Armie, are his Angels. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and Army oppoſite, are, the Dragon and his Angels. The euent of their conflict, is, the Dragon is foild, and the degree of the foile is, that he and his Angels are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, as they haue no more place in heauen. This is cleared by two contrary effects. The one, in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Citizens of ioy: the other, in the Dragon of rage. The ioy of the heauenly Citizens is ſet foorth in their ſong of victory: which victorie, is amplified by the greatneſſe, cruelty, ſubtiltie, maliciouſneſſe, enmity, and peruerſe diligence of the Dragon, who is ouercome: by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the victorie, for the price of it: by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conſtant ſuffering to attaine it, which endeareth it the more: and laſtly, by the miſerable condition of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſort through this his foile. Thus, is declared how the child eſcaped, and was exalted. Next is ſhewed, how the ſecond part of the generall euent, that is, the womans flight, did come. The Dragon his rage for his foile, and miſgiuing endeauour againſt the Childe, ſtirreth him to peiſecute the woman. Thereupon ſhee flieth, being heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereto by the meanes giuen her of two winges, <hi>Of that great Eagle.</hi> And her flight, heere, as before in the ſummarie propoſition, is cleered by the place of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, her condition there, and the time thereof. This rage of the Dragon againſt the woman, hath two degrees. The firſt is, hee perſecuteth her, wherethrough ſhee is brought to flie, by the meanes giuen her of the winges. The ſecond degree is, his endeuour, for her ouerthrow in her flight: the floud caſt out againſt her. This double rage is eluded; the firſt, by the wings; the ſecond, by the helpe of the earth, which ſwalloweth the flood. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall euent of all this miſgiuing endeauour againſt childe and woman, worketh in the Dragon increaſe of rage, whereby he is ſtirred to make warre againſt the reſt of her Seede. Againſt theſe (hauing miſgiuen in his open dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2565:66"/>
againſt her firſt ſeede) he ſtirreth vp that beaſt, whoſe riſing and working to behold, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtandeth on the Sea ſhoare.</p>

here, the firſt great enemie and ſufferings of the Chriſtian Church, in her infancy are ſet forth.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The woman, is the Primitiue Apoſtolike Church, glorious in the cleare light of the ſunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whom ſhe put on for her wiſdome and iuſtification. Treading all borrowed, ſpotted, changeable, tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and light things vnder foot: glorying onely in the <note place="margin">Chap. 21 14.</note> light miniſtred by the twelue Apoſtles, which is her crowne. Shee is big with childe of all peoples, whom ſhe was begetting to God, through obedience of faith in Chriſt. For her great troubles and ſufferings, ſhe is ſaid to <note place="margin">Gal. 5.

The ſpeech is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophets, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ordinarily in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now, againſt this woman, according to the old warre proclaimed in Paradiſe, is ſet in apparance, a very vnequall match, but that <hi>Michael</hi> fighteth the battell. This aduerſary, is Satan. (for ſo the ſpirit interpreteth verſe 9.) Hee is a great Dragon, for great malice, force, and ſubtilty. He is red, for his cruell and bloudy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: as who was a murtherer from the beginning <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> Hee hath ſeuen heades and tenne hornes (the armes of <hi>Rome)</hi> becauſe of this the Diuell his fury, againſt the <note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> Primitiue Church, the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and executors. And therefore, to ſhew <hi>Rome</hi> in that ſtate of perſecuting Emperours, the heades are crowned, for an euident diſtinction of <hi>Rome</hi> then, from <hi>Rome</hi> thereafter in the beaſt. The heads and hornes are put in both, that we may know what ſtate the ſpirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth: but by the different note of theſe heades and hornes. To take vp the different time, and condition in time. Againſt the Primitiue Church, the Diuell, albeit working by <hi>Rome,</hi> is made the direct enemie, becauſe then, Chriſtianity was directly oppugned, and open rage practiſed againſt the name of Chriſt: Heatheniſme, and worſhip of Diuels, plainely maintained. From which open dealing and licentious murthering, Satan being ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2565:67"/>
vp afterwards by power of the Goſpell: hee dealt more couertly by the beaſt of his authority, vnder name and profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and pretence of Chriſt his power, deceiuing men of the world: till, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand yeeres, the reuiued light of the Goſpell breaking out a freſh, and diſcouering the deceit of the beaſt, hee is ſo chafed, as hee falleth to murthering of Saints. In which reſpect the Dragon is ſaid to be looſed <note place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> the ſecond time, Chap 20. and thereby the beaſt falling to open murther, becommeth of his colour, Chapter 17. Of theſe heades and hornes, ſee vpon the 13. and 17. Chapters.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This Dragon then, imployeth head and taile, that is, cruelty and lies: for, hee was a lier and murtherer from the beginning. By his taile, that is, by his allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring deceit, whether effectuall error, or deceitfulneſſe of honours, riches, and worldly luſts, hee inſinuateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe amongſt theſe, who ſeeme ſhining ſtarres of heauen, and draweth them to fall from light and grace, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come earthly: ſuch as goe out of the Church (that is heauen) but were not of it. Marke alwaies, that Satan his firſt attempt againſt the Church, is with his taile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſtarres. Thus he ſtirreth his taile. With his heads, that is, his power and force, hee ſetteth himſelfe, firſt, againſt the childe, to deuoure him in the bearing. Whereby, the fury and rage of Satan, by the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, to keepe the Church of Chriſt from riſing, is ſignified: notwithſtanding whoſe malice and cruelty, the <note place="margin">Iſai. 66. 7.</note> childe, and <hi>a man childe</hi> (alluding to the ſtory of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and alſo, for that, as Chriſt was in perſon, and as the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, and other expiatory ſacrifices of the flocke; ſo all Chriſtians, in Chriſt Ieſus are conſecrated as males, for perfection of ſtrength and ſpirituall vigor) is borne, that is, the Church is brought foorth to the partaking of the honour, firſt proper to Chriſt, and in him to all his <note place="margin">Pſalm. 149. 9.</note> members. <hi>To rule all Nations with a rod of iron,</hi> Chapt. 2. 27. And not onely thus brought foorth, but, in eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2565:67"/>
preſence and power of God ruling in and amongſt them, eſtabliſhed here in earth againſt all Satan his fury, and viſibly ſeparated to God, from the reſt of the world; becomming Kings and Prieſts to God, in Chriſt: ſo as, according to Chriſt his owne prediction, the ſonne of man was ſeene come in his Kingdome with power, by his Church raiſed in the world. The throne, as the iron rod, is firſt and properly Chriſt his right, but it is alſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Saints in him, to whom hee giueth a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he hath receiued one of the father: and to whom <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 22. Chap. 3. 21.</note> he giueth to ſit in his throne, as he ouercame and ſitteth in his fathers throne. For euen here, we ſit with him in the higheſt places. So the taking vp of the childe, is the erection of the Church amongſt men viſibly: in that ſame ſenſe that the two Witneſſes were bid <hi>come vp hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Chap. 11. And the caſting of the Dragon from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is all one thing with this. For the exalting of the childe, is the deiecting of the Dragon from heauen: and the deiection of the Dragon, is the vptaking of the child. Satan is ſaid to be in heauen, when, ſo by lies and error he hath preuailed in the viſible Church, as no apparant, or very ſmall face thereof is ſeene. Like as the Church, is in the earth <hi>(euen where Satan his throne is)</hi> when it is ſo compaſſed with error and ignorance, as it appeareth <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 13.</note> not, till it be ſaid, <hi>come vp hither:</hi> that is, till God, by purity of worſhip and open profeſſion thereof, make his true Church viſibly ſeparated from the contagion of the worldy ſort. And euen in this caſe, Satan is deiected from heauen, and ſent amongſt his owne earthly ones. He is ſaid to fight in heauen, when by ſlight and might, he laboreth to keepe downe ſo the true Church, as it can not bee diſcerned from his company: and is deiected thence, when truth openly in the Church is maintained, ſo as he can haue no place for dominion, but amongſt the <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 31.</note> children of diſobedience. For beeing caſt out of men, hee goeth madlings in the ſwine of the world, and ſhut out of God his houſe, he furiouſly miſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth his owne:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2565:68"/>
putting forth his rage where hee may, ſeeing hee cannot where hee would. <hi>Woe to the Inhabitants of the earth.</hi> This is it, which maketh, that where euer the Goſpell is purely preached, there immediately by Sathan are raiſed ſtirres and tempeſts. For, while hee brooketh all peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <note place="margin">Luke 11. 21.</note> hee is at eaſe: but when that ſtronger commeth, who ſpoileth his houſe, then hee chafeth and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth mad in his Inſtruments. This euent Chriſt in theſe ſame words foretelleth; ſo as we need not doubt of the right ſenſe. Now is the <hi>iudgement of this world, now ſhall</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="9">9 This victory is by <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in heauen, that is, by Chriſt who is <hi>Michael our Prince,</hi> and the Angels of the Churches, Apoſtles, and faithfull Paſtors fighting by the powerfull preaching of <note place="margin">Dan. 10. 21.</note> the Goſpell againſt Sathan &amp; his Miniſters of darkenes, heathen Philoſophers, heretikes and all ſuch: for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is a warfare againſt Principalities and powers, &amp; againſt beaſts, wherin we muſt all fight the good fight of faith; and ſtriue for that victory which ſtandeth in ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the elect from God in Chriſt, and in the foile of Sathan, and that by the bloud of the Lambe, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by true faith in the word of Ieſus his Teſtimony, with perſeuerance, and a ready offering of liues for his honour.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now Sathan ſo deiected in rage, that thus againſt all his endeauors, the Church riſeth, ſetteth himſelfe to cruelly perſecute the ſame. For except in diſtinct conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, the woman and child are all one: but that the holy Ghoſt will thus expreſſe, how Sathan firſt by craft and cruelty laboured to deſtroy the Church in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it ſhould not ſpread: whereof miſgiuing, and ſhee multiplying wonderfully, hee inforceth ſtill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ragefull perſecution, The firſt and ſecond both are more then cleare in the perſecuting Emperours, and

ſtate of the Church in that time. Now this ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour againſt the Church is eluded, and the woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from his fury, but yet ſo as ſhee goeth to <hi>the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> this is to ſhew, how by the protection &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and his Succeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming Chriſtians, and who according to the Phraſe of the Prophets, are called <hi>that great Eagle</hi> (as the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">Ezech. 17.

And ſo by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than his craft (who now is bound vp a thouſand yeers) the beaſt ſtealeth in and ſitteth in the Temple of God. The true Church in the meane time lurking in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, as <hi>Elias</hi> in the time of famine: and no more any face of true worſhippe appearing, then was in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell <note place="margin">Chap. 11.

And therefore wee haue an other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sathan his fury againſt the woman, after he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſo furniſhed with wings, as he (being now chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chapter 20.) could no more perſecute openly, or come at her. <hi>Hee caſteth a great floud out of his mouth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her to drowne her in her flight.</hi> This muſt bee a filthie floud which ſpringeth from ſo foule a fountaine. Hereby then is meaned not onely that inundation of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, which in Sathan his intention no doubt were ſet forth to drowne the woman: but alſo all theſe poiſonable hereſies, whereof vpon this reſtraint he ſpued out an Ocean: both which by God his prouidence turned to the deſtruction and puniſhment of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2565:69"/>
ſort. For the bloody Romane Empire was ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theſe Nations; and the wicked of the worlde poiſoned with theſe hereſies. Thus, then Sathan miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of all his attempts againſt the woman and her firſt ſeed, and finding ſo little ſucceſſe in open dealing, from which alſo hee is now bound vp: hee prepareth a beaſt of ſtrange working to deceiue the world, and to make warre againſt the ſeed of ſucceeding times. Whereof Chapter 13. So as the whole ſumme of this Chapter is this. Sathan (ſeeing the Primitiue Apoſtolike Church by the cleare light of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the Apoſtles, whereby all borrowed, ſpotted &amp; tranſitory light was trod vnder, like to bring Nations to the obedience of faith; and ſo, to bring forth a church in the world, as hee who had long miſcarried all men, was now by the light of the Goſpell to be deiected from his place) hee vſeth all both craft and violence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, and notwithſtanding it is ſo fruitfull through Chriſt his power, and endeauour of faithfull Miniſters, that <hi>the ſonne of man commeth in his Kingdome with power, and Sathan is dethroned.</hi> This maketh him in ragefull deſpite, not onely to raiſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble broiles in the world to the <hi>earthes great woe,</hi> but to enforce alſo cruell perſecution againſt the Church: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which ſhee is armed with <hi>that great Eagle his wings,</hi> ſo as Sathan is reſtrained from open rage. His next endeauour therefore againſt her, thus protected is by inundation of barbarous nations, and poiſonable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to drowne her: but this the Lord turneth on the world; yet ſo as the Church goeth to the wildernes and lurketh.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus was the open rage of the Dragon againſt the Woman, &amp; her firſt ſeed: now followeth his couered dealing againſt her ſeed of ſucceeding times, by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of his power, deſcribed in this Chapter, from his quality, that hee is a beaſt: origine, that hee riſeth out of the ſea, and earth, in diſtinct conſideration: ſhape exceeding monſtrous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeuen heades and ten horns, as had the Dragon: but other wayes busked, as hauing his hornes crowned, and on his head, the name of blaſphemy: in body like a Pard, footed like a Beare, and mouthed like a Lion. Beſides this, hee hath for right diſcerning of him, two notes of great marke. The firſt is, his great power and authority, as Vicegerent to Sathan in his <hi>power, throne, and authority.</hi> The ſecond is, that one of his heads ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene deadly wounded was cured againe, where-through, all the world aſtoniſhed at the beaſt of ſo great maieſty and vnmatchable power, worſhip him and the Diuell his aduancer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Theſe two notes, and effect thereof, thus ſummarily proponed, are from the fift verſe, throughout the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exponed more largely, and firſt, this his authority practiſed in two miſchieuous effects, the one of ſpeaking blaſphemies, and the other of doing what hee liſt vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled. This double authority is cleared, firſt by the time thereof, forty two moneths, and next by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it: his ſpeaking of blaſphemies againſt God, his Church and members thereof. In his doing are noted, what it was, making warre: againſt whom, <hi>the Saints:</hi> &amp; with what ſucceſſe, <hi>that hee ouercame them.</hi> Thirdly,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2565:70"/>
how largely this power was extended: <hi>Ouer euery Tribe, Tongue &amp; Nation.</hi> Through al which he obtaineth, that al follow and worſhip him (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he elect onely excepted:) a caſe ſo dangerous and fearefull, as a warning is, <hi>Epiphonemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> ſet downe to all of attention: and therewith, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, vpon two reaſons. Firſt, that according to the generall law of God his iuſtice, whereby euery oppreſſour is oppreſſed, and the ſlaier ſlaine, this beaſt ſhould come to deſtruction. Next, that it pleaſed God thus to trie the faith and patience of his Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3 His ſecond note, of his deadly wound cured againe, how it was, is ſhewed by a new viſion of an other Beaſt, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the earth: in all outward ſemblance, like to the Lambe, and pretending ſimplie his power, but that his ſpeech was like the Dragons. This Beaſt his actions, and end thereof, are firſt ſummarily proponed: in that he did all that the firſt beaſt could doe, before him: and to this end, that all the earth might worſhip the firſt Beaſt in the ſtate of the cured wound. Then is exponed, how he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectuateth this great point. To wit, by ſignes and wonders which were permitted him to doe, and thereby to deceiue the earth wherein, he ſeemed to match <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in maſter points. That, whereto by all this deceite, hee induceth the earth and men thereof, is to make vp the image of the Beaſt, which had the deadly wound and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Which he worketh ſo luckily, that hee giueth ſpirit and ſpeech to the Image: and obtaineth thereto worſhip of Nations vnder paine of death: and ſubiection to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Beaſt his marke in worke or profeſſion, as his proper good, and: and vnder paine of confiſcation of goods, and interdiction of all humane commerce, that all, of all eſtates, rankes, and conditions, ſhould receiue his marke, or beare his name; or, at leaſt, be accounted of his number: ſo, making vp the whole body and frame of his Kingdome. Which in reſpect of the number of his name, comprehending all the ſorts of his followers, will appeare (to any, who is not indued with heauenly wiſdome to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2565:70"/>
count it) ſo large, ſo faire, ſo perfectly and proportionably builded and ſtabliſhed, as he will vndoubtedly bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby. And yet, who is wiſe to count it, will find it to be but a man his number and none of God his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And the number to be counted, is 666.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That theſe beaſts are the ſtate of Rome, all ſound Interpreters agree. But in what time, and of what policy, there is great diſagreement. That which hath bred grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulty in accommodation, is, becauſe that the two Beaſts heere ſet foorth, are taken of all men to bee diuers, or at leaſt, of diuers time and condition: whereas they are both one. And are heere diſtinctly and diuerſly ſet downe by the ſpirit, onely for cleere explication: as in the dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall be made plaine. The common opinion, that the firſt Beaſt is the heathen ſtate of Rome vnder perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Emperours, and the ſecond, the Popedome, cannot conſiſt with the cleare notes of this firſt Beaſt, proper to Popedome. The firſt note, is the attire of his heads and hornes. Rome, in the perſecuting Emperours (as they were the miniſters of Satan his open wrath) is noted by ſeuen heads and tenne hornes of the Dragon: but ſo, as the heads onely are crowned. The hornes, that is, the Prouinciall gouernments vnder them, and wherein was their ſtrength, hauing no Crownes: becauſe the roiall and ſoueraigne gouernment, was then onely in the heads of the ſtate, ſo, deſigning the Emperours of that time. But this Beaſt heere, hath his hornes Crowned: to ſhew that the proppes of his power are crowned Kings, as Chapter 17. is exponed plainely, that they are Kings which had not as then receiued a Kingdome. Whereby is manifeſt that the tenne hornes, as they are crowned, were not in <hi>Iohn</hi> his time: neither this beaſt, as it hath crowned hornes. The beaſt indeed, was before, in the fiue heads who were fallen; he was not in the ſtate heere deſcribed: for he was to riſe out of the bottomleſſe pit: and yet, euen then, he was in the ſtate of the ſixth head; that is, the <hi>Caeſars:</hi> by curing of whoſe deadly wound, in the Pontificalitie ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2565:71"/>
the Popedome afterward became the liuely image: that is, the ſtate of Rome vnder the Popes a liuely image of the ſtate of Rome before. And therefore, in diſtinct conſideration, The Pontificality, is the eight head of the Beaſt, and yet one of the ſeuen. And whereas the former heads were crowned: now the heads ariſe to a higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption (hauing hornes crowned) to attire themſelues with the name of blaſphemy, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The next note, heere proper to the Popedome, is, that the Dragon hath giuen him his power, throne, and authority. The Dragon in his openrage, vſed Emperours but for the Miniſters of his furie: but the Popes are the Vicars of his power, and therefore, are properlie the <hi>Sonne of perdition, King Apollyon, and the Angell of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit:</hi> whoſe comming is <hi>in all effectuall working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> For, albeit the Dragon bequeateth not vtterly his Kingdome, yet finding that his open rage had not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined ſucceſſe, hee ſubſtracteth himſelfe in a ſort, and ſubſtituteth this viceroy of his kingdome, the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall promoouer of darkeneſſe that euer was. Satan offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chriſt this bargen, but was repulſed: heere, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Math. 4. 8.</note> his Merchant, who accepteth of it, and both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worſhippeth and maketh all the world to worſhippe the Dragon. That the Popes haue Satan his throne in a peculiar manner, is plaine, by their practiſe and by their challenge. Their practiſe, for that it is not onely (as of all the former heads, or other tyrants whatſoeuer, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan his rage) to ſubdue to themſelues bodies, goods and ſtates of men, to diſpoſe thereof at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but, hee further will impire ouer the conſcience: and all his adminiſtration, as the proper angell of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, is to plunge men in darkeneſſe. Wherein the Dragon, as almoſt in all things, is an Ape of God his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For, as God hath giuen to Chriſt, his throne and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, all power in heauen and earth, for conquering a kingdome to him: ſo hath the Dragon giuen all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his annointed, Antichriſt, the man of ſinne, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p n="6">6 The third note here put, is the time of his working, 42. mouethes. The very time of Antichriſt his obtaining place in the viſible Church, Chap. 11. of the Temple clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and witneſſes preaching in Sackcloath: and of the womans abode in the wilderneſſe, Chap. 12. An infallible argument that heere Antichriſt is deſcribed.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The fourth note is cleareſt of all. For, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Beaſt, his heades and hornes, ſheweth him to be the Romane ſtate or Kingdome: ſo, heere a ſpeciall note is giuen whereby to diſcerne of what time, policy, ſtate and condition of Rome, this Beaſt is to bee taken: namely, in the ſtate of the wounded head, cured againe. And, becauſe this, beingſhortly touched might be obſcure: therefore to make it plaine, a ſpeciall viſion is giuen of the curer and manner of the cure, whereby this Beaſt in this ſtate, is made vp: ſo as, if it may not be eſteemed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the fame which it was before the deadly ſtroke; yet at leaſt it is a liuely image thereof. The Curer, is a Beaſt like the Lambe, and ſimply pretending his power in two hornes like to his: but ſpeaking like the Dragon. Heere, two hones like the Lambes, are not put for any anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Kings, but to ſhew a humble and ſimple pretence of the Lambe his power; &amp; not out wardly, of that ferity and ſtrength of the Beaſt, like a Pard, footed like a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2565:72"/>
Beare, and mouthed like a Lion. For, that to the Lambe Chap. 5. we attributed ſeuen hornes and ſeuen eies, was to ſhew his perfection of power and wiſdome. Heere the Lambe is put according to the naturall verity of ſuch a beaſt, ſo to expreſſe liuely the ſimulate hypocriſie and affectation of ſimple humility in this Beaſt ſo masking himſelfe, while yet vnder this pretence, he but animates againe the beaſt with ſeuen heads and tenne hornes, &amp;c. That ſo vnder himſelfe (the eight head in number and order, and one of the ſeuen, that is the ſixth, by cure of the wounded head) the <hi>beaſt that was</hi> in the fiue heads fallen before <hi>Iohn</hi> his daies, and in the ſixth head was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then in his time, but was not in the condition heere meaned, might ariſe in the owne time out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe pit: and deceiuing the world by the cup of fornication, may periſh for euer.</p>
            <p>The meanes how hee worketh this cure, are by deceit of ſignes and wonders, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. The manner of cure is, that by theſe ſignes and wonders, the world is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make vppe the image of the Beaſt which had the deadly wound and liued. And this is nothing elſe, but that the Kings and States of the earth, ſhould ſo ſubmit themſelues to the Popes of Rome, by ſignes and force of the cup of fornication bewitching them, and faining of himſelfe to bee the Lambe his Vicar, whereas hee is the Dragons, as the ſtate of Rome, which in ouerthrow of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> had receiued a deadly wound, ſhould riſe to the ſame or greater dignity then it had in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors: and the kingdome thereof, reerected in the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificality, ſhould bee as it were a liuely and ſpeaking image of the beaſt before it was wounded: and all men ſhould worſhip als farre, or more, the Popes, as they had the Emperours: the Beaſt, that is, the kingdome or ſtate of Rome, becomming in the head cured againe, that is, in the Pontificality, als famous and wonderfull as it was before the wound. And in this reſpect, the Pontificality, is both the eight head, in number and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2565:72"/>
of that kingdome or beaſt, and alſo is one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as in which the ſixth head is reuiued, or rather the kingdome which in the ſixth head got a deadly wound; according as Chap. 17. the Beaſt hath his denomination from the eight head. For cleare vnderſtanding of all this matter, reade that Chapter. The ſixth head was wounded, when by incurſion of Barbars, many greate and famous Prouinces were taken from the Empire. Yet more deepely, when not onely Italie was trode vnder foot, but Rome it ſelfe was ſpoyled and burnt by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laricus;</hi> after by <hi>Athaulphus</hi> and their Gothes: miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably rifled by <hi>Genſericus</hi> and his Vandales. The wound yet was more deepe, when <hi>Odoacer</hi> and his Heruls flew <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> and ſeiſed vpon Italie fourteene yeres. But then it became deadly, when the Emperour and Senate, diſpairing to keepe Italie and Rome any more, willingly bequeathed them to <hi>Thcodoricus:</hi> who thereupon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating <hi>Odoacer,</hi> was receiued in Rome as their lawfull Prince. Where he raigned, by himſelfe and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors <hi>Oſtrogothes,</hi> in peace and flouriſhing ſtate many yeeres.</p>
            <p>This deadly wound, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> afterward by the valor of <hi>Beliſare</hi> and <hi>Narſet,</hi> laboured to haue cured, but it auailed not, by new inuaſions the wound ſtill remaining deadly. But the Popes, by ſignes and cup of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bewitching euen all theſe Kings, who had riſen by the fall of the Empire, to ſubmit their crownes to them: and that dignity and glory, which Rome had loſt by fall of the Empire, the Popes recouering the ſame to it by the authority of the Apoſtolike ſeat and keies of <hi>Peter:</hi> then the image of the Beaſt was ſo made vp, as for liuely reſemblance, it ſeemed to haue ſpirit and ſpeech. Euen in a manner to be the ſame; and ſo getteth worſhip and ſlauiſh ſubiection of the world.

But as in this (in my iudgement) they haue miſtaken, ſo this difference impoſeth no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to thinke ſo. For the viſion of the ſecond beaſt is onely brought, for more cleare explication of that laſt note of the Beast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2565:73"/>
In the firſt beaſt the Antichriſt is expreſſed, but ſo as we may take vppe of what kingdome and ſtate hee is head, namely of the kingdome of Rome. And therefore, in the beaſt, that kingdome is ſo painted foorth to vs, as to know it rightly, ſhe hath all her heads attributed to her, which ruled in her from her firſt riſing to her laſt fall: yet ſo, as here, the beaſt is to be conſidered, onely in the condition and ſtate of the laſt head, ariſing by cure of the deadly wound. As to the Dragon, all the heads were attributed (to make cleare what ſtate he wrought by) yet ſo as his rage then, is conſidered onely in the ſixth head. He hauing ſeuen but for diſcerning the kingdome; fiue hauing ere then fallen, and two not as yet riſen. The ſecond beaſt is put onely for cleare explication of the condition, nature, quality, and working, of this laſt head, conſidered a part and by it ſelfe: and how this great worke, of quickning that mortally wounded kingdome or beaſt, is wrought by it, ſo as vnder it, the Beaſtreuiueth: and now, (howſoeuer for diſcerning the kingdome, all the heads be mentioned) commeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee conſidered in that ſtate and reſpect: in which (for great diuerſity from the former condition before the wound yea and before the the cure) this head is in a ſort a different beaſt, as hauing this ſingular in ſhape, that it is like the Lambe: in working, that it doth by ſignes and wonders: in condition, that the beaſt vnder it, is rather an image of the former then the ſame, and yet a liuely image: therefore called the eight head and one of the ſeuen. In which reſpect, but ſeuen heads are attributed to the beaſt, albeit in number there be eight. That the firſt riſeth out of the ſea; and the ſecond out of the earth; it is but to note the different manner of riſing; of the laſt head and ſtate vnder it, from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Beaſt in all his former conditions and heades. They both, in their diſtinct manner of riſing, haue this common, that they are from below. For, albeit the earth and ſea, in degree of account with other creatures; as the fountaines, ſunne, moone, ſtarres, Chap. 9. and. 16.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2565:74"/>
according to the effects wrought in them, and that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they in theſe degrees are the types, are to bee taken ſo, as agreeth with the courſe of the myſtery, as in theſe places is declared. Yet when Sea and Earth are ſet in oppoſition to heauen, as heer, and Chapter 10. when the Angell deſcending from heauen for ouerthrow of this beaſt, ſetteth his feet on the ſea and earth, whence in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration the beaſt ariſeth. And Chapter 12. <hi>reioyce O heauens, woe to the Inhabitants of ſea and earth:</hi> then things ariſing from ſea and earth muſt bee taken as Chriſt ſpeaketh to the Iewes. <hi>Yee are from below, I am from aboue.</hi> And euen the foure beaſts in <hi>Daniel</hi> (whoſe <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 23.</note> whole ferity, cruelty, fraud, and deſtroying power is in this one) whom in the beginning of his ſeuenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee ſeeth riſe out of the ſea, are ſaid in that ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verſe 17. to ariſe out of the earth, as all one thing: except that as the earth ſheweth the origine to be earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from below, ſo the ſea ſheweth their riſing to bee of the troubles, toſſings and alterations of the earth: whoſe commotions are compared to the ſtormy ſea, and according to this to ſhew the peaceable and calme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Church vpon vtter deſtruction of this Beaſt, <note place="margin">Iſai. 57. 20.</note> it is ſaide Chapter 21. that there was no more ſea. Then, this ſecond Beaſt is ſaid to riſe out of the earth, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that it was from below (for ſo is the whole beaſt firſt &amp; laſt) throught the ſtar falling <hi>from the heauen,</hi> chap. 9 But becauſe this laſt head (howſoeuer the beaſt or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Rome conſidered abſolutely riſeth out of the ſea) in the particular conſideration thereof by it ſelfe, and apart, aroſe in a farre different manner from all the former; which all aroſe by great commotions and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alterations: but this laſt head aroſe ſlily, ſubtlely, and almoſt inſenſibly, by ſlow degrees, as things that grow through the earth; and ſo became head of that Kingdome, which vnder it is the beaſt going to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <note place="margin">Luke 1. 17.</note> to goe before Chriſt. And this is onely for cleareneſſe of explication of him and his manner, who maketh the Image: as trauelling with all ſedulous endeauour by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes to conciliate authority, honour and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that ſtate vnder himſelfe, as head thereof. Neither hereupon muſt wee thinke the ſecond beaſt working to bee an other from him, before whom hee worketh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo farre as the ſpirit, ſo will diſtinguiſh betwixt the Kingdome wholly and abſolutely, and this laſt head peculiarly conſidered, in compariſon to the former, and as after a deadly wound hee quickneth ſo that ſtate again as hee procureth to it worſhip of Nations. In one word, the firſt beaſt is the Kingdom of Rome vnder the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficality: the ſecond beaſt is the Pontificality, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully quickning the wounded beaſt, to that eſtate: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chapter 17 but one beaſt, euen this firſt, is put and called the eighth head: ſo euidently telling vs that both are one and the ſame, except in conſideration as I haue ſaid. According to this it is, that hereafter the beaſt is diſtinguiſhed from the falſe Prophet, not that they are two, as many fondly imagine: but onely to take vp ſo the State and Kingdome, as the falſe Prophet is heade therof, &amp; ſo the falſe Prophet as he is head of that ſtate. See vpon Chapter 17. Sect. 11. 18. and 19. Sect. 27. Theſe two beaſts, then are to expreſſe one and the ſame ſtate (euen Antichriſt in his Kingdome, and in himſelfe head thereof) both for condition and time. For from the Pope his firſt degree of riſing, hee neuer got any ſuch croſſing, as for which it might bee ſaid of him, that hee <hi>ſhould abide a ſhort ſpace,</hi> Chapter 17. For euen in the moſt miſerable times of Rome by the Gothes, hee not onely retained his old got account, but was ſtill labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to aduance the credite of his Chaire: as his ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious

And whatſoeuer hinderance bee had by <hi>Gothik</hi> tiranny from riſing to the height hee after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, it is too weake a ground to ſay of him, <hi>that hee abode a ſhort ſpace:</hi> thus to make him both the ſeuenth and eight head, againſt cleare Text, which maketh the ſeuenth to bee ſoone gone, and if ſuch had beene the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, he might much both cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and eaſier haue called him the eight and ſeuenth, then the eight <hi>and one of the ſeuen:</hi> thus clearely imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which of the ſeuen hee meaned: to wit, that whoſe deadly wound, by his ariſing hee cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The miſtaking of the ſeuenth head maketh all the errour, and in ſuch light of Storie, agreeing fitly with this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, it is wonder that all ſhould haue erred.

But why doe they not labour as much to find in the letters of this name his Character, as his number? ſeeing the Character, is the Character of the name, als well as the number is the number of the name, as is euident Chapter 14. 11. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayeth the Text here, that the Beaſt his name is a man his name: but the number of his name is a man his number. But thus it is; All that follow Antichriſt haue his name; but in diuers manner. Some haue the Character thereof, that is, the name imprinted, and are his proper good, as hauing his burne-yron and marke, a familiar Phraſe from the manner of men. Some haue his name, yet ſo as they haue not his Marke: who haue not

learned the deepeneſſe of Sathan, neither are Antichriſts ſworne bondmen. And yet, ſome haue but the number of his name: that is, are ſo farre from being his ſworne and marked ſlaues, as they are no otherwiſe his, but in ſo farre as they are counted to bee ſo, and numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">Chriſtians muſt be called Catholike Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> his. For he is ſuch a tyrant as will haue all men in one of theſe ſorts: and becauſe within theſe, who haue the number of his name, both the former ſorts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: the number of his name ſheweth the whole body and frame of his Kingdome. For albeit many haue his name, and moe haue his number, which haue not his Charecter: yet all that haue either Character or name, are of his number. The man then to whom God giueth wiſdome to count his number, that is, the whole frame and building of that Antichriſtian Kingdome: by counting of it ſhall finde it but the number of man, and none of God his building. As God <hi>numbred and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baltaſar</hi> King of <hi>Babell,</hi> and found him light. Now <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 26. 27</note> here is wiſdome indeed, which to finde out, the Lord hath left to vs in this propheſie not obſcure traces, as he ordinarily in Scripture doth, of things obſcurely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The very next words in the beginning of the 14. Chapter being rightly marked, will ridde all the way. In them wee haue the Lambe ſet againſt the Beaſt, his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter againſt his, a name againſt the Beaſt his name, and a number againſt the Beaſt his number. The Character of the Lambe his followers, is the Seale of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chapter 7. The name which they haue is the name of the Lambe his father, and the number characterized with this name, is 144000. which number herefore, may wel bee called the number of the name of God, or God his number, as 666. is called of the name of the beaſt, or the Beaſt his number. Now theſe numbers are not ſet down for the exact count of perſons followers of Chriſt or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: but are taken of the holy Ghoſt, as fit numbers in conſideration both of their building and figure, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the different condition, frame &amp; building of theſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2565:77"/>
two ſo oppoſite bodies, that is, the true Church and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Lambe, and the falſe Church and body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. This notable difference, alwayes is to bee aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Lambe his number, all of them haue his Character, for they are ſealed with his fathers name in their fore-heades: (for here the true Church, and true members thereof are meaned) but in the beaſt his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are many that haue not his name, and much leſſe his Character. Wherefore in the 14. Chapter, and 9. verſe thereof, and euery where hence throughout this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, eternall fire is denounced onely againſt his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and the receiuers of his character. See vpon that place Sect. 8. That the Lambe his number is 144000. and the beaſt his but 666. It is for great purpoſe. For, as it was needful in the number of the true Church (which now in Antichriſt his wide dominion appeared to bee ſmall, or none at all) that to a hundreth forty foure ſhould bee ioyned thouſands, to ſhew a competent number, and of God his building, euen when Antichriſt appeared to brooke all: ſo to the Antichriſt his number, where no doubt is of multitude, all the earth following him, it was not meet that thouſands ſhold haue bin added. That thus wee might the better take vp, how theſe numbers are not ſo much put to expreſſe the difference in number of theſe two bodies (which if thouſands had beene added to 666. would haue beene all we could euer haue ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therof) as to note the difference in condition, frame and building. That is, that the one is the number of God his building and frame: the other, but the <hi>number of a man.</hi> That is, a building and body, howſoeuer in all outward appearance more belliſant and greater then the firſt, yet but of a man his inuention. For the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is in theſe two numbers 144. and 666. whether of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hundrethes, thouſands or millions. Vpon which, a man looking, who is not furniſhed with wiſdome from aboue to count the numbers; hee will much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and bee taken with the Beaſt his number, as larger
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2565:77"/>
a great deale, and better compacted in all the parts of it, each anſwering and ſo ſitly agreeing together, as it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all on ſixe, in vnities, tennes and hundreds: and ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of ſixe, the firſt perfect number, multiplied by tenne, and in ſo farre proportion of parts, as, ſixe is tenne times in ſixty, and ſixtie, tenne times in ſixe hundred. Againſt which to ſet 144. without wiſdome to count, a man ſhall thinke there is no compariſon. Heereby the ſpirit will teach vs, that an vnwiſe man, and not skilfull in diuine wiſdome to count, looking on the bodie, building and frame of Antichriſt his Church, ſhall be ſo taken with the goodly appearance thereof, as he ſhall thinke it to bee the onely true Church: but a wiſe man, able to count the number, ſhall finde it but the number of a man, and none of God his building. And, this is that which Chapter fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene is called, <hi>to ouercome the number of the Beaſt his name.</hi> For, who cannot count, will bee ouercome by it. Now the onely way to count it rightly, is, firſt to count the number of God his name, and thereby, examining the other, to finde it neither in building nor frame agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. That we might finde out this wiſdome, the ſpirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly counted this number 144. Chapter 7. And heere againe in fit place, recordeth it, for taking vp the myſtery. In that 7. Chapter this number expreſſing the body of the true Church in Antichriſt his vſurpation, is ſaid to be of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> not in propriety of ſpeech, as their was ſhewed. Next, is declared at length how the number is made vp: namely by twelue thouſand of euery Tribe: which Tribes, are at length, numbred for ſpeciall purpoſe, to hold the number of twelue: which number, albeit in effect, there were thirteene, yet in all records both of old and new Teſtament is keeped. So, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that no moe ſhould be counted but 12. left out <hi>Simeon,</hi> as then, for the murther of the <hi>Sichemits,</hi> bearing greateſt blot: which <note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Leuie</hi> had lately before purged, by ſanctifyng his ſword to God his honour: for which, in that record, he is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie commended. In the Chronicles, <hi>Dan</hi> is omitted, for <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 8.</note>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:2565:78"/>
his race is not reckoned, in deteſtation of his firſt erecting <hi>publike Idolatry.</hi> For which reaſon alſo in the 7. Chapter <note place="margin">Iudg. 17. &amp; 18</note> he is left out. Not that in propriety wee haue to thinke that Tribe to be more then others reiected; but to ſhew, that the ſealed ones are noe Idolaters, but all ſpiritual Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, Chap 14. 4. Where in Scripture none are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe</hi> come, iointly, vnder the name of their Father <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as <hi>Geneſ. 49. Ezech.</hi> 47. Now, <note place="margin">1. Chro. 22.</note> as theſe twelue are the Fathers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh: ſo as none were counted <hi>Iſraelites</hi> but who could reduce his Genealogy to one of theſe twelue: ſo, Chriſt, accordingly chooſed twelue Apoſtles to bee the twelue ſpirituall fathers of his Church (the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God) vpon whoſe foundation hee would haue it builded: ſo, as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not builded on their Doctrine, holding the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and all the building ariſing proportionably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 20.</note> the ſame is not of the <hi>new Ieruſalem</hi> from heauen, Cha. 21. which hath twelue foundations, &amp; on them the names of the Lambe his twelue Apoſtles: twelue portes, and on them written the names of the twelue Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Which, in all dimenſions, was twelue times twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, that is, 144000. furlongs (for ſo the place ought to be read) the Angels conductours twelue, and the wall <note place="margin">Chapt. 21. ſection 16.</note> in thickneſſe twelue times twelue, euen 144. cubits. In this number, to eſpie the wiſdome, are to bee conſidered the building, and the figure. The building, is by twelue vpon twelue; to ſhew, that the true Church is builded, ſo, on the true foundation of Apoſtolike doctrine, as it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill the foundation, nothing being built thereon, but agreeable thereto: as this number is no waies multiplied but by twelue vpon twelue, the multiplier and multiplied being but one. The figure of this number is <hi>foureſquare,</hi> and of equall ſides, and whoſe ſides all conſiſt of twelues. For, as it is onely builded by multiplication of 12. with 12. ſo can it neither bee halfed nor quartered but in twelues: and hath in euery ſquare three twelues. According to the figure of the new Ieruſalem, Chapter 21. hauing in each
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2565:78"/>
ſquare three ports, and on them the names of three Tribes, wherof each hauing twelue thouſand, make vp in length, height, and breadth the <hi>new Ieruſalem,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 144000. The Campe of <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 2. is agreeable heereto. All to ſhew, that the true Church both in ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and figure holdeth euer the foundation.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now heereby, let vs count, <hi>number and weigh Baltaſar</hi> and finde him <hi>light.</hi> This number 666. for als <note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> faire as it ſheweth, can neuer be builded vpon twelue, by twelue. Yea, which is more, take what multiplier thou wilt, thou ſhalt neuer raiſe it vpon twelue. It cannot bee deuided nor quartered in twelues: and, poſſibly thou ſhalt neuer reduce it to equal ſides. So as it neither riſeth on the foundation, much leſſe keepeth it: neither in frame or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is it any way like to the <hi>New Ieruſalem.</hi> In ſumme, heere is wiſdome, by true rule of Apoſtolike doctrine (the reed giuen <hi>Iohn</hi> Chap. 11,) to meaſure, count, weigh, and examine, the whole frame, doctrine, building and body of the Antichriſtian Church: and ſo, how faire a ſhew ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it hath to deceiue fooles, yet, by true wiſdome, to finde it all but the worke of a Man.

            <p n="11">11 That this number 666. is chooſed rather then any other number, where others may bee found hauing the defect obſerued in it, to repreſent the ſtate and condition of Antichriſt his body: beſides the fear perfection of the number before touched, and euen of the Romans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues highly eſteemed <hi>(Boniface 8. praefat. in ſextum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal.)</hi> The ſpeciall purpoſe heere of the holy Ghoſt, is to allude (according to his manner) to the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Where, by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> an Image is erected, which vnder paine of death, hee will haue all peoples, <hi>Nations and tongues to fall downe and worſhip.</hi> Which <hi>Image</hi> had of breadth 6. cubits, and of height 60.

               <hi>The ſound of many waters, the noiſe of great thunders, and ſound of harpes harping,</hi> verſe 2. Thirdly, their worſhip returned to God is ſingular: in ſpirituall ioy, knowen and approued of him, and performed in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fellowſhip of his true Church (through the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the word made vnto him a royall Prieſthood) in the midſt whereof, hee alwaies ſitteth King and Lord: which Church, as it remained vnknowen to the world, the time of Antichriſt his abſolute preuailing; ſo their worſhip was perceptible to none but theſe ſecret ſealed ones, whom God of his ſpeciall grace, had bought with his owne bloud, out of the world, verſe 3. to bee a holy and chaſte ſpouſe to himſelfe (for none are ſealed of <hi>Dan,</hi> Chap. 7.) by true faith, cleauing onely and alwaies to the Lambe, and following none other: keeping the liberty whereto God had made them free, and not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men: ſingled from the world to be a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> holy vnto God and Chriſt Ieſus, verſe 4. euen true Iſraelites like <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> and in Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe accepted and approued of God, verſe 6. This is the ſtate of the Church, cloſed in the Temple, <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 47.</note> Chapter 11. Lurking in the wilderneſſe, Chapt. 12. And heere ſtabliſhed on mount Sion, while all the world follow the Beaſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now, to cleare the threefold compariſon put ver. 2. The voice of the Lord is compared to many waters, for the vnreſiſtable force, and admirable noiſe, breeding wonder: to thunder, for terror and power ſhaking all: to the douce ſound of harpes, for the worke of peace and ioy in the conſcience. By which three, is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as the Church, lurking in time of Antichriſt his abſolute preuailing, had the preſence of the Lambe: ſo, howſoeuer vnſeene of the world, ſhe had alſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull diſpenſation of ſpirituall graces from heauen. Which the ſpirit heere expreſſeth by theſe three, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the three degrees of operation, which the word of God hath in the hearts of men. For, firſt it falleth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2565:80"/>
to mens eares, as <hi>the ſound of many waters,</hi> a mighty, great, but a confuſed ſound, and which commonly, bringeth neither terrour nor ioy, but yet a wondering and acknowledgement of a ſtrange force, and more then humane power. This is that effect which many <note place="margin">Mar. 1. 22 27. Luke 4. 32. Ioh. 7. 46.</note> felt, hearing Chriſt, when they were aſtonied at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as teaching with authority. <hi>What manner doctrine is this? neuer man ſpake like this man.</hi> This effect falleth euen to the reprobate, which wonder and vaniſh, <hi>Habak. 1. 5. Acts</hi> 13. 41. and whoſe hearts are conuinced, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, that it hath more then humane force, euen like the <hi>noiſe of many waters.</hi> But, as the firſt hearing of the roare of waters is moſt admirable, and the more one is acquainted therewith, the leſſe hee heareth it, as <note place="margin">Cicero. in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Scipionis.</note> theſe at the Catadupes of Nilus: ſo, in whom the word worketh but this firſt effect, his eares waxe duller and duller, as daily experience proueth. The next effect, is <hi>the voice of thunder.</hi> Which bringeth not only won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but feare alſo: not only filleth the eares with ſound, and the heart with aſtoniſhment, but moreouer ſhaketh and terrifieth the conſcience. And this ſecond effect may alſo befall a reprobate, as <hi>Felix Act.</hi> 24. The third effect, is proper to the elect: <hi>the ſound of harping;</hi> while the word not onely rauiſheth with admiration, and ſtriketh the conſcience with terror; but alſo, laſtly, filleth it with that ſweete peace and ioy, which none feele, but they whoſe hearts thereupon, againe, as well ſounding harpes, are tuned vp to <hi>ſing a new ſong</hi> vnto God. And, albeit the firſt two degrees may be without the laſt, yet none feele the laſt, who haue not in ſome degree, felt both the firſt two. For <hi>the voice of the Lord is mighty, the voice of the Lord is glorious; it breaketh the Cedars, and maketh the wilderneſſe to tremble:</hi> But <hi>in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> only <hi>men ſpeake of his glory, Pſalm.</hi> 29. This graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſation (incredible and vnſeene to the world, which could not therefore learne the ſong of praiſe thereupon) was in the 11. Chap. expreſſed by two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2565:80"/>
which for diſpenſing grace and light, were two oliue Trees, and two Candleſtickes in the Temple, while it ſeemed impoſſible that any ſuch could bee, Antichriſt brooking City and Court: and for force and power, fire went out at their mouths, and they did ſtrike the earth with all manner of plagues. Now theſe compariſons of the voice of waters, thunder, and harping, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe fitly what I haue told ſo, in them is implyed a ſure prognoſtick and argument of the next inſuing eſtate, in the Angels breaking forth and crying. For albeit, this ſound of water, thunder, and harping, the world, in this lurking condition of the Church, perceiued not, yet they could not ſtill remaine vnheard. Who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the breach of great waters? what congealed cloude can keepe in thunder? and, exceſſiue ioy, a heart, of any thing, can leaſt hold vp. Forth therefore, this hid Church behoued to come. The bellies made bitter, with eating the little booke, behoued to burſt or breake out: according as we ſee in the three Angels following, who come forth like the ſwelling of Iorden, like ſonnes of thunder (according as Chriſt Chapt. 10. preparing for this outbreake, his <hi>roaring voice,</hi> was ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſeuen thunders) and like the burſting out of a blythe heart, which cannot hold vp a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of ioy.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This ſecond condition, of the Church breaking forth, hath the velitation or skirmiſh, and a coincident caſe with it. The velitation (I call it ſo, in compariſon to the great battell in the ſeuenth trumpet and ſeuen vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als thereof, ſummarily proponed in the end of this Chap. and exponed largely thenceforth) according to the firſt degrees of the light of the Goſpell reuiuing, is ſet downe in three Angels; types of theſe Miniſters whom God ſtirred vp, to bee the firſt open conteſters with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt to the 12. verſe. The coincident caſe, is in the 12. and 13. verſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The firſt ranke of Preachers are expreſſed by an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2565:81"/>
Angel <hi>fleeing thorow the mids of heauen, &amp;c.</hi> for open and ſwift courſe, which notwithſtanding, was yet farre remoued aboue the perception of men of the earth, whereof few vnderſtood or imbraced the firſt warnings and light arriſing, it being but yet obſcurely preached: like as few vnderſtood the warning of Antichriſtian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comming on, Chap. 8. and in reſpect of that Angel there, it is, that this, is called <hi>an other Angel,</hi> as who is the next, vſing his forme. See a contrarie diſpenſation to this, which cleareth this ſenſe, Chap. 18. His doctrine is ſet downe firſt in generall, and to whom he preached: and ſecondly, the ſpeciall points thereof. In generall, it is an euerlaſting Goſpell: euen that truth which was from the beginning, and which, when heauen and earth paſſeth away, ſhall abide for euer: the immortall ſeede, <note place="margin">Math. 24. 35. 1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> and begetting to immortality. So it is called, againſt the calumnies of nouelty, and in oppoſition to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of men. Hee preacheth to <hi>them who dwell on the earth,</hi> euen in Antichriſt his darkeneſſe: aboue whoſe reach, it is leſſe maruell that this firſt light was yet farre remoued; as a fleeing <hi>flaſh thorow the mids of heauen.</hi> He preacheth <hi>to all Nations, Kinreds, Tongues and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> who had worſhipped the Beaſt; and of whom, by reſtored light of the Goſpell, an infinite number was now to be brought out of great tribulation, to ſing, with Palmes in hand, and hauing waſhed their garments in the bloud of the Lambe; <hi>Saluation is of our God and of the Lambe;</hi> and to be made partakers of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the thouſand yeeres being expired, Chap. 20. <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> Now the hid ones beginne to breake out, and the ſong vnheard, to bee tuned vp loudlie in the eares of all the earth: therefore, this Angel is ſaid to <hi>cry loude.</hi> In his ſpeciall doctrine, is the ſubſtance thereof, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching. The ſubſtance is, that <hi>all feare, glory, and worſhip,</hi> bee giuen to God onely, and that, both for auoiding his iudgements neere to bee executed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is creator of all things. A doctrine exceeding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2565:81"/>
fite for that time. His manner is to bee marked: in that hee vrgeth onely true worſhippe, not bold yet to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge directly the Antichriſt, as the ſucceeding Angell doth roundly; but more the third, ſo wiſely and plainely as the Spirit ſheweth the courſe: and the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Story is euident. Now as this was the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the conflict with Antichriſt; ſo accordingly in the ſong of victory, God is praiſed for theſe ſame points, Chapter 15. 3.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſecond Angell roundly denounceth the fall of Rome that ſpirituall <hi>Babell, Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that becauſe ſhee had not onely beene an Idolatreſſe her ſelfe, but as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne, ſhee is the mother of Whoredomes through the world, making men drinke vp ſuperſtitious worſhippe greedily as wine, and ſo to be beſotted therewith. To the which, God both gaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the world iuſtly in his wrath, that they who would not beleeue the truth, ſhould be taken with deceiueable illuſions, and for which, now againe the world iuſtly fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 10. 11.</note> the cuppes of the laſt wrath. As hee gaue to <hi>Iſrael</hi> Kings in his wrath, and tooke them away in his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <note place="margin">Oſe. 13. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 The third Angell yet more vehemently toucheth neerer. Warning all to leaue the Beaſt his worſhippe and character either in worke or profeſſion, vnder paine of eternall damnation.

Firſt, as they dranke greedily the Whores Wine, ſo get they to drinke the pure vnmixed wine of God his wrath: and next, they get it in the cup of his wrath: God ſometimes giueth a bitter cuppe to his owne children: but as ſtrong wine for mitigation, is tempered with water or ſugar: ſo are all God his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticements to his owne mixed with mercy: but to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2565:82"/>
wicked is powred out mercileſſe iudgement. Next, the Cuppe propined to the Saints, is not the Cup of wrath, but of loue, and medicinall: but the wicked drinke out of the cuppe of wrath. <hi>Lord reproue mee not in thy wrath, Pſal.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now, this iudgement is denounced againſt ſuch as worſhippe the Beaſt, and receiue his Character, &amp;c. And they are twice repeated, as I haue ſaid, wherein is no <hi>Tautologie,</hi> but diuine wiſdome, for to make vs take vp a great point. In the 13. Chapter, all the Beaſt his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers haue his Character, or his name, or his number: whereof, as I ſhewed there, the difference is ill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For many haue his name, and are content to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his, being ſo farre deceiued with his ſhew, as yet they receiue neuer his Character, as his mancipate ſlaues. And yet, moe haue the number of his name, that is, are counted and numbred to bee of his body, who yet in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect neither haue his name nor his Character. This hath deceiued men, that they haue imagined the Character to be ſome other thing then of his name. But as is cleare by this place, his Character is of his name, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Character; who ſo haue his name, as they are characterized therewith, and vpon his marke. A ſpeech <note place="margin">Liers and murtherers like their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diuel.</note> from common vſe. Hereof it is, that in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> all haue the Character, that is, all who are of the true Church elected according to the purpoſe of grace. But as in the viſible Church many haue the name of God, &amp; moe haue the number, that is, are accounted Chriſtians, who yet are not of the number ſealed: ſo in Antichriſt his Church, are many hauing his name, and moe hauing his number, and ſo are tolerated to <hi>haue commerce and trade with men,</hi> who yet neuer receiued his Character. Therefore it is, that the iudgement is denounced onely againſt thoſe who worſhippe him and receiue his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: and accordingly the Vials of wrath, Chapter 16. are powred onely vpon theſe. Who are here twiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that wee may bee wakened to aduert; how here
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2565:82"/>
the holy Ghoſt teacheth vs, not to iudge ſo hardly of all that follow the Beaſt, as that eternall damnation abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them; but onely ſuch as haue receiued his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. For no queſtion, but many haue beene, and are ſtill named his, and counted of his number, who learned <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 24.</note> neuer the deepeneſſe of Sathan: as ſimple ſheepe fallen into that ſlocke of his, becauſe they ſaw there the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Enſigne, and the Lambe his horns in ſemblance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee brooked the holy City, and Court of the Temple. Euen like theſe two hundreth, who in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of heart followed <hi>Abſolom</hi> from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of his treaſon. For we muſt conſider what <note place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 11.</note> ſort of enemy Antichriſt is. That hee is no fortaine inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but an inward Traitor. None directly fighting againſt the name and Enſigne of Chriſt, but by pretence of the name and Enſigne deceiuing. And ſitting euen in the Temple of God, as if a hid Traitor, pretending the King his Maſters ſeruice and commiſſion, would ſummon all true Subiects to follow him, while hee were but mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vſurpation: euen good Subiects might bee thus far deceiued as to follow the publike Enſigne, till the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were detected. Further conſider, that the true Church in Antichriſt his greateſt preuailing, was alwaies within his compaſſe, within which, all were euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to bee his owne, but yet were not. As within the compaſſe of the holy City, and Court of the Temple, were the Temple and witneſſes in it, Chapter 11. beſides, as no way could bee to the Temple, but through the City and Court: ſo no way euer was or ſhall bee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a member of the true Church, but by comming through the viſible Church, wherein Antichriſt fortie two moneths working and obtaining without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: all behoued to ioyne to that body where was the Enſigne, and ſeek in through the City and Court to com to the Temple. Now, no maruell, though many in the paſſing through were taken in admiration of the City &amp; Court before they got ſight of the Temple. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2565:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God was wonderfull in this, that in greateſt corruption he reſerued alwayes a ſure way through An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt to the Temple, the Sacrament of Baptiſme in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remaining, and the doctrine of the Trinity abiding ſound. So thus all comming through him, had his name or his nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, of whom yet many neuer receiued his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but eſpying the pollution of City and Court, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Temple. Where ſtill, though quietly, God preſerued two Candleſtickes and two Oliues; till at length his impiety came to that height by murthering the Saints, that it was ſaid to them, <hi>Come vp hither,</hi> and ſo a viſible ſeparation was made, not from the Church, <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> but from the thiefe and Traitor in the Church, his mouth bewraying it ſelfe to bee the Dragons. And certainely, this holdeth true, (ſo as we neede not ſo much iangle with the Romans thereabout) that the Church hath and euer ſhall bee viſible, becauſe alwayes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enſigne is ſeene. But this Enſigne the Traitor craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily tooke vpon him to beare, and thereby deceiued. Here is the fallacy, that by aequiuocation they conclude, if the Church hath alway beene viſible, then are wee the true Church. Here more is added. For albeit the church be alwayes viſible, yet the truth and true profeſſors in it are not alwayes ſo. For the witneſſes were cloſed in the Temple, the woman lurked in the wilderneſſe, and the ſealed ones were, albeit ſinging, yet vnſeene and vnheard vpon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> Three diſtinct ſpeeches vſed of the Spirit for great purpoſe. The firſt, to ſhew that howſoeuer the true Church was hid, yet where ſhee was, to witte, within the compaſſe of the viſible where Antichriſt ruled, and where <hi>Sathan his throne was.</hi> The ſecond, to ſhew that albeit ſhee lurked, yet ſhe was fed, as was <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, and <hi>Elias</hi> in the dayes of famine. The third, that in that great preuailing of Antichriſt, when <hi>all the earth followed the Beaſt,</hi> yet ſhe was ſtabliſhed on Mount <hi>Sion:</hi> ſo as againſt her the gates of hell could not preuaile. The true Church is in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2565:83"/>
ſome ſort euer vlſible, though not in her ſelfe, yet in her infallible Enſignes, as who ſeeth the Citie and Court, hee ſeeth in a ſort the Temple, becauſe albeit hee ſee it not diſtinctlie, yet ſeeing the City and Court, hee is certaine that the Temple is there. So ſeeing the viſible Church, within whoſe compaſſe, though no eye ſee them: yet God hath his true worſhippers, one ſeeth alſo the true Church. For within the Church are truth and lies, Chriſt and Antichriſt, and either of them now and then obtaine in it, and hold place <hi>communiter in toto,</hi> but neuer <hi>vniuerſaliter in ſingulis.</hi> From the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like times, as witneſſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Antichriſt was in <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7. 1 Ioh, 4. 3.</note> the Church, but hee appeared not ſome ages after, In his time hee riſeth and obtaineth all <hi>the holy City, and Court of the Temple,</hi> erecteth a throne in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and domineth as <hi>Iezabel</hi> in <hi>I hyatira.</hi> Truth is hid, and true Profeſſors, till the noiſe of many waters, the voyce of thunder, and ſound of well tuned Harpes, breake out of <hi>Sion</hi> and the Temple, and the woman returne from the wilderneſſe. It is a great Sophiſme to conclude from the Church viſible to the Church abſolutely, or true Church: or againe, from theſe to that: or to reaſon <hi>a toto communiter, ad vniuerſum ſingulariter.</hi> Albeit An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt was commonlie acknowledged of all, yet neuer vniuerſally of each one. For he neuer ſet his foot in the Temple, nor vpon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> The Romans preſſe ſore vpon vs, to ſhew who in former ages haue been of our Religion, and our men but buſie themſelues more then is needfull, the holy Ghoſt hauing ſo plainely foretolde the caſe. And how common doe wee ſee in our daylie experience of particular Churches, that things will by cuſtome or tyranny ſo obtaine, as none are found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, while yet in the meane time great numbers not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſallow, but euen hold themſelues pure there from? Here, who would aske the ſucceeding age, what had beene the eſtate then: hee could find nothing, but that all had erred; becauſe the common Records beare but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2565:84"/>
what obtained in the time: no Record remaining of theſe, who, though for feare they durſt not conteſt, yet miſliked and mourned for the iniquity. And if perhaps, they did vtter any thing which to the poſterity might haue carried teſtimony of their mind; the ſame being ſmothered by them who violently poſſeſſed and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all: I haue no doubt, but in euery age, euen in the greateſt height of darkeneſſe, diuers haue not onely been enemies thereof, &amp; both children and miniſters of light: but euen haue beene in their time knowne to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then. Albeit to enquire the ſucceeding ages of their ſtory, it is ridiculous, and wee but faſhe our ſelues vnneceſſarily to haile therein the cord of contention with the aduerſaries: hauing otherwiſe ſo cleare, and ſolide anſweres furniſhed vs by the holy Ghoſt to cloſe their mouthes. Yea, the Antichriſt his prerogatiue, and his long and peaceable obtaining in the viſible Church, diſmayeth vs ſo little, as thereupon wee build a ſure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that there all the time was the true Church. For hee is a proper ſore of the body of the Church. And as ſuch a peſtilent boile or leproſie, which can bee in no other but a man his body, albeit the whole body ſhould bee ſo couered, that nothing could bee ſeene but the boile or leproſie: yet euen thereby the beholder is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there is a man his body, becauſe that ſoare can befall none other. So, by Antichriſt who is a proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and ſitting no where elſe but in the Church, wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and perceiue clearely where the true Church hath beene, and ſtill in great part is. For euen before the laſt fall of <hi>Babell,</hi> the Lord his people are exhorted to come <note place="margin">Chap. 18. 4.</note> out of her. In the viſible Church the truth hath alwaies beene: but ſo a long time, as the Booke of the Law was within the Temple before <hi>Ioſias.</hi> Now then the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <note place="margin">2 King. 22.</note> of the Romans whereby they labour ſo much to ſhake vnſtable ſoules, is more then ridiculous: where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> what became of all our Fathers? to which we anſwere: Our Church was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2565:84"/>
               <hi>where Satans throne was.</hi> And of our Fathers wee iudge well, as who, howſoeuer they receiued the Beaſt his name, or at leaſt the number of his name, yet might haue beene free from receiuing his Character: and ſo out of the danger of this ſentence of eternall fire. If they had eies to ſee, and hearts to vnderſtand this Propheſie, they would bee confounded in that wherein they glorie moſt: and aſhamed to obiect to vs that which moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth our cauſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Thus was the velitation. The caſe coincident, is terrible perſecution. The weight whereof is cleered by a warning, verſe 12. and a conſolation, verſ. 13. The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, together with the weight, declare againſt whom this heauy perſecution is intended: to wit, the Saines, and <hi>thoſe who keepe the commandements of God, and faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> The weight is ſhewed in this, that their ſhall bee need of Chriſtian patience, as which ſhall be greatly exerciſed: and that the triall ſhall bee ſuch, as, the conſtant keepers of God his commandements and faith of Ieſus, ſhall finde wherein to be prooued.

And, ſeeing that the remnant ſeed of the woman, againſt whom the Dragon was to ſtir vp warte, Chap. 12. 17. are deſcribed by the ſame titles <hi>Of keeping the commandements of God, &amp;c.</hi> This warning heere giuen, hath alſo this end, to waken vs vp to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpeciall time and heate of that warre, their foretold to bee then, when Antichriſt, beeing chaffed with theſe three Angels, made all Europe to feele cruell fires and bloody maſſacres: whereof the memory is yet recent. That ſo, the reſt of them who ſhould be killed for Ieſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulfilled, Chap. 6. 11. finall and full vengeance may come on that bloody ſtate. The weight of this perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is yet further amplified by the conſolation giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2565:85"/>
it. Which beſides the ſubſtance thereof, is notable in many circumſtances. Of the deliuery, from heauen: the commandement how to receiue it, in that it ſhould not onely be heard, but alſo written, as worthy of laſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: <note place="margin">Chap. 19. 9. Iſa. 8. &amp; 30. Aabac. 2. 2. Iob. 19. 23.</note> of double aſſeueration: and that by the holy Ghoſt. The ſubſtance of the conſolation is, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that hencefoorth die in the Lord.</hi> The reaſons are, <hi>They reſt from their labours: and their works follow them.</hi> Our daies heere are but a ſhadowe, and in them, euen our ſtrength is but labour and ſorrow: all, wherein a man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth happineſſe vnder the ſunne, beeing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, from whence to remoue in the Lord, and enter into our reſt, is a great bleſſedneſſe; in ſo farre as our labour is not in vaine in the Lord, but great is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heauen. Now, howſoeuer all men goe naked out of this world, as naked wee come: and nothing of all our great labour and works goeth with vs. Yet, as euery one ſhall be indged and receiue according to that which hee hath done in the fleſh, good or euill; ſo euery ſoule cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it an inſtamped ſenſe of the workes done in the fleſh: ſo as either a ſpeaking and ſelfe accuſing guiltineſſe followeth a man; or then, as by grace he hath beene ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to make his election ſure by good workes in this life, ſo ſhall the teſtimony of peace in his conſcience follow him.

            <p n="10">10 From the 14. ver. is the third part of this Ch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the ſummary propoſition of the full ouerthrow of the enemies: which at length, in the ſubſequent Chapters, is explaned. Now heere, the courſe of this Propheſie is <note place="margin">The courſe of this Booke.</note> carefully to be marked, for a great light through all. The iudgements of God, firſt, and ſecond vpon the worlde, were in the ſixe Seales and ſixe Trumpets of the ſeuenth. To the 15. verſe of the 11. Chapter, there the ſeuenth Trumpet ſoundeth, and the laſt wrath is denounced. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the particular declaration whereof, that the iuſtice of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2565:85"/>
God, therein might the better appeare, it was requiſite, that the Hiſtorie of theſe enemies to be deſtroied, in their dealings againſt the Church, ſhould be cleered: for which it is, that the world feeleth all this wrath. That ſtory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was in the 12. 13. and thus farre in this 14. Chapters. Wherein, is no idle repetition of what appeareth before ſet downe. For the conſideration is much diuers: in that, whatſoeuer before the 12. Chapter was ſpoken of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or their dealing, was to ſhew, how by them, the world and worldly ſort, in God his iuſtice were puniſhed. The caſe of the Church ſparingly touched: ſo farre as might ſhew her to bee free from theſe euils (euen in the midſt of them) which were poured on the world for her hard intertainement. And what in the eleuenth Chapter ſeemeth wholly agreeable for time and condition with that which, hithertils in this Chapter is ſaid of the Church in her two declared ſtates, yet hath a farre diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from this. In that there, the witneſſes, firſt, in the Temple, next in their warre with the Beaſt, ſlaughter, riſing againe, going vp to heauen, and terrour of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies thereupon, with the fall in a part of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kingdome; are put, as plagues on the world, and men thereof; whom they firſt plagued, next tormented and vexed, after terrified, and in part ouerthrew. For, the Goſpell, to whom it is not the ſauour of life, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iudgement that commeth on the world. But from the beginning of the 12. Chapter to this place, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are handled, as by them the Church is exerciſed. Firſt, fighting and preuailing to Satan his deiection and exaltation of the firſt ſeede. Yet ſo, as through Satan his rage, but aided thereto with the two wings of that great Eagle, the true Church at length, fleeth to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and there lurketh. Wherethrough, the Beaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in place, obtaineth, and deceiueth all, except theſe who on mount Sion inioy the preſence of the Lambe. Who at length, by degrees breake foorth, and albeis in much ſuffering, yet ſtill fight, till at length, by him who <hi>ſitteth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2565:86"/>
on the white cloude, the iudgemeuts of God are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 15. 4.</note> The ſtory of the eleuenth Chapter and of this, are for time and matter, the ſame: but the conſideration and reſpect of handling much different. Which, is yet, for courſe and order, in ſo diuine an artifice led on, as heere the ſtory falling in againe to the ſame point, from which, for inſerting this narration, it was ſince the eleuenth Chapter, broken off: of that, which from the 15. verſe of 11. the Chapter at the ſound of the ſeuenth Trumpet, was vpon preconceiued ioy denounced; heere, from the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe of this Chapter, to the ende; the execution is ſummarily proponed. Exceeding fitly, ſo falling in, to the large explication of the ſeuenth trumpet in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chapters.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This ſummary execution is declared by two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. One of the Harueſt: the other of the Vintage. From <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. In both, are to be conſidered, the Actors, and their actions. The Harueſt hath two actors: and ſo hath the Vintage. The actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of both Actors, both in harueſt &amp; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage are, that the one worketh, furniſhed with conuenient inſtrument, &amp; the other ſtirreth to the work. Which in the Harueſt, is <hi>reaping the harueſt</hi> of the earth: in the Vintage, the cutting downe of the Grapes, caſting them in the winepreſſe, <hi>treading, &amp;c.</hi> The arguments whereby the inciters ſtirre the executers, is the readineſſe of both, for reaping and cutting downe. Thus by ſimilitudes familiar in the Prophets for ſuch iudgements, the deſtruction of <note place="margin">Iere. 51. 33.</note> the enemies of the Church is expreſſed: who in God his wrath as <hi>an vncleane thing, without the Citie,</hi> are deſtroied <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 11:</note> with ſo huge a ſlaughter, as all the earth is filled farre and deepe with their blood: by <hi>Hyperbolike</hi> ſpeech expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the greatneſſe of the plague; and, as to the holy City, ſo alſo alluding to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is in length 160. furlongs, as witneſſeth <hi>Rabbi Menahen,</hi> vpon <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> fol. 60. For clearing heereof, the Actors, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct actions muſt be diligently aduerted, ſo much the more, as to the obſcuring of all the Propheſie, this place
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2565:86"/>
is widely miſtaken. In them are to bee noted, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, their doing, and their order of doing: for courſe of time to be carefully obſerued. In the harueſt, hee that worketh, being accordingly furniſhed with fit inſtrument, by all hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> notes, is vndoubtedly, Chriſt the Lord of the harueſt. For, he is one like the ſonne of man, which, in all <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 13.</note> this Propheſie, is put but in one other place, and that for Chriſt: he fitteth, as a Iudge: on a white cloude, both for eminency and maieſty; as alſo, by the whiteneſſe, to ſhew the cleareneſſe &amp; pureneſſe of his iudgements, which <hi>Now were to be made manifeſt,</hi> Chap. 15. 4. The firſt fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angell foretold that they were neere, now Chriſt is cleerely to ſhew himſelfe: by ſhewing, hence, <hi>The ſigne of the ſonne of Man in heauen.</hi> The ſpeech is from <hi>Iſai 19. 1. Behold the Lord rideth on a ſwift cloude.</hi> Hee hath, with a ſharpe ſikle, a crowne: to ſhew him to be the Lord both of Harueſt and Vintage. For he not onely gathereth <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 30. Iſa. 63. 3.</note> the Saints, but alſo the Tares in bundles: and treadeth the Winepreſſe of God his wrath: and in both, he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth &amp; ouercometh, Chap. 6. The other, comming out of the temple, is the type of Saints &amp; faithfull ones, whoſe habitation is in the Temple, out of which they are now bold to ſtep out and be ſeene: and perceiuing the ripenes of the Harueſt (whereto it was not yet come in the fifth Seale, and therefore, this execution, craued of them then, was delaied) and yet not being able, in that weake eſtate of the Goſpell reuiuing, for ſo great a worke: (therefore it is that this Angell hath no ſikle) they beſeech the Lord of the harueſt to put too his hand, and <hi>Haue mercy on Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For <hi>the time to haue mercy, for euen the ful time is come. The harueſt of the earth is ripe, and the reſt of the Saints ſlaine.</hi> Neither is this thus expreſſed, as if euen then, or at any time, Chriſt did not worke by inſtruments: but to ſhew the beginnings; ſuch, as, in reſpect of the greatneſſe of the worke, and little humane aide, it was in a ſort, Chriſt his owne arme which helped him. But in proceſſe of time, by the powerfull progreſſe of the Goſpell, hee getteth to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2565:87"/>
himſelfe miniſters of executing his wrath, euen out of the Temple, furniſhed with conuenient weapons. And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this, in the Vintage, the Actor commeth out of the Temple hauing a ſharpe ſikle: as Chriſt, betime got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and daily raiſeth of his owne faithfull ones fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inabled and furniſhed with power to execute his iuſt iudgements againſt the enemies: <hi>To doe to her as ſhee hath done to vs, and to render her double.</hi> For this it is, that this ſecond Actor hath theſe different notes from the firſt. He ſitteth not; he is not crowned; and he commeth out of the Temple. So then, this Angell is the generall type, in this ſummary propoſition, of that ſame, whereof the ſeuen Angels are, in the large explication, Chapter 15. As is moſt cleere by comparing the Angell, ſtirring this to execution, with that one of the foure beaſts, furniſher of the Vials to the ſeuen Angels, Chapter 15. This laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer, hath this common note with the former two Angels, that he commeth out of the Temple: but this he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that he came from the Altar. So then, he is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Altar, by alluſion, ſtill to the Temple and Legal worſhip.

Whereupon the gracefull condition of the Bride victorious, is magnifickly ſet downe, Chapt. 21. and 22. This whole matter, is that other great ſigne ſeene in heauen: to diſtinguiſh this part of ſtory, from the preceding in the laſt three Chapt. called alſo a ſigne in heauen.

            <p n="2">2 In this Chapter, from the beginning to the fifth verſe, is ſet downe the greatneſſe of the erand: thence to the end, the diſpoſing of the inſtruments for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: the greatneſſe of the matter, is firſt ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily proponed in this, that hee ſaw a ſigne, a great, yea, a maruellous ſigne, and, in heauen. That Chap 12. was a great ſigne; but this is both great and wonderfull:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2565:88"/>
euen <hi>the ſigne of the ſonne of man in heauen.</hi> This great wonderfulneſſe, is ſhewed in the Miniſters, Angels: their number, ſeuen; their imployment, to bee executors of God his laſt wrath, for finiſhing of the myſterie, Chapt. 10. For his ſpirit would no longer ſtriue with men, verſ. 1. Next in the effect and end of their worke, to the 5. verſe. Which are, the deſtruction of Antichriſt: that the Saints, victorious ouer him, may praiſe God; and by the greatneſſe, equity, and truth, of his iudgements <hi>manifeſted,</hi> all men may feare, glorifie, and worſhip him, who onely is holy. For expreſſing of this effect and end, the Church and her condition, in, and vpon this executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to follow, (ioyfully vpon ſight of the inſtruments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, preco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing the certaine euent) is ſet down, in the victory and ſong thereof. In the victory, are the meanes whereby, and the party ouer whom. The meanes, are <hi>a glaſſie Seamingled with fire:</hi> the pure word of God mingled with the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, Chap. 4. The victory, is ouer the Beaſt, his image, his marke, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his name: to ſhew it now, full and perfit. In their ſong, are firſt, the quality, that it is a ſong of praiſe, for a maruellous deliuerance, and ouerthrow of a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: ſuch as <hi>Moſes,</hi> vpon ſuch a caſe, did ſing at the red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Secondly, it is in praiſe of the Lambe, through whom they obtaine this victory, and in whom the Father is glorified: and not in praiſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is the ſeruant of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3. Chapt. 22. 9. and 19. 10. Thirdly, their diſpoſition is noted, in that they haue the harpes of God, giuen by him, for his praiſe: that is, well tuned hearts, filled with ioy and loue, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his benefits, and burſting out in thankſgiuing. For hee onely putteth a new ſong in the mouthes of his ſeruants. Laſtly, the tenor of their ſong is in two: the praiſe of God his works and waies; and the ſequell ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The praiſe of his workes, is, that <hi>they are great and maruellous:</hi> according whereto, hee hath a competent title, <hi>Lord God almighty.</hi> The praiſe of his waies, is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2565:88"/>
that they are <hi>iuſt and true:</hi> and competently thereupon, he hath the title of <hi>King of Saints.</hi> In infinite authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power, yet to hold euer a iuſt and true way, is a great praiſe. Now, the ſequell hereof is, that he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be feared, gloriſied, and worſhipped of all. And that for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe he onely is holy, and not the Beaſt, who ſacrilegiouſlie busketh his head with that blaſphemie. Next, his iudgements are now <hi>made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt</hi> to all: ſo as, who before, worſhipped and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the Beaſt, as hauing none equall, or able to fight with him: now, in his iuſt and manifeſt ouerthrow, may know, and praiſe God only holy. For Chriſt now ſitteth <hi>on a white cloude</hi> iudging him. Compare this 4. verſe with the 7. of Chap. 14 and ſee what wiſdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Before wee enter in the ſecond part, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the inſtruments for this great execution: the interpretation giuen of the glaſſie Sea mingled with fire, is to be cleared.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That the glaſſie Sea is the type of the pure word, and pure worſhippe according thereto, ſee vpon the 4. Chap. Heere the alluſion is to that ſtorie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. and 14. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him hauing paſt the red Sea, ſtanding on the ſhore thereof, and ſeeing <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> and his hoſt drowned therein, they praiſe God, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the ſong of Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> Of this alluſion, while men marke not narrowlly all the points of conueniencie, the place is diuerſly miſtaken. Some taking this <hi>Sea ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with fire</hi> to be but the type of great troubles, thorow which the Church now hath eſcaped; according to the ſpeech <hi>Pſalm. 66. Thou haſt brought vs thorow water and fire.</hi> But this is not all whereto heere the ſpirit will lead vs. Others, take it for the treaſure of meanes, which God hath euer in readineſſe, as before his throne, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his enemies. But this is too generall. For here, a ſpeciall treaſure is meaned of the meanes, whereby, as Antichriſt is ouerthrowen and drowned, ſo God his Church is ſaued. And this is, the treaſure of the pure
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2565:89"/>
word of God, and power of his ſpirit mingled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For, we muſt all, be begotten of the word and of the ſpirit; and be baptized with water and with fire. And by this word and ſpirituall vertue thereof, muſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt bee foiled. As in the red Sea, the people of Iſrael were baptized, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. wherein <hi>Pharao</hi> was drowned. And as Iſrael was baptized vnder the cloude, which to them, was a pillar both of a cloud and of fire (of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and light) but to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> a pillar of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. In which reſpect, the red Sea, wherein, and the pillar, vnder which they were baptized, were types of the true word and ſpirit, whereby the true Iſrael of God are begotten to immortality, and the enemies ouerthrowen. So, by alluſion thereto, the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>victorious ouer An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and that great City, which ſpiritnally is called <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is ſaid to ſtand at a <hi>glaſſie Sea mingled with fire:</hi> that is, in the cleare light of the word mingled with the vertue of the holy Ghoſt; whereby they are victorious, and furniſhed with the harpes of God: but Antichriſt therein is drowned, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. From this Sea, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to diuert vs to ciſternes of their own digging, which are full of bloude. But heere, is our victory and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby to count the number of the Beaſt his name; and ſo, to ouercome him, his image, his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, name, and number. The Sea of the Fathers in a third part is bloud, Chapt. 8. So as thence, wee may (if wee bee not wiſe to diſcerne) draw death als well as life. The Sea againe of the Church of Rome, in latter ſtate, is all bloudy worſum, Chap. 16. This Sea, hath this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent note from that, Chapter 4. that this is mingled with fire. The fire is there alſo, but ſet out in ſeuen burning lampes diſtinct from the Sea: heere the fire is mingled therewith, and that of purpoſe, to leade vs to take vp a great point of wiſdome in the diuerſity of God his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in this laſt cleare light of the Goſpell, for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt his ouerthrow, from that firſt, in the Apoſtolike times, for caſting the Dragon on the earth. At the firſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2565:89"/>
going out of the Goſpell, to conciliat thereto the more credit, and to ſhew plainly whence the vertue, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it came, there was then a diſtinct diſpenſation of the ſpirit, in outward &amp; viſible ſignes, as clouen tongues, and fire: extraordinary effects and operations: as gifts of tongues, healings, and working of miracles: and by a ſingular and viſible manner of donation, as, impoſition of hands of the Apoſtles. But, in this laſt reuiuing of the Goſpell, the word ſhould be cleare and pure as at the firſt, and accompanied with the force of the ſpirit: yet the diſpenſation, donation, and operation of the holy Ghoſt ſhould not bee in that manner, but ſhould bee mingled with the word: the ſpirit and vertue thereof, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the preaching of the Goſpell; yet ſo, as no viſible or diſtinct ſymbol thereof ſhould bee as at the firſt, (for now, the preachers are feated by ſwallowing of the little booke, Chapt. 10.) no miraculous operations: finallie, no donation but ſuch as, with the word and by the word preached, the ſpirit ſhould worke in the Saints. So as miracles, in theſe laſt times, are no notes of true preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And this diuerſity of diſpenſation is exceeding wiſe, and requiſite for the times. At the firſt the Goſpell was not, onely to bee opened, to the world lying in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but alſo confirmed, to be from God. Now, it hath that credit with all; but beeing buried in ignorance, was to bee cleared. Neither muſt wee take this ſo, as if at firſt, the preaching of the Goſpell had wanted that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying vertue. For euen then it was not in <hi>words</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 20.</note> 
               <hi>but in power,</hi> and was <hi>mingled with fire.</hi> No doubt, but <hi>Iohn</hi> his doctrine and baptiſme, had with it the vertue of the ſpirit in thoſe that beleeued: for faith is the effect of this fire. And out of all queſtion, <hi>Apollos</hi> had the ſpirit in ſome good meaſure, when hee knew but the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And theſe Samaritanes, who by the preaching of <hi>Philip</hi> receiued the Goſpell and were baptized, had the ſpirit before the downe-comming of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> But at the beginning, were ioyned the viſible ſymboles,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2565:90"/>
donation, and miraculous effects of the holy Ghoſt, to procure reuerence and credit to the Goſpell, and to ſhew whence commeth all ſpirituall vertue, to faith or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion: and the outward healing of diſeaſes, to lead vs to know the power of the word and ſpirit, in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and life of the inward man, and curing ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Soule. Neither muſt wee imagine that now the ſpirite is ſo tyed to the word, as who euer heareth it, receiueth neceſſarily the ſpirit. For many heare whom it profiteth nothing, becauſe it is not mixed with faith: but <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> the gift of the holy Ghoſt is now no other way diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by the word preached: wee feeling the force thereof, but neither ſeeing whence it commeth, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 8.</note> it goeth. So, whatſoeuer ſpirit one pretend without <note place="margin">Iſai 59. 21.</note> the word, it is the ſpirit of errour.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now, how theſe Miniſters of the laſt wrath are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared to this great execution, is ſhewed from the fifth verſe to the end. And firſt, whence they are, 2. How diſpoſed, 3. Wherewith inſtructed, and by whom. 4. By what power it is, that ſo great a worke is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. They come out of the Temple of the Tabernacle of Teſtimony in heauen, now <hi>opened,</hi> that is, out of the true Church militant (this is implyed in the word Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) now made patent and viſible. This firſt note ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, both what they are, and of what time. They are members of the true Militant Church, who by the light of the Goſpell, the Church being reformed and opened, are ſtirred to the worke. For God turneth the hearts of Kings, who earſt gaue their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, and were his hornes; to hate now the Whore, and eate her fleſh, Chapter 17. For her fall ſhall not be by Kings of the Eaſt or Mahometans, but by reformed Chriſtians: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee ſee already good degrees, praiſed be the King of Saints. This note alſo pointeth the time of this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be in the dayes of the ſeuenth Trumpet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Oath, Chapter 10. Vpon the ſounding of which, Chapter 11. followed the opening of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

in heauen, and cleare ſight of the Arke of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and thereupon lightnings, thundrings, &amp;c. Now here, theſe ſeuen Angels, Miniſters of God his laſt wrath come forth of the Temple opened, and goe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Thus the ſpirit by cleare notes, leadeth vs to couple rightly the courſe of this Propheſie. Which, from the beginning hath ſo plaine a way, as all being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in ſeauen Seales, ſixe thereof bring the firſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,: the ſeuenth opened, yeeldeth ſeuen trumpets, whereof, ſixe bringing the ſecond euils: and theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but further induration, Chapter 9. The ſeuenth Trumpet ſounding, yeeldeth theſe ſeuen Angels with ſeuen Cuppes of the laſt wrath. Whoſe ſtorie by the narration, wiſely and exceeding purpoſely in the 12. 13. and 14. Chapters interiected, was till now delayed.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The diſpoſition of theſe Angels is ſhewed in their apparrell, which is linnen, and that both pure and bright, and girded to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a golden girdle about the breaſt.

But here in theſe Angels, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> garment hath a ſpeciall relation to their ſpeciall calling, To ſhew that this execution ſhould bee iuſt &amp; vpright, not only in reſpect of God the iuſt Iudge, whoſe <hi>wayes are iuſt and true,</hi> but euen in reſpect of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alſo, who in the light and aſſurance of faith, ſhould in the zeale of God and of his worſhip bring downe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. <hi>For bleſſed ſhall hee be called that rewardeth her as ſhe hath ſerued vs.</hi>

At the iudgements by the ſixe Seales, ſome cry was alwaies ioined to waken, if it had beene poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men to learne. The Trumpets ſounded loud, in ſixe of them God giuing <hi>Iezabel</hi> time to repent, Chapter 3. and 9. Hereupon obſtinate impenitency, out of golden bowles, wrath without noiſe is tumbled.

Chapter, when the Angell from the Altar ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power ouer fire, ſtirred the other to cut downe the grapes of the earth: the which ſame thing is here more largely explaned.

            <p n="9">9 The power, whereby this great execution is borne out, that it cannot bee ſtayed, is God his glorious and powerfull preſence in his owne true Church opened and

and lourdeſt of elements: as the earth is taken in the firſt verſe, all the Vials are powred on the earth, becauſe all are on the earthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antichriſtian Kingdome: in this other ſenſe of the earth, the firſt particularly, is powred thereon. The effect thereof is, that the filthineſſe, looſe life, hypocriſie, auarice, pride, ſymony, and other vices of the Clergy, and Church of Antichriſt, breake out to the view of the world (long blinded) as filthy boiles. The alluſion is to the ſixth plague of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where-tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Enchanters were no more able to ſtand before <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> This was the firſt degree of the fall of Rome, when God to make them deteſtable, diſcouered their ſores; ſo as theſe enchanting bewitchers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and could no longer abide the light. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of Story is moſt cleare: where by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers their auarice, pride and hypocriſie is highly excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt: Few daring yet challenge their doctrine and worſhippe: yet their perſons thus falling firſt in contempt, it made way to the next Cup. Now, as in the firſt Trumpet, contention and ſelfe loue ioyned with cruelty, like fire and haile mixed with bloud, caſt on the earth, made the firſt great degree to Antichriſt his riſing, by burning vp all true loue, life, and holy zeale of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: ſo, the firſt open degree of his fall, is by the cup of wrath powred on the earth, euen the diſcouery of their hypocriſie and filthineſſe, whereby they were ſeen to bee void of all true Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſecond Viall maketh a higher degree, in that not onely the perſons, who worſhipped the Beaſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his Gharacter, are for their ſilthineſſe, odious; but now, euen their common doctrine and ordinary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe becommeth vile and corrupted as bloody wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, deadly to all that drinke thereof, and abhorred of men, who in the cleare glaſſie Sea before the throne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceine the ſtinking rottenneſſe of this Aſphaltites. How after the contempt of the perſons for their abhominable filthineſſe; next, all their, worſhippe and doctrine of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2565:93"/>
reliques, indulgences, holy water, croſſings, ſoul-Maſſes, pilgrimages, proceſſions, inuocation of Saintes, baptizing of bels; magicall coniurations, forged mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, fooliſh Legends of lies, and the reſt of that ſea of rotten bloud beganne to ſtinke in the noſes of men, is more then euident: their whole worſhippe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſchoole Diuinity now ſtanding as the Sea of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Compare this Viall for kind and degree to the ſecond Trumpet.</p>
            <p n="5">5 By the third Viall, their riuers and fountaines of waters are turned into bloud. When by <hi>Moſes</hi> the floud and al ſtanks &amp; ponds of <hi>Egypt</hi> were turned into bloud, <note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> (for thereto in this and the former Viall the ſpirit allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) the Egyptians digged to themſelues wels to drink of. When in the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> through parching drought, all other waters failed, hee and <hi>Obadiah</hi> ſeeke <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 5.</note> to the riuers and fountaines. So the common Sea of Popiſh worſhippe and doctrine becommeth vile: the laſt refuge, for preſeruing the liues of their Beaſts, is their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and fountaines, whereby their Sea is inriched, and which by kind ſhould bee more cleare and ſweet. But theſe are alſo made bloud, &amp; that in two reſpects. Their riuers &amp; fountains are their great and learned Doctors, and grounds, whence theſe as riuers carry waters, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſprings, to ſweeten if it were poſſible that rotten ſea. But howſoeuer, in ſome outward degree they apeare to haue ſome more freſhneſſe; yet they are but bloud, and to drinke of them it is deadly. They labour much to excuſe and maske the groſſe rottenneſſe of their ſea, and to ſweeten it with eloquence, aide of Arts and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: and yet all is bloud. They buſie themſelues to bring warrands from the Fathers: but almoſt, all from that third part of that ancient ſea, which in the ſecond Trumpet was made bloud: and from theſe fountaines &amp; riuers which in the third Trumpet were for the third part made bitter and mortall. And what cleare &amp; ſweet water might both from Scripture &amp; Fathers be brought
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2565:93"/>
for cure of their Sea, they by falſe gloſſes wreſted inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, cuttings, and caruings turne all into bloud. The ſecond reſpect, in which their riuers and fountaines are ſaid to become bloud, that wee ſhould not miſſe to take vp, the Angell executer, praiſeth God his iuſtice therein, and another from the Altar (a ſure teſtimonie from Chriſt himſelfe) confirmeth his ſaying. And this double teſtimony both of the executers and miniſters of the Altar, true Paſtors encouraging to execution, ſo <note place="margin">Chap. 14. 10.</note> warranteth the equity of this point, that men need not bee remiſſe or ſtayed with any faint doubts, from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this iuſt worke. And certainely the Spirit in this double proclamation of God his iuſtice herein, ſeemeth in diuine wiſdome to haue foreſeene and foreſhewed the faintnes of men in this ſo approued an errand. The point is, becauſe their riuers and fountaines, euen their head-Clergie men, entertainers, nouriſhers, and vpholders of all that ſtinking ſea, haue beene bloody murtherers of the Saints and Prophets, and occaſioners of all bloud-ſhed in the earth (the Whore Chapter 17. being drunke with the bloud of Saints, and all the bloud of the earth being found in her, Chapter 18.) Therefore the Lord in <note place="margin">Obadiah 16. Iſai 49. 26. &amp; 51. 22. 23.</note> his iuſtice, now giueth them bloud to drinke, euen mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for meaſure. And the Cuppe that ſhee filled to vs, ſhee now taſteth in her courſe. Wherein is performed what for conſolation was ſpoken, Chapter 13. <hi>If any kill with a ſword, he muſt be killedby a ſword.</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this wee haue in ſome meaſure ſeene, and dayly ſee, in ſuch Countries wherein the Lord hath raiſed the light of his Goſpell, while their continuall conſpiracies and tteaſons againſt the ſtates and liues of Princes, compell men (otherwiſe, but prepoſterouflie pittifull, and for all this double denounced warrant of the equity of the worke, but too ſlow) to giue them the due recompence of their bloudy practiſes. But the effect hereof will bee ſtill more and more perceiued. For there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2565:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be no end of their tragicall attempts, till that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtate be deſtroyed for euer. Theſe are the Martyrs, the Church of Rome can glorie of. Here a diuiue artifice of the ſpirit is not vnworthy the marking: that as in expreſſing the firſt ſuffetings of the church by the dragon Chapter 12. who giueth his power, throne, &amp; authority to the Beaſt, alluſion was to the condition of the olde Church in <hi>Egypt:</hi> ſo here in the firſt degrees of finall wrath, alluſion is to the plagues there. Like as in the Chapter 15. vpon preception of the laſt degree, the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſung at the glaſſie ſea.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The fourth Viall is on the ſunne; whereby the beaſt his marked ones are plagued: the cleare light of the Goſpell (ſhewing Chriſt the ſun of righteouſneſſe) now ſo ſhining, as in place of glorifying God by repentance, and acknowledging of their errors and workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they as the Children of darkeneſſe, and hating the light, whereby their workes are reproued, boile in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefull rage, and are burnt vp with enuie and malice, as <note place="margin">Iohu 3. 20. Eph. 5. 13.</note> were the Phariſies at Chriſt his cleare doctrine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent myracles: and that <hi>Stephen</hi> hauing his face like the Sunne. And they blaſpheme God in blaſpheming his <note place="margin">Act. 7. 54.</note> truth, and true Church; ſpeaking euill of the way of righteouſneſſe: their deſperate rage ſtill increaſing as the light groweth, becauſe induration in impenitency is a common effect of all theſe plagues. In that, ſhowſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God hath his owne ſingle ones to pull out of that Kingdom, yet the body is not reclamable, but muſt goe to deſtruction. Compare this with the fourth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. The light of the Goſpel is a plague and torment to the reprobate world, as the two witneſſes, Chapter 11 were a vexation. Here the firſt effect of this Vial is rage, the ſecond blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The firſt is on the throne of the Beaſt, that is, on his Kingdom, as the next words interpret, and as the whole frame of Scripture ſpeech euinceth. The throne
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2565:94"/>
of <hi>Dauid</hi> is for his Kingdome. The Throne is eſtabliſhed: for the Kingdome is eſtabliſhed. Satan his throne, Chap. 2. &amp; 13. for his kingdome. The firſt effect heere of is, their kingdome loſeth the glory, luſtre, pompe, and wonted eſtimation, and becommeth contemptible. Whereupon the ſecundarie effect followeth, in them, of deſperate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, expreſſed by a geſture of men, extremly grieued. <hi>Gnawing their tongues:</hi> and obdnration in impenitency and blaſphemy, their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ores by the light of the ſunne being more and more laid open, and thereby their ſorrow aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. For their workes, ſee Chapter 9. And withall, conſider what a wiſe and iuſt retribution. As, by falling from heauen to the earth, and from being ſtarres of light to become miniſters of darkeneſſe, they opened the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, and let out darkeneſſe, by the ſmoake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of eclipſing all true light, and ſo erecting the kingdome of darkeneſſe. So heere, by the cleere ariſing light of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe, all the earthly and worldly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Kingdome becommeth contemtible, and is darkened. And as, by the doctrine of darkeneſſe, they, like Scorpions, ſtinging men, tormented their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſo the light op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned, and diſcouering their treachery, tormenteth them with anguiſh and ſorrow. This effect, both firſt and ſecondary, we ſee already in great part, but ſhall yet ſee more. For, albeit theſe plagues heere, haue their owne degrees for order of working, yet ſtill the former hold on with the ſubſequent, till all together, in the ende, bring finall deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The ſixth viall is notable in many circumſtances. It is poured on <hi>Euphrates:</hi> the effect is, drying the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof. This effect is for a ſpeciall end, that the way of the Kings of the Eaſt may be prepared. Againſt this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and apparent ſequell thereof, a great endeauour is ſhewed, and the euent thereof. The endeauour, is of the principals, <hi>Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet,</hi> by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, (a peſtilent broode, and well reſembling their origine) <hi>foule ſpirits, and ſpirits of Diuels:</hi> ſo is their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2565:95"/>
Their dealing is, to goe to the Kings of the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſtrangers from heauen, whom they may perſwade impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely cronting like frogges, night and day in their eares. Their force of perſwaſion is, by working ſignes, thus to ſhew them to bee faſe Prophets, ſeducing. The ende of this their endeauour, is to gather theſe earthly Kings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their purpoſe, to vphold their tottering King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now threatning a fall: and to impede the apparant effect to which this Viall maketh preparation: but which God ſhall turne to an other fine then they purpoſe: euen to be glorified in their iuſt deſtruction, as the euent proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Now, both in reſpect of the great danger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and miſled by theſe frogs, and of the great day of God his wrath, to come on them (ſo much the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous, as it ſhould come like a thieſe in the night) warning is giuen to watch, and hold the true faith: whereby, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Chriſt, and girding him to vs as with a golden gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, we be not found naked, and ſo aſhamed, but bleſſed through our garment. The euent of all this their buſie trauell is expreſſed in this, that they gathered them to a place called in <hi>Hebrue Armageddon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 Now, becauſe for the moſt part, the effect and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels of this Viall are yet to come: in ſeeking the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, we muſt walke warily, as the light of holy writ may leade vs. <hi>Euphrates,</hi> properly, is that great Riuer whereon <hi>Babylon,</hi> properly ſo called, did ſtand, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it ſerued for beauty, commodity, and fortification. It was alſo the march bordering <hi>Dauid</hi> his kingdome on the Eaſt, ſeparating, and in a manner debarring the Eaſterne peoples therefrom. To both theſe conſiderations, in this alluſion, the ſpirit hath reſpect. In the 51. of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hee threatneth that he will <hi>dry vp her waters.</hi> Thence, hither, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ſpeech is brought. In the next Chapter, the whore <hi>Babylon,</hi> is ſaid to ſit <hi>on many waters.</hi> Which are interpreted, <hi>Kings, Nations, Peoples, and Tongues.</hi> To ſhew, in great dominion and authority,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2565:95"/>
great dignity and ſtrength. The drying vp then of her wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is the decay of her authority, dominion, glory, and power, by the ſubſtraction of theſe from her obeience, in whom was her ſtrength and fortification. Euen that ſame, which Chapter 17. is expreſſed by <hi>eating her fleſh and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her naked.</hi> Thus, fitly for this reſpect, and yet more for the ſecond, the drying of <hi>Euphrates</hi> is heere mentioned, in a depth of wiſdome: to ſhew, how that Riuer borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> on the Eaſt, and ſet betwixt the Eaſterne Kings and the bleſſed land, being dried vp, the Kings of the Eaſt, ſhould therethrough haue eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe thereto: the debarring impediment being remoued. The ſenſe is. As Antichriſt his riſing was the occaſion of darknes, and defection from the Goſpell to <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> in the Eaſt and of the obſtinate abiding of Iewes (who are moſt part in the Eaſt, and whom ſpecially heere the ſpirit pointeth at, as the euent cleareth) in their infidelity: and as the greatneſſe and power of Antichriſt ſtill debarreth both, from embracing the Goſpell, as <hi>Euphrates</hi> flowing ouer all his bankes, and ſo letting all free paſſage to the Kingdome of <hi>Dauid:</hi> both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> through the ſuperſtition, idolatry and corruption of the Romiſh Church, abhorring Chriſtianity: ſo now, her waters being with the heat of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe dried vp, an open way ſhall bee prepared for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Goſpell. I know, how ſome, from the ſtory of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> King of the Eaſt, diuerting the courſe of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſo ſurpriſing <hi>Babylon,</hi> thinke this alluſion taken, to ſhew how myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall in like manner, be deſtroied by Eaſterne Kings.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2565:99"/>
The conuerſion of the Iewiſh people, by cleare warrant of Scripture, wee looke for. And that, not onely of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons, now and then, heere and there: but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that the body of that people ſhall ſolemnedly turne, to the great admiration of the world, and praiſe of God his both wiſdome and mercy. This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretell clearely: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> moſt plainely; yea the Lord himſelfe, in the prediction of their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. limitteth the time of their being trode vnder, <hi>till the fulneſſe of the Gentils bee brought in.</hi> Which ſelfe words, the Apoſtle vſing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth clearely the Lord his meaning. It is a wonderfull prouidence, that the Iewes, fifteene hundreth yeeres, not poſſeſſing one foot of property in the earth, yet are kept a ſeparate people, that in his owne time the Lord may be magnified in his mercy and truth, towards them, to the aſtoniſhment of all the world. That the great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances promiſed them in the Prophets, haue all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in Chriſt, it is certaine: but whereof, that the full accompliſhment commeth not til their ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, it is euident, by the Prophecies cited and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the Apoſtle, to that purpoſe. Now, whether they ſhall be brought to inhabite againe their owne Land, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I dare not determine: becauſe (it beeing typicall) all, promiſed theranent, may be performed in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction to the Church, which is the true Ieruſalem from heauen: yet certainely, my heart inclineth to thinke ſo. Becauſe their ſolemne conuerſion muſt bring with it, the remoouing of their reproach, and ſo, of neceſſity, a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering from their diſperſion, to brooke a ſtate in the eies of the world. And the Lord his owne words, limitting their beeing trode vnder foote ſeeme to implie no leſſe: <hi>O the deepeneſſe of the riches both of the wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God!</hi> The Iewes, miſconceiuing the Prophets, are ſtrengthened in their error of Meſſias yet to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thinke, that before his comming, the Roman Empire muſt be vtterlie deſtroyed; which now ſtandeth

So much the more as in place of his idolatrous ſuperſtition (whereat they now ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) done away, they ſhall ſee the purity of true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip erected.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The ſeuenth and laſt Viall is poured in the Aire. The effect whereof is ſummarilie, in one word denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and then typically declared. The denunciation is great: firſt for the authority, as beeing not onely from the Temple, but alſo from the throne in it, euen God his owne voice. And next, for the weight of the matter; that now, <hi>all is done.</hi> Not as if in that inſtant all things were accompliſhed; but, by pouring out of this Viall the ſigne beeing giuen, to ſhew that in the daies thereof all ſhould be finiſhed according as Chap. 10. was ſowrne. Neither is this to bee taken for the laſt conſummation, as neither is <hi>the great day of God almighty</hi> in the former Viall, for the laſt day: any time of God his great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, beeing in Scripture ſpeech ſo called ordinarily. But heere it is ſaid <hi>to be done.</hi> Becauſe now at laſt, God is by this plague to deſtroy all enemies of his Church, and beautifie her with peace, liberty, and plenty of grace: ſo as all whatſoeuer by the Prophets hath bene foretold and promiſed of either, ſhall now haue the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. The Church beeing freed of all troubles, and hauing but to expect her bridegroome, for whom now ſhee ſhall bee prepared.

ſeuen Vials, called of Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 24. the ſigne of the ſonne of man,</hi> ſhall haue paſt before.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This great effect, thus ſummarily in one word denounced, is declared by continuall allegorie. When the Aire is cleere and quiet, all, both ſea and land, riuers, fountaines, and heauenly lights, are calme and ſhine cleere. But, the Aire beeing troubled, all heere below is troubled, and for their vſe toward vs, the heauenly lights are alſo darkened: and theſe fearefull effects of <hi>thundrings, lightnings, voices, &amp;c.</hi> ordinarily do follow. Hereby, the ſpirit will expreſſe an vniuerſall and horrible commotion and alteration of the ſtate of the earth; which in one word hee calleth an earth-quake: yea and that ſo ſtrange and huge, as the like was not ſince men inhabited the ſame. It was a great earth-quake (that is alteration and viciſſitude of things) when vpon ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixth ſeale, the ſtate of the Roman Empire was ſhaken, and in the ſixth head, receiued a deadly wound. But in the ouerthrow of Antichriſt, the Beaſt going to deſtruction, when the cured head and Beaſt quickned, therein againe, ſhall be ſlaine and deſtroyed: there ſhall be another kind of commotion and alteration of the ſtates of the world. So as, who ſeeme beſt fenced and hedged from all perill, as Ilands; and who ſeeme ſtronglieſt ſtabliſhed in greatneſſe &amp; ſtrength, as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; ſhall flee away, and bee ſo vndone, as they ſhall bee found no more. And ſo, it is no maruell that this alteration ſhall bee conioyned with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plagues and iudgements vpon the wicked, like <hi>haile from heauen of a Talent weight:</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, remaine indured againſt God, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme ſtill.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The effect of this earth-quake, is declared to bee on the ſtate of Antichriſt and his aiders; vnder the names of <hi>the great City diuided in three; the Cities of Nations falling.</hi> Wherein, <hi>great Babel is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and rewarded.</hi> The Nations did tread vnder
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2565:100"/>
foot <hi>the holy Citie,</hi> Chapt. 11. And heere their Cities fall. In the ſtreets of the <hi>great City</hi> God his Prophets they murthered, vnburied and mocked <hi>three daies and a halfe.</hi> Heere, that great City is diuided in <hi>three.</hi> And ſo, that bewitching <hi>Babel,</hi> whoſe fall was denounced, Chap. 14. now commeth to ruine. For, by all theſe, that one ſtate is meaned; but that, with her fall, ſhall be conioined the fall of many great kingdomes, and all the face of the earth ſhall be altered. Which, beſides the reaſon of her greatneſſe, is yet the leſſe wonderfull for this, that with her fall ſhall come on, the conuerſion of the Iewes and orient with them, and apparantly by them. The ſubſequent Chapters, wherein this is more amply ſet foorth, maketh the matter cleare. Now what particularly is meaned, by renting of the great Citie in <hi>three,</hi> till the euent declare it, I dare ſay no more, but that apparently it ſheweth the ouerthrow and diſſipation of all the ſtrength of that State: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the ioyned power, counſell, and working of <hi>three.</hi> The Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, verſe 13.

            <p n="4">4 In the action of diſpoſing <hi>Iohn</hi> to the perception of theſe things, are the Inſtrument and his endeauour.

6 To <hi>Iohn</hi> thus prepared, appeareth the viſion of a woman ſitting on a beaſt, and properties of both. Of the Beaſt his properties wee will ſpeake in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the viſion which the holy Ghoſt himſelfe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. The woman is glorious in all worldly pompe, and royall magnificence, whereby ſhee dazeleth the eyes of men; ſhee is a moſt abhominable Harlot, prouoking to deteſtable Idolatry and ſuperſtition, and in place of the healthſome waters of life, propining her owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and deuiſes (for <hi>ſtollen waters are ſweet)</hi> which in deteſtation thereof, the holy Ghoſt here nameth by an <note place="margin">Ier. 51. 7.</note> abhominable name, This ſhee doeth vnder faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes, deceiuing with a golden Cuppe. Shee is an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent profeſſed Harlot, and mother harlot of the world; and yet with ſuch deepe ſubtlety couering her practiſes, as none ſhall read that which is openly written on her fore-head, but the lightned by the ſpirit, to finde out the myſtery. For ſhee is like that adulterous woman, Prou. 30. 20. <hi>which eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſayeth ſhee hath done nothing.</hi> Finally, ſhee is a cruell murthereſſe of Saints. Shee ſitteth on the Beaſt, as borne vp by him, and hauing all this glory and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to deceiue, onely through that credite and eſtimation which ſhee hath by the Beaſt her aduancer.</p>
            <p n="7">7 This viſion worketh in <hi>Iohn</hi> admiration, yet not ſuch as was that Chapter 13. of them who admire and follow the Beaſt, and that hereafter verſe 8. but no the leſſe hauing mixed with it ſome ſuch infirmity as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a wakening of him from a vaniſhing aſtoniſhment, wherein many lie benummed in theſe our dayes, who <note place="margin">Cap. 14. Sect. 3 Abac. 1. 5. Act. 13. 31.</note> yet wonder not the firſt wondring. This effect of the viſion occaſioneth the Interpretation. Firſt, of the Beaſt who is ſummarily deſcribed ver. 8. and after more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exponed in the interpretation of the heads and horns. His ſummary deſcription is by his ſtable and yet varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, which in thoſe who are not written in the booke of life, worketh ſuch admiration as was that,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2565:102"/>
Chapter 13. This Beaſt then in ſome ſort and reſpect, had beene before that time, wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeth him, and in ſome reſpect and condition was euen then, albeit not as it was before, neither as it ſhould be thereafter: and was yet to come in a different reſpect &amp; condition from either. And as it was yet to come (which is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and time, wherein, here it is to bee taken and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) it hath two remarkeable notes. One is, that it ſhould <hi>ariſe out of the bottomleſſe pitte,</hi> which albeit in ſome ſort it may bee ſaid of all wicked powers, yet it is in a ſingular manner proper to Antichriſt, Chapter 9. and 13. the Vicar of the Dragon his kingdome, the Angell of the bottomleſſe pitte, the aduerſary, the man of ſin, and ſonne of perdition. His other note is, that <hi>hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deſtruction:</hi> whereof hereafter.</p>
            <p n="8">8 This deſcription, ſo obſcurelie proponed, as in a ridle, the Angell moſt clearely openeth in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the heads and hornes: ſo as it is maruell why any ſhould ſeeke after any other ſenſe of the Angels words, then that which himſelfe giueth.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Firſt then the heades are both ſeuen hilles, on which the woman ſitteth, and alſo ſeuen Kings. The firſt is ſo cleare a note of Rome as Grammarians know it, and both are put here iointly, for cleare demonſtration what ſtate hee pointeth at; as alſo to ſhew that the heads of that ſtate (as they are Kings) muſt onely bee taken of ſuch as alwayas held that City, and not of ſuch as are, or were heades in bare title, neither abiding in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor making it great and glorious by their power, ſuch as were the Grecian Emperours after the fall of the weſterne Empire. And much more ridiculouſly ſince, the Kings of <hi>Germany,</hi> bearing the title of Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, while they haue not one foot within <hi>Italy:</hi> yea, &amp; of all Princes, who now domine within the compaſſe of the olde Romane dition, brooke the ſmalleſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and whatſoeuer either now be or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Title of other yet ſeeing the Beaſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2565:103"/>
bearing vppe the woman, maketh her glory and grandeure; none can bee eſteemed for heades now, but theſe, by whome ſhee retaineth her credite, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and pompe. Neither are Kings here to bee taken for ſo many perſons, but for ſo many kinds of ſoueraign gouernments, in courſe, ruling that ſtate, according to the knowne frame of Hebrue ſpeech. Now, in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe ſeuen Kings, hee doth interprete the former darke ſpeech, and leadeth vs euen by the hand, to the <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 17.</note> time, and that ſtate and condition of Rome in time, which here properly is the Beaſt bearing the Whore.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The Beaſt had been in a ſort, in the fiue heades who were fallen. It was euen then, in reſpect of the policy at that time ruling: but as the Beaſt here is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and ſpecially to bee vnderſtood, that is, as by him Rome becommeth <hi>the great whore,</hi> hee was yet to come. The fiue fallen were Kings, Conſuls, Dictators, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirs, and Tribunes. <hi>Caeſars</hi> the ſixt head ruled in <hi>Iohn</hi> his dayes. A ſeuenth was to come, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not the Beaſt, or head making this beaſt, as here it is ſet downe. For that head was ſoone to euaniſh: but the eight head in number, and which in a ſort, is <hi>one of the ſeuen,</hi> hath here peculiarly the name of this beaſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Of this head, three things are noted. Firſt, that hee is the eighth in number and order. Secondly, that yet in a ſort, hee is one of the ſeuen: to ſhew, how not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that eight are here counted, it ſtandeth yet true, that the Beaſt had but ſeuen heads. Not that it was one, and the ſame properly; but for viue reſemblance, Chapter 13. As making vp the image of the Beaſt by cure of the deadly wound, and bringing kingdomes &amp; prouinces in als great ſubiection to Rome by the cup of fornication, (thus bearing vp the Whore) as did earſt the former heads by force of Armes: ſo it is both the eight, and in a ſort the ſixt, wherein the Beaſt had got a deadly wound, which this head cureth. For the liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in Monarchie, ſtate, lawes, rites, veſtments,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2565:103"/>
&amp;c. Read the donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Steuchus</hi> in defence of it. This eighth head then is the Pontificality by which Rome is extolled and borne vp to be a <hi>Queene and Lady of Kingdomes,</hi> bewitching the world: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the ſummarie ſpeech, he had ſaid that <hi>the Beaſt was to come,</hi> and ſeeing ſeuen heades had onely beene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Beaſt, whereof none of the ſixe could be hee (as he is here proponed) leſt hereby we ſhould thinke that of neceſſity the next head after <hi>Caeſars,</hi> being the ſeuenth, behoued to bee this Beaſt (the Antichriſt:) the Angell in great wiſdome and plainneſſe pulleth vs from that thought, in ſhewing that one was then to come, who yet was not hee; for that ſhould ſoon bee gone: but the eighth and laſt ſhould bee this Beaſt. I ſhewed on the 13. Chapter, that the ſeuenth head was the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Oſtrogothes:</hi> to whoſe King <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> the Emperour of the Eaſt, with aduiſe of Senate, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bequeathed Rome and Italy, <hi>&amp; ſacro texit velamine,</hi>

               <hi>in Signum reiab imperio conceſſae:</hi> and who of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans was receiued as their lawfull Prince, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Succeſſors raigned ouer it many yeeres: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, was both peace and friendſhippe betwixt them and the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> all the dayes of <hi>Zeno, Anaſtaſius,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtinus.</hi> The third note of this eighth head, called peculiarly the Beaſt bearing the Whore, is, that <hi>hee goeth to deſtruction.</hi> And in this, hee is alſo ſingular from all former heads, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they all did fall, yet the beaſt in ſome ſort remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the State and credite of the Kingdome abode in ſome degree in the ſubſequent heades. But this eighth head ſhall draw that whole ſtate with him to vtter and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ruine, and this is that which Chapter 19. is meaned, where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are taken, and both caſt in the Lake.</hi> Whereupon many fondly imagine, that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet bee two diuers. But this is it which the ſpirit would ſhew vs, that the falſe Prophet who is the head ſhall ſo fall, as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2565:104"/>
the body of the ſtate and Kingdome ſhall periſh with him. For none ſhall bee able to cure his wound, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue any image of that ſtate againe, as he did the wound of the ſixth head. So then, taken abſolutely, this Beaſt is Antichriſt, that is, the Pontificality raigning ouer <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the eighth head the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificality. When the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, it is but for explication, to ſhew the ſtate or Kingdome, and who is head of it. And thus I ſhew, that Chapter 13. were the firſt and ſecond Beaſt to bee vnderſtood, as by this place is euident, where the firſt Beaſt is onely mentioned, and peculiarly called the <hi>eighth head,</hi> who is alſo one of the ſeuen, and not the ſeuenth as moſt part make him: for ſo the ſpirit had more eaſily called him the <hi>eighth and ſeuenth,</hi> then one of the <hi>ſeuen,</hi> but that hereby hee would lead vs to know which of the ſeuen hee is ſaid in a ſort to be. How farre <hi>Theodoricus</hi> and his wiſe daughter after him laboured, <note place="margin">See vpon Chap. 13. Sect. 7.</note> that Rome might both recouer and hold her ancient glory and magnificence, albeit hee ſeldome made refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there: the Stories giue cleare Teſtimony. From the fall of the Gothike Kingdome, the growth, pompe, and eſtimation of that City hath onely been by the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificality, bearing it vp, and by ſemblance of the Lambe his hornes, procuring to it worſhippe of Nations. For otherwaies ſaith <hi>Steuchus,</hi> it had remained <hi>foediſſima bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, porcorumque habitatio.</hi> So as, ſince that time, to make any other the head or King of Rome, whereby ſhee had growth or honour, it is ridiculous, and againſt all eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſtory. The Grecian Emperours, except an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle title, neither made any abode in that City, neither euer durſt openly attempt any further power therin then it pleaſed the Popes to allow them. And ſuch of them as at times did exerciſe any therein, it was not onely by ſurpriſe vnder falſe ſemblance, &amp; preſence of peace: but their dealing alſo with it was in plaine hoſtility as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. So as in effect they were rather ſpoilers and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2565:104"/>
rifelers then bearers vp of her. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germane</hi> Emperours aduanced her, but as hornes of the Beaſt who beareth her vppe. Who, that hee might the better puſh with them at his pleaſure, hath ridiculouſly, fed them with idle titles, as hee doth his other hornes, whom he crowneth and decrowneth as he liſteth. But hee himſelfe is this Beaſt, bearing vp this harlot.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Thus are his heads. The hornes haue many diſtinct and cleere notes to ſhew the Beaſt, who, and of what time he is. Of their number, ſee vpon Chapter 13. Section 8. Firſt then, theſe hornes are crowned Kings: that inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Rulers, as Liuetenants, or Preſidents of Prouinces, bee not heere imagined. According to the condition of this Beaſt, vnder the former heads, who themſelues only were crowned and not their hornes. Secondly, their time of being is noted: that they were not as yet riſen, but were to come. Thirdly, they are not ſo many perſons in ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one Kingdome, but ſo many Kingdomes, which all at one time ſhould raigne, euen with the Beaſt, vnder the eight head. The Beaſt, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. with tenne hornes, hath no mention of heads: For that there, the hornes haue the conſideration of the heads of that Kingdome, wherein ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely ſhould raigne ſo many Kings. Heere (which ſome Interpreters ſhould haue better obſerued) this Beaſt hath both ſo many heads, and beſides, tenne hornes by all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſion to that: becauſe heere the hornes are not to bee conſidered as heads of the ſtate, ſignified by this Beaſt, or ſoueraigne Kings ruling it. Which, if the ſpirit had mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had not attributed thereto heads alſo, more then to that in <hi>Daniel.</hi> But the ſoueraigne policies being expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by heades, the hornes are put to expreſſe the ſtrength of this Kingdome, in ſo many props of her power: and that ſo cleerely is vttered by the Angell, as it is wonder what ſhould make men to miſſe of his meaning: while he telleth plainely, that they are Kings, <hi>Which ſhall receiue a Kingdome at one houre with the Beaſt.</hi> Which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the making them Kings of that ſame ſtate, which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2565:105"/>
by the Beaſt is ſignified: ſo confounding heads and hornes which the holy Ghoſt hath diſtinguiſhed ſo cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Fourthly, their ſubiection to the Beaſt ſhould bee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and with vniforme and free conſent: not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Armes, as was the ſeruitude of Nations to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but by the bewitching power of the cup of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and theſe deceiueable ſignes and wonders, Chapter 13. This is the vnity of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This note alſo euinceth cleerely, that theſe hornes are kingdomes voluntary ſubiecting themſelues to the pontificality and Roman Kingdome vnder him, and not ſo many ſucceſſiue Kings of any, much leſſe of that kingdome, to which they gaue their Kingdomes. Fiftly, they with the Beaſt, ſhould fight againſt the Lambe. But to their owne confuſion, for two reaſons. One, in the Captaine, who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> The other in his Army, who are <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led choſen and faithfull.</hi> Not that he needeth any army or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces to ouercome theſe hornes: but it is to ſhew, that their fighting againſt the Lambe ſhould bee in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Who yet ſhould ouercome in the ſtrength of their King, by whom they are effectually called, ſo, as their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling confirmeth to them their election, and that by true faith wrought in them, which is the victory wherewith they ouercome the world: reſting on their Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 4.</note> faithfull to him euen to the death. and this is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that which was ſaid, Chapter 13: 7. For that ouercomming of Saints was not abſolute either in degree or time: but onely the ſlaying of their bodies and bearing downe of truth for a ſpace, Chap. 11. &amp; 14. 12. Which, with them notwithſtanding, reuiued againe, not onely to the terrour of their aduerſaries, but alſo to their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Thus is the Beaſt bearer vp of the woman. Euen the ſame, whereof Chapter 13. but that proceſſe of time, in the progreſſe of iniquity, giueth him, now, two notes ſomewhat different from that. The one, is ſcarlet colour, for increaſe of cruelty, wherein, by this time, hee hath
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2565:105"/>
come to ſuch height, as, for that, he hath now the Dragon his owne colour. Who before this, a ſpace was let looſe, <note place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> the thouſand yeeres of his reſtraint being expired: ſo as for bloody rage, now this ſuffragant of his throne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arſt like a Pard, is all of a bloody colour: and the Whoore is drunke with the blood of Saints. The other note is, that where, firſt, he had but his head busked with the name of blaſphemy, he is now, for growth of impiety and of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegions vſurpation of diuine honour, full of names of blaſphemy. The head which at firſt was busked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, both waxing therein, and defyling alſo all the body. So as, now it is high time to come out of her. The Beaſt was, firſt, like a Pard; a cruell, yet a fraudulent <note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> beaſt, and leſſe horrible to behold: But afterward more violent and raging.</p>
            <p>The Whoore borne vp by this beaſt, is ſhewed here, firſt by her great dominion, touched in the beginning of this Chapter, and heere now interpreted. This dominion ſhee hath through the Beaſt, her bearer. Secondly, her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is heere ſummarily foretold, which at length is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the next Chapter. And thirdly, in proper and plaine termes is told who ſhee is. Euen, <hi>The City which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ouer the Kings of the Earth</hi> So plaine a circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Aduerſaries are aſhamed to denie it.</p>
            <p n="14">14 In her iudgement, are three things. Firſt, by whom it is. Secondly, what it is. 3. How it commeth on. It is, by the hornes of the Beaſt, who ſhall worke her ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. What it is, is ſhewed by a naturall order. They ſhall hate her: they ſhall leaue her deſolate, by defection from her, vpon ſight of her impiety and abominations: they ſhall make her naked, pulling from her, her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rents and clothing: they ſhall eate her fleſh, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on her ſpoile as ſhe was facted and growne great with the ſpoile of Nations: laſtly, they ſhall burne her with fire. Now, here, we muſt not imagine that all theſe kings, who haue giuen their Kingdomes to the Beaſt, ſhall at one inſtant reuolt: many ſtill cleauing to him till his laſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2565:106"/>
foile, after the Whore is burnt, and ſo made pertakers of his iudgement, Chap. 18. and 19. But the holy Ghoſt will tell vs, that her deſtruction ſhal be by theſe ſame king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and ſtates which haue drunken of her cuppe, and had beene the ſtaies of the Beaſt his kingdome, and ſo, of her magnificence. And, what is done of any of theſe, is ſaid, indefinitely of all. For, her deſtruction muſt bee by Weſterne Princes, that ſo, a way may bee prepared for the Eaſt to embrace the Goſpell. Heereof, in no ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, we ſee the execut. on begunne and well farre aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the laſt degree is comming on quickely. How this ſo ſtrange a caſe falleth; that, who were the hornes of her power, and her darlings committing fornication with her, ſhould now turne to be her haters and deſtroiers, is ſhewed, that it commeth by God his diſpoſition and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling prouidence: who, as in his iuſtice, hee gaue ouer theſe Kingdomes to the efficacy of error to beleeue lies, for not beleeuing the truth 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. So, in his owne time, when his iudgement therein was fulfilled, for hir iuſt deſtruction who had ſo bewitched the world, hee ſhould turne their hearts to hate her who had ſo long and vildely abuſed them. Conferre heerewith the 16. Chap. of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15 Laſtly, as I touched before, is told in ſo plaine termes who this Whoore is, that the Romans are forced to confeſſe it. <hi>Bellarmine lib. 3. de Pontifice, cap. 13. Ribiera</hi> vpon this booke. The <hi>Rhemiſhe</hi> doctours are ſo ſtraited, that ſeeking ſhifts, they againſt a cleere light bewray an euill conſcience. See their annotations on this place.</p>
            <p n="16">16 So then, by all the courſe of this Propheſie, yea and the Romans owne confeſſion, this is manifeſt that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Whoore. And ſo, by neceſſary conſequence, the ſeat of Antichriſt his kingdome. Whereby it is that ſhee is the mother of Whootedomes, and Lady of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: through herexaltation and being borne vp by the Beaſt. Neither ſhall euer the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> bee able, confeſſing, once <hi>Rome</hi> to be this Whoore, but of neceſſitie to grant
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2565:106"/>
alſo that the Beaſt muſt be the kingdome of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many of themſelues perceiuing the ineuitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, fall next, for exepting the Pontificality from this blot, to deſpute of the time. Some making <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the perſecuting Emperours, to be the Whoore: as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in the place aboue cited. But, ſhe is, ſo, the Whoore, and then, the Whoore, as, and when ſhee is borne vp by this Beaſt, which fooliſhly he diuideth. Others, reiourne this to a future time, when as Antichriſt ariſing, forſooth, <note place="margin">Rhemiſts'on this place.</note> ſhall poſſibly expell the Pope out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſit there. So, forgetting the long boaſted priuiledge of <hi>Peter</hi> his Chaire: and while they ſeeke to eſcape, ſnaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more; by granting that to be poſſible, vpon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged impoſſibility whereof, they long agoe builde al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But the holy Ghoſt, euidently, here ſpoileth them of all ſhift, by cleare demonſtration: Whereby, as Rome is cleared to be the Whore, and the kingdome of Rome to be the Beaſt: ſo are we led, as it were, by the hand, to the time when: and particular ſtate of that kingdome, wherein it is to be taken for the Beaſt, heere, and Chapter 13. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: and that by three infallible tokens. Firſt, by a full and perfect enumeration of al the heads (that is, ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſorts of Rulers) from the firſt beginning of that ſtate, to the laſt and vtter fall thereof: and therewithall telling vs, that in none of the fiue fallen before <hi>Iohn</hi> his time, is that ſtate, the Beaſt as he is heere vnderſtood, or, conſequently, <hi>Rome,</hi> the whoore: neither in the head then ruling, namely <hi>Caeſars:</hi> neither in the ſeuenth head, which, vpon the deadly wound of the Beaſt in the ſixth head, ſhould ariſe and ſoone euaniſh. But in the eight head, ariſing by cure of the wound, and in that reſpect, one of the ſeuen, which was to come out of the bottomleſſe pit, that kingdome is the beaſt vnder that head, the falſe Prophet. And therefore the Beaſt heere is peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate by that head.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The ſecond infallible taken is the ſingular and different manner of working of the Beaſt and Whoore, in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2565:107"/>
that ſtate and head, wherein, properly, the Beaſt is to bee holden for Antichriſt, from all the former: and ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, competent to the laſt head, as can in no way agree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the other. For the hornes in time of that head, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which that kingdome is peculiarly this Beaſt, are crowed Kings, and ſuch as are not ſubdued by violence or force of Armes, but willingly and with one conſent <hi>giue their Kingdomes to the Beaſt:</hi> being bewitched by the cup of fornication, and deceiued by lying ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnder pretence of the Lambe his hornes, Chapter 13. So as, then only the kingdome of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be holden by this beaſt, when it is vnder ſuch a head, as, by whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Rome</hi> be commeth the Whoore, that is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcher of the world by ſuperſtitious and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſignes and myracles, and pretence of Chriſtian pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and holineſſe. Not hauing or pretending ſo much, a power to ſlay mens bodies, as, by poiſonable errour, to ſting and forment their conſciences, Chap. 9. and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdomes in ſubiection, more by feare of conſcience then force of Armes. Which is properly to be the whoore. For, vnder al the former heads, <hi>Rome</hi> was rather a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring furie, then an inticing harlot: drinking more the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of al other Nations the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propining any to them. Neither were any peoples ſubiected to her willingly, but by compulſion and Armes. But then ſhe became the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, when vnder pretence of Chriſt his power, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the cup of fornication, ſhe made Kings, voluntarily and with one conſent, ſubmit their Crownes to her: ſo making vp the image of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p n="18">18 The third proper note and token is, this Beaſt <hi>goeth to deſtruction.</hi> For vnder this laſt head that ſtate and Kingdome muſt be vndone for euer: and ſhall not bee as in the fall of the former heads, when in the next ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it held place: but this head ſhall ſo fall, as with him he ſhall draw that ſtate to eternall ruine. In which reſpect, it is ſaid, Chapter 19. that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are both taken and caſt into the fire. Thus, for a moſt cleare
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2565:107"/>
opening of all this Propheſie, the Holy Ghoſt heere in this Chapter, hath ioined the Beaſt, Head and Whoore: and exponed ſo euidently in a huge wiſdome. To make vs ſee, that what Chapter 13. hee ſpake of two beaſts: what, through the booke, hee ſpeaketh diſtinctly of the Beaſt, and the VVhoore, <hi>Babylon:</hi> of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet: is all, but for cleare explication of Antichriſt. VVhat a King hee is: of what Kingdome: of what time, and manner of working: cleering the Kingdome, by the head: and both Kingdome and head, by the head City of their power: with euident and infallible notes to take vp the right time and condition of all. So as the Romans, mocking our incertainety, (as they thinke) whether the Beaſt, the VVhoore, or the falfe Prophet, bee Antichriſt, bewray but their owne ignorance, or malice, or both. For the Beaſt is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: but ſo, and then, as, and when the head is a falſe Prophet: vnder preſence of the Lambe his power making <hi>Rome</hi> the VVhoore, and bewitcher of the world. In which reſpect, the falſe Prophet is the Beaſt: the eight head and one of the ſeuen. And thus, the Beaſt is onelie Antichriſt, as the Beaſt is the eight head, euen the falſe Prophet. And the falſe Prophet is Antichriſt, but as he is the Beaſt that is head of the kingdome of Rome. And Rome is the VVhore, but as ſhe is borne vp by this Beaſt, the falſe Prophet. How plainely the holy Ghoſt telleth this, take vp in this argument.</p>
            <p n="19">19 That ſoueraigne policy, ruling in and ouer the City, ſituated one ſeuen hils, and, in <hi>Iohn</hi> his daies, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule ouer Nations: which in number and order is the eighth head or ſoueraigne policie, after the fiue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len before <hi>Iohn,</hi> the ſixth then ruling and a ſeuenth to come, but ſoone to euaniſh: which eight head reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, to the ſtate hee ruleth, the luff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

4 The equity of this great fall, is for bringing all the earth into the ſin of ſpirituall fornication; ſo making <note place="margin">Nahum. 3.</note> it guilty of wrath: and that ſo farre, as the greateſt Kings were beſotted with her. While ſhee by couetouſneſſe, and deceitfull efficacy of errour, ſo maketh merchandize of all men, as the miniſters of her abominations waxed Kings fellowes, ſwimming in all aboundance of wealth and carnall pleaſure. And therefore it is a iuſt thing with God, that ſhee who with falſe ſemblance, drew all the earth after her, ſhould bee now no leſſe abhorred, then is hell the dwelling of Diuels: that ſhe who was the darling of Kings, committing filthineſſe with them, ſhould now bee a receptacle of foule and filthie ſpirits: and ſhee who for frequent reſort and multitude of trade, was not only her ſelfe <hi>the Lady of Kingdomes,</hi> but alſo, made all her merchants rich, through her ſuperfluous luxury, ſhould nowe, become ſo deſolate and forſaken, as to bee the neſting place of all vncleane and hatefull birds.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The ſecond voice from heauen, amplifieth and cleareth theſe ſame points of certaine and inſtant perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, equity, and greatneſſe of her iudgement: that ſo, in the mouthes of two or three witneſſes, and from <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 6 &amp; 19. 15. Ioh. 8. 17.</note> heauen, the matter may be ſtable. And this is by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold exhortation to the Saints. 1. To forſake and come out of her, proper to ſuch, as at this time, ſhall yet be within her. So little reaſon hath ſhe at any time to glory in the number of the Beaſt his name. 2. To repay her with iuſt recompence. And. To reioice of her fall. The firſt, are ſtirred, firſt to come out of her, by argument of a manifeſt perill to the remainers, of being infected with the contagion of her ſinne, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, inuolued with her in the ſame iudgement. For ſociety in ſinne bringeth fellowſhip in wrath. Secondly, they are ſtirred to do it with diligence, both for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the iudgement, and preſent effuſion of wrath, which can haue no delay, in reſpect her ſinne is come to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2565:110"/>
the height, ſhee hauing ſo, ſtill heaped ſinne on ſinne, that her iniquity hath mounted to the heauens: ſo as <note place="margin">Ier. 51. 9. Ezr. 9. 6.</note> God, who for his patience and long-ſuffering, appeareth often to forget the waies of men, is now to poure out on her ſuch a full cup of wrath, as ſhall well witneſſe him to remember her ſinnes, and to bee a iuſt repayer of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus, as the exhortation to come out, by a voice from heauen, ſheweth the certainty of a preſent fall, like that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> was bid of the Angels to come out of her; and that of <hi>Babel</hi> properly, when by the <note place="margin">Iſai. 48. 28. &amp; 52. 11 Ier. 50. 8 &amp; 51. 6.</note> Prophets, the people of Iſrael were exhorted to come out of her and bee <hi>as the hee-goats of the flocke:</hi> ſo is both the greatneſſe of her deſtruction heerein implyed, like that of <hi>Sodom</hi> where was no remnant, and the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it is cleare, in the degree of her ſinne. The Angel whoſe voice Chapt. 14. ſucceeded the denouncer, there, of <hi>Babels</hi> fall, gaue ſharpe warning not to worſhippe the Beaſt, or receiue his character. But, now abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting <note place="margin">Ier. 50. 40.</note> of <hi>Babel</hi> is needfull, and euen the name and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are now dangerous. Wherefore, come out of her, and <hi>remember Lot his wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſecond point, whereto the ſecond heauenly voice exhorteth the faithfull, ſpecially the miniſters, of <hi>Babels</hi> fall, is to doe the worke of the Lord diligently: for negligence therein is accurſed; in all which, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, greatneſſe, and certainety, of her fall is ſhewed. For, what is more equall then retribution, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one receiue according to their worke? then, as they haue meaſured, that ſo it bee meaſured to them againe? what more iuſt, then who exalteth her ſelfe, that ſhe bee brought low? and that ſhee who hath wallowed in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and carnall delights, receiue torment and ſorrow? what more equall, then who preſumptuouſly, glorying in her greatneſſe and ſtrength, ſecurely promiſed to her ſelfe perpetuall ſtability, ſhe finde againe vnexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Now, how great againe, ſhall the fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> be, if ſhee receiue double for her waies; and that ſo
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2565:110"/>
much the more, as by the hands of theſe, whome ſhee hath highly wronged; therupon ſtirred in iuſt diſdaine againſt her? if ſhee be als farre preſſed downe, as ſhee <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> hath exalted her ſelfe, whoſe fall ſhall be like her fall? if ſhe receiue torment and ſorrow according to her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what torment and griefe ſhall bee comparable to hers? That this her iudgement is ineuitable, als wel as iuſt and great, is cleare in this, that it is <hi>God,</hi> euen that <hi>great Lord of heauen and earth that</hi> condemneth her: and who then ſhall abſolue her? wherein as the ineuitable certainety of her iudgement is euident, ſo is implyed the equity. For, <hi>ſhall the Iudge of the world iudge vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly?</hi> the greatneſſe alſo: for it <hi>is a hard thing to fall into the hands of the Lord: before whom all Nations are but as the droppe of a Bucket, or as the duſt of a Trebuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 For more clearing of her preſumption, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent glorifying her ſelfe, it is expreſſed in her owne ſpeeches, and her iudgement accordingly ſet downe: <hi>I ſit being a Queene, and am no widdow, neither ſhall I ſee</hi>

            <p n="8">8 Her iudgements here ſpecified are ſuch, as befall the moſt diſtreſſed in ſtrighteſt ſieges of Townes, when mortalitie, doole and famine, all iointly conſume, as it may perhaps fall that thus ſhee bee ſacked.

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:2565:111"/>
were a great relaxation to her griefe: but to ſhew two things. One, that her fall ſhall haue no turning, but from the time it beginne, ſhee ſhall fall ſtill till vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. The other is, that euen her laſt and ful deſtruction ſhall come farre againſt her expectation, <hi>in a day whereof ſhee ſhall not know the morning.</hi> For albeit ſhee feele al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Iſa. 47. 11.</note> her iudgement begunne, and in good degrees ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, ſo as they are gnawing their tongues for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: yet ſhe is ſtill as <hi>Iezabel,</hi> who vpon the very point of her laſt fall, painted her face, and looked as a Queene: <note place="margin">1.

            <p n="10">10 This great iudgement of the Whore is yet ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a liuely repreſentation of the mourning of her adherents vpon the ſight of her fall.

Thus the ſodain and ſtrange caſe breedeth aſtoniſhment. The ſmoake of her burning, and terrour of her torment bringeth feare: ſo as how grieued ſoeuer with her fall yet: they ſtand backe, not daring to helpe her. Their

To am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this occaſion of their griefe, the ſorts of wares are recounted, thereby ſhewing the wonderfull greatnes of her trade, by which her Merchants behoued to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, as hauing the trade of all nations, and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner goods from all parts. All that ſerueth for glorious and princely attire, as <hi>gold, ſiluer, pretious ſtones, pearles, fine linnen, ſilke, purple, ſcarlet:</hi> or for delightfull and ſumptuous pleniſhing, and fabricke, as <hi>Thymwood, veſſels of Iuorie, all veſſels of moſt precious wood, braſſe, yron and marble:</hi> or for pampering the perſon, and dainty faire, as <hi>Cinamon, odours, ointments, incenſe, wine, oyle, floure, wheat Cattell, ſheepe:</hi> or for royall and princely Port, as <hi>horſes, chariots, ſeruants.</hi> The decay of all which from her, and ſo the matter of her Merchants ſorrow is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp with a generall, of <hi>all that her ſoule luſted after, all fat and all pleaſant thing,</hi> vttered in a ſarcaſtik apoſtrophe to her ſelfe, for amplifying her fall, and argument of their ſorrow, ſo much the greater, as ſhee ſhould neuer reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her loſſes.</p>

This is the time denounced, Chapter 11. When the Lord <hi>rewardeth his Seruants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; &amp;c. Now they are deſtroyed, who deſtroyed the earth.

And by this reaſon they are ſtirred to ioy, as accordingly in their ſong, Chapter 19. they acknowledge. Not that God pouſſeth his Children to any corrupt affection, but with pure hearts to reioice for their owne deliuerance, and God his honour, in the ouerthrow of his and their foes, as <hi>Dauid.

            <p n="2">2 This Chapter, hath firſt, the ioy of Saints, in their ſong of praiſe: and next, the foile of the Beaſt. The ſong, for the forme, matter, and euent, is admirable. In the forme, are the ſingers, the ſtrange manner of ſinging, and the courſe or order of their ſong. The ſingers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe and degrees of the ſong, are three. Firſt, a great multitude in heauen, Secondly, the 24. Elders and 4. Beaſts. Thirdly, the voice of a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as the voice of many waters, &amp;c. Stirred thereto by a voice from the throne.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By the firſt, <hi>a multitude in heauen,</hi> by all the frame of ſpeech thorow this Propheſie, are ſignified the Saints in common. In whom all and generally, the deſtruction of the Whore, worketh this ioy which breaketh foorth in thankſ-giuing. Their manner of ſinging is, <hi>with a loude voice,</hi> both for their force of affection in them ſelues, and for the aduowed open proclaiming thereof before the world: and that, firſt in a generall and vncouth word, they praiſe God and ſtirre all others thereto: and next, they vtter ſpeciall points of praiſe, with the reaſons, wherein is the matter of the ſong.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The generall word is, <hi>Haleluiah,</hi> two well known Ebrew words, and of frequent vſe in the <hi>Pſalmes:</hi> but neuer till now, in all the new Teſtament recorded. And heere are put ſoure times, not for any ſpeciall holineſſe or

Which purpoſe and myſterie, to take vp clearely, the occaſion of this ſong, and courſe thereof, as orderly it goeth on, beeing compared with what at length wee ſpake vpon the ſixth Viall, Chapt. 16. will euidently lead vs. For, by the iudgement of the Whore, the way is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for theſe of the Eaſt; who, vpon the victory here enſuing ouer the Beaſt, ſhall celebrate the ſame, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the place in Ebrew <hi>Armageddon,</hi> and mourning the mourning <hi>of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Mageddon.</hi> And ſhall bee brought with vs Gentiles, to ſing <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah.</hi> As the courſe and matter of this ſong ſhew eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. But wee muſt not eſteeme, that this firſt <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> is ſung by the Ebrews, albeit it bee in Ebrew, to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs to aduert the myſtery. For this firſt <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> the Chriſtians of the Geutiles doe ſing: onely to ſhew the way now prepared, by the iudgement of the Whore, for them to come in, and concelebrate the victorie. Neither thus, ſo much, for any ſuch intention of the ſingers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that end, as that heereby, the ſpirit will ſhew, that the fall of the Whore, and loud praiſe of God, by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for it, ſhall in a degree, waken vp the Eaſt, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews principally, and ſhal ſerue for a great ſtep for them to come in to the Church. And yet an other greater ſtep is laide for them, and they more ſtirred, vpon the higher intending of this ſong by a ſecond <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingneſſe of her ruine. And yet more, by a <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiah</hi> of the Elders and Beaſts, falling downe <hi>and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him that ſitteth on the throne.</hi> Wherein, wee muſt take heede, that wee eſteeme not <hi>the multitude in heauen,</hi> and the <hi>Elders and Beaſts</hi> to be otherwaies diuers, then

in diſtinct conſideration, for the more cleare explication of the degrees whereby God wrought on, this great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Which, as it ſhall be in a good degree promooued, by that common ioy and praiſe of Chriſtians, ſuch as confuſedly, and ſuddenly, at the firſt ioyfull euent, is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all hearts: ſo, a greater and more effectuall degree thereof ſhall follow, when the praiſe hereupon, ſhall be ſolemne, in the Church aſſemblies and publike actions thereof: which is meaned by the ſong of the <hi>Elders and Beaſts,</hi> who are the type of the Church, as for ſolemne and lawfull worſhip, it is ordered, in the Beaſts going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and elders following them: hauing God his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his gtacious diſpenſation of the ſpirit, word, and faithfull miniſtery thereof: ſuch as (albeit it hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies appeared to the eies of men of the earth) yet God had at all times as by conference of the 4. and 11. and 14. Chapters herewith, is manifeſt. When this Church thus, for a lawfull miniſtery, ſeruing God in the communion of Saints, is hid from the world, then none heare or learne their ſong but the ſealed Virgins. But at this time, their <hi>Halleluiah</hi> and publike ſolemne praiſe, ſhall be ſeene and heard widely, euen to the wakening of the Eaſt thereby. For it is now a long time ſince it was ſaid to the reuiued <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> witneſſes, <hi>Come vp hither.</hi> The 144000. ſealed ones are ſaide Chapt. 14. to ſing a new ſong before the throne, Elders, and Beaſts: not that the 144000. are one thing, and the Elders and Beaſts another. But, as the 144000. are put to expreſſe the ſtate and condition of the true Church, in Antichriſt his vſurpation; ſo they are ſaid to ſing, <hi>before the Throne, Beaſts, and Elders.</hi> To ſhew, that albeit the world perceiued it not, euen then God had ſtill a Church, in the midſt whereof he dwelt, and had in it a miniſtery, and was worſhipped lawfully, in the aſſembly and communion of Saints. For this it is, that thorow this whole Propheſie, howſoeuer, to expreſſe the diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church, ſundry and diuers types are vſed; yet this, of Throne, Beaſts, and Elders, euer holdeth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2565:116"/>
in all. Thus then, the firſt common and confuſed ioy and praiſe, thereupon, is a double degree, (according as it riſeth vpon the Whores eternall fall) and effectuall, to waken. But, when euen theſe ſame, in ſolemne aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, profeſſedly praiſe God; it both inhanceth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice done, as done in the Sanctuary; and ſheweth a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe and regard of the benefit, moouing that duty in the hearts of the praiſers: as alſo, the publike, well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and holy excerciſe, in the Congregation, ſtirreth more, them who are without, to reuerence, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then common and priuate cariage, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5. 7. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. 25. Theſe ſame two degrees are, Chap. 11. Where, vpon the ſigne giuen by the Trumpet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiued ioy of theſe ſame euents to enſue, this ſame praiſe is ſummarily ſung. Now then, this third <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> of the <hi>Elders and Beaſts, falling and worſhipping him that ſitteth on the Throne,</hi> is a neerer degree of vp-ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſtep of in-comming, of Ebrewes and Orient, to ſing <hi>Halleluiah</hi> with vs. But laſtly, <hi>the voice from the Throne,</hi> euen God his owne powerfull voice, ſhall fully waken them from their deadneſſe, and pull perfitly, the vaile from their hearts, <hi>pouring on them the ſpirit of mercy and compaſſion,</hi> and taking from them <hi>their ſtony hearts,</hi> that they may <hi>ſee him whom they pearced.</hi> And <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 16.</note> this is called peculiarly, the voice from the Throne, to note God his powerfull working of their illumination and full conuerſion at this point, whereto their hearts, by the victory of the Chriſtian Church, and praiſe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God therefore, were in ſome good degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, prepared and mollified. So as now, <hi>all the ſeruants af God, all that feare him, both ſmall and great,</hi> ſhall raiſe vp a ſong to God, for multitude, maieſty, and noiſe, admirable: for exceeding great power and motion of ſpirit, full of thundering: for newneſſe of matter, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ioyfull. For raiſing of this great <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> a ſtrange order of working (as would appeare) is heere ſet downe. For, where it might ſeeme, that according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2565:117"/>
diſpenſation of all grace, the voice ſhould, from the Throne, haue gone firſt to the Beaſts and Elders, and from them to the multitude: in a heauenly wiſdome, the firſt motion is from the multitude, next, from Beaſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and laſtlie, from the Throne: to ſhew this great worke (as I haue ſhewed) at laſt, by God his owne power, fully effectuall. The order is from <hi>I ſay, A voice ſoundeth from the City, a voice from the Temple, the voice of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 66. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Lord who recompenſeth his enemies.</hi> Then, <hi>Sion before ſhe trauelled, brought foorth her children, and before her paine ſhee was deliuered of a man childe.</hi> Then, <hi>The earth was brought foorth in a day, and a Nation was borne at once.</hi> Conferre diligently, and eſpie deepe wiſdome.</p>
            <p>This voice, is <hi>to all Gods his ſeruant, to all that feare him both ſmall and great,</hi> the time of whoſe reward is now come, when God <hi>deſtroieth them who deſtroied the earth,</hi> Chapter. 11. Now, <hi>Rachel</hi> barren while <hi>Lea</hi> bare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhall breake foorth in the thouſands of <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> and tenne thouſands of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> So, by this voice <hi>from the Citie, from the Temple, and laſtly, from the Throne;</hi> euen from him <hi>Who fully recompenſeth his enemies,</hi> is raiſed, for multitude of ſingers, for manner and matter of ſong, an <hi>Helleluiah</hi> of a wonderfull note. While, not onely, <hi>a great multitude euen all the ſernants of God, ſmall and great, Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> doe ſing it, but alſo their ſong is like the voice <hi>of many Waters, and as the noiſe of great thunders;</hi> not as theſe Cha. 14. which none heard but the ſealed ones: but <note place="margin">Chap. 14. Sect. 3.</note> ſuch as ſhall fill the world with aſtoniſhment, and make the heauens reſound. So ſweetely and mightily ſhall the Harpes of them, whoſe receiuing ſhall bee <hi>life from the dead,</hi> bee tuned vp, with vs <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to praiſeour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sauiour.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thus, for cleering the myſtery heere implied, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhewed the forme, in the ſingers vncouth manner, order, and courſe of this whole ſong: Now let vs returne and firſt conſider the matter of all, and then the euent in <hi>Iohn.</hi>

            <p n="6">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:2565:117"/>
6 The matter of the ſong in the firſt three <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> and two degrees of ſingers, is all one. In the laſt <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> &amp; laſt ſingers, when all <hi>ſmall &amp; great ſing,</hi> it is larger. The ſong of the firſt ſingers hath two parts, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, to ſhew the riſing of their affection, the word <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiah</hi> is doubled. The firſt part hath the ſpeciall points of praiſe, and reaſons thereof. The ſpeciall points; are, <hi>Saluation, glory, honour, and power, &amp;c.</hi> Thus in ioyfull ſong profeſſing, that the onely praiſe of their ſaluation, the onely glory, that is, the eſtimation and high account they haue God in, as onely author of all their good: all the honour, that is, all dutifull worſhip, which according to that eſtimation and account they owe, are due to him onely. Laſtly, they acknowledge his onely power and ſtrength in all their deliuerance, and ouerthrow of their foes. This ſong, is the ſame in argument, with that Chap. 7. <hi>Saluation is of our God and of the Lambe.</hi> The reaſons of this their praiſe, are firſt, generally giuen, and next, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially accommodare to the preſent matter. The generall is, that <hi>his iudgements are true and iuſt,</hi> in relation to his promiſes and nature: and accordingly in the ſpeciall caſe heere meaned, the truth of his iudgements is cleere, in that the Whoore is iudged and deſtroied: as he promiſed, not onely to deſtroy her, but alſo all that doe euill to the Sanctuary. The iuſtice and equity, is manifeſt in her ſinne, who was a great Whoore; and therewithal, the corrupter of the whole earth: being, both her ſelfe, extremely ſinnfull, and inducing others to ſinne: next, extremely cruell, as in whom all the blood of the earth was found, and who, ſpecially was drunken with the blood of Saints. Now, God is a requirer of blood, and ſingulary of his holy ones, whoſe death is precious in his eies. This, both truth and iuſtice of God, in this ſpeciall act of the Whoores damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is yet more cleered in the ſecond part of their ſong: whereto they are ſtirred, by the conſideration of her euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fall, ſo as they neuer feare her deceit or cruelty any more. And, this raiſeth their affection to a new <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iab,</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:2565:118"/>
ſo, vpon the more cleare ſenſe of the greatneſſe of the benefit, doubling the praiſe. <hi>The fooliſh knoweth it not, and the vnwiſe man vnderſtandeth not, that the wicked flouriſheth as the graſſe, but hee ſhall bee deſtroied for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 The ſecond order of ſingers affirme the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the word, <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſing the ſame praiſe in <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 In the third order, as the ſingers are moe, and the note higher, ſo is the matter of their ſong ſomewhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: as which, hath not onely relation to the iudgement of the Whoore, as the former parts of the ſong, but alſo to the ſubſequent ſtory, both of the enemies ouerthrow, and gracefull ſtate of the Bride thereupon: both which are heere ſummarily celebrate, and largely after, through the booke exponed. The firſt, in this, that <hi>now the Lord raigneth,</hi> for they are deſtroied who vſurped the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The other, in that <hi>the Bride is prepared.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the vſurpers, is hencefoorth in this and the next Chapter: the Bride prepared, Chapters 21. and 22. Heereupon, all are of other, mutually exhorttd to ioy and gladneſſe, aſwell as to the praiſing of God; for that <hi>The Lambe his marriage is come, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein, as there is huge matter of Gods praiſe, ſo of exceeding ioy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne good from him. This marriage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted of old, was come in a great degree, when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome came into the world, but they who were bidden, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come, and amongſt thoſe, who were brought in to the wedding, one wanted a wedding garment, and <note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> thereupon, is caſt out into vtter darkeneſſe, euen the lake of fire and Brimeſtone. But now, at this point heere ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, the marriage ſhall come in a nobler degree, when God, by a <hi>voice from the Throne,</hi> ſhall turne their hearts who refuſed, now to come in: that, as their caſting of was the riches of the Gentiles, ſo their receiuing, may bee <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> much more the life of the world from death, by ſo ſtrange and wonderfull a change as ſhall make, in a manner, a new

For, what a Bride we are, by nature, ſee <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 16. and not onely is the garment giuen her, but, which is to be marked, the putting on thereof is giuen her alſo: as, which ſhee can no more put on, by her ſelfe, then ſhee can purchaſe it. What this garment is, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firſt, figuratiuely, and then in proper termes. Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely, it is <hi>fine linen pure and ſhining.</hi> This linen hath two properties. It is pure, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt giuen vs, of the father to iuſtification, whom by the gift of faith we put on, is pure, ſpotleſſe, and vndefiled: and maketh
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2565:119"/>
vs pure before God. This is iuſtification of faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. The ſecond property is Shining; for as it is ſpotleſſe and pure, ſo hath it a glorious luſtre, to ſhew, that Chriſt is not onely put on to iuſtification, but alſo <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 15.</note> to glorie, and that in two reſpects, One, in that hee ſanctifying vs wee ſhine here as lights in the middeſt of a froward generation, ſhewing forth the vertues of him that hath called vs: ſo glorifying God, witneſſing to the <note place="margin">1.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The other reſpect of ſhining is, in that as we put on Chriſt to iuſtification and ſanctification, ſo alſo to full glory at length with himſelfe, our corruptible bodies being made conforme to his glorious body. The Iewes firſt, ſeeking to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſnes <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> which is by the Law, (ſo like <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua,</hi> making garments to themſelues) fell from the righteouſneſſe of <note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> God, but now God turneth their hearts to prepare and trim themſelues with the Bridegroome his gifts (as was <hi>Rebeccha</hi> with the ornaments brought from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, both giuen her; and put on her) counting all <note place="margin">Gen. 24. Philip. 3.</note> things loſſe to bee found in Chriſt; that is, not hauing their owne righteouſneſſe which is by the law, but the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith in Ieſus: which, and application thereof, are both the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee gift of God. And the holy Ghoſt ſo coucheth the words, as no place is left to cauillation. For he ſayeth not our Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the fine linnen, but the fine linnen giuen vs is our iuſtifications.</p>

On his thigh, not ſo much for that ordinarily, the ſword, weapon of the victory, is girded on the thigh: but, for that in Scripture ſpeech, a man his ſtrength is placed commonly in his loſnes and <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> thighes, <hi>(now it is his owne ſtrength that helpeth him)</hi> and therefore, it was a token of ſubiection and ſeruitude, to put the hand vnder the thigh.

I ſhewed Chapt. 17. what it is to eat the fleſh of the Whore: but heere, is ſuch a ſtrange ranuerſing of the ſtate of the world, as no doubt, falleth by that earth-quake of the ſeuenth Viall.

25 So, are the parties. The euent of the battell, in the Beaſt his foile, is declared in few words: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of a conflict; but, of a proud and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate purpoſe to fight againſt the rider on the white horſe. For they ſhall be blind and obdured to the end: as is cleare by the effects, in them, of the Vials, Chapt. 16. And the word <gap reason="foreign">

For he drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of perpetuity, as alſo ſtaying vpon him the Whore. <hi>I ſit beeing a Queene and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no mourning,</hi> Chap. 18. 7.</p>
            <p n="26">26 Their iudgement is diſtinct, according to the diuers qualitie of the parties. The Head, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, are caſt in the lake of fire and brimſtone, and that a liue: to ſhew a moſt horrible, and recureleſſe iudgement, by alluſion to that of <hi>Sodome;</hi> and of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who went downe aliue in the pit. Euen eternall deſtruction and torment. The followers, <note place="margin">Nom. 16.</note> are ſlaine by the ſword of the Lord his mouth, to the loſſe of all their glory, and worldly ſtate, which is made a prey to others. Onely, by this difference, to ſhew, how this great Captaine, iudgeth and fighteth righteouſly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to each according to the degree of their ſinne. For, no doubt, but euen at this point, many ſhall follow the Beaſt, and fall from their eſtates by his fall: whom yet, by deſtruction of their fleſh, the Lord may reclaime from the full degree of his puniſhment; in lightning them to ſee the truth. As, many alſo ſhall drinke with him of the cup of endleſſe wrath.</p>
            <p n="27">27 That the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are heere made two, is only to ſhew, the ruine of the Head and State with him. For, as the falſe Prophet, ruling ouer the State, is the Beaſt; ſo being diſtinctly conſidered from the State, he is the falſe Prophet. As the firſt and ſecond Beaſt are Cha. 13 diſtinguiſhed but for explication. So this is put, to ſhew

in ſuch ſort the fall of the falſe Prophet (the eight heade and one of the ſeuen, the beaſt with hornes like the lambe making the image of the Beaſt by cure of his deadly wound) as ſtate and all ſhall periſh eternally. For, as this Beaſt hath ſome note from all the foure in <hi>Daniel;</hi> ſo in the deſtruction of this, the ſpirit alludeth to that of theſe.

2 In his firſt reſtraint, come to bee conſidered, the ſureneſſe, end, and degree thereof. The ſureneſſe, is cleered in the perſon apprehender, and manner of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. The apprehender is God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s miniſter, <hi>an Angell:</hi> inſtructed with authority, as, <hi>comming from heauen:</hi> with power to execute, as, hauing the <hi>key of the bottomleſſe pit, and a great chaine.</hi> All ſpoken after the manner of men. This Angell, falleth not from heauen to earth, as that great ſtarre, Chapter 9. but <hi>commeth downe,</hi> as he Chapters 10. and 18. And, accordingly, hath the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit for a farre different end from that: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, to incloſe the Prince of darkeneſſe, being himſelfe the miniſter of light: whereas that great ſtarre, falling from the miniſtrie of light, to become the miniſter of darkneſſe, he openeth the botomleſſe pit, to let out darkeneſſe. The Dragon, is heere deſcribed, by theſe ſame names, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, of ſeducing Nations, which are giuen him in the 12. Chapter, in the firſt degree of this his firſt foile, towards this firſt captiuity: when by <hi>Michael</hi> his valour, hee was caſt from heauen. Which the holy Ghoſt doth, of purpoſe, to leade vs know that this firſt binding, is from that rage. So wiſely and plainely, the ſpirit teacheth vs to couple together the parts of this propheſie. Now Chriſt is hee properly, who treadeth downe the head of that ſerpent: <note place="margin">Gen. 3. Luke 11. 21. 1. Ihon 3 8. Chap. 1. 18.</note> who, onely, is that ſtronger then the ſtrong one, comming in, binding him and ſpoiling his houſe: as who, onely hath come to loſe the workes of Satan, and onely hath the keies of hell and death. But, according as he giueth gifts to men, and worketh by his miniſters of whatſoeuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who, in his light and ſtrength, aduance the Kingdome of light, and bring downe that of darkeneſſe, his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, thus inſtructed by him, and to this ende, are alſo <note place="margin">Pſal. 149. 8.</note> binders of the Dragon. Of whom this Angell is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall type.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The manner of fermance, to ſhew the ſurenes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is after the manner of men, ſet forth, in incloſing, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2565:127"/>
and ſealing, as was the caues mouth on <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Sepulchre of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The end of his reſtraint is, <hi>That he ſeduce not the Nations, &amp;c,</hi> Which ende, how it is, and how farre to be vnderſtood, the degree of his reſtraint now, and his endeauour, vpon his next looſing will make cleare.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thus we haue the ſureneſſe, and end of the Dragons reſtraint. Now followeth the degree thereof: cleering the end, as I haue ſaid. The degree is, that this his capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity is not abſolute, but in a ſpeciall conſideration. This is ſhewed by the time thereof, ſtate of men in that time, and what this ſtate is. The time is not, <hi>for euer,</hi> as in his next taking, but, for a thouſand yeeres: which being expired, he was to bee loſed againe. The denunciation of which ſad euent, is mitigated with a conſolation, that it ſhould be but for a ſhort ſpace, euen that three daies and a halfe, wherein the witneſſes were killed and lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, Chapter 11. For thencefoorth, by degrees the Dragon is againe comprehended, till he be made fully faſt in eternall chaines.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſtate of men, during this firſt reſtraint, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it alſo not to be abſolute: in ſo farre, as hee ſhall bee bound but to a few, being ſtill looſe towards the moſt part. This is cleered, by declaration of the ſeuerall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both: and firſt, of theſe to whom hee is bound. Wherein, are two: their condition, in this his reſtraint: and, who they are, that haue this condition. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, is expreſſed, firſt, in figuratiue ſpeech, of <hi>Thrones and Sitters, hauing iudgement accordingly, giuen them:</hi> and next, in proper termes, that they <hi>liued and raigned with Chriſt theſe thouſand yeeres.</hi> Who they are, that are in this eſtate and condition, is ſhewed in two ſorts: Firſt, <hi>The ſoules of them who were beheaded for the word of God, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They who worſhipped not the Beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> The ſtate and condition of the contrarie ſort, is, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe thouſand yeeres, they lay <hi>dead and liued not.</hi> Now, how great this number is, and how ſmall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2565:127"/>
thereto, is the former, is cleere by the 13 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where all the earth follow the Beaſt, and receiue his Character, name, or number: except theſe 144000. ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones, Chap. 7. in mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lambe, Chap. 14. And conſequently, in what reſpect, and to whom, the Dragon is ſaid, during this ſpace, to bee bound.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The third point, ſhewing yet further the ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Satan his reſtraint, is the explication of this ſtate and condition of both ſorts of men: what this life and raigne of the one is: and, what is the death of the other. To wit, that this life and raigne, are not to bee taken for this naturall life, or any wordly dominion: neither yet, for that euerlaſting and glorious ſtate, which the Saints, in Soule and body, after the laſt indgement, inioy in heauen: this being their ſtate during the thonſand yeeres, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt reſurrection. As, neither is the death of the other, to be vnderſtood of the naturall death of the body, by ſeperation of the ſoule therefrom: or, of the eternall death of both, in <hi>Gehenna:</hi> as, wherein the world lying dead a thouſand yeeres, thereafter riſeth from it, to haue part in the firſt reſurrection, and conſequently of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But, this life and raigne in reſpect of the ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, is their honourable commemoration, and riſing from vnder theſe horrible ſlanders &amp; calumnies, whereby, the honour of their ſufferings was, maliciouſly, by Satan eclipſed: euen that ſame thing, which, by <hi>long white robes,</hi> was ſignified, Chapter 6. In reſpect of theſe who <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not the Beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> This life and raigne, is the firſt reſurrection: whereby men here, by the word and ſpirit, are begotten to the life of God in Chriſt, and freed from the bondage and death of Satan and ſinne: being <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 14.</note> vindicare in the liberty of the ſonnes of God, and ſo, made Kings and Prieſts to God in Chriſt Ieſus. And the death of the reſt, who riſe not this firſt reſurrection, is that death in ſinne, ignorance, idolatrie and induration, wherein all men lye, naturally, depriued of the life of God: like thoſe <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 6.</note> widowes, who being aliue, yet were dead: and like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:2565:128"/>
who was dead in <hi>Baal.</hi> From which death, who <note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. 13. 1.</note> ſo riſeth not, to be pertaker of the firſt reſurrection, ſhall be accurſed foreuer, and ſubiect to the power of the ſecond death, as contrariwaies, who haue part in the laſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct on, are bleſſed and holy, and ſhall liue and raigne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally not feeling the ſecond death.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now, this death of the <hi>Reſt of men,</hi> albeit in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſiderations of the ſingular perſons, in that time who lay dead and raiſe not the firſt reſurrection, it was an entrie to the ſecond death: Yet the ſpirit, heere, ſheweth that in the generall conſideration of the world, it ſhould not alwaies lie in that death. But as theſe 144000. liued and raigned with Chriſt, theſe thouſand yeeres, (while all the earth followed the Beaſt, and were dead in <hi>Baal)</hi> and were partakers in the firſt reſurrection, vnder ſure hope of the ſecond, to glory: ſo after theſe thouſand yeeres were expired, not theſe onely but an infinite number of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, with Palmes in <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> their hands, and long whit robes, made white in the blood of the Lambe, ſhould riſe from their death wherein they lay, and ſing a new ſong. This, is euidently implied in theſe words, <hi>The reſt of the dead liued not, till the thouſand yeeres were expired,</hi> and this is called the firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, is ſpoken, in common, both of the former who liued during the thouſand yeeres, and of the other, who, after the thouſand yeeres, aroſe and liued. So, as theſe words, <hi>This is the firſt reſurrection,</hi> are relatiue, als well to the life of theſe who liued during the thouſand yeeres, as to them, who ſhould liue after the expiring thereof: for, their life is one, albeit not of one time, as the words, <hi>The reſt of the dead liued not till, &amp;c.</hi> euince clearely: and accordingly, bleſſedneſſe and immunity from the ſecond death, is the firſt pronounced in common, of both: and thereafter ſeuerally by parts, this their common life and bleſſedneſſe of the firſt reſurrection is exponed. That the firſt ſhould liue and raigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres: and the other, notwithſtanding, of the Dragon againe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2565:128"/>
louſed, and his ſtrange endeauours thereupon, yet ſhould riſe this firſt reſurrection, and liue, and raigne with Chriſt for euer and euer. The place hath been, and is miſtaken highly, euen to the breeding of dangerous hereſies. But thus it is. The holy Ghoſt hauing ſet forth the ſtate of the Church, as ſhee riſeth the firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and liueth the life of God, from the time of Sathan his firſt reſtraint, and that in two degrees of riſers: firſt theſe, who during the yeeres of his Captiuity, liued &amp; raigned, when as by the Beaſt his preuailing it might haue ſeemed, that there had beene none at all: Next, theſe, who after the thouſand yeeres, notwithſtanding his looſing and rage, yet roſe from their death in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and blindneſſe; and hauing ſaid of both in common, <hi>this is the firſt reſurrection.</hi> He then procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their bleſſedneſſe accordingly, in this their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, and raigne here, and that diſtinctly according to the two times. Of the firſt ſort, that <hi>they ſhall be Prieſts of God, &amp; raigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres.</hi> And of the ſecond ſort, that <hi>after the thouſand yeeres were expired</hi> they ſhould riſe to the life of God, and <hi>raigne for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> Now, if this ſecond member had been thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly put, anſwering ſo to the other, it had exempted al doubt. But becauſe in ſtead of this ſummarie reddition, the holy Ghoſt much more gracefully ſubioyneth the narration, how, as during Sathan his firſt reſtraint, a good number liued the life of God, refuſing the Beaſt his marke, and ſo were bleſſed in the aſſurance of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ouer the ſecond death: ſo, after his louſing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, and all his endeauours thereupon, <hi>the reſt of the dead ſhall riſe</hi> the firſt reſurrection, and the Church ſhould ſtill waxe and encreaſe in light &amp; grace: Sathan in his higheſt endeauours againſt her, ſhould be againe made faſt for euer, and ſhe enioy an eternal peace. Then to haue the full ſenſe of the ſecond member, and a cleare reddition, wee muſt reade from the beginning of the ſeuenth verſe, to the end of the 5. of the 22. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2565:129"/>
Neither muſt wee here imagine, that the firſt are ſaid ſo to liue a thouſand yeeres, as though the life of God had periſhed from them thereafter, or that this life and raigne is of one and the ſame perſons, ſtill liuing all this while, (which were a lourdly groſſe apprehenſion) as neither muſt wee thinke, that becauſe the ſecond are ſaid to raigne for euermore, that thereby is firſt and properly meaned their ſtate in glory after the laſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But thus the ſpirit will ſhew, how firſt and laſt God entertained a Church, and ſpirituall life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. To the firſt, are attributed a thouſand yeeres, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the Dragon being ſo long tyed from diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their ſpirituall life and raigne by open rage, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine let louſe. To the ſecond, a raigne for euermore, becauſe the Dragon fighting againſt it, is taken and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued for euer, to ſhew ſuch a deſtruction of oppoſers, as the Church her peace ſhould neuer againe bee diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by any new louſing of Sathan from his ſecond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment: but ſhee ſhall enioy quiet ſtate here in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull diſpenſation of grace, till ſhee bee at length tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to euerlaſting glory: according to that which of her in this reſpect was ſaid, Chapter 7. <hi>they ſhall hunger no more, &amp;c.</hi> To take the thouſand yeeres, verſe 6. to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the expiring of the firſt thouſand, verſe 4. and 5. which ſecond thouſand yeeres, the reſt of the dead ariſing, ſhall liue and raigne: and to take the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection here ſo in relation to a ſecond, as by the firſt ſhould be meaned the riſing of Gentiles from vnder An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian darkeneſſe: and the conuerſion of Iewes to be in relation thereto, the ſecond: Albeit it be the indge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one deepely ſeene in theſe myſteries, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well of the Church for his learned Commentaries on this Booke; yet it ſeemeth to me a groundles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, which hath made him to miſtake alſo as I think the end of this Chapter. For, beſides that to take the thouſand yeeres, verſe 6. for a ſecond thouſand, after that verſe 4. and 5. and yet to make the thouſand yeeres ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2565:129"/>
verſe 7. to be relatiue to the firſt, and not to theſe immediately preceeding, it maketh an obſcure, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate conſtruction, (which in our interpretation goeth plaine and ſoundly) what ſhould induce to thinke a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thouſand yeeres to be meaned verſe 6. ſeeing no caſe is put at the end thereof to fall out, why the ſpirite ſhould ſo exactly haue limited them, as we ſee in the firſt the looſing againe of the Dragon? The thouſand yeers, life and raigne then in the 6. verſe, is the ſame which was ſpoken, verſe 4. and there reſumed very pertinently, to ſhew, in ſubioyning the other ſort of riſers and liuers, God his whole diſpenſation, from the firſt binding of the Dragon, towards his Church, firſt and laſt, and diſtinctly in both.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Now, from what point of time to beginne, and at what point, conſequently to cloſe the count of theſe thouſand yeeres, the end heere mentioned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Dragon his reſtraint, doe clearely lead vs. Wee muſt not thinke, that Sathan in an inſtant was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyed vp from his rage, or againe, in a preciſe point of time let looſe. But both fell out by degrees. From the firſt out going of the Goſpell, hee beganne in ſome degree to bee bound, as hee complaineth of Chriſt, that hee had come to torment him before the time. And as <note place="margin">Math. 8. 29.</note> the Goſpell preuailed, hee was ſtill the more made faſt. But ſeeing the end here ſpecified of his binding, and the condition of the Church heere deſcribed vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, Make euident, that this his Captiuity is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but in ſome ſpeciall conſideration: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees here mentioned ſhew, that then his vptying is to bee counted, when in that conſideration he is perfectly made faſt, as taken, ſhut vp, locked on &amp; ſealed; we haue to take vp that point of time, when according to this end he was fully faſtned. I ſhewed before on the 12. Chapter, that the Dragon his proper rage is taken for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and cruell perſecuting of Chriſtians: from which he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2565:130"/>
was then fully tyed vp, when by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the faith, open perſecution ceaſed, and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was by lawes eſtabliſhed, the Church became glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of all men; the ſoules of Martyres got long white robes, and <hi>ſeates were ſet vp, and the Saints</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 6. 11.</note> 
               <hi>did ſit on them, &amp;c, hauing iudgement giuen them.</hi> For, both the commemoration of Martyrs was honourable, and the eſtate of the Church flouriſhing in peaceable and goodly condition, and glorious account. And albeit in the meane time, Sathan was working by his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the Beaſt, whom vpon this his reſtraint from open rage, hee ſent forth, then in the firſt ſenſible degrees to deceiue by falſe ſemblance, and who from this point of time mightily preuailed (though at firſt by ſlow &amp; ſcarſe perceptible degrees, as riſing out of the earth) in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Nations to make vp the image of the Beaſt, which at the end of theſe thouſand yeeres came to the top of <note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> impiety: yet they liued and raigned all the while, who <note place="margin">Chap. 14. Sect 8.</note> receiued not his Character. The end then here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of the Dragons reſtraint, <hi>that hee ſhould not ſeduce, &amp;c.</hi> muſt not bee taken abſolutely (for hee was neuer buſier ſeducing, nor with greater ſucceſſe, then during theſe thouſand yeeres) but ſeducing here muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, according as wee ſee hee worketh vpon his lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe: when hee falleth to that ſame kinde of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, from which firſt hee was bound vp, that is, <hi>to ſeduce Nations to compaſſe the Tents of Saints, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued City.</hi> Euen to ſet them againe vpon violent and furious perſecution, by ſword and fire, as he was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning, and as in that, men moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themſelues to bee the children of their father the Diuell. From this rage hee was bound vp, when by the two wings <hi>of that great Eagle,</hi> the woman eſcaped to her <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> place <hi>from the preſence of the Dragon:</hi> he beeing chained from comming at her, now extolled with wings. And the degrees here ſet downe, of <hi>binding, incloſing, ſhutting
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2565:130"/>
vpon and ſealing,</hi> ſhew euidently that the count is to be taken vp from the full and perfect point of his Captiuity. For from that time hee had no louſe chain for open rage. In <hi>Iulian</hi> he was not ſo much louſed, as biting the chain. Who beſides his ſhort abode, neuer durſt fall directly to murthering of Chriſtians, the perſecutions of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alens</hi> were partiall heates vnder profeſſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that bloud that was mingled with haile and fire, Chapter 8.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Now, as wee haue the point of time of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fermance, which is the 300. yeere of Chriſt, or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: ſo this leadeth vs to the point of his looſing, the 1300. yeere, or thereby, and the conueniency of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is cleare; for although as by degrees hee was faſtned, ſo by degres hee was looſed againe; yet wee ſhall find as at the firſt point, the full degree of his binding; ſo at this time, him fully looſed. In the Pontificality of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the ſeuenth, he had a long chaine, which yet was further raxed in that of <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſecond, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, kindlers of that tragicall and ſuperſtitious warre, for recouery of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But, for the end here ſpoken of open cruelty againſt Saints, hee was fully louſed in the Pontificality of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; from whoſe times haue beene bloudy perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cruell rage. Then the woman beganne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the wildernes, the witneſſes to ſteppe out <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> of the Temple, the little booke eaten, to giue hearts and eyes, to apply the reede, and ſo to diſcerne the Temple from the Court: then the firſt of theſe three Angels, Chapter 14. beganne to breake out through the midſt of Heauen, and the other two in courſe followed: ſo as then <hi>they were bleſſed who died in the Lord,</hi> and then <hi>was the patience of Saints.</hi> The Beaſt his mouth then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiued, and ſo the ſemblance of the Lambs horns no more able to beare him out, the Dragon behooued come againe in roome to maintaine his owne throne, &amp; to repreſſe by rage what by hypocriſie could not be kept
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2565:131"/>
downe. Then the two witneſſes lay ſlaine in the ſtreetes of the great City, all Nations being ſeduced to ſlay them, and reioyce ouer them. Then the Beaſt which <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> was carſt ſpotted like a Pard, becommeth of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons colour; and the Whore born vp by him, is drunke <note place="margin">Chap. 17.</note> with the bloud of Saints: from that time what cruell murther of Chriſtians was vnder the odious names of <hi>Waldenſes, Albingenſes, Fraterculi, Beghardi, &amp;c.</hi> And ſince, what fiers, what bloud ſheds, what monſtrous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots for extirpation of the truth haue beene practiſed, is too well known.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In this rage, though for a time the Dragon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borded, yet praiſed bee God, by ſucceſſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and fire from heauen, hee is in making faſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, in an euerlaſting chaine. Therefore it is ſaid, that hee ſhould be louſed but a <hi>ſhort space.</hi> For they are faine to relent of their open murthering and burning, &amp; are now in God his iuſtice getting meaſure for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</p>
            <p n="12">12 The time then of theſe thouſand yeeres, is from the firſt open and ſenſible ſteppes of the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, working on to the quickning of the Beaſt (which fell together with this binding vp of the Dragon) to the toppe of that impiety, when it came to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And this is the onely time in all this propheſie, to <note place="margin">Chap. 9. Sect. 5.</note> bee taken definitely; becauſe of Antichriſt his whole working (which was in way euen from the Apoſtolike times, firſt by hid and inſenſible, and next by open ſteppes towards the height, from which height againe as by degrees it aroſe, ſo by degrees it muſt vaniſh) no preciſe or exact time could be ſet downe: but yet, to giue vs ſufficient cleareneſſe, the holy Ghoſt putteth the time from the firſt beginning of open working, to the height of impiety: and marketh the two pointes of this time, with moſt euident notes of the binding of the Dragon, and his louſing againe.</p>
            <p n="13">13 In <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his time, that too great and open
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2565:131"/>
ſteppes were laide for Antichriſt to mount vp to Sathan his throne, is too well knowne. And to what a height the miſtery of iniquity had wrought on, in the Pontifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth their owne ſtories giue cleare teſtimony: recording of him that hee entred like a foxe, raigned as a Lion, and died as a dogge. When, by a counterfeit Oracle hee had got himſelfe made Pope, hee would vpon no condition acknowledge the Emperour, except hee did take his title and dignity of him, as to whom properly it belonged. He excommunicated the French King, becauſe hee would not take his Crowne holden of him, and impudently and impiouſly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Subiects of their allegeance. He blaſphemouſlie againſt the honour of Chriſt his Croſſe, inſtituted the firſt Iubilie at Rome, and put forth this decree, that <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Rome ought to be iudged of none, although he ſhould carry innumerable ſoules with him to hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14 The peruerſe mindes of the Romanes here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themſelues. For this time of a thouſand yeeres, which onely of all the times in this propheſie is to bee taken definitely, they will haue to bee indefinite; and al the reſt to be taken both definitelie and properly. And without either example of Scripture, or ſhew of alluſion, caſting it roundly by them, they will forſooth haue theſe thouſand yeeres here indefinitely put for all the time from Chriſt, to Antichriſt his raigne: who ſhall raigne (ſay they) three yeeres and a halfe before the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But, if during theſe thouſand yeeres, the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honor and chiefe crown of them who liue and raign in them, be their refuſing to worſhippe the Beaſt (whom euen Romans confeſſe to be Antichriſt) of neceſſity his Kingdome muſt haue beene in vogue theſe thouſand yeeres. And this againe ſheweth plainely, that theſe times of a 1260. dayes, 42. monethes, and <hi>a time, times, &amp; halfe a time,</hi> are not properly and definitely put for the iuſt time of Antichriſt his raigne, as the Romans would inforce, ſeeing theſe thouſand yeeres hee beareth ſway:
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2565:132"/>
further, if theſe times were definitely, and yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be taken, as ſome of our learned interpreters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, I ſee no reaſon why here the holy Ghoſt ſhould haue altered his ordinary ſtile. See Chapters 9. and 11. and 12.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Now conſidering all the courſe of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, expreſſing firſt the ſtate of the Church in the ſeuen of <hi>Aſia,</hi> next, compriſing the whole future euents in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Seales: the ſeuenth whereof affordeth ſeuen Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and the ſeuenth of theſe ſeuen vials of the laſt wrath. Seeing alſo that in all this Booke, but ſeuen diuers times are recorded. Firſt, that of ten dayes, Chapter 2. 2. that of halfe an houre, Chapter 8. 3. that of fiue monethes, Chapter 9. 4. that of an howre, day, moneth and yeer of the ſixth Trumpet, Chapter 9. 5. that of 1260. dayes, 42. monethes, a time, times, and halfe a time, which are but one, Chapter 11. and 12. and 13. 6. that of three dayes and a halfe, Chapter 11; and now this of a 1000. yeeres is the ſeuenth, in huge proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exceeding all the former. Conſidering alſo, that this time of a 1000. yeeres, is in the courſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and within ſhort ſpace, ſixe times recorded, and thereafter no time mentioned but <hi>euermore.</hi> Whither in theſe conſiderations, if this maner of leading imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any further myſtery, I referre it to godly and ſober conſiderations: not daring louſe the raines to curioſity in ſo diuine and hid matter; wherein yet I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, thongh my weakeneſſe cannot find it out, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is eyther in matter or manner of handling, which hath not in it a great depth of wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Thus was the dragons firſt reſtraint, in a certaine degree of time and meaſure. Followeth the ſecond, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and euerlaſting. And it is cleared by the fore-going liberty, to which hee is louſed. From the firſt bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So as all this point is in theſe two, the dragons ſecond liberty, and the euent thereof.</p>
            <p n="17">17 In this his ſecond liberty, is the time when, and his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2565:132"/>
endeauour beeing looſed. The time is, at the expiring of the thouſand yeeres whereof wee haue ſpoken. His endeauour being looſed, is to practiſe againe, that from which, by his firſt taking, hee was with-held: that is, to <hi>ſeduce Nations.</hi> Which ſeducing, muſt bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode to be of that ſame kind, as heereafter is clearely ſhewed, in that hee brought them to <hi>compaſſe the tents of Saints and beloued City.</hi> For otherwaies, all the time of his reſtraint from this kind of working, hee by the Lieutenant of his power, ſeduced in another kind migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie. The greatneſſe of this his endeauour, to this end, is cleared: firſt, by theſe whom hee ſeduced: and next, by their action vpon his inſtigation. In theſe who are ſeduced, are theſe circumſtances. 1 Their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 Their quality. 3 Their number. Their habitation, is <hi>the foure quarters of the earth.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is offered to our conception, both, Satan his earneſt and diligent practiſe in this his laſt puffe; and that, all the enemies ouer the whole earth, of what ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoeuer, whom, in this his laſt fury, hee bringeth foorth, are heere deſigned. Their quality, is expreſſed in the names giuen them, of <hi>Gog and Magog.</hi> To ſhew them, deteſtable, for cruell diſpoſition to deſtroy: that by a huge deſtruction, they ſhall be deſtroyed: and that they are the inſtruments of Satan his laſt fury. Their number, is expreſſed in two notes. One, that they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpred the plaine of the earth: the other, that they were as the ſand of the Sea for multitude.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Such are they who are ſeduced. The end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dragon leadeth them, is, <hi>to compaſſe the tents of Saints and the beloued City.</hi> Euen the vtter deſtruction (in their intent) of God his true Church, heere on earth, pitching in Tents, as yet in their warfare, and abſent from their eternall habitation: but who notwithſtanding, are the true Citizens of heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> of God.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Thus is the Dragons liberty, and his endeauour
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2565:133"/>
thereupon. The euent heereof is double. One, of them, who thus ſeduced by him, were ſet on ſo euill a worke; <hi>that fire came from heauen and deuoured them.</hi> The other, of him who is their leader; that hee is now taken and commited to euerlaſting fire and torment. This his iudgement, is cleared by his fellowſhip therein: the <hi>Beaſt and falſe Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20 This euent is further cleared and declared ſure, by ſetting downe the laſt degree of their deſtruction, in the laſt iudgement, when all enemies being brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, death ſhall bee ſwallowed vp to victory. To ſhew vs, that this ſecond victory ouer Satan, and reſtraint of him from this his laſt rage, ſhall not bee, but onely for a certaine ſpace, as was that firſt: or in a ſpeciall reſpect, as that was; but it ſhall be abſolute and eternall. So as, from the time Chriſt began this ſecond time, <hi>ſitting on a white cloude,</hi> Chap. 14. 14. <hi>to make his iudgements manifeſt,</hi> Cha. 15. 4. And, from the time he began to erect this his <hi>great white Throne</hi> by the reuiued light of the Goſpell: when <hi>the time of the dead commeth to bee iudged,</hi> Chap 11. The ſeuenth Trumpet ſounding to the finiſhing of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, in full accompliſhment of all which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretold, for deliuerance of the Church, and her goodly ſtate in grace: So as, <hi>the ſigne of the ſonne of man ſhall bee ſeene in heauen:</hi> the victory ouer her enemies, ſhall ſtill hold on, and the enemies ſtill fall, as did <hi>Haman</hi> before <hi>Mordecay,</hi> till by all the degrees of deſtruction, <note place="margin">Eſter 6. 13.</note> they at laſt, in the generall iudgement receiue finall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: when death and the Diuell, who hath dominion thereof, ſhall be aboliſhed. And, for this purpoſe onely, it is, that heere, ſo liuely an <hi>hypotypoſis,</hi> of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſet downe. In the perſon of the iudge: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of iudging; and the execution: ſo farre foorth, as for the preſent purpoſe was needfull. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Iudge is deſcribed in his office, adminiſtration thereof, and his dreadfull maieſty and power. In office, hee is a Iudge, a royall and a great Iudge, as hauing a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2565:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Throne and a great Throne. He is alſo faithfull, true, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and glorious, and whoſe iudgements are cleare and manifeſt; by his <hi>white Throne.</hi> As he rode before, Chap. 19. on a white horſe, and did ſit Chapt. 14. on a white cloude. His adminiſtration is, in that hee ſitteth. His dreadfull maieſty and power, is expreſſed, in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full forme of iſhing before his preſence. <hi>Heauen and Earth depart,</hi> and ſo as their place is not found. To ſhew <note place="margin">Iſai. 41. 12.</note> a perfit departing: as that which in Scripture, is ſaide of the wicked, that he periſheth ſo, as his place is not knowen.</p>
            <p n="21">21 The order of iudgement, is in the perſons iudged, and manner of proceſſe. The perſons, are all the deade great and ſmall: cleared, by enumeration of theſe who are dead in the Sea, who by any other kind of mortality, or who were in their graues. And herein, clearely is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the power of the Iudge. For no queſtion can bee of the liuing, when all the dead are forced to giue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The manner of proceſſe is ſet downe, after the forme of well ordered humane iudicatories. In that <hi>bookes were opened:</hi> euen the records of mens actions: <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 10.</note> and <hi>another booke, the booke of life.</hi> The iudgement of earth, is, <hi>of theſe things which were in the bookes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their workes.</hi> The forme of ſpeech is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that it ſaith not, <hi>of things written in the bookes and according to their workes.</hi> To ſhew, that heere, are not two rules of iudging. But, that ſo men are iudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, as yet the iudgement is led and ordered by the bookes. For the ground and cauſe of the iudgement, is the booke of life: according as in it mens names are written, or are paſſed by: beeing either giuen to Chriſt of the Father, or left.

heere, by his ſpirit to bring foorth fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo, at length glorifieth. Theſe fruits of faith, confirme vs in the aſſurance of our election, and that wee are in Chriſt Ieſus: that, which, further ſtrengthneth our peace, as writing it in our owne conſciences: which are the one ſort of bookes: and whoſe teſtimonie muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the other booke of life. Now, then in the iudgement, ſo are workes lookt on, as collation alwaies muſt be of the bookes, to ſee if our names be written in the booke of life, as aſſurance of life and ioyfull peace are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our conſciences. Otherwaies, in it ſelfe, all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is but as a menſtruous clout. But yet, what <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrael</hi> will not obtaine ſeeking to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, which is by the Law, the election will <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3. &amp; 7.</note> obtaine.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Such are the perſon of the Iudge, and the order and manner of proceſſe. Now, the execution follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Which, agreeably to the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt, for which, onely mention of the laſt iudgement is heere made, is all in wrath, againſt death, hell, and ſuch as are not written in the booke of life: who are adiudged to euerlaſting fire, which is the ſecond death. And, this is to ſhew, as I touched before, that this laſt victory, ouer the Dragon and his inſtruments, ſhall bee full and perfect: holding courſe, from the firſt degree of their foile, therein, till death and the graue, which are the laſt enemies, be ſubdued. And, this execution of enemies was ſufficient to record in this place, where, this matter is not <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.

As many, heereupon, haue imagined, that the ouerthrow of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and theſe huge Armies of opponents, ſhould bee conioined with Chriſt his laſt comming. But, the ſpirit hath no ſuch meaning.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2565:134"/>
vp of victorie: and that the Dragons foile ſhould not bee, now, as at the firſt binding, from which after a ſpace, hee got looſe againe: But, it ſhould bee to finall deſtruction. And, in this ſenſe, the Apoſtle in the ſecond to the <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. telleth that Antichriſt ſhall bee aboliſhed with the brightneſſe of the Lord his comming. Not, as though he ſhall raigne till then: but that he ſhall be ſo conſumed heere with the power of the word of truth, as, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering ſtrength, he ſhall be deſtroied for euer: the full and perfect point whereof, is in the Lord his laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and finall ſentence againſt him. Therefore Cha. 17 the Beaſt is ſaid to goe to deſtruction. In the vſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Scripture, when God will confirme his Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt dangers, and in hope of deliuerance, for their full ſetling, he leadeth them to the conſideration of that finall deliuerance, whereto euer our hearts ſhould bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. and in like manner, in denouncing deſtruction to the enemies (in the meaſure whereof, as it falleth out here, we neuer are ſatisfied) he leadeth vs to their laſt and finall ſentence. Thus the Lord calleth the Prophet, and other <note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> faithfull, in that promiſed deliuerance from the tyranny of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> to the conſolation of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <note place="margin">Acts 24. 15. &amp; 26. 8.

The Martyres ſuffered conſtantly, vnder the Lawe, looking for a better reſurrection. The Scripture teacheth vs, that, that day ſhall come as a thiefe, vpon a peaceable and ſecure world, marrying and taking in marriage, &amp;c. Which vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 2.

For, if the laſt iudgement and comming of Chriſt to it, had ſo notable markes, as the foile of Antichriſt, taking of the Dragon, and ſo great tumults, warres, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, with the hauocke of ſo huge Armies beſiedging the Church, how could either that day comes as a thieſe on a peaceable world; or the Church, in ſuch cruell inuaſion, be at eaſe, and ſleeping?

This is certaine, that in the condition of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as I haue ſaid, wee are not onely to looke vpon things in propriety, but alſo to conſider them as ſtampes of things to come. Hereof it is, that as all the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances promiſed from their enemies, and afflictions then had a further reſpect (as the meaſure of their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances, nothing anſwerable to the high promiſes; eaſily brought the godly to conſider, and waite for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſo alſo were their troubles and troublers, types of other and more dangerous enemies, and the deſtructions denounced againſt them (which in the firſt properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were not ſeene fulfilled in the degree threatned) raiſed the hearts of the faithfull to waite in the end for a more abſolute victory and conſtant peace. The firſt great affliction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Pharao,</hi> that great dragon, as Chapter 12. Itouched. The next great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and captiuy was by <hi>Babel,</hi> and theſe Beaſtes in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now after the peoples deliuery from <hi>Babel,</hi> City and Temple being reedified: the laſt cruell oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing enemy, and ſtayer of true worſhippe before Chriſt his comming in the fleſh, was <hi>Gog,</hi> and of <hi>Gog</hi> ſpecially <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> as <hi>Daniel, Ezechiel,</hi> and bookes of <hi>Machabees</hi> ſhew clearely. For the Romans were not long before Chriſt, but drawne in as ſequeſtres by the Iewes owne partialities (whereto pride brought them after <hi>they had beene helped by a little helpe)</hi> and albeit the ſtronger, yet ſo farre ſuffered and maintained the liberty <note place="margin">Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hence it is, that as for expreſſing the firſt troubles and troubler of the Chriſtian Church, and her deliuery there from, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. And for expreſſing the next huge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of Antichriſt, the alluſion is to <hi>Babel,</hi> and that in a Beaſt carrying a note of all the foure in <hi>Daniel:</hi> ſo here to expreſſe the laſt enemies, who after her comming out of <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Sion</hi> reedified, ſhall be inſtruments of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than his laſt puft, the holy Ghoſt alludeth to <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> For whoſe deſtruction, as a great white throne was ſet vp, that at the firſt comming of Chriſt; the ſaints <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> might get the Kingdome: ſo here, to ſhew that theſe laſt Miniſters of Sathan his rage ſhall fall ſtill to finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Lord his laſt comming, a great white throne is erected. And as vpon the full ouerthrow of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Ezech.</hi> 38. and 39.

That of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is of the ſtate of the Church of Chriſt vnder the Goſpell, generally in relation to the Church before Chriſt, and vnder the law. This here in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Chapters, is of the Church ſpecially, now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious ouer theſe enemies, and gracefull through the conuerſion of the Iewes and Eaſterne Kingdomes to the faith: enioying plenty of light and peace, in relation to the Chriſtian, Church, before in her wreſtlings and ſufferings by theſe enemies, now ouerthrowne.</p>
