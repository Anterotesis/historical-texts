         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEeing now by the providence of God, got out of the reach
of rigour, and fearing neither the doggedneſſe of a Iaylour
nor the Voyage of Barbadoes; but Enjoying the freedome
of my former life, and the companie of my Friends, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo how great a deſire you have to hear of me, both in my
own particular Fortune, and Succeſſe of that late Unfortunate
Army in the North, I acknowledge my ſelf bound in duety to
Satisfie your longing, and give you a true and perfite Relation
of the Progreſſe and Event of that Expedition, But shall remit
the Story of mine own Adventures and return, unto another
occaſion, it beeing but of ſmall moment, and the other ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be known of every one who loves Truth, of which I may
freely ſay; I can tell as much as any private Perſon that was in the
Journey, for beeing an Eye-witnes and Actor from the firſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of the Troupes, unto the day of the Deſaſter, and having
haunted the Chief Commanders for my better Information of
what paſt in the Army, I can the more aſſuredly give you an exact
accompt of the moſt Materiall Paſſages in that Expedition,
Wherein I proteſt before God, I shall ſtrip my ſelf of all Paſſion
and Partialitie, for the diſcharge of my Conſcience; and defence
of the Truth, to give you this free and following Narration,
Whatſoever malice may perhaps have blown abroad to Poyſon
the Seduced people with miſreports.</p>
            <p>I shall not here inſiſt upon the oppoſition made in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Scotland againſt the Levie, nor the Jealouſie that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
ſome, in the choice of the Commanders, as perhaps beeing
men who had their own ends, or aſpired to that Domination
which others had long Vſurped, and would be loath to lay down
again, both parties ſtill pretending the keeping of the Covenant,
and that Jealouſie was Fomented by the Miniſtrie, which every
day preached againſt the Engagement, There was alſo a Partie,
which not ſiding with any of the other two, preſſed the calling
<pb facs="tcp:35200:3"/>
home of the Prince, ſo to decide all differences, &amp; prevent heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning
in the point of Command, at which time alſo a black
cloud in the Weſt did threaten a Deludge to deſtroy the good
deſigne, but that was ſoon Diſſipate by the wiſedome and valour
of the Earle of Calander, Leivetenant Generall of the Army,
and Middleton Leivetenant Generall of the Horſe at Machlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore,
by order from the Lord Duke Hamilton. And not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
His Grace receaved order from the Committee of Eſtates,
to march ſpeedily to the English border, for ſecuring of Carlile,
and oppoſing of Major Generall Lambert, mean while all the
ſtrong holds of the Kingdom as Edinburgh, Sterling, Dumbarton,
and the reſt were yet in the hands of the well-affected Partie, (as
was ſuppoſed) or might have been eaſily ſecured, But what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
were made concerning the Forces in Ireland, led by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Major George Monro, for the finding of moneyes to pay
and tranſport them, it beeing reſolved they should be under the
Command of the Earle of Crawford Lindſay Treaſurer, I need
not to relate, and therefore to begin my Journall, take it thus.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of July, His Grace appointed a Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
at Annan; where the ſmall number that reſorted at firſt made
us ſtay ſome few dayes. Upon the 8 We entered England, and
quartered that night at Rokliff, the next day the Army marched
by Carlile, and quartered at Thursby, there the Generall receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the keyes of the Town, and Caſtle, from Sir Philip Muſgrave,
went up into the Caſtle, and gave order our ammunition should
be left there, though the cuſtody of both was ſtill in the hands of
the English, for ſome few dayes, which showed how great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
he had in them, at Thursby diverſe horſe and foot of ours
came unto us and we heard that ſome, both horſe and foot were
come over out of Ireland, landed in Galloway; and marching
toward Dumfries, there alſo we ſaw Sir Marmaduck Langdalls
foot, and one Troup of horſe, which were all proper men, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Major Lambert was then at Penreth, toward which upon Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the 14 we advanced, but were benighted &amp; came short 2 or 3
<pb facs="tcp:35200:3"/>
miles, yet having got two horſemen priſoners, diſcovered the
Enemy, and ſo poſing our guards it beeing very late, we quartered
there. Next morning early our Cavalrie advanced (the weather
beeing very rainie) and the foot following, found that Lambert
with his Forces was retired that night towards Appleby (in which
Caſtle he had a gariſon,) our intention was to overtake his Rear,
but we were informed that they were for certain at Appleby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were two miles paſt Penreth, Which made us ſtay and
quarter there that night, and the next day which was Sunday,
upou Moonday ſetting forward toward Appleby with our horſe,
We diſcovered a body of Lamberts Cavalrie, which being preſt
upon by ſome of ours, was forced to retire within the barricade
near unto the bridge at Appleby, which our folks could not force
for want of the foot, whom the rain and waters did extreamlie
hinder in their march; the Enemy having his foot at the barricade
neither could our horſe paſſe the River to reach Lamberts
Army which was on the other ſide, by reaſon of the great inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
through exceſſive raines, in the evening ſome few foot
came up to us, and we endeavouring to gain the Bridge were
prevented by night, ſome few of each ſide beeing killed and hurt,
amongſt whom Colonell Hariſon of theirs was wounded, and
the Earle of Calander receaved a muſquet shot upon his left ſide,
that night our Cavalrie remained on the fields, and Sir Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duck
Langdalls foot came up, but ours ſtayed at Kirby-Thure,
that ſame night alſo Lambert marched over Stain-moore. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yet a gariſon in Appleby Caſtle, before which Sir Marmaduck
with his foot, lay down till the Surrender thereof, during which
time, Sir Thomas Tilſley had a Commiſſion given him, for the
raiſing of Forces in Lancashire, out of Furnis, and their-abouts,
the next day the Duke ſent back freely a Lievetenant to Lambert
who had been taken the day before, and diſpoſing the horſe into
ſeverall quarters we ſtayed there a fortnight waiting for our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ammunition and meall, while we ſtayed at Kirby-Thure, it
was much preſt that the Irish Forces might joyn with us, and the
<pb facs="tcp:35200:4"/>
Cannon be left behind which was not verie conſiderable beeing
but 4 ſix pound balls, and 2 twelve, in the Counſell of warre alſo
it was debated whither the Army should march into Yorkshire,
to follow Lambert, or through Lancashire, which was a plentifull
Country, and into which our ammunition might with greater
ſafety come unto us, the other being waſted and ſpoiled by the
Enemy, at laſt it was reſolved to march into Lancashire, it was
likewiſe propounded to put the Kingdom of Scotland in a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of defence, by raiſing of an Army to be commanded by the
Earle of Lanrick. From Kirby-Thure we marched in two
dayes to Kendall, where Generall Major George Monro a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and worthie commander (whoſe courage and conduct in the
warres of Ireland, have with credit gained him an honourable
name,) came unto us, and the Duke was again deſired thoſe
Forces from Ireland might joyn with us, but what anſwer or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was given to Monro, himſelf beſt knowes, howſoever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his own Forces, and we marched from Kendall to
Hornby in Lancashire, and there again upon debate of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the horſe, which was extreamly ſtraited, it was ordained
they should march under the command of the Earle of Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Middleton, leaving two brigades of horſe, and the Dukes
own leiff-guard to remain with him, upon the rear of the Foot:
and the Irish Forces, with Monro, were again urged to be joyned
with the Army, by showing what danger they might incurre, He
marching by the Enemies gariſons and from Skipton, if they
should fall in betwixt him and us, which was of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
then the leaving of the Cannon, We having found the
wickednes of the way ſo troubleſome for carriages, that night
the Cavalrie paſt by the Town of Lancaſter, and quartered at
Garſtang, which was upon the 13 of Auguſt, the next morning,
I ſaw his Grace, and the Earle of Calander, upon a hill, near Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,
into which he had ſent Sir Thomas Tilſleys folk who were
playing with their Muſquets upon the Caſtle, and after confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
the Earle of Calander returned to his quarter at Garſtang.
<pb facs="tcp:35200:4"/>
Upon the 15 Sir Marmaduck Langdall, gave notice to Calander
and Middleton who were then quartered at Blackburn of the
Enemies advancing toward Skipton, and to the Duke alſo, as
Calander likewiſe did, whereupon the next morning Calander
and Middleton, meeting with Sir Marmaduck, at the Earle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalls
quarter, ſome 5 or 6 miles above Preſton, he confirmed the
intelligence of the Enemies advance, and deſired quarters nearer
Preſton, which was granted, and order given to the Lord Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton
to remove his brigade, as he did, drawing into a field,
where the foot was thought to have been, as was concluded before
at Hornby, that night Middleton returned to Blackburn, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
going to finde the Duke, whom he ſuppoſed to be at Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
according as was reſolved, by the way was informed that he
was 3 miles short of it, and quartered at Broughtoun with the
foot, which should have been a Preſton that night, which fault
was the main ground of all our misfortune, at laſt Calander com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Dukes quarter late, shew him of Sir Marmaducks
drawing nearer Preſton, and of the order given to thoſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord Levingſtouns Brigade to do the like, and how
his Grace was expected there with the Army, ſeeing the ſafety
thereof, depended wholly thereupon, the horſe being quartered
on the other ſide, toward Whiggin (except thoſe two brigades,
were left with him,) the Duke anſwered that he could not get car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
for the ammunition, Calander told him of the enemies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing,
&amp; that ſome of them had been ſeen among their friends,
as alſo by ſome Parties of Horſe who were ſent out to diſcover,
the Duke confeſt he had notice of it, but is was then late, and they
should ſpeak of it to morrow, But whither that ſecuritie proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a confidence, or weaknes, in a Generall God knowes.
Next morning Calander comming to him, asked where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
was, he anſwered that they marched timely in the morning,
and he thought by that time they were the length of Preſton;
(where they should have been the day before) afterward Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
asked him where were theſe two brigades of horſe which
<pb facs="tcp:35200:5"/>
were left with him, he ſaid hee had given them no orders, and
that they were ſtill lying in their quarters, not having ſent any
ordinance Ruyters to receave order, Whereupon I heard Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
ſay, he much admired his Grace had cauſed the Foot to
march, and not ſent order expreſſe to the horſe which marched
with him, though they had been wanting in that point, Seeing his
own ſafety and the Armies, was ſo deeply intereſt into it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
Calander ſent two expreſſe (leaſt the Enemy should
fall in betwixt them, as they did:) with orders to thoſe brigades,
to march to Preſton, and joyn with the foot, which nevertheles,
they could not, after breakfaſt the Duke called for his horſe, it
beeing about nine a-clock, and as he was going to get up, Sir Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduck
came, where I heard Calander ſay, your Grace is too far
from your Army, get on before he light, which he did, &amp; ſo they
ſaluted on horſe-back riding towards the Army, within twice
twelve ſcore, one came and told Sir Marmaduck, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was falling upon his rear, (you muſt know that he had ſtill
marched upon our left hand, from his quartering at Settle and
Sigelſwyk) and thereupon they all fell a galloping, untill they
came near Preſton, to the entry of the lane upon the end of the
moore, where they found Leivetenant Generall Baylie, with the
Foot, drawn up in battle, and all the baggage by him, yet a little
before we came to the foot, we were told it was but a miſtake,
though shortly after the Enemy did appear, and fell a skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Sir Marmaducks rear, when Calander Baylie and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
Turner comming to the Duke, after ſome diſcourſe amongſt
them, order was given to the Foot to paſſe the bridge, ſome of the
Enemies horſe showing themſelves upon the heath on our left
hand. Then the Earle of Calander deſired the Duke to ſend for
Middleton with the Cavalrie, and whilſt the foot were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Duke thought fit to leave three brigades upon the
moore to favour Sir Marmaducks retreat, which Calander de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
his Grace to conſider, and that commanded muſquetiers
would be better in thoſe narrow lanes, whereof the beſt both of
<pb facs="tcp:35200:5"/>
Officers &amp; Souldiours might be piked out, and ſo they were and
Calander commanded out 500 Muſquetiers to line the hedges
and 600 more further down towards the end of the bridge, (if
the enemies horſes should advance) and a brigade conſiſting of
the Earle of Roxburghs regiment, and Colonell Tours to favour
Sir Marmaducks retreat, on the other hand two parties of Horſe
were commanded out of thoſe few troupes we had to diſcover the
enemies advance which left but few remaining, by reaſon of a
partie had been ſent to Sir Marmaduck at his own deſire, the two
brigades not beeing come up, for the Lord Levingſtouns brigade
being preſt by the enemy had paſt the water marching down on
the other ſide towards Preſton bridge, where he came about two
of the clock in the after-noon, and having ſent before to receave
orders the Duke commanded one Glaſſe who did the duety of
Quarter-maſter Generall, to give out quarters for his brigade in
ſuch Towns as he named, and that after ſight of the billet hee
should march to his quarter, there was likewiſe, afterward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hundred commanded which the Earle of Calander deſired
might ſtay untill they ſaw whether the enemy did advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the moore, in regard there were ſo few horſe there (the
word and ſign beeing then given) but ſeeing none advanced, that
hundred horſe with the ſame officers was ſent to Sir Marmaduck,
beſides 200 muſquetiers which had been ſent before; though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanded
of him, but the Scots foot and baggage were ſo long in
marching and paſſing the narrow lane and bridge as ſpent much
time, and ammunition, Sir Marmaduck ſending twice or thrice
for ſupplie of ammunition which he had, the Duke remained ſtill
on the head of thoſe few horſe never viſiting Sir Marmaducks
poſt, but Calander riding to and again, betwixt the horſe and foot
where the moſt eminent danger did appear, went up to Sir Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduck
to know what he wanted (though he had no intereſt in
his Army) the other thanked him kindly and deſired to know if
the whole Army was paſt, Calander told him it was very near,
Whereupon Sir Marmaduck entreated him that he might know
<pb facs="tcp:35200:6"/>
of it and Calander aſſured him he should do it, thereafter it was
my fortune to be near the Duke, when Calander came to him, his
Grace asked where he had been, and why he did not ſtay upon
the head of the horſe, he anſwered that he did not conceive the
greateſt danger to be there in regard the enemies horſe did not
advance.</p>
            <p>But let me here ſtay a little, while the foot and baggage are
paſſing the bridge to conſider the reaſons given for this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
our Cavalrie being far diſtant, and the enemie according to
Sir Marmaducks intelligence, beeing ſaid to have divided his
Forces, whereof ſome part was marched toward Colne &amp; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
was it not likelie that Sir Marmaduck was able to deall
with them having betwixt 3 and 4 thouſand foot, and 7 or 8 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horſe, with the aſſiſtance of ſome of our horſe which was
marching towards us? Or ſay, was it fit to expoſe our foot having
no horſe but a handfull to the enemies whole Cavalrie and Foot,
Upon a flat campagne or moore if his intelligence was falſe? His
Graces great judgement and long experience (having been twice
before a Generall, by ſea and land, at home and abroad; together
with his earneſt deſire of that command, notwithſtanding the
advice of his friends to the contrary, and the jealouſie that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all men of him, which rather kindled then quenche the fire of
his high ſpiritfull of his own ſufficiency) was no queſtion capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to weigh any counſell in the ſcales of Reaſon, whether it were
of valour to be taken or not, and therefore I may ſay in all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
who ever gave it, was no raw nor fresh-water ſouldiour,
however the end proved, and now the foot and baggage beeing
almoſt paſt the bridge, the Earle of Calander drew the Troupes
nearer unto it within the lane, where he and Colonell Turner (I
fortuned to be with them for the time alſo) riding back to the
Townes end of Preſton toward the bridge, we found a Troup re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from thence upon ſight of us, whereat we wondered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
by their armes and ſign, (which was a green bough) We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
them to be enemy (for ours was white) Whereupon the
<pb facs="tcp:35200:6"/>
Earle of Calander called to the Muſquetiers to give fire, which
though they did not upon the order, yet the Enemy hearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
within the lane, and himſelf advancing gave fire with his
piſtoll upon them and they faced about, So he and I parted about
this time I was informed that Captain Watſone who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dukes lieff-guard of horſe doth affirm that he beeing on
Preſtoun-moore perceiving the enemies horſe to be drawing out
of an narrow lane into the moore where they ſtood, he went to his
Grace who was cloſe by and shew him of it beſeeching him to
give them leave to charge the enemy before they should be in
order, hoping with that advantage, to give him an accompt of
them, but contrair to his expectation the Duke in paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him not to looſe a piſtoll upon no pretext whatſoever, I
riding afterward towards the bridge, heard a great noiſe behind
me, the enemy turning again toward the Town and all our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
running, comming near I found ſome ſtragglers and baggage
horſe, and after a little while Calander came alone, his horſe
much ſpent &amp; wearied, who gave preſently order to Rally theſe
ſtragglers and rode himſelf and brought Kelheads Regiment of
foot which was upon the rear and ſaid the muſquetiers into ſome
dry ditches near the bridge, the pikes he placed in the moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
ground, the enemy advanced preſently but our men
giving fire upon them they retired again to purſue the reſt of our
people, who had quited their ground, We not having any Horſe
and Baylie beeing with the foot upon a hill, half a mile diſtant
from the bridge on the other ſide of the water, then came one to
the Earle of Calander telling him that the enemy was paſſing the
River, below the bridge at a Church, whereupon giving order to
Kelhead to make good that poſt, promiſing to ſupplie him with
fresh men, if it were needfull: and having ſent before to Baylie for
300 muſquetiers he met them by the way as he was going to the
Church and ſent Leivetenant Colonell Halſt with one hundred
and fresh ammunition to the bridge, another hundred he left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a little hill betwixt the bridge and the Army, and the third he
<pb facs="tcp:35200:7"/>
took along to the Church where it was ſaid that the enemy was
paſſing, where beeing come he found no ſuch thing, then leaving
ſome to man the Church-yard he and Colonell Turner, came
back and heard that they were paſſing above which made them
rerire to the Leagger where they met the Duke (who told them
how narrowly he had eſcaped, and almoſt been taken priſoner,
in the Town of Preſton) and there they were again told of the
Enemies paſſing above, the Earle of Calander preſently called fo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
horſe, it was long before any came: And theſe few only of the
Lord Kenmoores, with which he drew down to the bridge to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
the foot, but the third time beeing advertiſed that they were
paſſing above the bridge, he drew towards the place, and ſending
out three horſemen before, followed with the reſt, till on the way
thoſe three returning told him there was no ſuch matter, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome of our own ſtragglers paſſing which were routed on the
other ſide, and comming back toward the bridge: he found that
the enemy had forced it after a long and hard diſpute through
the advantage of the ground and cover of houſes and hedges,
whereas on our ſide it was very low and no shelter at all, and was
purſuing of our folks toward the Leagger, which made him cauſe
a houſe bee ſet on fire in their way a little below the Leagger,
about a muſquet shot, The day being near ſpent a ſmall party of
the enemy paſſing by the ſecond bridge followed up the hill
within a lane where the Duke, Calander, Baylie, and many other
Officers were ſtanding on the other ſide of the hedge within the
foot Leagger, the muſquetiers having order to give fire, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
retreated but we had no horſe to follow; Kennioores Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
beeing retired behind the foot, then a counſell was called,
where the Duke, Calander, Baylie, Colonell Turner, the Earle of
Dumfries, the Lord Bargeny, and many other Officers were (Sir
Lewis Dives was there likewiſe) there Calander enclyned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to a moore on this ſide of Wiggan, where we might expect
our horſe and attend the enemy to fight them. But afterwards
upon ſome conſideration finding the impoſſibility of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:35200:7"/>
the ammunition hee altered his opinion (as I heard) and
though the moſt part of the Votes run in that ſtrain yet he upon
more mature deliberation, diſaſſented from it, proteſting he
would bear no blame if things did not ſucceed according to his
wish and reall intention. The Duke replyed it was concluded
and too late to oppoſe, giving order to the Regiments to ſend
for as much ammunition as they pleaſed, and that Calander
should march preſently with thoſe few horſe they had then there
toward Standish-moore, the night beeing very dark, and the lanes
narrow and deep, a Regiment of foot which was advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the horſe Rencountring, ſome of our own horſe who had
been quartered with Middleton (and by ſome of the foot ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers
were ſuppoſed to be enemy; upon whom they gave fire)
took the alarm ſo hot that many quited their armes, Whereupon
Calander advanced and found them to be our own, ſo he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on to the moore where he halted till it was day, (that night we
left our ammunition) but before that it was day the Duke had
paſt through the Troupes and was gone to Wiggan, where Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
and the Earle of Traquair went to him there he asking
for Middleton, they told him they had no notice of him but that
he was marched towards Preſton, and was in the Rear, and that
the foot were advancing into the moore, showing alſo how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
his preſence was to encourage the Souldiours after ſo ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and hard marches as they had, Then he deſired Calander to
draw them all up in battell upon the moore: &amp; he would follow,
which was ſtraightway done, &amp; after ſome time the Duke came,
Leivetenant Generall Middleton according to his order ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
toward Preſton, and not finding the Army retired after
them, and the enemy falling upon his rear he repulſed them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
times, and forced them to give back, carrying himſelf moſt
bravely like a gallant man, and wiſe commander, and came to
the moore about ten a-clock, where he found the foot, and thoſe
horſe they had with them drawn up, the Marques of Argyles Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
and the dragoons were placed at the entry of the moore
<pb facs="tcp:35200:8"/>
to favour his retreat, and ſtaying there till two a-clock ſome ſmall
parties of the enemy skirmishing, it was reſolved to march, the
body of the horſe firſt leavying upon the rear of the foot, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Major Vandrosk, Leivetenant Colonell Iames Innes, and
Leivetenant Colonell David Lindſay with ſome troupes of
horſe, together with Argyles Regiment of foot, and Colonell
Mills few dragoons, in this order the Army marched, and the
Earle of Calandar, Middleton, Baylie, and Turner, ſtayed upon
the moore, untill the moſt of them were marched into the lane,
Middleton then advancing to the horſe, Calander remained till
the whole rear of the foot was entred the lane, at which time hee
had notice given him of the enemies advancing upon the right
hand to fall in betwixt the horſe and foot, between there &amp; Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
upon the advertiſment he advanced to know the certainty,
but it proved falſe in regard of ſome marish ground, and no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Enemy there, afterward comming to Wiggan hee
found the Duke, (of whom he went to receave orders) at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Town marching with the horſe, but by the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the lane and narrownes of the bridge, together with the
deepnes of the way, many of the foot which was extreamly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
having before ſuffered hugely in the want of victuals was
loſt, and the horſe were a long time in paſſing the water, ſo as
night drew on when Middleton hearing of the enemy upon the
Rear went back and there the Officers of the commanded
Troupes of horſe behaving themſelves like brave men were moſt
hurt and taken. The Duke ſending for Calander told him hee
should do well to march on with the Cavalrie to Warringtoun,
where there was a paſſe and bridge of which he much feared the
Enemy should poſſeſſe themſelves, and ſo bring the Army into
great inconveniences, a little after as he was marching, the Duke
ſent him word he would yet ſpeak with him ſo he let the Troupes
march on forward thorow the narrow lanes, (it beeing moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light)
and ſtayed till the Duke and Sir Marmaduck came up to
him, there the Duke again showed him his apprehenſion of the
<pb facs="tcp:35200:8"/>
Enemies ſeazing upon that paſſe from the neighbour Gariſons,
willing him to march without ever halting untill he had made
himſelf maſter of the ſame, Calander forth-with ſending a Partie
before to diſcover the Enemy, and ſave the ſtragglers, from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
by reaſon of the night, (ſome of Sir Marmaducks and
our<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo being gone out before) when we were within a mile of
Warrington, we heard that the Enemy had taken in the Bridge,
but upon the advance of our fore-troupes had again quited and
was run away, before we entered the Town, the Duke and Sir
Marmaduck came up, and there lighting his Grace ſent order to
Leivetenant Generall Middleton, &amp; Baylie, to advance thither,
ſeeing the next day they were to march to White-Church; and
ſo for the Peak, Calander gave order for the Horſe to Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
the next morning at the bridge, the moſt part beeing quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
on the other ſide, but betimes newes was brought that the
Enemy had routed the Foot, though the Generall had not heard
any thing from Baylie, nor Middleton, about eight a clock at the
Rendevous, we heard that the Enemy was paſſing the River
upon our left hand, Whereupon Calander ſent out a Partie to a
foard, and a little after I ſaw the Duke march by, to the top of the
hill where Sir Marmaducks Horſe were, and but few of the Scots
Horſe were yet come to the Rendevous, there I heard the Earle
of Calander ask Colonell Mill, if any of his Dragoons were come
up, his anſwer was, none, by reaſon they were all diſperſed in the
evening before, by this time Sir Marmaducks Troopes were
marching off the hill, and Calander with his own three Troopes,
and three of the Earle of Errolls, which were all verie weak reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the top of the hill, where hee was told that orders were ſent
to the Foot to make their own conditions, But let me here tell
you, that I beleeve, if that had been propounded to Calander
Hee would have been as refractary from it, as he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon the like occaſion concerning the Horſe, there
he was likewiſe told that the Duke was marched after Sir Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduck,
and after ſome ſtay there, not hearing any thing
<pb facs="tcp:35200:9"/>
hee marched after the Duke, ſuppoſing the intelligence to be
true, Sir Marmaduck marching ſtill on the Van, with his few
Horſe, and his Rear beeing pretty-well advanced before the
Scots horſe, ſome few of the Enemies Foot lying at a paſſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
out upon certain Stragglers of the Scots, but were preſently
beat back by the Lord Levingſtoun; and Major Drummond,
down to their Barricade, having loſt ſome, and others hurt; there
Calander made ſome Troupers light from their horſes, and force
their paſſage, thinking that to be the way, which was not, and
therefore we took to the left hand, and followed Sir Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducks
Troupes that were marched on with the Duke, about four
miles further at a halt, Middleton came up alone, and after ſome
conference returned, (with great diſcontent) to his Troupes
showing that the Foot was yeelded up at Warrington, we were
that night to quarter at White-Church, and upon the march I
heard an Officer of qualitie, propound to the Earle of Calander,
the neceſſity of thinking upon a Treaty, in regard of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
long and weariſome marches, they beeing in great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and their horſes tired, which if he and Middleton would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
unto, they put no queſtion but the Duke would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
but he abſolutely refuſed to hear of it, ſaying, they were
yet a conſiderable body of Horſe with which they might shortly
recover an Army of Foot, and that they were within a day and a
halfs marching, of a place where they might be in ſafety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
themſelves and their Horſes, but upon the march we were
ſo hindred with frequent, though falſe alarmes and halts, (no
Enemy beeing near us, but Gariſons) that we came short of
White-Church, 2 or 3 miles, and quartered in the fields that
night near Malpas, in Cheſshire, where Sir Marmaduck, Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Middleton, attended the Duke, reſolving from thence
to march to Vtoxater and to ſo Ashburn, in the Peak, that night
diverſe Officers left their Troupes, and rendred themſelves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
to the Enemy, which did much dishearten the Souldiours,
diverſe Officers likewiſe of the Foot, who would not accept of
<pb facs="tcp:35200:9"/>
the conditions which Leivetenant Generall Baylie made at
Warrington, came up to the Cavalrie, the next day we marched
about a mile beyond Drayton, and quartered in the fields, upon
the 12 of Auguſt we marched toward Vtoxater, and comming
near Stone a troup of the enemies which lay there, drew out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hill on our left hand, we ſaw alſo more troupes from Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord
upon our right hand, there at a halt, what paines Calander
and Middleton did take to get the diſorderly troupes, (whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
and diſobedience upon their Officers abandoning of
them, had forgot all reſpect unto command) into order, and bring
them under their ſtandards, can neither be expreſſed by me, nor
imagined by thoſe who have never ſeen the like mutiny, yet at
length they brought them to it. But by the way between the
bridge and Stone, I ſaw Calander and Middleton come to the
Duke, who shew them a letter he had receaved from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Shropshire, brought by two Committee men, the tenor
of it was to give quarters to the Duke, and his people upon lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of their armes, whereat they both did much wonder,
that a Committee would offer any ſuch thing to an Army, they
having no other Forces but their Gariſons, (but there was a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
amongſt the troupers, that a trumpet had been ſent to the
Enemy) Sir Marmaducks troupes having the Van marched tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Town, Calander with his next, and Middleton in the rear
placing a guard on this ſide of Stone, till all were paſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
were appointed by the Duke, to ſtay and dine in the
Town, upon a halt on the other ſide, I ſaw the Duke, Calander, Sir
Marmaduck, &amp; Middleton, ſpeaking together where there came
a Trumpet to them, from Staffoord, who belonged to ſome of
thoſe who had rendred themſelves priſoners the night before,
here a Trouper upon ſome queſtion shot Captain Gray, and was
piſtold by publick order for it. So on we marched for Utoxater,
Sir Marmaduck in the Van of all, the Duke in the Van of the
Scottish horſe, Calander in the middle, and Middleton in the rear
having marched about two miles in narrow lanes, (it began to
<pb facs="tcp:35200:10"/>
rain hugely) the Staffoord troupes beeing upon our rear, Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
gave order to charge them, but ſome troupers repining ſaid it
was nothing to bid charge, whereunto he replyed that it was not
his cuſtome to be ſparing of himſelf upon any occaſian that was
needfull, and therewithall bid them follow him, and charged like
a gallant man, and wiſe commander, thereby to animate his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
horſemen, and show them a good example, in ſuch an
extreamity, but beeing upon the ſide of a hill, and the ground ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſlipperie thorow the great raines, his horſe fell and he was
taken priſoner, and the night drawing on, the enemy retired being
preſt by Colonell Lockhart, who was in the rear with him, the reſt
of the horſe were drawn up upon a moore, where there came
two Countrey Gentlemen to the Duke, but from whence or
what they brought, I could not learn. Upon the notice of
Middletons beeing taken, Calander faced about and marched
to the rear, where ſpeaking to the ſouldiours, he deſired them
now to do for the honour of their Nation, which then had ſo
much ſuffered, and the recovery of ſo gallant a man, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them never to leave them if they would but perform
their part, and with that reſolution went on to reſcue Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
untill he underſtood from Colonell Lockhart, that the
Enemy was retired, Whereupon hee returned to the moore,
where he halted untill the rear came up, before which time
it was dark night, beeing then about 4 miles from Utoxater,
unto which by reaſon of the darknes and foulnes of the way,
it was very late before the troupes did come, quartering moſt
upon the fields and ſtreets, next morning betimes Calander,
and Sir Matmaduck, attended the Generall, who was a bed
(becauſe of a pain in his leggs,) there he having heard before
that Calander was marched away, with the moſt part of the
horſe told it him, but Calander anſwered that he had not
uſed to give any orders where his Grace was, but ſuch as he
receaved from him, there it was debated what was next to be
done, But then Sir Marmaduck shew the neceſſity of his
<pb facs="tcp:35200:10"/>
marching when it was propounded to Capitulate, and that
hee could expect no quarter, Calander alſo declared plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that upon no tearms hee would conſent to a Capitulation,
but ſuch Troupes or Troupers as would march with him he
would undergo the ſame hazard with Sir Marmaduck, and they
might follow him, which the Duke hearing, ſaid that he would
not ſtay behind, and therewith Sir Marmaduck and Calander
went to horſe, and gave order to the Troupes to draw out to a
hill, about half a mile on the other ſide of the Town beyond the
River, yet it was long before any conſiderable number came to
the place, and Sir Marmaduck ſending to Calander, to know if
he was ready, my Lord deſired him to have a little patience, but
he ſent him back word that the day was well advanced, and hee
was to have a long march he could not, and ſo marched away,
which Calander ſeeing ſpoke to the Officers and Souldiours,
willing them to repair to their ſtandards in order, but none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
or very few did, though he aſſured them that he would die
with his armes in his hand, after ſuch misfortune, rather then
Capitulate, yet what ever he ſaid, was little regarded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Duke was abſent no man obeyed, at laſt he told them,
that ſuch as had a minde to show themſelves men, for the credit
of their Countrey, might march along with him, and thoſe that
were ill mounted and had a minde to treat, might ſtay with the
Duke, but few offered to ſtirre, ſo that he rode after Sir
Marmaduck alone, to show him how things ſtood, and take
leave of him, comming back he found ſome Officers ſent from
the Duke, to deſire his return for conſultation, and the Duke
gave order that a partie should be ſent back to Utoxater, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Army might return, and there deliberate of what should
be done, to that effect the Lord Levinſtoun was ſent, and Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
viſited all the avenues and barricaded them, poſing guards
every where, then orders beeing given, for all Officers to repair
to the Duke, Hee then deſired Calander to go and adviſe with
them what was moſt expedient, thereupon Calander asked him
<pb facs="tcp:35200:11"/>
whither to march, or to fight, he was ready to obey, but if it
were to Capitulate he abſolutely diſclamed it, and ſo went to his
quarter, where he inſtantly gave order to the diſmounted men,
and Stragglers of the Foot, to go to the Church-yard, and that all
Officers that were quartered in the Town, should bring thither
ſuch armes as could be found there, for arming of them Theſe
Officers who were aſſembled by the Dukes order having deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there opinions, when Calander came back, the Duke told him
they had found it fit to ſend a trumpet to the Enemy, but Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
replyed that he diſaſſented from ſuch a baſe way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would give no advice, nor adhere to their Treaty, neither
be included into it, but rather die like a man of honour, fighting
if he could finde but ten men, to share in his fortune with him,
the Duke notwithſtanding ſent out a Trumpet, and in a short
while after, ſome Troupers drew up on the markat-place before
his lodging (which certainly was not done without the knowledge
of ſome chief Officers,) for when Calander went out to ſpeak to
them, they were not ſo well inſtructed as afterwards, till putting
them in minde of the Oath he made unto them the night before
never to leave them, if they would play the part of gallant men,
but that he would upon no condition Capitulate, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to run the uttermoſt hazard of his life with honour, then
condeſcend to ſo baſe a way of Treaty, if otherwayes he could
not eſcape the hands of his Enemies, at length they ſeemed to
be a little ſatisfied, ſo he returned to the Dukes lodging, and
Colonell Lockhart was ſent down to diſmiſſe them, but toward
the evening, their number increaſed and ſeaſing upon Calanders
Horſe and armes, they would not ſuffer him to go out of the
Dukes lodging, but keept him there priſoner, nor were any of
his ſervants permitted to come near him, but before that uproar
began, aſſoon as it was concluded by the Duke, and the other
Officers to ſend and Capitulate, the trumpet beeing gone, Major
Gib and another were ſent as Oſtages. In the evening the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
came back, and one of the Enemies with him, who found us
<pb facs="tcp:35200:11"/>
in this poſture of munity, and that encreaſing hourly, (it was
then clear moon-shine) when they roſe to ſuch a height that they
releived the guards, which the Leivetenaut General had poſed,
ſent up 2 or 3 of their number to the Dukes chamber, with their
armes in their hands, as Commiſſioners from the reſt, which he
ſeeing, declared to them that he had no minde to leave them, and
ſpoke unto the whole body upon the market place, out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
the Enemies trumpet who was in the next room heard all,
Calander incenſed with that ſcurvy dealling, told that ſuch baſe
way of detaining him priſoner was not the meanes to get good
quarters, beſide the dishonour of it, Whereupon ſome words
paſt betwixt the Duke and him, upon his averring of the ſame,
as they ſate down to Supper, he ſtill telling him he would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to any Treaty but die ſooner, if he could not otherwiſe
eſcape, and that they would repent and quite their poſts if the
Enemy did once approach. at laſt after diverſe falſe alarmes that
night, toward the morning they had one for certain of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
advance, which made theſe mutiniers abandon the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
returning ſome of the Earle of Calanders horſes, and
armes unto his quarter, at which time the Duke beeing in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
bed, Calander took horſe with ſome few Officers, and viſited
all the poſts; where there was yet no ſight of the Enemy, after
having told the Duke, that he would upon no condition Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and that ſo often before, but particularlie when the Lord
Kenmoore parted when it was alſo time for him to be gone, as
any judicious man may think, ſeeing the duke had Capitulate,
and ſent out Oſtages, and ſo with his Nephew the Lord Leving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fton,
&amp; ſome others he went away leaving the Duke to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but as he came about a quarter of a mile from the Town, he
was told by certain Officers, and ſome Country people, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was given from ſome Officers at Utoxater to barricade the
end of the lane, whereby neither Officer nor Souldiour might
eſcape that way, and drawing up thoſe Troupers that came with
him, he again told them as before he had done, that all ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:35200:12"/>
were ill mounted or had a minde to Capitulate, might return
to the Duke, and though he had no guide yet notwithſtanding
holding faſt to his firſt reſolution he would take his hazard,
and then riding on with the number of ſixſcore horſe or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
Himſelf took the charge of one third part, giving an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to the Lord Levingſtoun, and the third to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Colonell Keyth, brother to the Earle Marshall,
paſt through Asburn, intending to follow Sir Marmaduck
Langdall; but there he was informed of his disbanding of his
people, and marching on further, came amongſt hills, where
the Countrey people roſe in armes upon him, and there by
reaſon many horſes loſt their shooes with ſo long marching,
diverſe were taken priſoners, Colonell Keyth with the firſt,
by ſome of the troupes of Darby, but marching on ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cheſterfield, about the evening beeing within a mile
and a half of the Town, intending to have paſt through it,
and there halting to know whether there were any of the
Enemy quartered, night fell on, and the Countrey all about,
firing to give notice of us, we were informed that ſome troupes
were come there, and before we could get on horſe-back, a
partie of foot fell upon us, which we repulſed killing ſome,
and ſo marcht away, (it beeing very dark) to the right hand
toward Bolſover, the Lord Levingſtoun having the Rear,
with Major Drummond and other Officers before we came
near Bolſover loſt their way, we then halting upon a heath,
and miſſing them, beeing very few in number, our horſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
wearied, the Earle of Calander marched back a mile,
to ſee if he could learn any thing of them, whom not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(and it beeing very rainie weather) hee intended not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
(if he could) to march to Pomfret. But being
miſled by the guide he then had, thoſe few Officers which
were remaining, aſſoon as it was day, (the Countrey beeing
full of the enemies Troupes;) thought it fitteſt every man to
shift for himſelf, and ſo we parted, recommending one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:35200:12"/>
to the protection of God, and I took my own way, not
doubting but that ſame providence which had brought mee
ſo far in an Unfortunate journey, would yet bring me out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
bnt what befell me in my taking afterwards, and my priſon,
(from which I am now by the grace of God got free) before I
found Scots ground to go upon, Shall bee the Subject of your
next entertaynment.</p>
            <p>And now, to conclude all our misfortunes, and end this tedious
diſcourſe, I shall briefly tell you, that after all the difficulties, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and delayes, in the levying of the Army in Scotland, our
ſlow march at our entry into England, wanting proviſion, and
waiting for the cannon and ammunition, the not joyning of the
Forces from Ireland, and the Dukes falling short of Preſton, (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the enemy a fair opportunity to fall in betwixt the horſe and
the foot) then the leaving of the ammunition, was the loſſe of the
foot, the tampering to Capitulate diſcouraged the horſemen, and
the Dukes deſign to treat, after ſo many great overſights, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the mutiny at Utoxater, loſt the horſe shamefully,
when they might have been ſaved to recover a new Army of foot
again; And thus craving you pardon for my prolixity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
you ſo long in a diſcourſe which could not be contracted
in fewer words, when the full and plain Truth was to bee told, I
here take my leave, what reſts concerning my ſelf, and our
other Friends, you shall hear at another occaſion from,</p>
