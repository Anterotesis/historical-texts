            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>I Haue obserued (gentle Reader) from the words and writings of the learned, that it is a Maxime or Rule in Philosophie; <hi>Finis est primus in intentione,</hi> The end aymed at is first setled in the intention of man: And finding this Romanist to boast and brag much of his learning, it is not vnlike, that like a cunning Clerke (whatsoeuer his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be) the ende of this his worke was the first ground of his writing.</p>
            <p>He proclaimeth Temperance in his title, he pursueth the Art of Rayling in the whole processe following, and in the end of all, he perswadeth ruine both to Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: In the first dissimulation, in the second scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the third trecherie is contained; for he shakes handes with Temperance at the verie first, and leaueth her to rest and remaine with his title, and the leafe being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he plungeth presently into his vaine of rayling, which (if he had affected Temperance) he would neuer haue done, and the end sheweth his intention to be to bring in either a tolleration or flat alteration of Religion.</p>
            <p>But wilt thou know (Christian Reader) what forced this fellow to become so suddenly distempred? My <hi>Watch-word</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20447:3"/>
presented vnto thee to prepare thee with a couragious heart, and readie hand, to resist forraine malice, and home treason, plotted and purposed by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Soueraigne and Countrie, hath wakened him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, and out of the lightnesse of his braine (through ouer-watching of himselfe to deuise and worke mischiefe) he tearmeth this my booke (in the beginning of his Preface) an iniurious Pamphlet and a <hi>biting Libell</hi>: my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours therein he calleth a base exercise of calumniation and rayling, and in the matter thereof it pleaseth him to say; I spare neither God nor man, <hi>So farre forth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Catholike cause, or the cause of them,</hi> and for this I must receiue my checke and refutation at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>The iniurie he chargeth me to haue done is to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, of whose doctrine and dealing I confesse (in my former booke) I warne thee to beware: as for the tearme of a byting Libell, thou wilt say (gentle Reader) when thou hast peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him and me both ouer, that it is a more fit addition to the title of his temperate <hi>Ward-word</hi> which is byting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is full of rayling, and is a Libell, because it is slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous against her Maiestie, and the seat of her Iustice, and is thrust out without name: as for the basenes of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise imputed to me for writing and publishing that booke, and the cause thereof, indeed it is a verie base thing to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, and rayle as he doth; but to lay before Subiects the doctrine and deeds of disloyaltie, and to warne them to take heed thereof, as I haue endeuoured therein to doe, will proue neither calumniation nor rayling.</p>
            <p>If any simple seduced Catholike stand free from subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the disloyal doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; from doing that it directeth and teacheth, he is not touched by me; therefore
<pb facs="tcp:20447:3"/>
this Champion that draweth all Catholikes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of my words wrongeth them more then I doe: but he might haue spared to name the God of heauen, as a partie in his Catholike cause, till he can proue the cause warranted from God, and his truth, which he shall neuer do; yet I must receiue this worthie Gentlemans checke for my labour, but he shall find it is farre from a mate, and that his Bishops are too weake to bring it to that.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman saith he is verie loath to be ouer eager and sharpe with me in his Encounters, not onely in his owne worshipfull disposition, but also for the reuerent respect he carrieth to the house and family I come of, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler affection he feeleth towards some of my name and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; but this is no sooner vttered then that he breaketh out presently into these words: <hi>Who will not confesse but that lying, forging, and falsifying, ignorant vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, odious scoffing, malicious calumniations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious interpretations, bloudie exaggerations, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous insultations, ouer them that alreadie are in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and calamitie, ought to be farre from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pen and tongue of a Knight or Gentleman?</hi> And who would haue thought that so temperate a title could haue afforded so vntemperate a stile? Againe, who would haue expected such raging and rayling Rhetoricke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me from one of so milde a disposition, as he professeth to be of, and that caried so reuerend a respect to the family whereof I am a braunch, and such a feeling affection to some of my name as he would perswade?

            <p>But he is prouoked by me to breake out into choler for that I not onely (saith he) <hi>Touch the honours, states, and liuings of home-borne subiects, and bring them into question, vniustly being no waie tollerable, but rush further to the open assault of forraine Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, also their honours, fame and reputations which is lesse tollerable, and consequently hath neede of some more sharpe and forcible reiection.</hi> The former persons meant by him are made apparant before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them I onely say this in this place, I wish them all from my heart, that as they are home-borne, so they may be home-hearted Subiects, that their Soueraigne and countrie may enioye them sound English Subiects indeed: as for his Monarches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne</hi> hee hath no cause to carpe at me, but to blame themselues, for it is they, and not I that haue teinted their honours, fame, and reputations, the first of them hauing long sought to depose her Maiestie from her regall and supreame right within her owne Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the other hauing made attempts to inuade and make a conquest of her land, and both of them hauing conspired the death of her Maiestie by setting on both bastard borne, English and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Blessed was Ierusalem by the testimonie of the Lords owne mouth when he said: <hi>My beloued had a Vineyard in a very fruitfull hill, and he hedged it, &amp; gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out the stones of it, and he planted it with the best plants, and built a Tower in the middest thereof, and made a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse therein:</hi> But when he looked for grapes, and it brought forth wild-grapes, the Lord threatned from the height of this blessed estate, to cast them into the gulfe of miserie, to take away the hedge from his

Vineyard, that it might be eaten vp, and breake downe the wall thereof that it might be troden downe, &amp;c.

For, as for the late tumults and stirres of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is euident to whom they are to be ascribed by the sending thither of <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and of Italian bandes by the Pope, who is the common Trumpeter of Sedition in all Christian Common-weales, which seeke to shake off the yoke of his tyrannie: There kindled (vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) the flame of Rebellion in the North, but (bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God) it vanished quickly like a smoke, <hi>Spayne</hi> likewise attempted an inuasion, but with such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, as neither hath he cause to boast of his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor wee to complaine of our losses; for as the starres fought in their course for <hi>Israel</hi> against <hi>Sisera,</hi> so did the windes for <hi>England</hi> against <hi>Spayne:</hi> other warres to speake of, we haue had none, but such as we haue voluntarily vnder-taken, for the reliefe and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of those that were oppressed.</p>

Is it not strange that these men either so vnconscionably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise that openly, and generally, which they dare not auow, and iustifie? or so impudently denie, that, which they doe so commonly practise the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine is (saith this Champion) that the Popes and Churches Indulgences auaile not to remooue mortall sinnes, &amp;c. neither doth the pardon remit the

guilt of sinne, &amp;c. But (Sir) whatsoeuer your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is in this point, your practise is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; neither is it any rare thing with your almightie Pope, to practise that generally by his infinite autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which all his Doctors and schoole-men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to defend.<note place="margin">Indulgences grounded nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon Scripture, nor vpon ancient Fathers.</note> For as for the authoritie wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your indulgences are grounded, your owne men confesse, as namely (amongst the rest) <hi>Durandus, De Indulgentijs pauca dici possunt per certitudinem, quia nec scriptura expressè de ijs loquitur, sancti etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patres Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius, Hilarins, Hieronymus, Augustinus minime loquun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur de indulgentijs:</hi> Little can be certainly affirmed of indulgences, because neither the Scripture speaketh expressely of them, and the ancient fathers, <hi>Ambrose, Hilarie, Ierome, Augustine</hi> make no mention of them.

Certaine it is that her Maiestie when she was in that trouble and daunger, vsed these words when shee protested her innocencie at her landing at the Tower. <hi>Before thee O God I speake it, hauing none other friends but thee alone:</hi> and as certaine it is that neither wise States-man, nor any other can definitelie say of these, or any other supposed causes, in these respects, or for these causes chiefly shee was preserued: what though shee were gracious, amiable, and vertuous, and much fauoured of the Spanish King (who in policie it may be did by that meanes seeke to win the peoples hearts vnto him,) must it needs follow hereupon, that therefore her innocent behauiour could not bee called into question, nor her bloud shed by any wicked conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie? The King of Spaine was farre from her in her greatest trouble, and neither you, nor any other can say that hee pleaded her cause or stoode openly for her freedome at any time. If hee sent the Duke of Feria to visite her, or secretly did speake for her to Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> as Master <hi>Foxe</hi> seemeth to confesse,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20447:46"/>
he did that which was seemely and honorable in a King, and that which her place and innocencie iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserued.</p>
               <p>As for the generall hope which you say most men had of her Maiesties being a Catholike: if it had been either so vniuersally conceiued as you imagine, or by such outward tokens had appeared as you haue set downe, how can it be true that she was presumed by many to be inclined to a different Religion from yours, as you a little before in this <hi>Encounter</hi> doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse? If shee had been deuoted so earnestly to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion, why needed commaundement to be giuen that shee should haue Masse within her house, within two daies after her committing to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and how happened it, that her men were so vnskilfull to helpe the Priest, that the first day there could be no Masse for want of a Clerke, and the next day one of her yeomen at <hi>Kyrieleson</hi> made a stop, and set the Priest being not able, or not willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede any further? Her sound affection to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was the cause of all her trouble and danger in her Sisters daies, and her willing and ioyfull embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the true Christian faith, and of God his true worship and seruice, hath so sufficiently been witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed euer since the beginning of her Raigne, that no man of common sense or Christian charitie hath the least cause to suspect that her heart should bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound in the present profession of God his true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Gospell.</p>
               <p>The last cause which you alleage to concurre to the preseruation of her Maiestie, is but a thing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by you seeing the matter of depriuing her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20447:47"/>
of life neuer came to any such stately consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you your selfe in handling this point, doe plainelie graunt; and seeing also that in such a case they could haue found out other meanes, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting such a potent pretender: whatsoeuer you say of the Spaniards affection to the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> at that time, I am sure all <hi>England</hi> had like to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by so lamentable an experience, that this Lady of <hi>Scotland</hi> was so affected by <hi>Spaine,</hi> and sundrie of our English Espagniolized traitours, as (if through Gods goodnes shee had not been cut-off in time) hardly could our Soueraigne haue escaped with life long, being almost daily in daunger (whilest that <hi>Scottish</hi> Queene liued) through the practise of <hi>Rome, Spaine,</hi> and our home Traytors. Thus notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all your flourishes and deuises, your potent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are too weake to weaken my speech, the gracious worke of God in preseruing her Maiestie at that time appearing to euery Christian and indifferent iudgement, no lesse miraculous and strange, then I haue affirmed.

               </p>
               <p>The second thing you finde fault with in this your <hi>Encounter</hi> is my affirming,<note place="margin">The fretting of the Papists against her Maiestie now being Queene</note> that when our Soueraigne was fullie possessed of her royall seat, then Sathan began to rage, and his ministers to fret and chafe; these my words you terme to be wicked calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tales of a tubbe, to entertaine fooles and ignorant people; but with how little truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, and with what abundance of malice and folly, that which followeth shall I doubt not make appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the indifferent reader.</p>
               <p>You aske how it could be that the Papists did freat and chafe, seeing they as the greatest number, and chiefest persons did freelie, and willingly place her, crowne her, annoint her, take her oath, for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the lawes of the Realme, and sweare fidelitie to her againe. To which question I returne the like for answere: how could it be that <hi>Haman</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to honour <hi>Mardocheus</hi> in the sight of the people, should fret and chafe at his aduancement,<note place="margin">Hester. 6.</note> when as he was the man that arrayed <hi>Mardocheus</hi> with roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all apparrell, brought him on horsebacke through the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20447:48"/>
streete, and proclaimed before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the King will honour. This is no tale of a tubbe, as this carping companion would perswade, but a truth out of Gods booke, whereby we may see that some do yeeld vnto that outwardlie in shew, which in their hearts they yeeld not vnto, and at which, afterwards they fret &amp; chafe. And could it otherwise be, but that they must fret and chafe, when as before her raigne in her sisters time one <hi>Ferrar</hi> that was defended by <hi>Storie</hi> and <hi>Bonner,</hi> said that he hoped that she and they that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped she should haue the Crowne should hop head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, or be fired with faggots before she should come to the Crowne: and also after her aduancement to the Crowne, the Bishops, and Clergie maisters as they shewed themselues in the conference at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and in the Parliament assembled verie diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, stubborne and malicious, (wherupon some of them were committed to prison,) so they had a consultation to haue excommunicated her, as your worshipfull Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> affirmeth in his 52. page of his answere to English Iustice, and (as your <hi>Rishton</hi> saith) the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> whose dutie it was to haue crowned her, Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> being dead, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to doe it, and so did all the Bishops, except one, and he almost the lowest.</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to peruse the examination of some particulars, of the hostilitie by me alleadged, willing the Reader by the way to consider deeply of your graue aduise, which (vpon my vsing the words <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Annoynted,</hi> as honourable and rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to her Maiestie) you offer to be aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20447:48"/>
thought of, as tending to the commendation of annointing Priestes and Princes,<note place="margin">About an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.</note> and concluding stronglie the great honour that her Maiestie had by Catholikes at her first entrance. What, must it needs follow that annointed must be taken for annointing with oile, or must her Maiestie needs be beholding to the Clergie for that she is called the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I had well hoped that your quoting in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diuers places of Scripture, for confirmation of the ceremony of annointing Priests and Princes, had been a better Bible-clerke then so foulie to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the 105. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 150.</note> which place hath been allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for Priuiledge of the Popish Clergie from the sword of Iustice, notwithstanding their filthie life. The Patriarches, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led annointed, and yet were neuer annointed with oile. In <hi>Esay.</hi> 45. <hi>Cyrus</hi> is called the Lords annointed, and yet a heathen Prince:<note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note> our Sauiour Iesus is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led annointed, and yet it is not read, that euer he was annointed with outward oile. Princes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords annointed chieflie because God hath put them apart, and consecrated them to serue him in place of gouernment, because they are indued with wisedome, courage, strength, and feare of the Lord, and because they should be profitable to the people, gentle, and mercifull, the truth is more respected then the outward ceremonie in the word annointed. Priestes, Kings, and Prophets before Christes time were annointed with visible oile. I confesse, not for such cause as you imagine that Princes are, but to shew that they were appoynted of God, consecrated, and furnished with gifts from him, as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20447:49"/>
also to be types and figures of Christ, who vnder the law was represented by these three offices, estates, or orders of men. The ceremonie is not now of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to continue; Christ without outward annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was called by <hi>Simeon</hi> the annointed of the Lord. So that hir Maiestie may be tearmed honorablie and deseruedlie the Lords annointed, and yet neither your superstitious, and Iewish ceremony of greazing your popish Priests commended thereby, nor her Maiestie made much beholding to your Clergie for that honour.</p>
               <p>The first particular of hostilities which you take vpon you to disprooue is my speech of your dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Doctor <hi>Storie,</hi>

You tell vs there are three things in my speech of <hi>Doctor Story</hi> to be considered; the words I charge him with, my interpretation of them, and the iudgement he receiued; in all which if you can either conuince me of vntruth, or iustlie condemn me for vncharitably censuring the speech, and his person, we will beleeue you another time, in your proud boasting. The words (you say) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sufficiently proued to haue been spoken by him, neither by sufficient witnesses,<note place="margin">Stories words.</note> nor by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: and because the words could not serue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpose, but to his owne ruine (he being known
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20447:49"/>
to be wise and no foole,) you would haue it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he spake them not at all. This is but a simple defence (Sir <hi>Encounterer</hi>) of your stout champion, seeing the words were spoken in the hearing of so many witnesses, both of your side and ours, in the Parliament house, and seeing that the speech being generally testified by them that heard him at that time, it was neuer, either by himselfe denied, or by others that were present controlled. If Doctor <hi>Storie</hi> had been so wise, as you would perswade he was, he would neuer haue vsed such impudent words, such shamelesse talke, such vnconscionable and cruell speeches, without anie pittie, of such as he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted most cruellie, as it is certainelie reported he did also at that time. As for the interpretation which you call a bloudie commentarie,<note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them.</note> it was not deuised to draw bloud, nor to presse him downe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he long since receiued his iust iudgement, it doth onely descrie his bloudie and disloyall heart, which caused his tongue to vtter such furious and bloudie speeches. You would faine haue Doctor <hi>Storie</hi> not to meane the Queene by the roote, but either here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie it selfe, or the infected Nobilitie and Gentrie. But alas (Sir <hi>N.D.</hi>) your fained glosses are so farre from drawing his words to another sense, that they rather confirme the same, much like to <hi>Pilates</hi> superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being set vp to shew the cause of Christs condemnation, did yet notwithstanding proclaime his innocencie, and conuince them of crueltie: for doe not you a little before confesse, that these words could serue to no other purpose, but to his owne ruine? and doe not you here acknowledge that the

Nobilitie and Gentrie seasoned with true Religion (which you in the madnes of your idle braine call heresie) were but inferiour roots, both which things doe proue, that his words (which were these) <hi>They</hi> (meaning the Commssioners, and Counsellors in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time) <hi>laboured onely about the young and little sprigs and twigs while they should haue stricken at the roote, and cleane haue rooted it out</hi>) cannot be meant of any other, but of the Prince and chiefe roote, from whom by the great goodnes of God, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and open profession of Christian Religion, hath againe sprung vp in this our land, and with whom it doth continue yet still, notwithstanding that <hi>Bacon, Cicill, Knowles</hi> and all those that you named are dead and gone.

For in the title to that Bul, you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20447:51"/>
know the Queene is called a pretended Queene, by the Bull she is deposed, her Subiects are absolued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their oath of fealtie &amp; allegeance, and those that obay her are accursed. What though all Catholiks are not priuie to your Popes reasons, &amp; informations? may it not be concluded necessarily (notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that) that such as acknowledge the Popes supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer Prices, and hold it for a <hi>maxime,</hi> that in a definitiue sentence he cannot erre, are enemies to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> &amp; the State? I know in deed some, as Master <hi>Hart,</hi> may deny that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope hath any thing to doe with disposing of kingdomes, &amp; deposing of Princes, and so the Bull may not any waie concerne them; but I doubt there be but a few that will affirme the Popes supremacy in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral things to be vsurped. But because you post ouer this matter to other treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, esteeming of me in matter of dispute, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did of <hi>Dauid</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he scorned,<note place="margin">Master Iuel.

               <p>And because in this place (before you consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Bull) you take exceptions against a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of mine which you terme ridiculous, &amp; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from deepe ignorance and a base breast, I will a little fortifie my saying, and make it apparant to the indifferent reader, either your grosse mistaking, or wilfull and malicious peruerting of my said speech: as for your <hi>Lucyfer</hi>-like pride it is more then apparant alreadie: my words are these,<note place="margin">Whether any man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings.</note> 
                  <hi>As though it were in the power of any one mortall childe of man, to dispose of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to depose Princes, or to dispense with subiects for not,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20447:52"/>
onely disobeying, but rebelling against their lawfull Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, &amp;c.</hi> Is this such a ridiculous proposition (Sir <hi>Encounterer</hi>) or doe these words either make tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kingdomes matters of Godhead and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or necessarily conclude that wicked Princes, such as <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> must bee obeyed in all things, with which flourishes, and false gloses you seeke to discredite my sayings? Your malice did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster your reason, and your will did ouerrun your wit in this your lewde construction.</p>
               <p>That which I said I may lawfullie still vphold, that Princes are not depriuable by any mortall man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man dispense with subiects for refusing to yeeld that obedience which the Lorde requireth them to yeeld. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> acknowledgeth that it is God,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. and 4.</note> that hath this power to take away Kings, and to set vp Kings, and to giue the kingdome to whom hee will, and saieth that the Lord ordereth the States and Princes of the world at his pleasure: <hi>Marie</hi> the blessed Virgine reserueth this honor who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to God.<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> 
                  <hi>He putteth down the mightie from their seate, and exalteth the base:</hi> reade ouer the bookes of Kings, none euer disposed of kingdomes, but the Lorde of Lordes; neither were any throwne from their thrones, but by the Lords speciall appointment, as in the deiection of <hi>Ieroboam, Baasa, Elah, Achab</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> is apparant.<note place="margin">1.

King. 19.</note> as also the most part of the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> euen fourteene of them.</p>
               <p>But it may be you thinke, because the Prophets
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20447:52"/>
denounced Gods iudgements, annointed some to be Kings, and some others by speciall commandement and authority did execute Gods iudgements, as <hi>Iehu</hi> vpon <hi>Ioram</hi> and <hi>Achabs</hi> children, that therefore my proposition is infringed; which cannot be (Sir <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counterer</hi>) for it was done by Gods speciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Iudge and superiour ouer Princes, and not by their owne motions, or in their owne name: No Priest, no Prophet, no Apostle, no Bishop euer had authoritie to depose Princes. Hee that saith,<note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>By mee Kings raigne,</hi> doth challenge this power to himselfe, and it is plaine blasphemie to giue it to any other. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expressely resolueth that Kings neede not to feare to lose their Kingdomes, or that their Kingdome shall bee taken from them, as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Herod</hi> feared, and therefore out of all question,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>August. in Psalm.</hi> 47.</note> there is no such authoritie giuen to any mortall child of man to depose Princes.</p>
               <p>But although I thus confidently and vpon good grounde doe pleade against the Popes vsurped au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, yet I am neither so seruily sottish, or so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiouslie conscienced, as either to adore earthlie Princes, or to denie that any Prince established may be touched or disobeyed in any matter: for as I haue learned to giue to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is <hi>Caesars,</hi> and to God, that which is Gods, worshipping the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with Religious worship: so I know vsurpers may be suppressed by rightfull inheritance, as <hi>Athalia</hi> by <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> and in our land <hi>Richard</hi> the third, by <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth: and to our Princes wee must yeeld such obedience as the Lorde alloweth, obeying them in the Lord, chusing rather with the Disciples to obey
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20447:53"/>
God then man, when man commaundeth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnlawfull things. And so leauing you (Sir Pope-Idolater) to your palpable flatterie, and to please and defend your <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula,</hi> as a more fit fellow to flatter seriouslie, and to adore such saints then my selfe, I stand as becommeth me in loyaltie for my Christian, and religious Soueraigne, and so will doe (by Gods grace) whilest I liue to my last breath.</p>
               <p>Your three points which you would haue to bee considered vpon my speech of the Bull come next to be handled, by which you would gladlie proue, that not the malignitie of the Pope and Papists against our Prince brought forth this roring Bull, but some dealings of ours, and that the Popish Recusants are not to be accused for it, or inforced by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to change their olde beleefe about the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1</note>The first point to be considered, is that the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rth in the thirteenth yeare of her Maiesties raigne and not before, as by our owne Chronicles (you say) appeareth: Let it bee so (Sir <hi>N.D.</hi>) though the Bull was set vp in the thirteenth yeare of her Raigne, and dated 1567. 5. <hi>Calend. Martij,</hi> what conclude you hereupon? Must it therefore needes follow that the Bull proceeded not from any malignitie of the Pope, and Papists? but of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, as out of mine owne words you would seeme to proue. Your argument is verie weake, your conclusion cannot bee inforced vpon such slender premisses. The malignitie of the Papists is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant by their consulting to excommunicate her
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20447:53"/>
Maiestie, as before I shewed out of Cardinall <hi>Allyn,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Stories</hi> words, by informations giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, which you confesse, whereupon the Pope in his Bull chargeth her with many things most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely and falselie. The hatred of the Pope is most euident, calling her a pretended Queene and an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, euen in the title, and beginning of the Bull. And though the Bull was not published till the 12. yeare, being yet concluded vpon about two yeares before, as the date sheweth, yet both the Pope and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents might as well fret and storme at her enioying of the Crowne, as at her Christian and Religious gouernment. Buls are not hastelie procured, your Pope must be sued vnto, and false informations must be giuen, and it might be as they had vaine hopes for a time to feede themselues with, so (those hopes fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) the fittest season for publishing of the Bull, was thought to be when others were prepared to raise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>The second point is a matter of as deepe conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note place="margin">2</note> as the former, wherein hee telleth vs by enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of diuers hard vsages offered by her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and the Protestants, against the Pope and Popish Catholicks, that it must needs be, that not malignitie of the Pope and his adherents against her, but diuers iniuries and cruelties offered, inforced the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bull. I will not vouchsafe to make an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for defence of those things, which you (Sir <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counterer</hi>) recken vp as wrongs and iniuries offered to your Pope and Pope-worshippers; this onely I say for answere, that as her Maiestie hath done nothing in the reformation of Religion, in requiring an oath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20447:54"/>
of her people for acknowledgement of her authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in inforcing her Subiects to the true seruice of God, in punishing offenders, and obstinate persons, and such like proceedings, but that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her, and the godlie zealous Princes haue done before her: so it doth not necessarilie follow, that notwithstanding all those things haue been done in godlie zeale and louing care for the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soules of her people, therefore you are free from malignitie, your faultines wherein I haue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie proued before, though in your deepe and cunning flatterie you would gladlie denie it: you fawne vpon her Maiestie, and yet accuse her most falselie of breach of promise in altering Religion: you seeme to free her from a desire to publish Gods Gospell, and yet affirme that your Pope had great cause to proceede against her. Other Princes as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first, <hi>Richard</hi> the second, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, haue made lawes against the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and vsurped iurisdiction, and yet haue not tasted so much of his malice, which sheweth the malignitie of your Pope and his adherents against her Maiestie. As for your Poperie and superstition rooted out of this land, it was not of so long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance as you boast, for but little before <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, Kings were Gods Vicars for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Church, Ecclesiasticall liuings were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed by the Princes, they made Ecclesiasticall lawes, Priests were married, and your Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was not then knowne: You blasphemouslie scoffe at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and ye glorie in the dissention betweene vs and the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:20447:54"/>
but as the Lord is of will and power to mocke mockers, so can hee make the infirmitie of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, worke to his glorie and their good. I passe ouer many things willinglie in this your Rhetoricall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, contenting my selfe to haue shewed the <hi>non sequitur</hi> of your allegation.</p>
               <p>The third point which you would haue conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is that it was an acte of iurisdiction from an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall superiour, as also an auncient kinde of proceeding against Princes in our land, as well as in other places without any trouble to the people for the same, and therefore you would not haue your Catholikes to be charged with it, or troubled for it. For answere thereunto this I affirme, that as wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not your Popes superioritie, or Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall iurisdiction ouer vs, he playing the vsurping Tirant, in censuring our Prince; so we neither yeelde that this his proude and malicious cursing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of Princes hath been of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; or that those his adherents, who iustifie his proceedings are to bee freed from blame. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Princes the annointed of the Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> are the higher powers ordained to execute Iustice, and Iudgement ouer the good and euill: We knowe no other Superiour in nations and kingdomes, next and immediatelie vnder God, but such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> willeth vs to be subiect vnto, when he saith, <hi>Submit your selues vnto all manner ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be vnto the King, as to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, &amp;c.</hi> he speaketh of one not of many superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, where a Monarchie is established.</p>
               <p>The time was when your Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was far
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20447:55"/>
from hauing a superioritie euen in <hi>Rome</hi> and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; for both <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Otho</hi> the great, had right soueraigntie, and royaltie of the Countries giuen to your Popes, with acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee their Soueraigne Lordes, in regarde of which they yeelded tributes, and other seruices vnto them: as also in former times, the Emperours had their Lieutenants and deputies in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Valentinian Theodosius.</hi>
                  </note> euen to <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenths time; and your Popes obtained not the Soueraigntie which now they challenge, till it was almost 1200. yeares after Christ, in the daies of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, and <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, both Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Your vsuall engine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and depriuing of Princes of their Crownes, is likewise far short of that antiquitie, by which you would seeme to mitigate the rigour and crueltie thereof. For as there was neuer any <hi>Romane</hi> King or Emperor excommunicated and depriued of his kingdom by any Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; cursed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth, the brand of hel, who being a Necromancer, a periured person, and a most wicked man, confessed at his death to a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that he was set on by the Diuell to raise vp dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and warres in Christendome: so in <hi>England</hi> from the conquest vnto King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, there was no Prince of this land deposed by your pope, but onely King <hi>Iohn.</hi>

                     <hi>Sigebert. in Anno</hi> 1088.</note> It is a noueltie (Sir <hi>N.D.</hi>) and not a matter of antiquitie (as <hi>Sigebert</hi> telleth you,) to teach that people owe no subiection to euill kings, &amp;c. As for that you say that Subiects heretofore in our land haue not beene troubled, or forced to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20447:55"/>
their beliefe concerning the Popes power, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his cursing and depriuing of Princes is more then you know, and it maketh no great matter whether it were so or no, seeing that your vse of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication hath not been so frequent in our land, and your dealings were neuer so treacherous and desperate as they haue been of late. Our English Nation did neuer at any time since the first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the faith vnto this day, acknowledge the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped power of your Pope to depose Princes, much lesse hath it been anie matter of our faith: your Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, may put in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation to be an Article of our beliefe, and make your popes supremacie of the necessitie of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; but wee haue learned to ground our faith vpon the Scriptures of God, which teacheth no such absurd and diuellish points. The lawes of our land haue heretofore in King <hi>Richard</hi> the seconds time, and <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, made it treason to bring in any excommunication from <hi>Rome,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the lawes of the Realme for benefices and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, to compasse or imagine the death of the King, to leuie warre against the Prince, or to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and fauourers of the Kings enemies, all which lawes doe verie neerly concerne such amongst you, as vouch the Popes wicked claime to depose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are perswaders, aiders, and comforters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion and rebellion: Your affections wee deale not with, but with your confessions, wee punish you not, for your faith, but for your works.</p>

how that the Dutches of <hi>Suffolke</hi> espying him in the Tower, (being the prisoner) inking <hi>Edwards</hi> raigne: said it was merrie with the Lambes, now the Wolfe was shut vp: which speech, this your gentle natured Bishop, and nothing vindicatiue (as you terme him) well remembred in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the first lent of her raigne, studied an holie practise of reuenge, first by touching this Dutches in the person of her husband Master <hi>Bertye,</hi> for whom he sent an attachment to the Sherife of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colneshire,</hi> with a speciall letter, commaunding him most strictly to attach him, and without Bale to bring him vp to him to <hi>London,</hi> whereas he had no cause at all to send for him.

But to looke backe a little vpon this famous Sermon, in the long narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you set down by occasion of this Sermon, I must examine some few points, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in either this Proctor belieth the Bishop, or the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop the King. And first if it be true that he affirmeth that King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight appointed <hi>Gardiner</hi> to be one of the sixteene Counsellors in his testament to gouerne his Sonne, and the Realme: how happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it that Sir <hi>Anthonie Browne</hi> was so earnest and importunate a sutor to the King, to haue <hi>Gardiner</hi> put into his Will againe when he was put out?<note place="margin">Gardiner put out of King Henries Will.</note> And why did the King bid him holde his peace, and trouble him therewith no more? For if hee were in, he would trouble them all; and if hee moued him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more for <hi>Gardiner,</hi> he would also put him out. Is not this an argument that the King reposed great trust in <hi>Gardiner</hi> for the gouernment of his Sonne and the Realme? Another thing you say <hi>Gardiner</hi> vttered in his Sermon, that King <hi>Henrie</hi> in his latter time was inclined to reconcile himselfe to the Pope. But I would the Bishop had had more wit to speake truth, and lesse skill in lying:<note place="margin">King Henrie the eyght not minded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the Pope as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner saith, but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> for it is apparant that not long before the Kings death, hee with his owne mouth answered the Ambassadour of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> that if the quarrell of the Duke his master were nothing else against the Emperour but for Religion, he should stand to it stronglie, and hee would take his part. Nay more then this (as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> Doctor <hi>Cranmer,</hi> a man farre more inward with the King then <hi>Gardiner</hi> was, doth testifie) the King but little before his death resolued, talking with the Archbishop, and <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:20447:71"/>
Embassadour, that he and the King of <hi>France</hi> within one halfe yeere, would not onely change the Masse in both the Realmes to a Communion, as it is now vsed, but vtterly to haue banished the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; his vsurped authority: Yea they were so throughly and firmely resolued in that behalf, that they minded also to exhort the Emperour, to doe the like in <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and other his Countries and Seigniories, or else to breake off from him.</p>
               <p>A third thing in this discourse you alleadge, that Bishop <hi>Gardiner</hi> was wont to say of King <hi>Henrie,</hi> that after he left to loue that person which by Gods law, and mans law, he was bound to loue aboue all others (to wit his first wife and Queene) he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loued anie person heartilie, and constantlie after.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I shortly answere, that concerning his often changes of his wiues putting som to death,<note place="margin">About King Henries di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce from his first wife with Gard. iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</note> and others away, I will not take vpon me to answere at all. But to <hi>Gardiners</hi> report I answere, that this his mutabilitie proceeded not hereof, because he ceased to loue the first, but because he first loued where he should not, namely his owne brothers wife, against the voice of God and nature: as crouching and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who flattered with the issue of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull match, not in word onely, but in publike writing professed to the whole world, vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the former mariage, with his brothers wife, and approuing &amp; iustifying the second with Queene <hi>Anne.</hi> In his booke <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> he writeth of that point to this purpose.

                  <note n="3" place="margin">Your yonger brethren are the elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents against the Queene.</note> But (Sir) your elder brethren, (whom you allow to speake) are farre enough from reach, they may safely define what they will against the Queene, and cast abroad their iudgements in railing bookes to yonger brethren, to settle in them a consent therto: Which being done, they must yet make shew not to intermeddle, to the end they may the better auoide perill to their persons, &amp; secretly hearten the people against her Maiestie.</p>

iestie, and diuers of her Honorable Councell with armed men: the effecting whereof stayed onely the comming ouer of certaine Priests which were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp; in the meane time (through Gods goodnes) this horrible treason was discouered, and preuented. And <hi>Paine</hi> being asked, how they durst practise or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any such mischieuous action? his answere was; that to kill the Queene, or to vse anie crueltie against her, or any that would take her part, was no offence to God, and that they might doe it as lawfully as to a brute beast; and to approue himselfe a fit messenger to be sent on such a bloudie errant, he affirmed that himselfe would be one of the first that should exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the same: here is one of your yonger brothers, whom all the world must confesse to be a fit son for such a father as your Pope is.</p>
               <p>Besides this, your Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> Doctor <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> and others (as elder brethren) sent <hi>Richard Hesketh</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Lancashire</hi> and a younger brother,<note place="margin">Heskets trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> to induce the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> late Earle of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> to make a suddaine rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> and to take vpon him the title of the Crowne; assuring him from them and others, of treasure and forraine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to maintaine the same: which treason the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Earle dutifully detected, <hi>Hesketh</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and bitterly cursed his elder brethren, to make him a yonger brother, to aduenture the danger of the treason, that they as elder brethren doe teach and deuise, farre enough from reach. Is this the weeping of your yonger brethren without intermedling? are these the teares? then are they of a right Crocodiles brood, which seemeth to weeepe, but it is to this end,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20447:74"/>
that they may sooner kill and destroy. Nay further then this, these elder brethren commend to their yongers, treason against her Maiestie, for a point of their faith, namely, that if the Pope say the worde, none of the Papistes ought to obey her Maiestie, nor to account her Queene of <hi>England</hi>:<note place="margin">Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queene made a point of the popish faith and religion.</note> for in the cases of conscience (as Doctor <hi>Bilson</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> noteth) wherewith the Iesuites that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> were furnished, to the 55.

If therefore a Catholike be asked, do you beleeue that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> may depriue Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her crown? he must answer (not regarding any danger of death) I beleeue he may; for this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a point of faith, and requireth a confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of (our) faith. Do not these elder brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (think you) dutifully put in their iudgements between these two imagined Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the Queen &amp; the Pope, when they teach their yonger brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Queen, for an article &amp; point of their faith?</p>
               <p>To ende with this Cardinall, who (thanks be to God) ended his life before he could attaine the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected end of his traiterous dessignments: doth he not perswade that it is not onely lawfull, but honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to murther Princes for Religion? for (saith hee)

And this doctrine of your Cardinals, <hi>Parrie</hi> himselfe confesseth vnder his owne hand writing, did throughly resolue, confirme and strengthen him, in his diuellish purpose to kill the Queene. Doctor <hi>Allens</hi> booke (saith he) was sent me out of <hi>France,</hi> it redoubled my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, <hi>euerie word in it was a warrant to a prepared mind:</hi>

All which things considered, I appeale to any good natured Papist, who hath in him any sparke of loyaltie in his heart to his Prince, &amp; loue to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrie, whether this Cardinall not only by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practises seeking to stir rebellion against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, but by publike writing earnestly perswading the same, yea animating, &amp; encouraging her Subiects to lay violent hands vpon her sacred person, were not indeed a cardinall and arch-traitor: and for this his Proctor I answere him, and conclude almost with the very words wherwith himself shutteth vp this his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,</hi> let all men iudge of this mans treacherie.</p>

Therefore looke not that your bare word shall goe for a currant proofe with mee in this behalfe, seeing you haue no one title of the word of God to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, it being manifestlie to be proued thereby, that he is wholie opposite to Christ, both in faith, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and gouernment, which long challenge of his, and leane proofe of yours, is largelie confuted, and ouerthrowne by sundrie learned.</p>

But (good Sir) there
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20447:81"/>
is no such matter, you misse your ayme verie much: as I know &amp; grant that not the hearers of the law but the doers shal be iustified, and that if we be not doers of the word, but hearers onely, we deceiue our owne selues, hauing no interest in those three benefits spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in our Creed by Christ purchased to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Forgiuenes of sinnes, Glorious resurrection of our bodies, Eternall life: so I did neuer so much as by dreame imagine any the least forwardnes to good workes in Papistes aboue vs, to whom (God forbid) that herein we should be inferiour.

               <p>But I pray you are not the vulgar and common sort easilie deceiued by and outward ciuill carriage of men?

It is written of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, that he caused almes-houses to be erected, in sundrie places of his Empyre, appointing that poore Christians aswell as others, should be there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued: yeelding this reason, that sith the Christians taught to doe good not onely to friends, but to our enemies, it were ashame for them to be inferiour to Christians in doing good. Amongst Turkes, Iewes, Pagans, many things are done wisely, valiantly, iustly,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20447:82"/>
and according to ciuill honestie; yet are but deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arguments to perswade to be of their Religion, and (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> I trow tearmeth such mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good works) as gaye apparrell put vpon a dead carcase. I haue ascribed no more to the Papists in this point, then may trulie be yeelded to the heathen: and yet the Papistes especiallie of the wealthier sort, when now the streame and course of the law goeth against them, vsing for policie much kindnes, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, affabilitie,<note place="margin">True faith not without good workes.</note> to the inferiour and common sort; may by this meanes winde themselues into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes; and as a Mirmaiden with her sugred song, and the Scorpion with his fawning and smiling, meane destruction in the ende: fo by this plausible courtesie they seeke to drawe and induce to their religion, by which sugred baite many are ensnared, with the wordes of our Sauiour, <hi>Beware of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by their fruites ye shall know them, &amp;c.</hi> I gladly agree and subscribe to them, as also to the testimony of Saint <hi>Iames: Thou hast faith, and I haue workes, shew me thy faith without workes, and I will shew thee my faith by my workes.</hi> For as wee see not the soule of man (it being a spirituall substance) yet whom we see to walk, to speake, to haue sense and feeling, wee know the soule to be in that man: so faith being an inward qualitie of the soule, cannot be seene of anie but by effectes, namely good workes. And as a painted fire is no fire, because it wanteth heate, and an Image is not a man, because it wanteth sense: so no more is that faith indeed (but onely in name) which doth not fructifie by good workes; as the Church of <hi>Sardi</hi> had a name that it liued, but indeed it was dead,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20447:82"/>
it was called spirituall, but was carnall. The true iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith must be accompanied with an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation: Iustification, and sanctification cannot be seuered. But being my selfe in the ranke of learners, I confesse it becommeth me to referre you, for a full answere to your blasphemy against our true doctrine of iustifycation to those that haue both learnedlie and diuinelie handled it, to the true comfort of all Gods children.</p>

their answeres and other behauiours, they should shew themselues as dutifull Subiects, till such time as there were <hi>certa spes victoriae:</hi> these be brought with speciall direction to be taught and perswaded, and how farre these lead wide from deepe dissimulation I appeale to the indifferent Reader, but this is no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie in Poperie, though your dimme sight cannot discerne it.<note place="margin">Dissimulation of some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.</note> And I pray you (Sir) what meant sundry of your Recusants the last sommer (when all the land was in armes) to sell away their goods, and to slide out of the way themselues, when order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to dsarme them? did not this arguea reseruing of themselues <hi>in plenitudinem temporis,</hi> and that, they had some hope, that their <hi>certa spes victoriae</hi> was not farre off?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The threefold accusation examined.</note>You proceed further to my triple accusation (as you terme it) against them, which yet is rather an admonition for due prouidence, then an accusation to draw on anie heauie punishment. I note three things. First, the harme they continually doe; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the hurt they would doe; thirdly, their deep dissimulation:<note n="2" place="margin">The hurt Recusants do.</note> for the first, I onely insist in this one hurt, that when the Gentleman recuseth, and is borne withall, the meaner sort receiue infection and draw backe also: Likewise though the husband come to the Church, if the wife refufe, the danger redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the whole household, and wiues of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sort are by them likewise infected. Of which you make light, but it ought to be of more moment to vs; and therefore more heedfully to be seene vnto, then you desire to haue it. For how shall the child, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the tenant, be forward to know the truth, when
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20447:83"/>
the Parent, the Master, the Land-lord refuse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? The wifes recusancie was not so common, till men infected with popery were perswaded, that they could not be drawne by law to pay the penaltie for the wiues: and the Popes holines had a dispensation readie for the husband to goe to Church. Now that the meaner and poorer sort of women are infected by these of the wealthier, and that they when they come home, labour also to peruert their husbndes, it neither need seeme strange to you, and we that liue to serue in the countrie, finde too lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it. For commonlie and for the most part, men proue to be such, as are they whose companie they frequent: and daily experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth teach vs the tiuth of the old saying: <hi>Cum boni, cum malis conuer santur, &amp;c.</hi> When the good conuerse and keepe companie with the euill, sooner are the good by the euill corrupted, then the euill by the good conuerted. Heresie is by sundrie writers compared to the plague, as for sundry other respectes; so for this, that as the plague doth spread it infection to manie, oftentimes infecting the whole house, and reaching the venome thereof to neighbour-houses, so that it sometimes filleth the whole Towne or Citie with dead corpses: so heresie feeketh to infect manie, and to spread the poyson of it from one to another. Now those that are sicke of the plague, by a laudable policie, we seclude from companie, that so they may not infect others: grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care ought (in my opinion) to be taken of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that they may not raunge whither they wil, and keepe companie with whom they please, for that the danger is greater of heresie, then of the plague: for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20447:84"/>
the plague killeth but the bodie, heresie killeth the soule; the plague threatneth temporall death, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie eternall.</p>
               <p>But you aske from what these wiues, children, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, tenants, and husbands doe fall? and I answere, as manie of them as become Papists, fall from true Religion, and manie of them also from loyaltie and sound loue to their countrie. But you say conscience is cause of this fall, and not euill will or rebellion? and I answere, it is fancie that leadeth them rather then conscience; for <hi>conscientia</hi> must be <hi>cum scientia,</hi> conscience must be grounded vpon knowledge, and knowledge is to be fetched not from your traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and vnwritten verities, but from the written word of God, which is able to make a man wise to saluation, through faith which is in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>

But what punishment is laid vpon Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, by the rare clemencie of her Maiestie, any way comparable to those that Christian Emperours haue made against Recusants, or such as refused to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Church of Christ?

ouer, in which kind I list not to contend with you: your cauilling and misconstruing shall briefely be laid open. My words you set downe; <hi>These ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men that vnder pretence of Conscience rebell against God in religion, and refuse to yeeld a loyall obedience to their Liege-Ladie, seeme to carrie a most lamentable resolution lurking in their bosomes against Queene, Countrie, and vs all, &amp;c. And if this be conscience, I know not what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science meaneth, and yet this conscience they fetch from Rome, &amp;c.</hi> You beginne with the last wordes, from which you pike out this conclusion against me, that I know not what conscience meaneth, either in nature and definition, or in practise and feeling; the first you say is past my vnderstanding, by reason my bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp hath hnot been in schooles; the other you take vpon you to make plaine I am voide of, by my manner of writing against Catholikes, &amp;c. Surely I willingly confesse my wants in learning to be verie great, and doe bewaile my losse of time in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, yet this I hope I may say without suspition of vanitie or ostentation, that I laid the grounds of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in one of the best schooles in this land, namely <hi>Winchester,</hi> and added some further building in one of the best Vniuersities in Christendome, namelie <hi>Oxford,</hi> studying there in <hi>Magdaleine</hi> Colledge vnder that worthy Doctor <hi>Humfrey,</hi> where besides my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate study, I wanted not such furtherance, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with sundrie of the best learned in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie could afford me; and since I left the Vniuersitie, I haue not spent so much time in hunting &amp; hawking, as you presume, although I hold them for lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations moderatelie vsed in the feare of God. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20447:87"/>
therefore I did long since know (I praise God) that Conscience is a part of our vnderstanding, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our particular actions, either with them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: I knowe also that of this Conscience God onelie is Lorde, and his words and lawes, doe onely binde the same properlie; and from hence must we fetch the direction and warrant of our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Conscience which will not admit vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and set vp, and to obey &amp; disobey Soueraignes at our pleasures, yea and to kill Princes (as your Pope giueth warrant to doe) and then to say we doe it of Conscience, but will giue me a sufficient warrantise, to condemne all such Schoolemasters and Schollers; and so Sir (not as a teacher in our Israel, but as a Scholler) I haue tolde you what Conscience is, and by that touch I haue giuen of the practise and feeling of Conscience (which must bee warranted by the word of God, and not by mens dreames, and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) I haue cancelled the warrant you would take to your selues, to disobey and resist the authoritie, giuen to her Maiestie from God.</p>

For why

should I be blamed to charge them with falsehoode, disloyaltie, treason, and lurking resolutions against Queene and Countrie, and to bee the very <hi>Catilines</hi> of our age, when your Popes doctrine teacheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and they frame themselues in all things to obey him? When Rebellions haue been raised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our owne bowels?

And in the first two, sundrie of your Recusants false fingers haue been set on worke, and in the third the Inuaders haue promised to themselues (and so published) great assistance from them, and both for Inuasion, Rebellion, and taking away of her Highnes life; who haue been the very <hi>Catilines</hi> of our Countrie, but they?

That they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not depriue christian princes of their principalities. <note place="margin">3</note>3.

faith and obedience to their Prince. 4. That it<note place="margin">4</note> is no determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, that the Pope may depose Princes. 5. That the Canon made at the Councell<note place="margin">5</note> of Lateran, touching the deposing of Princes (the which hath bred the greatest scruple in our English Romane Catholikes) neither is, nor euer was of force within this land. 6. That the sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced<note place="margin">6</note> against her Maiestie, was neither lawfully, nor orderlie done, according to the Laterane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Therefore I am farre from imputing the crime of sedition to all Recusantes, and as I doe not accuse all, so can no man trulie excuse all; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that verie manie haue been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with this humour, by the perswasions of Iesuites and Seminaries, as hath been proued before; and from hence you may pike out your hard and heathenish hearts, wherof you make mention: As for the bare sense of an English heart, which you snatch out of my words, it is such an heart, as hauing onely the light of nature (without anie knowledge of the true God at all) would not so brutishly seeke the life of their lawfull Soueraigne, to the betraying of their countrie into the handes of straungers, and such an honest heart, I wish you at the least.</p>

But as the Apostle by all things, meaneth all such things as are not contrarie to Gods commaundement, as he elsewhere expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord:</hi> so is my meaning as cleare as the light, that we must obey Princes in all things, that imply not disobedience to God: generall and vnlimited obedience, we teach not to vow and performe to anie man, it being due onely to God, who cannot erre in the things he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth.

Wee neuer held our selues in that sort bound to any King or Emperour, though your Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites vow such obedience to their Superiours. The very Poet may teach, that

                  </q>
Therefore sith earthlie King, are vnder the King of Kings, wee must so obey the inferiour, as wee diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the Superiour. The highest King hath set downe his law to earthlie Kings, as well as others, in the two tables: if they presume to make a law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this lawe, therein we are not to obey. It was not disloyaltie in the AEgyptian Midwiues, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to murther the male-children of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> commaundement; nor in <hi>Obadiah</hi> in hiding the Lordes Prophets, contrarie to <hi>Achabs</hi> will; neither in the Apostles in not forbearing to preach in the name of Iesus, at the Rulers commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; they did (as they ought) preferre obedience to God, before obedience to man, when they cannot both stand together. By all obedience then, it is plaine that I meant, true and sincere obedience from the heart, not dissembling obedience onlie for feare; as the Apostle when he perswadeth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to walke worthie of the vocation whereunto they are called, with all humblenes of minde, meaneth by all humblenes, true, sincere, inward humilitie, not counterfeite, and hypocriticall. And if mallice had not here lost both her eyes, and her wits, this scoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cauiller might haue seene that in the very entrie to this point of obedience, I doe manifestlie affirme it; for I say these three things euery man ought to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20447:92"/>
keepe sound within his breast, first, his Conscience before God; secondly, his Loyaltie to his Prince; thirdly, his Loue to his Countrie: Now how is it possible a man should keepe sound his Conscience before God, which I set in the first place, if hee obey his Prince in things against God? nay, that I place first, because it must be the director of vs in our Loue and Loyaltie both to Prince and Countrie. If the Lawes of the Prince or Countrie commaunde any thing contrarie to it, wee ought in such things not to obey our Prince, and for such things we may flie our Countrie; but yet not rebell or fight against them, as you seeke to perswade, saying that Christ alloweth greatlie of them that despise Father, Mother, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and Kinred, yea they are willed to hate them and make warre against them, for his sake; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie also the like is willed against Princes in the same cause,<note place="margin">This is <hi>N.D.</hi> his spirituall conceite as you may reade in his booke pag. 83.</note> and this out of your conscienceles hart, made fit for Rebellion, you falselie and impudentlie affirme: but we say, we must hate Father and Mother as we must our life for Christ, not to doe violence to our selues, or to make warre vpon them, nor to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing against either, but in comparison of Christ, and for his sake, not to regarde the losse of either; and therefore that which you adde of warring against our Countrie and Prince for Religion, as it is not in any text of holie Writ, so doe you plainelie discouer your traiterous minde, against Queene and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and what was the marke you aime at, in all this wrangling against the point of obedience.</p>

The Pope will haue the Emperour to holde his stirrope, whilest he mounteth on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was angrie with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Frederike</hi> for holding his stirrope on the wrong side, when he is mounted: the Emperour must lead his horse by the bridle, and Kings walke along before; yea when he is carried on mens shoulders, the Emperour (they say) must helpe to carrie him for a space.

First, the Pope most iniurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deposed her Maiestie from her Royall Crowne, dismissed her Subiects from their obedience due to her, yea cursed as many as did obey her: further hee sendeth <hi>Murton</hi> into <hi>England</hi> to stirre vp Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, and consequentlie (as much as in him lay) to fill the land with dead corpses, and to make our flouds run dyed with English bloud: when this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, hee sent <hi>Saunders</hi> with sundrie forces to inuade <hi>Ireland,</hi> not onlie to increase Rebellion there, but to winne it quite from her Maiestie if hee might. The bloud by this occasion shed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> could not yeelde his holines an heartie draught, and therefore hee setteth on and abetteth the Spanish King in the yeare 1588. to make Inuasion for a full Conquest; and to the ende he might throughlie speede and not

And that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of a bloudie monster might bee wanting in him, hee suborned <hi>Parrey,</hi> and armed him with full remission of all his sinnes, besides other promises, murtherouslie to kill her Maiestie and to shed her guiltles bloud.

they speake of our land vntrulie, and wee of them report nothing but knowne truth. And if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Spaine preuailed not more with you then truth, you might remember and report, that manie outrages were by the Spaniardes at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against our countriemen; as namely, that great tumult at <hi>Westminster</hi> betwixt our men and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, whereof great mischiefe was like to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. What was the ground of it? in whom was the fault? was it not about two harlots? and was not the fault wholie in the Spaniardes? for whiles some Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes committed wickednes with those strumpets, others with dags and other weapons kept the entrie of the cloistures; some of the Deanes men came in the meane space into the cloyster, at whom the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes discharged their dagges and hurt some of them, whereof great busines was like to follow: But you shew your selfe worse then one of the broode of <hi>Cham,</hi> who was cursed for vncouering his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shame, for you seeke to lay shame vpon your mother <hi>England</hi> before she deserue it, to please a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner, and a sworne enemie to her. Now let all men of conscience, yea of common reason iudge, whether of vs two hath the malignant spirit by you named, I in discouering the daungerous humours of the Spaniardes for my countries good, or you in not onely concealing them, but seeking to cleare them, for your countries harme, and hazard of ruine, yea in labouring in your censure to lay so odious a blot of disgrace vpon your natiue countrie?</p>
               <p>Concerning their late King, and that before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and proued by me in my former booke against

him out of the letter of discouery which I cited, this <hi>Encounterer</hi> promiseth himselfe great aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, the vanitie of whose conceite shall appeare by that which followeth for all his great paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his leauing no stone vnmoued whereby he might discredite either me in cyting such a letter, or the discouerer in writing it, or both. Sometimes hee seemeth to doubt whether there were any such let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of discouerie sent, or whether the tale bee not wholy forged by my selfe; nay he perswadeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to discouer both treacherous cogging, and shameles forgery in my heart and hand. Concerning which obiection of forgerie, I doubt not but to all men indifferent it might bee sufficient for me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, as one <hi>AEmilius Scaurus</hi> did, who being by one <hi>Varius</hi> accused of treason, made this short and plaine answer, <hi>Varius dicit, Scaurus negat; vtri creditis? Varius</hi> saith it, <hi>Scaurus</hi> denieth it, whether doe you beleeue? In like sorte if I should answere concerning this odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crime of forging and inuenting this letter, <hi>N.D.</hi> a Iesuiticall scholler and sworne Spanish obiecteth it, <hi>Francis Hostings</hi> a Christian and true hearted Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman denieth it; whether doe you credite? The iudgements of as many as were not more then halfe Spanish would acquite mee. But yet for further eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I adde, that this discouerie was written in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a letter from a true hearted Englishman, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at that time with a great man in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the name of the writer was one <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> (not <hi>Bradford</hi> whom <hi>Boner</hi> put to death, but <hi>Bradford</hi> a Papist;) the Nobles to whom this letter was directed, were the Earles of <hi>Arundel, Shrewsbury, Pembroke</hi> with other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20447:106"/>
Nobles, and these named I trust you will cleare them from being infected with the humour you imagine to be fed by him.</p>
               <p>Hauing little hope to perswade the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I forged this letter of mine owne head, hee proceedeth to seeke to discredite the certificate in it selfe. For short answere whereto, there be two things materiall of which I must say somewhat, the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it selfe of this King to Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> with the conditions thereof insisted vpon by this English Spaniard, and made a speciall colour to crush the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of <hi>Bradfords</hi> aduertisement, and the secret intent of the King by this letter discouered. By the first, <hi>viz.</hi> the conditions of the marriage together with the Kings vsage, towards the English for a space, hee would ouerthrow the second, namely the certificate of the Kings secret meaning. But (Sir) your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hereupon is very feeble and weake, in taking vpon you hereby to controule the aduertisement of <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> to be false. The world hath not found it strange for some politike men to make semblance of loue when they meane nothing lesse; I will not hunt far for proofe touching the argument in hand, or for disproofe of this <hi>Encounterers</hi> wrongfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against me: Let the <hi>Anti-Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Gallo-Belgicus</hi> both Papists, and <hi>Emanuel Lewis</hi> a <hi>Portugal,</hi> in his open confession at the Guild-hall, and sundrie others suffice for my clearing, not to haue written that I did without ground of proofe in my former booke. It were not amisse to remember and consider, what moued your Popish Prelates and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to bee so busie in hand to haue Ladie <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:20447:106"/>
now our most worthie and happie Queene, married to some Spaniard, and to bee posted ouer with her portion much about the time, that it was said, Queen <hi>Marie</hi> was with childe, and when your Catholike King was concluded to bee Protector and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the issue hoped for. I dare not say (for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your Worship) that I feare it should haue been the best of our sweet Queenes fortune, (if that match had gone forward) to haue liued with her husband in <hi>Spaine,</hi> whilest your King Catholike enioyed by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation the possession and gouernment of her Kingdome in <hi>England,</hi> to the killing of all true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish hearts: but I dare boldlie say that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in <hi>England</hi> doe praise God from their hearts, that she so happelie escaped so daungerous and base a match, and that we so happelie enioy so worthie and blessed a Queene.</p>
               <p>The conditions of the Marriage and vsage of the King for a space being too weake an inference to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the certificate concerning his secret meaning,<note place="margin">The person of the discouerer considered.</note> let vs in few words consider somewhat both of the person of the Discouerer, and the substance of the discouerie: I pray you (Sir) what should moue <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to write this; but that an honest true English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart incited him thereunto? he was by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a Papist, by habitation a Spaniard, for his Master on whom he attended was one, and being amongst them his perill was great in writing this; for if he had been discouered, his life must haue paide for it: he did it not then for hatred to Poperie, as you would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, nor for malice to his Master with whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared he was in good account, nor for any hope of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20447:107"/>
rewarde being farre enough off from receiuing any, but neere vnto daunger it is plaine he was, only when he heard of such a perilous plot to the vtter rooting out of his Countrey men, and ouerthrow of his flourishing Countrey, hee was forced out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of a true English mans heart to expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the hazard of his life, by his setting downe, and sending this aduertisement to these Lords.</p>
               <p>But to fill vp the discredite you desire to lay vpon <hi>Bradford</hi> for this his aduertisement so honestlie giuen to the Nobles of <hi>England,</hi> you aske <hi>How he could in Spaine discouer so great a secret that lay in the Kings breast in England?</hi> For answere I must tell you, that I hope it is not vnknowne that there was some intermission of time betweene the Kings marrying of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> and her death; besides that, when the King was in <hi>England</hi> I trust he had not all his Nobles and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors with him: if this were consulted on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before the marriage, he might then get notice of it; if it were concluded on after the marriage, why might not this be brought to his Master and others into <hi>Spaine,</hi> by letters from some of the Nobles that were with the King here? So that this is but a poore shift to discredite <hi>Bradfords</hi> aduertisement, and the circumstances considered that I did set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his being a Papist in profession, in dwelling a Spaniard, and in place not to write this without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, I doubt not but to euery one in whom reason ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and not passion, it will proue probable enough that there might bee a iust cause of such an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King his sonne was by

our nobles called into <hi>England,</hi> and set vp for their King against King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the <hi>Vicount Melun</hi> (falling deadly sicke) vpon remorse of conscience, secretly confessed to diuers of the Barons, what was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>Lewis</hi> to doe when he had once obtained the Crowne, namely that <hi>Lewis</hi> with sixteene of his Counsellors (whereof this <hi>Vicount</hi> was one,) had compacted after possession of the Crowne obtained to depriue our chiefe Nobles of their lands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and driue them into perpetuall exile. And so farther proceeding, and with many teares pittying the extreame miserie this land was like to come vnto, he brake out into these words: <hi>My friendes, I counsaile you earnestly to looke to your selues, and to prouide the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in time, least it come vpon you vnwares; your King for a season hath kept you vnder, but if Lodowicke preuaile he will put you from all. &amp;c.</hi> Had <hi>Lodowicke</hi> so treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an intent when our Nobles so highly fauoured him, and shal it seeme strange that King <hi>Philip</hi> should haue such a secret meaning? did a Frenchman and an enemie vpon very remorse of conscience bewray this secret? and might not <hi>Bradford</hi> an Englishman (though a Papist) hazzard his life to discouer King <hi>Philips</hi> daungerous plot against his countrie?

I write against a straunger, truly; these against their Soueraign, falsely: I, to confirme sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects hearts, in loyaltie and obedience to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Soueraigne; they, to corrupt Subiectes heartes, and to make them disloyall and disobedient to their Soueraigne: I, to free my countrie from all vsurpers, they, to fill their countrie with forraine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: I, to preserue vnto vs the sincere truth of Gods Gospell; they, to thrust vpon vs a false worship by Poperie and superstition. And this shall suffice to shield and deliuer me from being harmed, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20447:109"/>
by your slaunders, and for all your malice to me, I am sorie you should carrie so vilde and villanous a mind, as not to be vexed to see your Soueraign so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully and disloyally dealt withall. But I haue now so good cause to guesse the vnsoundnes of your heart to my Soueraigne, by this your wrangling, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Ward-word,</hi> as I cannot expect or hope for anie good fruit of a loyall heart towardes her Maiestie from you.</p>
               <p>And to confirme me and all true Subiectes in this opinion,<note place="margin">About Lopus.</note> you close vp this your last <hi>Encounter</hi> with a doubt, whether <hi>Lopus</hi> euer ment to kill our deare So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; and why you should doubt I see not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not done, and with a deniall that your Catholike King should be priuie thereunto, (and yet all the Agents in it doe plainely confesse so) by the first whereof, you lewdlie labour to taxe the seat of our Soueraignes Iustice; and by the second you abuse her Maiestie and her people: and by both you offer to discredit the honourable testimonie in print, of the proofes and proceedings, by examinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of her Maiesties Councell. In which you may finde, how <hi>Lopus</hi> was first solicited by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drada</hi> from <hi>Mendoza</hi> the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in <hi>France,</hi> to poyson her Maiestie: Secondly, by the same <hi>Andrada,</hi> he was solicited by a token from <hi>Christophero de Moro</hi> (one of the Kings priuie Councell,) Thirdly by one <hi>Roderoquo Marques</hi> a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugale,</hi> vnto whom <hi>Lopus</hi> did vndertake to doe the abominable fact, for which he was profered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised fiftie thousands crownes (which I hope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken to be the gift of anie Subiect:) fourthly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20447:110"/>
for this purpose, <hi>Lopus</hi> sent <hi>Andrada</hi> ouer to <hi>Callis</hi> to conferre with <hi>Counte Fuentes</hi> about this practise; and caused <hi>Stephano Ferrera de Gomo</hi> another <hi>Portugale</hi> to write letters to <hi>Stephano Iberra</hi> the Kings Secretary at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to assure him &amp; <hi>Fuentes,</hi> that the detestable fact should be performed if the 50000. crownes were paid, which letter <hi>Lopus</hi> himselfe sent by one <hi>Gomes Dauila</hi> a <hi>Portugale.</hi> But <hi>Andrada</hi> not being thought fit to follow so great a cause, <hi>Ferrera</hi> was chosen to manage it, by whom the Doctor did againe assure the performance of this villanie; and then there were bils of exchaunge for the mony deliuered by the <hi>Counte Fuentes,</hi> the one from <hi>Gonzalo Gomez</hi> to <hi>Pedro de Carreras,</hi> the other from <hi>Gomez</hi> to <hi>Iohn Pallacios:</hi> And if (through the merciful prouidence of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God) these had not been lingered, and that in the meane time by the diligence and carefulnes of one of the Lords of her Maiesties priuie Councell the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had not been discouered, the villanie had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and acted, and so brought out of doubt (as this Espaniolized champio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seemeth to haue wished) to the vnauoydable hazard of ruine in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Countrie and State. So haue you here vpon honorable credence plainely proued, that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> should haue been the Actor of this villanie, that <hi>Andrada, Ferrera Gomez Dauila,</hi> and <hi>Manuell Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes</hi> (all <hi>Portugales</hi>) were Agents and Messengers to him about it; that <hi>Mendoza</hi> your Kings Embassador in <hi>France, Christofero de Moro, Count Fuentes,</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie <hi>Iberra</hi> (all Councellors to your King) were Directors to these Agents and Messengers, and how farre your King himselfe did direct herein, let the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20447:110"/>
booke tell you: And therefore haue you no cause to doubt of <hi>Lopus</hi> his bloudie meaning in this bloudie busines.</p>
               <p>To returne to your selfe (Sir) I make no doubt but you desire to be beleeued in all that you haue scattered in your Libell, and not least in this last part; for if you could creepe into the secret bosomes of our English Nation, and winne credit to be beleeued, that all that you say is Gospell, you might then hope of some likelihood to preuaile in your shameles sute for toleration,<note place="margin">His sute to the Lords.</note> or alteration in Religion tendered to the Lords in your Remission immediatly following. But as it is well knowne to them all, that we haue been much blessed of God by her Maiesties gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (although you inuert all out of your popish and traiterous affection into cursings) so I doubt not, but they all see and will acknowledge, that the true worship of God erected and established amongst vs by her Maiestie, is the verie assured and principall ground-worke of all our blessings: Religion and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie must be our safetie, and so long as wee keepe God by imbracing his truth without halting; so long shall God keepe this land safe from all malice of all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies whatsoeuer. Therefore farre shall it be from them, so much as to lend an eare to so impudent and euill affected a Sutor, as you shew your selfe to be, in daring with shameles face to slaunder and scorne our Religion, to depraue our seat of Iustice, to harten disobedience, to excuse traitors, to darken and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of your two Monarches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> against our Soueraigne &amp; Queene; contrariwise when her iust commendation was set
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20447:111"/>
out, for being God his good instrument of many great blessings brought vnto vs, you maliciouslie turne them (as I said before) into cursings: when to the praise of almightie God mention is made of her wonderfull and happy deliuerances, both in the time of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> and in her owne time, you doe in derision call the first a miracle of Milne-wheeles, and the second you shameleslie seeme to perswade, they were things rather feared by vs, then intended to her. When I vrge <hi>Stories</hi> traiterous and bloudie words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, you cunningly seeke to turne his meaning to other persons and purposes. When I condemne Cardinall <hi>Allin</hi> and Bishop <hi>Gardiners</hi> proude and pernitious dealing towards her, you fall into extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie high commendations of them, as if the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of their praises for so dealing had been worthie to bee blowne ouer all the world: when I say, that we should keepe these three things safe in our breast; first our Conscience to God; secondly, our Loue to our Countrey; thirdly, our Loyaltie to our Prince, you earnestlie labour to proue that wee are not bound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to loue our Countrey, and to beare Loyaltie to our Prince, but that for Religions sake, wee must hate them and warre against them: and when I lay downe the many, and manifold wrongs most vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianlie and vnkindly offered to her Maiestie by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> you bend your whole force to couer all, and to proue wrongs offered by her Maiestie and our Nation to them, such is your speciall loue to these your two Monarches, and to all treasons, and Traytors plotted and encouraged by them; and so little and key-colde is your loue and dutie to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20447:111"/>
to whom you owe all loue and obedience. But this is the fruite of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> his Bull, the perill of which curse you will not incurre; and such is the force of your Catholike Religion and Spanish Crownes, as you will rather worship <hi>Dagon,</hi> then serue the liuing God, and giue your faith to an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping stranger, then keepe yours giuen, and due to your lawfull Soueraigne. Yet for all this you doubt not to tender a remission of your whole answere to the iudgement of the Lords of her Maiesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, by which your answere, and remission (if it bee well scanned in matter and manner) you will bee found iustlie to deserue all the titles contained in this one verse,
<q>
                     <l>Vafer, detractor, mendax, elatus, iniquus.</l>
                     <l>A subtile, railing, lying, proud, &amp; treacherous man.</l>

And thus much haue I aduentured to offer to the view of my Christian Countrymen in defence of my former <hi>Watch-word,</hi> collected by me out of my Christian affection to them for their benefite, that they may know I stand still constant, and confident to defend the truth of my God, against Poperie and all other heresies, to performe my Loialtie to my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne against all Popish Espaniolized Traytours, and treason, and to stand for the libertie of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie against <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and all forraine Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates whatsoeuer; as also that my silence should not cause them to conceiue, that this masked Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rayling tongue hath any way distempered me, or his threatning brauadoes any whit dismaied me, the first whereof I passe ouer, with little regard, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Counsell of wise <hi>Salomon: It is the glorie
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20447:112"/>
of a man to passe by offences:</hi> the second I scorne, being sent out by a cowardlie Companion that speakes big, and dares not shew his face.</p>
               <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> I delight not in warre and hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betweene Princes, I wish peace in all States and Common-wealths, from my heart, so farre forth as may stand with the glorie of almightie God, who is the supreame author of all authoritie and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is onely to bee serued both by Prince and people, as his word prescribeth. For I confesse, <hi>Dulce est nomen pacis; res verò ipsa, tum iucunda, tum salutaris.</hi> And yet can I not subscribe to this blinde Peace-makers desire, that longeth for a Peace to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and laboureth by a Peace to bring in his Idoll worship againe amongst vs: but I heartelie pray to my God, to preserue vs from such a Peace, and with <hi>Erasmus</hi> I affirme, <hi>Melior est talis pugna, quae Deo proximum facit, quàm pux illa quae à Deo separat.</hi> But if such a Peace may be had, as may not preiudice a good Conscience in the truth of Religion we now holde, nor impeach the safetie of our deare Queene, nor hazard bondage to our Countrie, by the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of forrainers and strangers; blessed bee that Peace-maker, and God almightie graunt vs such a Peace all our daies. And this haue I presumed to say in answere to this Champions Peace prayed for in the Conclusion of these his <hi>Encounters,</hi> with a minde rather to raise vp the power and pride of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> then for any good minde or meaning he hath to our Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to knit vp this my Resistance to euery of your rayling <hi>Encounters,</hi> (Sir <hi>N.D.</hi>) I assure my selfe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20447:112"/>
you shall finde all the Protestants and Professors of Gods truth in <hi>England,</hi> as also many of those that are infected with the Romish Religion, so well resolued from your owne pen of your want of ciuilitie in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beyond measure, and your want of a found heart to your Soueraigne and Countrie, in so highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling your two greatest Monarches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the preiudice and touch both of Queene and Countrie (so farre forth as the power of your wicked wit and words can deuise, and perswade) as your glosing shall gaine little credite to worke my condemnation in any of their iudgements, either for any thing that was in my former booke, or for any thing contained in this latter: For I meane none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all that is said, but a desire of confirmation to the one in a holy profession, and a reformation to the other of their being any longer seduced, and misled by <hi>Romes</hi> inchantments, and a care in both to stand firmelie and faithfullie to defend their Soueraigne and Countrey, against forraine malice and home Treason; whereunto if way should bee giuen, God should be dishonoured, our Queene endaungered, our Countrie depriued of it auncient and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable liberties, and then what can either one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke for but miserie, and desolation. For what befell both to <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi> when the <hi>Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi> brought in a friend of theirs called <hi>Facinus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> who was to haue the goods of the <hi>Guelphes</hi> for his paie? He was no sooner gotten in, but that without sparing of either, both sides were spoyled; whereof when the <hi>Gibellines</hi> complained, saying that their goods were spoyled contrarie to agreement, this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20447:113"/>
their friend by them brought in answered, <hi>That themselues were Gibellines, and they should bee safe; but their goods were Guelphes and they must pay for it:</hi> Your selues can make the application; and so to your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes I leaue it, beseeching God to continue his wonted mercie towards our Queene and land, and to giue to this my aduersarie and all of his faction a better minde, if it stand with his good will and pleasure.
