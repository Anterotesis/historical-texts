            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Abſtract of the Grievances of Trade which Oppreſs our Poor, <hi>Humbly offered to the Parliament.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Need no farther Proof of our Calamity and Decay of Trade, than a true Account of the Hard Charge upon Land, to the neceſſary Relief of our Poor in all places of our Woollen Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> which in many Pariſhes is a greater Expence, than the neceſſary Support of our War. And to excuſe the preſent Juncture of Affairs, I refer to the Preſſures of the Farmer fifteen or twenty Years paſt; during which time his Wooll, Corn, Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did not yield ſo much by a third part, as it did in former days, although in Peace with all <hi>Europe.</hi> Notwithſtanding which Charge, could I here ſet forth the Hardſhips that many Weavers and Spinners have undergone theſe two Years laſt paſt, preſerving Life only by the hard Fare of Beans and Water, which is true in too many Inſtances of Fact, (who in former days lived handſomly by their Labour.) It could not but move the Pitty of this Great Council, ſince it evidently Springs, not ſo much from the Badneſs of Trade in it ſelf, as the Prevailing Power of Forreign and Private Intereſt in the Management. And ſince this Hard Fare in the Country is in great meaſure occaſioned by the Delicates of Capons and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, the Splendor and Equipage of Intruders in the City, who live upon the Woollen Manufacture, like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Lillies, and neither Toil nor Spin. And had not the Benign Favour of Providence happily interven'd in a Plentiful Crop of Corn and Fruit, Neceſſity had compelled a more Tumultuous Addreſs. And the Hopes of this Seſſion is the only Support of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Traders; the Hazard in the preſent Management of the Sale of Cloth, being too great to adventure an Eſtate in the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95289:3"/>I. The firſt Grievance that I humbly offer to Conſideration, is the Exportation of our Wooll into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which Practice is ſo Obvious and well known, that I need not ſpend time in making any Diſcovery, whilſt of three thouſand Packs of long Wooll that grows annually in <hi>Rumney</hi> Marſh, it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly believed that Two thouſand are carried into <hi>France.</hi> Neither can I think it needful, to ſet forth the Loſs that our Nation hereby ſuſtains, when each Pack of long Worſted Wooll is fifty Pounds loſs to our Nation in the Manufacture. Beſides, by the mixture of one Pack of ours, they work up two of their own to a far greater Advantage. And whilſt they are hereby likewiſe become Competitors with us in the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture at all our Forreign Markets with their cheap Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: How to prevent this great Miſchief, is the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Great Council, which being effectually done, would more affect <hi>France,</hi> than a Million of Money expended in the beſt Method that could be contrived; and likewiſe enable us to pay a Million more to carry on the War: And have the ſame good Effect as in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to bring back a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our Manufactures that we have loſt, which would be no ſmall Advantage to our Nation; for although in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects at preſent we have too many People in <hi>England,</hi> yet in the general we much want: Our Wooll is the Bread of our Nation, and no Compenſation can be made for its loſs, or other ways to be found (whatſoever we may flatter our ſelves) for the Imployment of our Poor, that will Support its Practice; Providence having diſtributed to all Nations ſome peculiar Aſſiſtance, thereby to keep all parts of the World in a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon each other; and the ſetting up Work-houſes for the Imployment of our Poor, even in the Woollen Manufacture, in the preſent Circumſtances of our Trade, will be but Skinning over the Diſtemper, which in a little time will break out in the greater Rage. For if thoſe that are bred up to a Profeſſion, cannot get a Livelihood by the Imployment of our Poor in their own way, it is very unlikely that thoſe that are to come into a Practice in the uſe of a Publick Stock, ſhould have any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Succeſs; and the raiſing any ſuch Stock, would be very difficult at preſent in all thoſe places where it is moſt wanting, being very much Impoveriſh'd already by an equal Expence, in the Relief of the Poor, and Charge of our War. We have Wooll enough growing in <hi>England,</hi> with the help of our Spaniſh, to imploy more Poor than we have; and was our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95289:3"/>
Trade but duly encouraged, our Work-people would be ſought after. And it's remarkable, that whilſt we give Money freely upon one hand, to carry on a War againſt <hi>France</hi> with Vigor, we ſhould Support them upon the other with our Wooll, which hath been no ſmall Kindneſs. When the <hi>French</hi> parted with <hi>Ireland,</hi> they carried off a great quantity of Wooll and Yarn, which put them upon a Manufacture for <hi>Turkey:</hi> They have ſince been ſupplied with great quantities of Wooll from us; the <hi>Straits</hi> hath been open to them; and to help them to a good Market, our <hi>Turkey</hi>-Merchants bound up their own Hands from ſending, which hath very much impoveriſh'd our Poor.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The next Grievance in Trade that comes in courſe to be conſidered, is the loſs of the Reputation of our Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures abroad, occaſioned by our ſlight making and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them; in which particular I think we are arrived at Perfection, every private Maker's Rule being freely become his own Choice. And until this Miſchief to the Publick is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd, I think it in vain to propoſe to our ſelves a greater Conſumption.</p>
            <p>This hath evidently prevailed upon us, as the Forreign Merchants of <hi>Holland, France, Flanders, Germany, Sweden,</hi> &amp;c. hath made themſelves Principals in our Markets, in buying our Engliſh Commodities by their Forreign and Engliſh Factors reſiding with us.</p>
            <p>Theſe Factors being obliged to buy ſuch Price-Goods as their Principals abroad direct; and the Makers in <hi>England</hi> being under no Rule or Reſtraint from the Government in making their Goods, they quickly drop'd from their Standard Goodneſs, and as Prices were beat down upon them, have ſtill made the Commodity worſe. The Forreign Merchants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Dutch, having a nearer Intereſt of their own to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the Woollen Manufactures, hath always been a beating down the Prices of ours, without a due Reſpect to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, knowing well enough that it was the Intrinſick Goodneſs of our Engliſh Cloth in former days, that always kept a Check upon them. Our late Government having been likewiſe ſo kind to forward this Practice ever ſince the 25 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. by taking of Aliens Duties, from all our Woollen Manufactures, and putting the Forreign Merchant upon an equal Foot with the Engliſh, it hath prevailed ſo far, that nine parts in ten of our Woollen Manufactures that are vended in <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95289:4"/>
and great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> are carried over upon theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Merchants accounts, as likewiſe in their Bottoms.</p>
            <p>The exact Care of our Anceſtors, ſucceſſively to prevent this Miſchief, and encourage the Engliſh Merchant, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very much reflect upon the Practice of our days, in which we have ſeemingly loſt the Love of Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VII: <hi>Anno primo, cap.</hi> 2. made an Act, That Aliens made Denizons, ſhould pay the ſame Duty as if they were Aliens, whilſt we excuſe Aliens, and make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Engliſh Merchant and an Alien in all our Native Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. <hi>With a great Sum,</hi> ſaid the Chief Captain, <hi>obtained I this Freedom:</hi> But ſaid St. <hi>Paul, I was Free born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to prevent this Loſs to our Nation, but by eſtabliſhing the Merchandiſe of our Woollen Manufacture in Engliſh hands; who purſuant to their own Native Intereſt, will be obliged to examine the Goodneſs of their Goods, and be Ambitious of preſerving their Reputation, who are always upon the Spot to conſult with the Maker, and receive conſtant Advice from their Engliſh Correſpondents abroad how Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities pleaſe, how Faſhions govern, and what Meaſures are to be taken to prevent the Dutch and French gaining Ground upon us. It muſt be allowed, that no part of the World can equal us in the Woollen Manufacture, in the diligent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Advantages which Providence hath afforded us. And the Reputation and Goodneſs of any Commodity is a very great Inducement to its Sale, ſo long as a real Benefit doth likewiſe thereby accrue to the Buyer; Cloth being the Foundation, of almoſt as great a Charge in trimming and making a Suit, and the ſaving of Threepence in making, doth make the Commodity Ninepence the worſe in its real Merit. This being the Foundation of our Riches, it ought ſure to be the principal Care of our Government; but no Law can be effectual, without Incorporating our Woollen Manufacture in Engliſh hands to be Exported.</p>
            <p>For if a forreign Merchant hath a Servant of his reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> which hath the freedom of our Markets in buying and ſending him over, ſuch Goods as he directs, he can eaſily order the making of ſuch and ſuch cheap ſlight Goods, and find Makers enough to make them for him, if they are aſſured of their Chapmen. For all that the ſtricteſt Examiner can do, purſuant to any Law, is but to give Light to the Buyer for his Government: So that ſhould we endeavour to reform this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95289:4"/>
Grievance by a Law, with the concurrent Aſſiſtance of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Merchants, and leave a Liberty to this Forreign or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Factor to act for Forreign Merchants, the Credit that is gained abroad by the Engliſh Merchant, ſhall be undermined and interlop't away, by falſe Engliſh Goods of like making in an extraordinary Profit to the Forreigner, in which Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar we are not without a Famous Inſtance, where the Tillets, Scales, and Coat of Arms, of an Engliſh Merchant, were counterfeited by a Dutch Factor, and worſe Goods made up under his Mark, which was proved in an open Court in <hi>England,</hi> and Damages allowed. I doubt we are too ſhort in contending in Trade with the ſubtle Dutch, whilſt we leave open ſuch Blots as this. This is like a two edged Sword to our Poor, it leſſens the Conſumption, and immediately takes the Bread out of their Mouths; For there is more Workmanſhip (in many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars required to the Manufacturing two Cloths exactly well) than is now uſed to the making of three, and Money very well expended.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To this debaſing our Woollen Manufacture, being added in the Next Place the unneceſſary Charge of ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon it, we need not wonder at our want of Conſumption abroad, or Complaint in our Streets at home, which is fully compleated by the Profit of the Wooll Jobber, Salary of the Factor, and his Profit out of Wooll, the attendant Charges of new Preſſing, Ware-houſe Room, Portridge, Poſtage, Caſh-money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is always a large Article in a Factor's Account, and the more Secret Profit of the Packer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſorry Bullworks in Trade, to cope with the Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Induſtrious Contrivance, and exact making of the Dutch in all their Woollen Manufactures, and the cheap Workmanſhip of <hi>France,</hi> whilſt both are manufacturing our own Wooll. This dead Weight upon the Maſter Wheel of our Trade, hath been fixt by the Loſs of the Publick Market of <hi>Blackwell-hall</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where in former Days the Clothier met the Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that was a Free-man, who was thereby alone impowered to buy in this Market, and ſold him his Cloth, afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Money, and bought his Wooll of the Grower, which was a ſtrait Current of Trade, which now by the Power of Private Intereſt, is drawn into a Meander, and its Courſe ſo much retarded through the great City, that the Country is ſtarved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95289:5"/>This Alteration of the Sale of Cloth, from the Publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket into Private Houſes, and the Management by Factors and Packers, hath introduced a Swarm of Inconveniences, which would be too tedious to Particularize; like the Limner, I will fix upon the Head, and therein ſhadow the reſt, which I take to be the long Credit of Six, Nine, and Twelve Months Time, which at preſent is uſually taken in the Payment for Cloth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bought, without making any ſuch Condition in the buying. This is a Cuſtomary Accomodation extorted from the Maker, by the Cunning of the Factor, to ſupport his own Station, and introduce a farther Profit to himſelf out of Wooll, which in the next Place is politickly converted into a Shew-horn by the Merchant, to get their Goods the cheaper, and peel the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the firſt Place, They hereby overpower the Maker's Stock, and puts him upon Stops in Trade, which hath very much beaten down the Price of Workmanſhip. The Circumſtance of our Poor from this long Credit is truly lamentable, Wages in the firſt place is hereby beaten down three Pence in a Shilling. This being likewiſe ill paid, hath forced moſt part of our Poor to buy their Wheat, Malt and other Neceſſaries of Badgers, a great Growth of which hath lately ſprung up in our Nation; where in many Particulars, they have not had above ten penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth for a Shilling. And which is yet more impoveriſhing, Theſe Badgers are great Sellers of Brandy and hot Liquors, and our Poor having a conſtant Reſort to their Houſes, are under a conſtant Temptation to drink. And although there need no Inducement after a Habit is taken, yet being got into theſe Mens Debts, they are forced to ſweeten their Credit, by a new new—Lottery. Could there be a Law provided to put a ſtop to this ill Habit of drinking hot Liquors, it would be of great Service to our Nation, and that Grain that is hereby expended is doubly loſt by palling the Stomachs of our Poor, beſides a worſe Conſequence in ſhortning their Lives. In the next Place, they hereby command the Clothier in buying his Wooll at Shear-time, to get it the cheaper of the Farmer. Both which have been effectual means to anſwer their Deſign. The Firſt in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Wages, hath leſſened the Price of Corn, Cheeſe, Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hath put the Breeder upon the great Neceſſity to ſell his Wooll at Shear-time, the Clothing Stock being now wholly involved in the City of <hi>London,</hi> all Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are generally ſtopt at that Time of the Year. How far this hath prevailed, let thoſe that are concerned conſider. And

the greateſt part of our Trade being managed by Forreign and Engliſh Factors, the Advantage of this centers in <hi>Holland</hi> and other Nations.</p>
            <p>This long Credit hath drawn over abundance of Interlopers, or Forreign Factors, from <hi>Holland,</hi> the Hanſe Towns of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Flanders, France, Sweden, &amp;c.</hi> which are readily courted by their Brethren the Factors in <hi>London,</hi> and although too many of them left their own Country, becauſe the Air was too ſharp for their Pockets, yet they are hereby enabled to make large Maſters of Goods upon their Principals abroad, whoſe Service they court before they deſire their Bills for Payment, which is a ſtrong Fortification to a Man's Credit, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Cemplement theſe hazardous Times. And all this done for two <hi>per Cent.</hi> The Inſurance I muſt confeſs is cheap enough, being made upon the Goods, I wiſh that was all the Hazard the Maker was at, and that he needed not an Inſurance for his Chapman too.</p>
            <p>This Practice is of Power enough to draw all the Commiſſions out of Engliſh Hands that have any Subſtance; and will in a little time deſtroy one Branch of the Revenue of our Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Courts: The Inventories of our Clothiers Eſtates, in a ſhort Time, will be fully ballanced by bad Debts of Enſurance; as in a late Inſtance of as good a Maker as <hi>England</hi> ever bred, whoſe Eſtate was ballanced by his Factor in five and thirty Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds bad Debts.</p>
            <p>This Credit being not only the Foundation of the Engliſh Factor, but a Compaſs whereby he ſteers his Clothiers to his Ware-houſe of Wooll, it hath begot ſo intire a Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Interloper, their Intereſts thus Jumping, that the Engliſh Merchant that bought the Cloth for thoſe Parts, paid ready Money, and ſometimes converſt with the Clothiers, hath been wholly diſcouraged and beat out of Trade. And ſo great a Familiarity ſprung up between theſe Brethren in their frequent Meeting at the Poſt-houſe to receive their Letters of Patterns, the one from his Maſters abroad, the other his Servants out of the Country: That the Interloper many times opens the Factor's Letters of Patterns, when his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions are conſiderable, and when theſe Patterns ſo luckily jumps, there can be no exact matching of them until the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight is cleared with a Glaſs of good Wine. In the drinking of which the Affairs of State are as well ſettled as that of Trade. And Directions muſt be given to the Makers when Opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95289:6"/>
to manage Elections as well as govern their Chollers: And if the Wine chance to pleaſe their Pallats, they familiarly drink up the Sea, and joyn <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> as exact as a Pattern cut out of the ſame Piece of Cloth.</p>
            <p>But as by this Fraternity of Dealers ſo many Loſſes hath hapned, we are now like to have a Compenſation in a new Race of Merchants: By the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> inter-marrying with the Daughters of our <hi>Canaanites</hi>; hereby to increaſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions by the choiceſt Goods and beſt Penniworths in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way: However by this means our Maſquerade-Merchants will become half <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which will be better than all Forreign. Since our late Government hath not thought this Branch of our Merchandiſe worth their notice, which in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. ſupported three hundred Merchants upon the Cloth Trade, and without peradventure as many upon the Linnens, deſigning a more brisk and dependent Imployment for the young Sons of our Gentry.</p>
            <p>I cannot but think, that the Forreign Merchants of <hi>France, Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> Laugh'd in their Sleeves, at the firſt Advice of this Preferment of their Servants in <hi>England,</hi> that was to entail them ſo many good Penniworths; who are much to be commended in making the beſt of their Markets, otherwiſe their Folly had been more betray'd in not hitting the Blot, than ours that gave Opportunity in leaving it open. But Experience ſhews us, that Friendſhip and good Neighbourhood is beſt preſerved by an exact keeping of Mounds, eſpecially where there is great odds in the Sweetneſs of the Turf.</p>
            <p>Credit in Trade, in the whole Practice of it, is extreamly impoveriſhing and prejudicial to our Nation, which hath inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly grown upon us theſe late Years, and will unavoidably deſtroy all Subſtantial Traders, and Order in Trade, if not prevented. It hath in the firſt Place been too great a Spur to Ambition (the Epidemical Diſtemper of our Nation) and made all Ranks of People put their Children to Trades above their Abilities of ſetting them up, which hath drained the Country of little Stocks, that otherwiſe would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Husbandry; too much increaſed the Numbers of our eaſie Traders, and leſſened our Graſiers, Farmers, and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious ſort of People, that are much wanting to a full Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Land, the Foundation of our Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95289:6"/>In the next place, it hath brought an Interloper into almoſt all Trades, without being regularly brought up to it. Since all Government in Trade hath been laid aſide, which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a very great Grievance to the Trade of our Nation: This hath left the Burden too hard upon thoſe of his own Rank, and ſpoiled thoſe above him. And we have too many that ſpend their Time Idly in Coffee-houſes, getting their Livelihood by peeling the Country, that are really wanted in digging of Ditches, and improving our Land; which is a dry ſort of Livelihood, I muſt confeſs, compared with getting of it with a Stroak of the Pen, but of Moment enough to be conſidered by our Government.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to another Inducement to our long Credit in Trade, which is likewiſe the Off-ſpring of the former. Forreign Merchants, eſpecially the Dutch, by this Freedom of our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, in buying our Engliſh Commodities, have been induced to ſend over all the Native Commodities of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. As likewiſe the Product of all other Parts that will yield an Advantage in <hi>England,</hi> to their Agents here upon their own Accounts, to be diſpoſed in a retail Manner as Occaſions hath required them; which in former Days were bought by our Merchants in their Markets, and brought over for the Service of <hi>England.</hi> Whilſt our Trade for thoſe parts was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in Engliſh Hands. The woollen Manufactures of <hi>England,</hi> in thoſe Days being eſteemed the commanding Commodity in the Trade of the whole World, as appears by the Priviledges granted to the Company of our Merchant Adventurers at their Reſidences abroad; their fine Linnens, Spicery, Whale-bone; Mader, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are now ſold off to our Linnen-drapers, Grocers, Mercers, Salters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a long Credit, upon this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Credit in Trade in <hi>England</hi> is valued proportionable to our Intereſt of Money, which being Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and Money in <hi>Holland</hi> but at three, it was Bait enough to a frugal Dutch-Man. And it is a little remarkable truly, that ſuch large Stocks of Goods that are always lodging in their Ware-houſes, and in the Hands of our Traders in <hi>England,</hi> which hath had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Government, and afterwards the ſame Freedom of our Markets as our Native Subjects, ſhould yet be excuſed the Payment of the leaſt Share towards the Charge of our War, whilſt their Goods hath been carried and recarried in their own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95289:7"/>
Bottoms, which in time will unavoidably pull down the Bull-works of our Nation, whilſt I dare undertake that theſe very Goods have been paid for by many Engliſh Traders that durſt not own them. In a Subſidy granted to King <hi>James</hi> the firſt <hi>Anno Septimo Cap.</hi> 22. the Goods belonging to Engliſh Subjects were charged at two Shillings eight Pence in the Pound, and all ſuch Goods as this belonging to Aliens, was charged at five Shillings four Pence.</p>
            <p>Theſe Goods will be eaſily diſcovered, there being exact Accounts kept, Debtor and Creditor, in all their Factors Books, and certainly be worth a looking after, when there may be one German Merchants Account to be found that deals for one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> in Linnens. And upon the other hand, did we ſave the Money in the Exchequer that is drawn back by Goods exported from our own Plantations, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Die ſtuff, (whereby the Dutch are inabled to die twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper than the Engliſh) Tobacco, Sugars, and the Linnens that are ſent hence to our own Plantations, it would advance very conſiderable towards our next Years Expence.</p>
            <p>How far our Nation is concerned in throwing open all the Myſteries of our Trade to any Part of the World, and in letting in Perſians and Grecians to be acquainted with the Prices of our Goods in a low time of Trade, I am not of Ability to determine, but cannot but take Notice of the Occaſion of their coming over, and how that Part of our Trade falls under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in my preſent Subject of Credit.</p>
            <p>Our Honourable Eaſt-India Company, ſome Years ſince fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a little Eclipſe in their Credit, whereby Money grew ſcarce with them, and their Manufactures of Indian Silks, Muſlins, and Callicoes, which were wholly carried on with Silver, being their only Profit, through the cheap Wormanſhip of the Indians, who were now (by Artificers ſent over) brought to humour our Engliſh Fancies, or our Ladies brought to fall in love with them, wholly neglects the ſending over any of our Woollen Manufactors for three or four Years, to ſome Parts of the Eaſt-Indies that they formerly ſerved, upon which (a Famine of Cloth growing on in thoſe Parts) ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95289:7"/>
Perſians and Grecians, muſtered up their Forces like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons, and undertook a hazardous Journey into a ſtrange Land where they heard was Plenty, for the Good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Country-men; their fair Enterprize ſucceeded well in their Journey, but not without Difficulty (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Parallel) when they attained the Land, for they now found themſelves within the Charter of the Eaſt-India Company; and although they ſaw great Plenty of the Goods their Countrey wanted, yet their Hands were ſtill bound up from procuring it for them; but this Difficulty was accommodated by the Payment of a Fine of ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Company, or more, for what Goods they bought; upon which they were permitted to go freely into our Packer's Houſes, and were courted with as good and cheap Penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths as <hi>England</hi> afforded; and paid for their Cloth before they exported it.</p>
            <p>Upon great Complaint, as well upon this Account as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, againſt the Eaſt-India Company, to the Government, They were lately obliged to ſhip off annually one Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds worth of our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, for the Advantage of the Country, which readily they agreed to; but by the Sharpneſs of their Wits they turned this Obligation into a Support of their Darling Profit; which I think is the Maſter-piece of their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and it was effected by this Means.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> were now to return again into their own Countrey all except <hi>Callander,</hi> who was their chiefeſt Judgment in the Woollen Manufacture; who was to be left behind to inſpect their Penniworths, and ſee their Goods ſhip'd off according to their Agreement: And to ſave their Trouble and Hazard in remitting their Money for <hi>England,</hi> it ſhould be paid into their Factory in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> This Affair being ſo well accommodated, the Company now gives out that they reſolve to devote themſelves to the good of the Nation, and to buy all the Cloth that was made in their way; and in the firſt Place, to carry on their Deſign, they eſpouſed the Intereſt of three or four conſiderable Packers, that had the command of the Sale of great Quantities of Cloth, but were privately
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95289:8"/>
Members of their own Company; theſe now out-vye one another in their Bills of Parcels of Cloth, where they drew many Clothiers into the ſame Bargain as one and the ſame; and as Money was paid, without Diſtinction they divided it, and Multitudes of Samples were ſent into the Eaſt-India Houſe. Some Scruples were made at firſt, by their Propoſals of a little Accommodation in Payment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore of ſome Ships that they dayly expected; which difficulty was ſoon got over, by the firſt Examples. A conſiderable Quantity of Cloth was bought, <hi>Callander</hi> inſpected the Penniworths, and the Cloth was Shipt off.</p>
            <p>Upon Pretence of Diſappointments, Payments are now ſtopt, and Bonds given, with lawful Intereſts to the Clothiers for ſix Months; that time expires and no Payment, and now going on for the other ſix Months. And thus they have fixt a Debt of almoſt one Hundred Thouſand Pounds upon the Countrey, and no Poſſibility of paying it off, until their Goods return from their Factory that this Money purchaſed; ſo that inſtead of their relieving the Countrey, they have made the Countrey relieve them, and reduced our Poor to Hunger and Nakedneſs, which is a very ſevere Diſpenſation upon the Countrey at this Juncture of Time. Doubtleſs when the Obligation was laid by the Government for the buying of ſo much of our Woollen Manufactures, it was likewiſe intended that there ſhould be <hi>quid pro quo</hi>; and whatſoever Damages doth come from hence to the Countrey, muſt be owing to the Unkindneſs of her own Members; for had our Bill paſt to preſerve the Publick Market of <hi>Blackwell-hall,</hi> the Eaſt-India Company muſt as well paid for this Cloth, as their Bills of one Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds that were drawn upon them from <hi>Cadiz</hi> at the ſame Time. He had need of a Roman Faith, that will give Credit with Goods upon a common Seal.</p>
            <p>But to conſider Credit upon the other ſide, where it makes no Returns in Profit or Charity, which is made good in the very letter in all our ſhort Staple Indian Silk and Callicoes; which Credit hath had as Impoveriſhing Effects upon this ſide as the other, and as politickly drawn on.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95289:8"/>
It was the Magnetick Force of the nimble Current of our new Faſhions, that ſwelled the large Folio's of our Silk-man and Upſtart Millener to ſuch a Bulk, that they were like to overturn the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter, De donis Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi> and center the Grandeur of our Nation in <hi>Sampſons</hi> and <hi>Goliahs</hi> in Trade, where the meaneſt Settlement muſt be a Coach and Six. This Credit hath been like the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>'s Sword, that ſpared neither Friend nor Foe; and in our late Current of Affairs it was impoſſible to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when there was not a Ship that came from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> but brought home ſome new Faſhion or other; which by their frequent Addreſs with Guinea's, and fine Indian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the governing Star of our Faſhions, was ſoon enough ſet forward, being ſo agreeable to the Errand the Goddeſs came upon; which was impoſſible to be withſtood by a Feminine Power.</p>
            <p>When I conſider this nimble Expence upon one ſide, the leſſening of Rents and ill Payment upon the other, I cannot but fancy that the Country-Gentleman's Eſtate (for many Years paſt) hath been like St. <hi>Laurence</hi> upon the Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron, unluckily melted upon both ſides; and that he hath had as hard a Task (if Bleſs'd with Daughters) to keep out of theſe Books, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had to paſs by the <hi>Cyrens.</hi> Nay, which hath been an Aggravation, our late Court-Ladies, to out-run the Strain of the Times, and give an Example to the whole Nation, hath inſenſibly been Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphiſed into a ſubſtantial ſort of Superſtition; in being become like the Pſalmiſt Idols, that had Hands, but handled not the Counter-part of Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>But Bleſs'd be the Heavens, the Influence of a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hath once more recover'd the Faculty; nay, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ſo good a Satisfaction, that many are ſeemingly under a voluntary Penance for loſt Time, which in all likelihood will redeem our Female-Sex from the Government of the <hi>Indians</hi>; otherwiſe they will become like the Fooliſh Builder that built his Houſe upon the Sands; and convert their Labours into the greater Ridicule, by falling into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the Spider that works in Cobwebs. Which ſingle particular, in Seven Years Practice, will be a full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the utmoſt Expence of our Revolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95289:9"/>I ſhall not endeavour to make any Calculation of our Loſs to the Publick by theſe Practices, being very far from believing, that this Management grew on upon us by the Inadvertency of our late Governments, but rather by the contrary: But it's Matter of Amazement and Admiration, to conſider the ſlow Advance of thoſe that bear ſo neceſſary a part in the Superſtructure, after Providence hath been ſo favourable to ſettle us once more upon ſo good a Foundation: Whilſt it hath long ſince likewiſe pleaſed His Sacred Majeſty to recommend the Ballancing of Trade.</p>
            <p>I wiſh we are not convinced of our Negligence in the great Affair of the Trade of our Nation, when it is too late. I am well aſſured, had there been due Care taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Exportation of our Wooll, at the Beginning of our Wars, and encourage Trade in all its particulars, as in Prudence we ought and might have done, had we laid but two Shillings in the Pound equally upon Land, and raiſed the reſt that our Occaſions required by an Exciſe, our labouring People, which would have paid the greateſt Share, had lived much better than now they have done, and the reſt of our Expence had been ſaved.</p>
            <p>In a long Combat we ought to be tender of loading our Sword hand; and this I am ſure, that whilſt by Annuities, Lotteries, and Banks, we have fixt great part of our trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stocks in a Mortgage upon the Nation, not again to be commanded, thereby to prevent an Exciſe, we have tied up our own Hands in Trade, and fixt it to a very dangerous Degree, in the Hands of the Dutch and other Nations; who hath as effectually exciſed the labouring Part of our Nation, as if they lived under their own Government; and will every Year do it more and more purſuant to their own Intereſt, and in Favour of their own Subjects; and its a little melancholly to conſider, that the little Trade that we have left is liable to be ſtopt, if they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>It is a vaſt Sum of Money through the whole Nation, that three pence in a Shilling in the Workmanſhip of our Manufactures does amount to, which is the leaſt that hath been loſt. But the Value much greater, when one third part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95289:9"/>
of our People have not been imployed, whilſt our Wooll hath been exported, but remained as a Burthen upon the Land. To this being added the loſs of our Merchandiſe, beſides the low price of our Goods, and likewiſe our Frieght, it will amount to a Prodigious Sum; and I doubt it will be found a greater Difficulty to recover our Trade than at preſent is thought upon.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Another Precipis that ſeems to threaten the Ruin of our Trade, is the low Ebb of our Coin in Quantity and Quality. Wages is too much paid already in Goods, to the Sorrow of our Labourers, which in a little Time will be forced into a Practice, as in the Days of our Anceſtors; it is the Drift of too many deſigning Perſons in our Nation, to lull us aſleep in Security. We were lately told by a great Monarch in Trade, that our Nation was at preſent in a very thriving Condition; and ſubſtantially proved his Point by the Increaſe of our Coaches in the City of <hi>London.</hi> Our Government hath ſince turned that part of our Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour into our Support, which I think was but a golden Dream; and I can't but think it ſeaſonable to turn another part of the Profuſeneſs of our Nation into our Relief, which is our great Prodigality in Plate, in which you are ſerved in every Two-pot-houſe in the great City.</p>
            <p>This being the Ambitious Strain of our late Times, it now remains as a dead Stock upon too many Hands that wants Money to pay their Debts, and would be glad of an Opportunity to make themſelves eaſie in getting rid of it, which would be affected by an Expedient, in my Judgment, that would be a farther Service to us at this Time, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by leſſoning the Standard of our Coin one penny in a Shilling or more, and giving this Advantage in ready Money coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Perſons that brought ſuch a Weight of Silver to the Mint. Which would be Inducement enough to bring in a conſiderable Stock through the Nation, and be a good Cordial at this time to a Languiſhing Trade; to which being added a proportionable Advance to all our Mill'd Money that holds its full weight, it would be a double Advantage, as in the Increaſe, according to the Practice of <hi>France</hi>; ſo likewiſe in ſecuring it from being exported, the preſent Diſproportion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95289:10"/>
in the Weight of our current Coin ſeems greater than can in reaſon be allowed, and this Addition in a new Coin that could not be clipt, would be a Stock to carry on our Trade withall, whilſt the other in due time, might be new ſtampt.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Another Grievance in Trade, that hath very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd our Poor, hath been the Private Intereſt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Merchants, in making Stops in Trade to advance the Prices of their Goods at home and abroad, thereby to get thoſe they buy the Cheaper: This hath Inrich'd a few, and Impoveriſh'd multitudes.</p>
            <p>This being like <hi>Charibdis,</hi> ſo evident a Rock to all Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering People, that Impoveriſh'd our Poor, and to be avoided, was ſo cunningly managed by a deſigning Party in the Heat of our late Affairs, that it ſplit our Intereſt upon <hi>Scilla,</hi> a Rock that was much more Dangerous. So great a Difficulty is it, for a People that are inclined to be hot and Splenatick, to avoid one Extream, without falling into another: The firſt brought home the Riches to our own Nation, though in a great Inequality: The other, in not Supporting our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, hath centred the Riches of Trade in Forreign Nations, in a greater Impoveriſhing of our Poor; which in a ſhort time will make <hi>England</hi> like <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> I think all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ought to be inſpected, theſe Miſchiefs prevented, and Companies inlarged.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Another Oppreſſion upon our Poor, hath been the ſending out our Woollen Manufacture without being fully Manufactured: This hath very much affected our Diers, leſſened our Cuſtoms, and oppreſs'd our Sea-men, Die-ſtuff being a bulky Commodity. This hath been carried on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to many Acts of Parliament, and hath been chiefly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the drawing back of Cuſtoms in Logwood and other Die-ſtuff from our own Plantations, and the ſuffering it to be ingroſs'd in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to Die ſo much Cheaper than we.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The laſt Grievance in Trade that I ſhall mention, hath fallen upon our poor Sea-men, which is a Wound in our Vitals. This hath been lately conſidered and recommended
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95289:10"/>
by his Moſt Sacred Majeſty, as a great Encouragement to Trade, as indeed nothing can be more. This is no way to be effected, but by an Encouragement of their Imployment. By the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>Primo Eliz. Cap.</hi> 13. it was enacted, That whatſoever Merchant did Ship any Merchandiſe upon a Forreign Bottom, he ſhould pay Aliens Duties. This kept the Imployment in the Hands of Engliſh Sea-men. By the 25 <hi>Caroli</hi> II. Aliens Duties upon all our Manufactures were taken off, and hereby the Engliſh Merchant was loſt as well as the Engliſh Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This hath prevailed ſo far, that in a conſiderable Fleet that lately carried off our Woollen Manufactures to <hi>Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> conveyed by Engliſh Men of War, there was but two Engliſh Ships. And I doubt our Share in the Merchandiſe as light.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the many Stops in Trade, that hath been made ſince our Happy Revolution, and the Contrivance of thoſe within our own Bowels to Oppreſs our Poor: Firſt, In the Exportation of ſo great Quantities of our Wooll: Next, In tying up the Hands of ſo many of our own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that were willing to Trade to the <hi>Levant,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Conſumption of our Cloth, but it was by the Moths: Next, In binding up ſo great a part of the Clothiers Stocks in the common Seal of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Bonds that affected no particular Perſon: The vaſt quantities of our Teaſles, Fullers Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that hath been exported to <hi>Holland</hi>; and that violent Stop in Trade that was made at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in a little time after the Clothiers had ſold off almoſt all their Cloth. I can believe no leſs, than a Conſpiracy to incite our Poor to Levelling againſt their own Inclination, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity being a Hard Weapon: And that there hath been a Deſign againſt the Common Good of our Nation, as ſure as that of <hi>Cataline</hi> againſt the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi>: And I think our Affairs doth as much call for the well-digeſted Temper of publick-ſpirited <hi>Tully,</hi> as the Strain of thoſe days. <hi>Patere tua Conſilia non ſentis? Conſtrictam jam omnium horum conſcientia teneri conjurationem tuam non vides? Quid proxima? Quid ſuperiore nocte egeris ubi fueris: Quos Convocaveris, quid Conſilii ceperis: Quem noſtrum ignorare arbitraris. O Tempora! O Mores! Senatus hic intelligit, Conſul vidit: Hic tamen vivit. Vivit imo vero in Coenatum venit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95289:11"/>And thus I have given an Impartial Account of the Preſſures of our Poor, which can no way be redreſs'd, in my weak Opinion, but by a Select Committee of the moſt Able and Steady Members of our Great Council, to ſit <hi>de die in diem,</hi> and examine theſe Grievances, which I humbly ſubmit to Conſideration.</p>
