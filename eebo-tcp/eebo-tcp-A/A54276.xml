            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the <hi>KING,</hi> The Humble Addreſs of <hi>John Pennyman.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>The BLESSING and PEACE of GOD, Which paſſeth all Underſtanding, Be with the KING for evermore.</opener>
            <p>THE Way for the KING to obtain it, is, not only to watch againſt the Evil of His own Heart, but to be a <hi>Dread</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> to all Evil-doers with whom He is concern'd, both at Home and Abroad; and let the KING be ſo known to be a hater of all Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that no Debauched or Vile Perſon ſhall dare to ask any Place or Favour at his Hands; aſſuring themſelves, that none but Lovers of Sobriety, Vertue, and Goodneſs, ſhall be well accepted of Him: So ſhall the KING render to the moſt High GOD, according to the great Benefits He hath received, and the Nation ſhall have cauſe to Bleſs and Praiſe the LORD that ever He came to be KING over them.</p>
            <p>The Prayers of the Honeſt-hearted are truly for the KING, that a Good and Right Spirit may guide Him in all His Ways, that He may have Victory over all His Enemies both within and without, and that the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> may be given to Him; So ſhall Truth and Righteouſneſs flouriſh in his Days. And inaſmuch as the KING hath ſhewed Mercy to the worſt of his Enemies, (and not followed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mple of thoſe before Him, who with ſuch horrible Cruelty took away the Lives of ſo many Men, and alſo Women) therefore ſhall Mercy be ſhewed to Him for evermore.</p>
            <p>And as there was a Heart ſet to pray for His ſafe Return from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hither again; even ſo there is this <hi>Thanksgiving-Day,</hi> a rendring Praiſes to the LORD, for the KING'S great and wonderful Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from thence; believing that his outward Life, inward Vertue, and Zeal for Righteouſneſs, ſhall be the Means of theſe Nations Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, if they turn from the Evil of their Ways.</p>
            <p>Oh! that the KING and QUEEN would ſet their Hearts, both by Words and Example, to bring down the Pride of this People; it abounds to the Grief of the Sober-minded, and will bring Deſtruction, if not prevented by Repentance and Amendment: Therefore in all humility, my humble Requeſt to the KING and QUEEN, is, That Vertue, where-ever it is ſeen, may be incouraged; and all Vice diſliked and detected: So ſhall They be truly Honourable, and proſper in all Their Undertakings. Which is earneſtly deſired by one that is a true Lover of Them, and of all that ſeek the Advancement of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which never fades away.</p>
