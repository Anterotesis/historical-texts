            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lord DVKE in his Voyage.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vne the 24. 1627. being Sunday after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Seruice and Sermon, the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
tooke his Barge, and enioyned all the
Officers and Commanders to attend him
to the Fleet, lying then at Anchor in <hi>Stokes</hi>
Bay, which hee weighed the ſame day, and
fell downe towards Saint <hi>Hellnes</hi> poynt,
where hee caſt Anchor againe, and ſtayed there for want of
winde till the 27. of Iune. The ſame night hearing there
were ſome Commaunders behinde in the Towne, who kept
diſorder; he went a ſhore himſelfe, and ſearcht all the houſes
in the Towne, where he found ſome Captaines that had been
diſorderly: Amongſt the reſt there was one that gaue an
vnmannerly anſwere, who was caſheered for his labour.</p>
            <p>That night the Lord Generall lay a ſhore: the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
betimes he went a board. On Wedneſday the 27. wee
weighed Anchor with 100. ſayle of Ships, and tackt to and
againe vntill wee recouered the Poynt Eaſt of the Ile of
<hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thurſday the 28. wee ſtoode on our courſe towards the
Weſt, vntill we were come to the height of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> about
eight of the clock at night: wee ſtoode Weſt, and Eaſt, and
by South. And on Friday the 29. wee ſayled with a ſlacke
winde; but before night wee got ſight of land on our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
ſeeming to be 12. leagues off, a part of <hi>France,</hi> called
the <hi>Vſhant,</hi> in 47. degrees or there-abouts. Wee ſtoode on
to Sea that night, with a freſh gayle of winde, which ſerued
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11837:3"/>
vs vntill the next morning at two of the clocke, and then wee
were becalmde till Monday the firſt of Iuly, at foure of the
clocke. At which time we ſent a Boy to the top of the mayne
Maſt, to ſee what he could diſcouer, he ſpied on the head of vs
14. ſayle of Shipps ſome foure leagues off, and very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
within a quarter of an houre after there aroſe a good
gayle of winde fully with vs, ſo that the Admirall and all the
reſt made haſt to hoyſt vp ſayle and chaſe theſe Ships. Before
nine of the clocke at night a Catch of his Maieſties ouertook
them, which was commanded by Captaine <hi>Dunning,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to them and asked what they were, they tolde him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
tale: he deſired then to winde about, and come aboard
and ſpeake with our Admirall. They bid him goe before to
their Admirall, and what he did they would follow: he came
to their Admirall and deſired him to winde about and ſpeake
with our Admirall. Their Admirall asked <hi>Dunning</hi> what
Fleete it was, he tolde him it was the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Fleet,
hee asked what they were doing there: hee tolde them they
were Tacking to and againe to ſcoure the Seas. No (ſaith he)
I know you are going to <hi>Burdeanx,</hi> but there you will finde
them prepared for you, and they will giue you hot ſeruice.
Hee asked who was our Admirall, hee tolde them my Lord
Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Whereupon hee fell in rayling, and
called vs all Ro<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gues and Raſcalls, and commanded the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to ſhoote; he ſhot halfe a dozen ſhot at him, and ſhor him
twice though the ſayle, hard by the middle of the mayne
Maſt: ſo that <hi>Dunning</hi> fell a ſterne of him, and tackt about
to vs, and tolde vs what had paſt, and that he conceiued them
to be <hi>Dunkerks</hi> men of Warre, very well appointed, which
did much comfort our Generall, and all the reſt. We chaſed
them all night: and on Tueſday the 20. of Iuly at light day,
wee had got neere vnto them with ſome of our Shipps. The
<hi>Lyon</hi> had got the Winde-ward of them. Three of the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and the <hi>Maria,</hi> with the <hi>Catch,</hi> was got almoſt within
ſho<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of them; but in this time they were throwing out their
Balleſt, and making themſelues light: and when they had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11837:3"/>
done that, they hoyſed vp ſtudding Sailes, and after outſailed
vs quite; We followed them ſo farre, as there was no hopes,
and then wound about to our intended courſe: At foure of
the clocke the ſame day, my Lord cauſed to ſend vppe the
maine Maſt, to tell how manie Shippes we were in company,
and we found we were then no more then three ſcore; for we
had loſt in that Chaſe my Lord <hi>Haruey,</hi> with fortie ſaile of
Shippes, who met not with vs till wedneſday the 11. of Iuly.</p>
            <p>We were kept from the place where we intended (with
contrarie windes and calmes) till teweſday the 10. of Iuly;
About two of the clocke, then fell a violent ſtorme, with a
thicke miſt, ſo that we were put into great danger.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Noneſuch</hi> in this ſtorme had ſpent her Fore-maſt, and
many of the other Shippes loſt their Long-boates, being ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Sterne. About eight of the clock the ſtorme broke
vp, and it grew to bee cleare; Then we diſcerned the Iſle
of <hi>Ree</hi> to be within three leagues of vs, whither we ſteered
our courſe; And about ten of the clocke caſt anchor ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Saint <hi>Martines,</hi> the prime Towne in that Iſland. The
Next morning being wedneſday, we weyed anchor, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe lower to a point of the Iſland next to the maine-Land
and ouer againſt <hi>Rochell.</hi> There we caſt anchor, and
placed our Shippes round about the Iſland, that the Enemie
might neither export nor import any thing for their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>That done, being the 11. of Iuly, we had very good ſport
in chaſing thoſe Barques and Hoyes which were offering to
goe from the Iſland to the maine-Land, and from the maine-Land
to the Iſland: We tooke many of them, and there were
none that got eyther in or out. About ſixe of the clocke that
day, my Lord <hi>Haruey</hi> appeares with his fortie ſaile of Ships,
which was vnto vs a great comfort: About eight of the
clocke the ſame day, the Lord Generall called a Cou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cell, and
reſolued to land our Men the next morning, vpon that point
which lay iuſt to vs, as being the moſt ſafe place; At which
time he gaue order to ſome Shippes to batter a Fort, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11837:4"/>
lay a league off on the right hand, &amp; continued the battering
till ten of the clocke the next day; then we found there was
no reſiſtance in the Fort, whereupon, the Lord Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to giue ouer.</p>
            <p>On teweſday the 12. the L. Generall was vp and readie
by three of te clocke in the morning, and receiued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that morning at fiue of the clocke, and after tooke
his Barge and went aboard the <hi>Nonſuch</hi> to Monſiure <hi>Subeeſa,</hi>
and returned from thence at ſixe: At ſeuen of the clocke,
Monſiure <hi>Sabueſa,</hi> Monſiure <hi>Blancarte</hi> and Sir <hi>William Becher</hi>
went to <hi>Rochell:</hi> At eight of the clocke, the L. Generall ſent
Maſter <hi>Grymes</hi> (the Gentleman of his Horſe) with a Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy
of his that could both runne and ſwimme well, and ſixe
Muskatieres (to the point of the Iſland, where they were to
land their Men) to ſee if they could diſcouer any Men or
Ordnance, that they had planted there to encounter vs:
When he came to the ſhoare, he cauſed the Foote-boy to
ſtrippe himſelfe, and to run along, and he run three quarters
of a mile into the Countrey, and found all that Coaſt cleere,
ſauing three Horſe-men, that the Enemies had ſet out to be
Scoutes, which chaſed him back to the Sea ſide; The Boy
was releiued by the Ship Ordnance and the Muskets in the
Boate: At ten of the clocke, he turned back to the <hi>Triumph,</hi>
and gaue the L. Generall an accompt what he had diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
Whereupon, the L. Generall gaue preſent order for all
Officers to be in a readineſſe, and to meete him aboard the
Kings good Shippe (called the <hi>Lyon)</hi> lying next the Pointe,
where they were to land their Men, for there he would keepe
his Randeuous for that time: At twelue of the clocke, he
tooke his Barge, accompanied with Sir <hi>George Blundell</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
Maior, attended by M. <hi>Grymes</hi> and M. <hi>Aſhburneham,</hi>
and went to all thoſe Ships that had Land Soldiers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them that they ſhould preſently draw themſelues as
neere that point of the Iſland as they could; After that, he
went to all the Ships, and appointed the Captaines of them,
how and where to attend with their Shippes, and commanded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11837:4"/>
them preſently to prouide their Barges and long Boates, to
land their Land Souldiers, and to ſend them to the Lyon.
Hee then made choyſe of tenne Ships of leſſer burthen, and
directed them to draw their Shipps as cloſe as they could to
either ſide of the point of the Iſland, where the Souldiers
were to be Landed, and commanded them that if the Enemie
did appeare within ſhotte, they ſhould preſently play vpon
them.</p>
            <p>He being aboard at the ſame time of one of theſe Shippes,
went vp to the top of the mayne Maſt, and diſcouered of the
Enemies three Troupes of Horſe, and 16. or 18. hundred
Foote, all ready in Battalia ſome Engliſh mile or more off
the place, where wee were to land our men: hee came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
downe and tolde vs what hee had diſcouered, and ſhot
at them himſelfe two or three Peeces of Ordnance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the reſt of the Peeces to play vpon them ſtill: with
that tooke Barge and went to the Lyon, where hee found
all the Officers ready with their long Boates to land their
men.</p>
            <p>In this time came backe from <hi>Rochell</hi> Monſieur <hi>Sabueſa,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> who ſtayed there till Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Monſieur Saint <hi>Blancart</hi> diſſwaded the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to forbeare the Landing of his men vntill the next
morning: but the Lord Generall fearing it would giue time
to the Enemie to ſtrengthen himſelfe. Hee would by no
meanes heare of any delay. Whereupon Monſieur Saint
<hi>Blancart</hi> like a braue man, chooſed himſelfe a Pike, and put
himſelfe into Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes</hi> Regiment.</p>
            <p>By this time it was three of the clocke when the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
commanded to land two Regiments, that were of the
olde Companies, where of Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes</hi> and Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Brett</hi> were Commanders, he went with them himſelfe
on ſhore, and appointed the two Colonels in what place they
ſhould land their men. And being landed, commanded them
to put their men in Battalia with all ſpeed, fearing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
vvould giue them a ſuddaine aſſault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:11837:5"/>
The men being vveary in lying on Shipboard, lingred
vvaſhing their hands in the Sea; but the Lord Generall vvith
a Cudgell runne to and fro amongſt them, beating ſome, and
threatning other-ſome, and got them thruſt vp three Pykes
length to the skirt of the banke, vvhere they vvere to be.</p>
            <p>There vvas a third Regiment that vvas ready to land: in
the meane time came Sir <hi>William Courtney</hi> to the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and tolde him, that vnleſſe hee ſhould doe the ſame
curteſie for him vvhich he did for the other two Collonells,
hee ſhould not get his men landed, and that his vvere olde
Souldiers, and vvould doe good ſeruice if the Enemie made
aſſault.</p>
            <p>Whereupon my Lord called Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> &amp; vvent
into his Barge, vvith an intention to haſten a ſhore his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and as ſoone as he had gone about foureſcore from
the ſhore, hee preſently heard the fight begun, and turning
backe, he ſaw three Troupes of French Horſe, charging our
Foote vvith all the fierceneſſe that migh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be: And the third
Regiment, thoſe that vvere vnlanded, preſsing themſelues
amongſt the Shippes to ſuccour themſelues: the reſt of that
Regiment that vvere landed hee ſawe preſt into the vvater
by the French Horſe; and Sir <hi>William Haydon</hi> being caried
violently to the Sea by the Reuolters, was there drowned.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he ſet S. <hi>William Courtney</hi> into another Boate,
with commande to make all expedition to get his Men lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
And very brauely himſelfe drew his Sword and turned
his Barge (attended by Maſter <hi>Grymes</hi> and M. <hi>Aſhburneham)</hi>
and thruſt himſelfe vpon the Reuolters; and rebuking ſome,
and encouraging others, told them, he hoped they came not
with any intent but to aduenture themſelues ſo farre as he
would leade them: Wherevpon, he thruſt himſelfe on to the
ſhoare, (and they followed ſlowly) and animating of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Foote which were run into the water, they moſt of them
leapt out of the water, and vpon the Lord Generalls words
threw themſelues forwards as if they would haue fought
brauely, but before we could get where the blowes were, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11837:5"/>
Battaile was ended.</p>
            <p>My Lord Generall had ordered certaine Shippes to ſcoure
the Landing place with their Ordnance, but the aſſault was
ſo ſodaine as they did little hurt to the Enemie; and in verie
heate of the combate, it fell out, that one of our owne Shipps
had entangled himſelfe betweene our Battering ſhippes and
the Land, by which meanes they were hindred in performing
of their charge.</p>
            <p>If the French Foote had come on to haue charged preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vppon the diſcharge of the Horſe, it had been impoſſible
that we could haue withſtood them; But as God would haue
it, the Horſe-men made more haſt then in iudgement they
ſhould haue don: Before the Foote came we had killed moſt
of their Horſes; But when the Foote did come, they came
very orderly and brauely, being 1500. comming within a
Pike and a halfe of our Men before they diſcharged; and the
Leader of the Foote (being a braue and goodlie Gentleman)
tooke off his hatte, wherevpon all their Foote diſcharged
their Muskets, and after they fell to it with Swords and puſh
of Pike, vntill they were breathleſſe on both ſides: The
French finding our Pikes to be longer then theirs, threw away
their Pikes, and went to it with Stones, and ſo did our Men,
but ours beate them out, and made them flye away very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
that happie was he that got firſt off his Armor to
betake him to his heeles.</p>
            <p>This Battaile did not continue in all much aboue halfe an
hower, but our Horſe were not yet landed; But if we had had
twentie Horſe to haue followed them, we had killed them vp
euery Man. That night we intrenched our ſelues in that
place, fearing the Enemie would giue vs an aſſault in the
night. My Lord Generall ſpent that euening in viewing of
the dead Bodies, and viſiting thoſe that were hurt on our
ſide, and giuing great charge to the Chirurgions to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
care of them.</p>
            <p>We tooke fower of the French Gentlemen, but they were
all hurt before; two of them dyed the next day, one of them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11837:6"/>
is aliue yet in the <hi>Tryumph,</hi> his thigh being ſhotte to peeces,
the other, being a Page, the Lord Generall ſent him to his
Maſter.</p>
            <p>The next morning very earlie, the Lord Generall came on
ſhore againe, and ſpent all the whole daie there, calling the
Commanders to him, and ordering them to bring him notes
of euery ſeuerall Companie, how many they were, and how
manie were periſhed in the conflict; By which vve found,
there was nineteene Captaines, Antients and Lieuetenants
killed, and twelue other Officers hurt, but in no danger of
death, and ſome thirty fiue common Soldiers drowned, but
none killed; for the French men diſcharged all on our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and neuer looked at the Common ſort. Our Gentry
(when the common Soldiers began to route) clapt themſelues
together, and ſhewed themſelues the braueſt Men in the
world, eſpetially Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Brett,</hi>
Sir <hi>George Blundell,</hi> and a Brother of Sir <hi>Alexander Bretts:</hi>
There was not one Gentleman of our Nation in the field that
did not act his part brauely.</p>
            <p>This being Friday, the day after the Battaile, the 13. of
Iuly, Monſieur <hi>de Thorax,</hi> Gouernour of the Iſland, ſent
the Barron <hi>Ambleuile</hi> with a Trumpet to ſpeake with the
Lord Geuerall: His Meſſage was, to deſire my Lords fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to giue them leaue to fetch away their dead bodies:
they being ſo ſuddenly demaunded by them, my Lord made
ſcruple in granting it. Whereupon the Gentry made meanes
by ſome of our Officers to buy the bodies, and offered for
one 1000. pounds. When my Lord Generall had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he gaue leaue that they ſhould take them away.</p>
            <p>Within foure houres the Gouernours ſent another Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
with one of his Pages, to giue him thankes for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and to report to him that he would neuer after harbour
an ill thought of the Engliſh, for hee iudged the Gentry of
them to be the braueſt men in the world. Although before
the Battaile he made no more account of vs then if wee had
beene all Beeues: and enquiring what number we were, wee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11837:6"/>
tolde him 6000. He ſaid he would kill vs and ſalt vs, as wee
did Oxen in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time he ſent my Lord Generall word, that he
would wayte on him himſelfe, ſo that we made full account
that hee would giue vs Battell. The ſame day wee put our
ſelues in Battalia, and expected them all that day, yet hee
came not. The next day being the 14. of Iuly, we made our
ſelues ready to Martch, and at 6. of the clocke we marched
an Engliſh mile further into the Countrey, leauing Sir <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine
Bartue</hi> in the place with ſome Companies.</p>
            <p>The 15. by 6. of the clocke in the morning, vve marched
on to a village vvithin an Engliſh mile, and tooke in that
vvithout any diſturbance. Then vve marched on two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
miles further, to a Towne called St. <hi>Maries,</hi> vvhen vvee
came neere to the Towne, the Proteſtants came out and
yeelded the Towne to the Lord Generall, ſo hee went with
ſome Gentlemen with him, and tooke poſſeſsion, and made
the Souldiers martch by, and not ſuffer them to come to the
Towne, fearing they vvould pillage and diſturbe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
ſo vve marched on the ſame day, to a Towne called <hi>La
Flote.</hi> In the mid vvay the Enemie appeared vvith 120. horſe
and 1500. Foote, the which were left vnkilled. Wee did
verily thinke they would haue giuen vs Battell, but it did not
proue ſo: for as ſoone as they viewed vs, they returned
backe againe.</p>
            <p>We vvere ready for them, for our men vvere very forward
to fight, ſo vve marched on vvithin halfe a mile of <hi>La Flote</hi>
vvhere the Proteſtants of that Towne met vs, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Towne and themſelues vvith a ſuite they had to the
Lord Generall, vvhich vvas that hee vvould for their ſakes
ſhew fauour to the Romiſh Catholiques: for that they had
liued long together in that Towne, and euer receiued good
Quarter and vſage from them: And that now ſeeing he vvas
become Maſter of both, he vvould requite it on their behalfe
to the Catholiques, vvhich hee very Nobly conſented vnto,
and vvent vvith them to the Towne, and tooke poſſeſsion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11837:7"/>
and preſently turned backe to the Souldiers, and Encamped
them round about the ſame, and vvould not ſuffer any of
them to goe into it, fearing they vvould make Pillage, and
that night lay amongſt them in the open Field, vvith no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bedding, ſaue one Cloake vnder his head, and another
vpon him.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 16 he went into the Towne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Monſieur <hi>Subeſa,</hi> and ſome other Lords, to
bury Sir <hi>William Heydon,</hi> and returned into the Field at
night, and lay as he did before. But that night about two of
the clocke, there fell very miſerable vveather, vvith Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and Rayning, and continued ſo till twelue of the clock
the next day.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the 17. vve martched on towards St.
<hi>Martyns,</hi> though it Rayned very fearefully: and about 12.
of the clocke it grew faire; at which time vve vvere vvithin
three Engliſh miles of the Towne.</p>
            <p>By that time we had marched a mile further, we could ſee
the Enemie ſally out of the Fort vvith Horſe and Foote: ſo
they Martched towards vs, and vvere vvithin the diſtance
of an Engliſh mile: and wee thought they vvould take the
aduantage of our weary Martching, and giue vs Battell.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was holden fit by the Lord Generall, that we
ſhould take all aduantage we could in that place, which was
onely to gaine the Sunne and the Winde of them. We mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
on toward the end of the Towne, that lay next vnto the
Sea ſide, and furtheſt from the Fort. And by that wee had
aduantage both of Sunne and Winde. Within leſſe then an
Eugliſh mile of the end of the Towne, we could ſee the Horſe
approach very fiercely, as though they would come ſuddenly
vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Lord Generall gaue order to the Maſter
of the Ordnance, to ſhoote ſome of our Drakes at them;
which he did, and killed a Gentleman and two Horſes, and
put all the reſt in feare and diſorder.</p>
            <p>Here Captaine <hi>Coningham</hi> (Lieuteuant of the Horſe) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11837:7"/>
himſelfe on horſebacke, and proffered a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
but no Man anſwered him. Whereupon they preſently
put out a Flagge of Truce, and ſent ſome of the Proteſtantes
to vs to render the Towne, without any condition; So that
we preſently marched into it in Battalia, and quartered all
our Soldiers therein. The Lord Generall rode to euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and deſired them to be carefull of themſelues and not
to wrong the Towne, and that they ſhould take nothing but
what was giuen them and what they payde for, and that he
would goe aboard the victualing Shippes, and told them they
ſhould want nothing, which contented them verie well, and
thanked God with a loude voyce that they had ſuch a worthy
Lord Generall.</p>
            <p>He tooke his Barge, and accordingly went, and as he was
going, there was a poore Engliſhman in diſtreſſe in a Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
where the Tyde had locked him about, and had no
meanes to ſaue himſelfe, but muſt runne towards the Fort,
where the Enemie was retired with all his Forces: My Lord
hearing him ſo cry out, cauſed to ſtay his Barge (although
the Barge-men told him he would endanger the caſting away
of himſelfe; and the Gentlemen perſwaded him alſo, that he
ſhould not hazard himſelfe in the danger, yet would he not
ſtirre before he had releeued this Man and got him into his
Barge; So after went aboard of the Victualing Shippes, and
ſaw all the proportions of the Victuals ſent to the Soldiers;
and after went aboard the <hi>Tryumph.</hi> And on wedneſday the
16. made a diſpatch for <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint the King with
his fortunate proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Enemy was retired into the Fort a Musket ſhot, with
1500. Men, of which number, there was 120. Horſe left;
they had neyther Water nor Wood in their Fort, and had
but ſome eight or nine Peeces of Ordnance, and the Fort too
little for ſo great a Company, ſo that it was not likely that
they could hold it long, and we hope to be Maſters of it, as
well as of the Iſland, within a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Thurſeday and Fryday, we were rayſing a Mount to plant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11837:8"/>
our Ordnance againſt it.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 21. we planted twentie one peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and eleuen Drakes, and the Maſter Gunner was very
confident to batter them from the Fort in a very ſhort time:
We were working with our Pyoniers, and our Soldiers tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
againſt the Fort.</p>
            <p>This is all I was an Eye witneſſe to. So God ſend them
good ſucceſſe, and I for <hi>England,</hi> in his Maieſties Good Ship,
called the <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was ſlayne that day in (the Battaile) of the <hi>French</hi>
125. Horſemen, dead on the ground, beſides a great many
that were deadly hurt, of vvhich number, there vvere 23.
Marqueſſes and Barons; all the reſt Knightes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
