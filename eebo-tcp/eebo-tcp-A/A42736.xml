            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Light held out in these
Papers is accounted so clear
and so useful, that it hath been thought
great Pity it hath not been set up
upon a Candlestick. They have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up and down in Manuscript about
Thirty Years, being much valued by
those who were Possessors of them.
It is Credibly reported that a very
great and Learned Man (whom for
some Reasons I will not name, though
his Commendation would have great
weight with Persons of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions)
did upon the perusal of
them, speak to the Learned Author
to this purpose, <hi>That it was worth
a Mans Living a great while,
<pb facs="tcp:40513:3"/>
though he did nothing else but
bring forth such a Composure.</hi>
The Subjects Treated on are so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and of such concernment, that any
contribution of Light therein ought
to find Acceptance, and be rejoyced
in by all. The manner of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Treating on them is succinct
and plain, and wholly unoffensive.
The Differences and Contests about
these Points, which have of late ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
among us, do further recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them and the Publishing of
them as very seasonable at this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
The Blessing of God go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them. So prayeth</p>

<hi>preventing</hi> their Legal Guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Formal Pardon</hi> takes off Legal
Guilt, where once it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virtual Pardon</hi> keeps it off, where
else it would be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Formal Pardon</hi> takes away all the
Actual Legal Guilt, contracted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40513:6"/>
the Person from all Sin, whether
inherent in, or committed by him,
before his Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virtual Pardon,</hi> all capacity from
the Person upon his Faith, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of having in his Nature, or
committing in his Actions, any more
Sin (for then could there be no room
for so much as Virtual Pardon), but
of contracting any more such Legal
Guilt from any Sin, whether inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in his Nature, or committed
by him in his Actions, for time to
come.</p>
               <p>And in this very Point, lying the
main stress of the Controversie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
briefly (which will much help
to clear it) that (not the Nature,
not the Actions, but) the Person
(according indeed both to his Nature
and Actions) is the proper Subject
of all Law-Obligation, whether of
the Precept to Obedience, or Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to Punishment for Disobedience;
and therefore must be the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
also of all Law-Disobligation, or
Dissolution of Law-Obligation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for one End, or another. Since
then a Person, while out of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40513:7"/>
is the unhappy Subject of the most
severe and rigorous Obligation, as of
the Precept of the Law to Obedience
for his Justification, so of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Law to Condemnation,
and all Legal Punishment for his
Disobedience; Accordingly must a
Person, when in <hi>Christ,</hi> be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Subject of the most gracious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the severe and rigorous
Obligation, as of the same Precept
of the Law to Obedience (not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but) as to Justification; so also
of the same Threatning of the Law
(not indeed simply, but) as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
or any Legal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his Disobedience. And as
from this dissolution of the Legal
Obligation of the Threatning, is the
Actual, Formal Pardon or dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Legal Obligation of such a
Persons Sins past (for Sin cannot be
formally <hi>Remitted,</hi> before it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<hi>Committed</hi>) so from hence must
(and cannot, but) be also the Actual
Virtual Pardon, or Dissolution of the
Legal Guilt or Obligation of such a
Persons Sins to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40513:7"/>
Yet as the Precept in the hand of
<hi>Christ</hi> still binds to Obedience upon
Gospel-Grounds, and to Gospel-Ends
and Purposes (though not for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication)
so the Threatning in the
hand of <hi>Christ,</hi> still binds (though
not to Condemnation or any Legal
Punishment, yet) upon Gospel-Grounds,
and for Gospel-Ends and
Purposes, to Gospel-Chastisements
for Disobedience in Sins to come:
Which Sins, when they come, as
they derive a new Gospel Guilt
(though no new Legal Guilt) upon
the Person; so they need a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Pardon
(though no new Legal-Pardon,
nor indeed are capable of it)
therefore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Gospel-Pardon</hi> of Gospel-Guilt,
is the dissolution of Gospel-Obligation
to Gospel-Chastisement
for Gospel-Sin. For as there is Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
or Gospel-Obedience, according
to Legal or Gospel-Precepts; so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such Precepts is there Legal
or Gospel-Sin. The Nature of this
Gospel-Pardon will the better appear,
in the manifold Differences of it from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40513:8"/>
Legal Pardon. Such as these that
follow.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Gospel-Pardon</hi> is an Act of meer
Mercy of God as a Father, only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Intercession of <hi>Christ,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
therein his Merit with the
Father, for dealing with his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in this regard also as Children;
Gospel-Guilt needing not for its
Gospel-Pardon, any Legal Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Legal-Pardon</hi> is a Sentence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
from God as a Judge, both
from his Justice and Mercy, upon
both the Merit and Satisfaction of
<hi>Christ,</hi> improved upon his Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for condemned Prisoners of Law,
but Elect Prisoners, to be so made
his Members and his Fathers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Gospel-Guilt</hi> is sometimes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pardoned, sometimes but in part,
partly remitted, partly retained.
Such was <hi>David</hi>'s guilt of Adultery
and Murder, and such its Pardon;
partly remitted, the Lord put away
his Sin (the Gospel-Guilt of his Sin)
so that he dyed not in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40513:8"/>
And partly retained, so that he
was Chastened for it, in the Death
of his Adulterous Issue, 2 <hi>Sam. 12.</hi>
as well as otherwise by his Son <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
there also Threatned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Legal Guilt</hi> is alway either wholly
Pardon'd, or wholly Unpardon'd;
either all remitted, or not at all:
That having place here, <hi>Nil solvitur
nisi totum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Gospel Guilt</hi> may be remitted,
as contracted, successively and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Legal Guilt,</hi> however contracted,
is remitted all together, at once, and
but once.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Gospel Guilt,</hi> when, and so far
as Pardon'd, is alway Pardon'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and in it self; first by Gospel-Transgression
redounding upon, and
then by Gospel-Grace removed off
from the Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Legal Guilt</hi> is Pardon'd, partly
<hi>Formally,</hi> and in it self; as in all Sins
foregoing Justification; partly <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi>
and in the Person; as in all
Sins following Justification. In those,
their Legal Guilt so <hi>removed</hi> from,
as if it never had redounded upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40513:9"/>
the Person: In these their Legal
Guilt so <hi>removed</hi> from the Person, as
it never can redound upon it: The
Person being now a priviledg'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and no more
Chargeable with Legal Guilt, than
<hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Personal Vnion</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi>
everlastingly prevents the resulting
of its proper personality out of his
Humane Nature so united, which
out of all other Natures not so united,
immediately results; So <hi>Mystical V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with <hi>Christ</hi> everlastingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the redounding of Legal Guilt
upon the person so united, from his
sinful Nature and Actions; which
from all other such Natures and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of persons not so united, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
redounds.</p>
               <p>5. Faith is the only Instrumental
Means, or Causal Condition of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Pardon: Repentance (Godly
Sorrow for Sin, and Amendment of
of Life) the Consequents of this
Pardon, as the effect of that Faith.</p>
               <p>Repentance (Gospel-Sorrow for
Sin, and Return to Child-like Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience)
as well as Faith, the Means
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40513:9"/>
of Gospel-Pardon, or Dissolution of
the Obligation of Gospel-Threatning
for Gospel-Sin, to Gospel-Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Fatherly Chastisement:
Or (in yet plainer <hi>English</hi>) of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chastisements of God (which
are often very severe upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
the main work and Business
of Gospel-Chastisement, being so
done to the Hand of God; which is,
by execution of Gospel-Chastisement
upon them to reduce his Children
into that Gospel-Aw and Order,
wherein by the Gospel-Threatnings
of them only, they would not be
kept: And which Gospel-Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
He hath always in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by Him, in that Variety, and
with that Severity, that Legal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
would be altogether as
improper and useless to his mixt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Mercy as a Father, towards
the compassing of his Gospel-Designs
and Purposes upon his Children, as
Gospel-Chastisements would be to
his simple Justice as a Judge, towards
the Attainment of his Legal Aimes
and Ends upon his Enemies. Nor
are those Gospel-Chastisements used
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40513:10"/>
by Him towards his Children, but
when there is, nor further than there
is need (1 <hi>Pet. 1. 6.</hi>) for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of some such good, as in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of his Providence could
not otherwise be brought about.</p>
               <p>Some other Differences might be
offer'd, but these being the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
will afford a sufficiently large
Prospect into both the Necessity and
Nature of these two so different kinds
of Pardon.</p>

there can be to their Persons

of the <hi>Minor.</hi> Where by the first

never after, either in whole or in

no new Application of it. But, <hi>&amp;c.
Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In whose Natures, Sin can never

<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Minor</hi> is
clear from the Apostles Assertion,
<hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin shall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over you.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> also
clear from the Reason of that his
Assertion there rendred, <hi>For you are
not under the Law, i. e.</hi> the Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
unallay'd Threatening of the
Law, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not under Legal Guilt:
But <hi>under Grace, i. e.</hi> Gospel-Grace
allaying the Legal into a Gospel-Threatning;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> under only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Guilt
of Sin. And this, if need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40513:15"/>
may be thus further clear'd. The
Unsubdu'd Power of Sin in Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
is a Legal Punishment: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
the Guilt binding over to it, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Guilt. The Subdued Power of
Sin in Believers, only a Gospel-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Guilt binding
over to it only Gospel-Guilt. (Both
these <hi>Enthymems</hi> proceed upon the
Reason of the 14th. Argument).
And yet further thus; As the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
Power of Sin in Believers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
under the Notion of <hi>Malum
Paenae,</hi> is only a Gospel-Chastisement,
to which therefore only Gospel-Guilt
obligeth; So consider'd under
the Notion of <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> it is
only Gospel-Sin, Deriving therefore
only Gospel-Guilt, binding over only
to Gospel-Punishment.</p>

all Law-Curse for all their Sins, even
Sins to come, as well as present and

Reason of the <hi>Major:</hi> Because the

               <p>Those who cannot be Condemned

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40513:17"/>

something might be Legally

be understood <hi>consequenter</hi> (as they
call it) of Elect Believing Ones.</p>
               <p>The main strength of all (that

               <p>All Obligation to Punishment, is
from the Threatning (as all to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

suffer'd to procure this Pardon for
them, which will make his whole
Law a Law of Love to them, and
their Observance of it, sweet and
easie for them. And if the Woman
in the Gospel, <hi>Luke 7. 47</hi> loved <hi>Christ</hi>
the more, the more Sins he forgave
her; the Virtual Pardon of Believers
Sins to come, being more, than the
Formal Pardon only of Sins past, will
make them Love more, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Sin less, and obey more.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Child-like Fear of Fatherly
Chastisements,</hi> will impress and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
more effectual Dread of Sin,
upon the Hearts of Believers, than
Slavish Fear of Judiciary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
will do upon the Minds of
Unbelievers: Whereof much might
be said here, if enough had not been
said before.</p>
