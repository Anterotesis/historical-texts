            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest of men, having tyred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in seeking to obtaine happinesse by the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of learning, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:40259:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and at last, finding that hee that encreaseth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, encreaseth sorrow, hee turnes himselfe another way, and seeing the knowledge of the creatures could doe him no good, he thought to try what delight the use of them could bring unto him; in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance whereof, hee gave not himselfe over to brutish, and unmanly pleasures, but to the free use of such creatures, as the Lord hath bestowed upon the sonnes of men, for their refreshing and delight: a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongst which hee reckons up gardens and Orchards stored with all sorts of fruits, and flowers: these hee might have enjoyed with much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and comfort, if hee had
<pb facs="tcp:40259:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
used them aright, but seeking for happinesse in them, no such honey could be sucked out of the daintiest of those flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; no such wine out of the fruitfullest of those grapes: and therefore hee concludes, looking upon all the workes which his hands had wrought, that all was vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirit. <hi>Eccles. 2.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the Lord afforded unto him such choise delights: so he hath bestowed upon your Ladiship a confluence of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward felicities; and amongst them Gardens (if I may guesse) not farre inferiour to <hi>Solomons:</hi> and those beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and inameld with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the choisest flowers, whose lively verdures, and
<pb facs="tcp:40259:4"/>
fragrant smels (if I mistake not) your Ladiship is much pleased with: yet herein I presume in a much different way from <hi>Solomons,</hi> as not seeking happinesse in them; but rather desiring by those objects to raise up your soule to such contemplations, as may truly further your eternall happinesse: and if your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship shall find such heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly odours in those flowers, whose purest matter is the earth: and whose freshest beauty is so fading: what will you doe in a <hi>Nose-gay</hi> of flowers, whose matter is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and whose smell, and beauty will never decay: Such anone I doe here humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto your Ladiship: you
<pb facs="tcp:40259:4"/>
may use it summer and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without feare of withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; yea, herein are flowers both for food and physick: for meats, and medecine. Length of time will no whit impaire, either the beauty or Vertue of them, and therefore they doe most transcendently excell all earthly flowers whatsoever: Indeed I must ingenuously confesse, that few of them grew upon mine owne soyle; yet before I could bind them together in this handfull, my labour was not small in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through so many Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, out of which I have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them: neither as I hope will it be offensive, or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the worthy Planters, and Owners of them (some of
<pb facs="tcp:40259:5"/>
which are with God, others now living) that I thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse them abroad, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves having first made them common: If your Ladiship please to vouchsafe your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance of them, I doubt not but they will take the better with others; and if God may receive the glory, and his People benefit by these my labours, I shall have mine end, whose ambition it is to to be esteemed.</p>

            <p n="4">4 Lust as its like fire in multiplying, so 'its like hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire in abiding, it needs not to be preserved by a supply of outward materials to foment, and cherish it, but it supports it selfe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As the water when 'its stopt in 'its principall course, yet one where or other (where it best may) it will find a vent: even so Lust in the heart, when the mind and faculties, and body, and members, are quite tyred out in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall service, will make a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40259:11"/>
shift to breake forth into some easier vent.</p>
            <p n="6">6 A mans actuall sinnes are personal, and therefore intransient, they begin and end in himselfe: but origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne is naturall, and therefore with the nature it passeth over from a man to his posterity, being an entaile that can never bee cut off.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Originall sinne is left whole to every child of <hi>Adam:</hi> all have it, and yet every one hath it all too.</p>

God by it, he accounts the greatest evill in sinne, as God himselfe doth.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Though our sinnes be exceeding great, yet we must labour to see an Al-sufficiency in God, a large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his mercy, which is able to swallow them up.</p>
            <p n="10">10 A pure heart casts out sinne, as pure liquor doth scum.</p>
            <p n="11">11 As when oyle and water are mixed together, the oyle will worke it selfe out, and purifie it selfe: so a regenerate man, though he sinne, hee doth not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with sinne, but hee workes it out by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
