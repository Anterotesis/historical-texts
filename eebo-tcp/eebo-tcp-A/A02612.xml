            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the opinion of <hi>Licurgus</hi> that wiſe Law-giuer of the <hi>Lecedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that there was no better way to keepe men in good order, then to vſe partly threats, and partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; partly rewards, and partly puniſhments: and in a well-gouerned Common-wealth he thought the one as needfull as the other. GOD Almightie, that great and wiſe Law-maker of heauen and earth, hath appointed by theſe two meanes, <hi>Praemiis &amp; Poenis,</hi> by rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21197:5"/>
to keepe the common-wealth of the whole world in good gouernment, and to bring men to obedience to his holy commandements: for after he had in the 20 of <hi>Exodus</hi> giuen his moſt ſacred Precepts: that he might the rather ſtirre men vp to keepe, and obſerue them: in the 26. Chap. of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus,</hi> and alſo in this Chapter, hee propoundeth certaine bleſsings, and curſings, menaces and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, rewards and puniſhments, as moſt forcible motiues to winne them to obedience. From the third verſe to the thirteenth, bleſſings are promiſed to the obedient; from the fifteenth to the ende of the Chapter curſings are denounced againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. Wherein we may note, what a gradation God doth keepe in inflicting puniſhments on ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne ſinners: firſt, he trieth by his leſſer and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chaſtiſments, to make them turne vnto him; and if they will doe no good, then hee comes with the Sword to conſume, and cut them off from the face of the earth:<note place="margin">Pſal. 71 12.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeakes, if a a man will not turne, God will whet his Sword. Thus much we ſee in this Chapter; but more plainly in the 26. of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> where firſt he threatens to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice them with the Famine; if that will not amend them, he threatens to encreaſe their puniſhment, and to ſend the Peſtilence among them; If that will not reforme them, then in the laſt place he giues them ouer to the Sword as it is <hi>v.</hi> 25. of that Chap. <hi>If yee will not for theſe things be reformed by me</hi> (meaning the Famine and Peſtilence) <hi>but walke ſtubburnly againſt me, then will I alſo walke ſtubbornely in mine anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and I will chaſtiſe you ſeuen times more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your ſinnes, and I will bring a Sword vpon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21197:5"/>
you that ſhall auenge the quarrell of my couenant, and ye ſhall be deliuered vp into the hands of your enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloued, God hath tryed by the two former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence, to winne vs of this Land vnto his obedience: we haue had of late many <hi>deare yeares,</hi> wherein a number, eſpecially the poorer ſort haue pinched for it: wee haue had the laſt a <hi>dying yeare, Annum mortalem,</hi> wherein thouſands, and ten thouſands haue fallen in our Streetes. Now if theſe things reforme vs not, (as GOD knowes there is yet little reformation ſeene) wee are next in order to expect the Sword, Warre, and the calamities thereof to deſcend vpon vs; our Enemies to inuade, and ouer-runne vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe GOD bee the more mercifull vnto vs. So the Lord here menaceth his owne choſen people, deare <hi>Iſrael:</hi> (and we may apply it to our ſelues, if we walke in their ſteps;) if they will not amend by his former puniſhments, then he will ſtirre vp a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne foe to inuade them.</p>

The great Turke feaſting his Baſſaes and chiefe Captaines for many dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, cauſed, at euery Banquet certaine of the chiefe Captiues, both men and women, of whom many were of the Imperiall ſtocke, to be in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cruelly put to death, as he and his Turkes ſate banquetting: ſawcing his meate with the bloud of the Chriſtians, chearing himſelfe with their miſery; deeming his Feaſts much more magnificent, with that dolefull muſicke of the dying Captiues: which cruelty he vſed euery day, till hee had deſtroyed all the Grecian Nobility, and all the chiefe Citizens. A pittifull calamity! wee condemne them of folly, and ſay they deſerued no better: God graunt the world condemne not vs of the like folly, and ſay we deſerue worſe; becauſe we are armed, being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: their miſhap ſhould be our caueat: If we doe not in time take heede, it is like to fare with vs, as it did with them. I feare we keepe our wealth, for our Enemies to make merry with: If we part not with ſomething for our owne defence, wee are in danger to loſe all, as wel as they: and to come to worſe bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and miſery; more mercy is to bee expected from the very Turkes, then from the bloudy Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</p>
            <p>We haue a moſt gracious King, (whom the King of heauen long preſerue with a proſperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Raigne; and let all good Chriſtians ſay, <hi>Amen</hi>) who is more carefull and deſirous of our ſafety and happines, then we our ſelues: his wants are great, his expenſes greater for the common good: what charge he is at, both at home, and abroad cannot be vnknowne vnto vs: he hath a ſtrong and powerfull

enemy, which wants neither meanes, nor malice. O let not vs diſcourage him by our backwardneſſe; <hi>Vltrapoſſe, non eſt eſſe;</hi> he hath, he doth, he will doe what he may, more he cannot. There is a thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>nervus Belli,</hi> without which Warre cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: If we ſhrinke in theſe ſinewes, and withdrawe the nouriſhment, will not the whole body be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to come to ruine? And verely (from my heart I ſpeake) vnleſſe He be in time ſupplied, wee ſhall all rue it: the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will reioyce to worke vpon ſuch an aduantage. That man were mad, that would not part with a penny to enioy a pound; and al the world will condemne our Nation, if we loſe our Countrey for lacke of defence, hauing ſuch meanes to defend it. It is euery mans caſe, let vs all lay it to heart.</p>
            <p>I haue heard of a Marques of <hi>Brandenburge,</hi> who was wont to ſay, he had in his Countrie, three <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries</hi> which were three <hi>Monſters:</hi> one of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi> who had abundance of Corne, and yet had no Land to ſow; another of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> who were full of Money, and yet receiued no Rents: the third of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> order, whoſe monkes had a great many Children, yet had no wines. Wee are like to be a <hi>Monſter, and wonder, a Prouerbe, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke to all people,</hi> as it is <hi>verſe</hi> 37. For vnleſſe our Soueraigne be ſupplied, that ſome courſe may ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be taken for our defence, wee ſhall haue neither Lands, nor Rents, nor Money, nor Corne, nor Wiues, nor Children, nor any thing elſe in ſafety, but all will fall into our enemies hands: Lord open our eyes, that we may ſee the danger we are in, and in time prouide for it, leſt when it be too late, wee wiſh wee had. When you ſee this <hi>ſtrange, ſtrong,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:21197:22"/>
and <hi>ſterne Foe</hi> at your gates; your Countrey waſted, your Houſes fired, your Citie beſieged: when you heare the clangor of the Trumpet, the clamor of the wounded, the clattering of the harneſſe, the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Drumme, the roaring of the Ordnance, the thundring of the Cannon: when you ſee your wiues rauiſhed before your faces, your friends ſlain, your children murdered, your Infants daſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones, or broached on the Pike; and all the Land made nothing but the Shambles of <hi>Castillian</hi> and <hi>Ignatian</hi> Butchers; then you will wiſh (but alas too late) would to GOD wee had in time beene warned; would we had parted with halfe our eſtates, rather then loſe all, and come to this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſlauery and miſery. God in mercy put it into all our hearts to conſider ſeriouſly of it; that euery man according to his ability, may condeſcend vnto the neceſſitie of the time.</p>
            <p>Now for a concluſion: All that hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, may ſerue as a ſtrong motiue, to ſtirre vs vp with ſpeed to turne vnto God, that hee may turne vnto vs, and turne from vs this fearefull calamitie: Let vs repent heartily, and cry vnto him mightily, to ſpare vs, to be mercifull vnto vs. Vnceſſant prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, repentant teares are moſt powerfull to procure Gods mercy, to diuert his iudgement: he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and will receiue our Prayers; he is pittifull and will regard our teares. His Sword was once drawn againſt <hi>Niniueh,</hi> a fearefull doome pronounced; <hi>Yet fourty dayes and Niniueh ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> The King, and his Nobles, and all the people fall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; they faſt, they pray, they humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſackcloath and aſhes: their ſinnes cry for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21197:23"/>
iudgement, their repentance for mercy: there was a contention betweene them, which ſhould out-cry the other: their wickedneſſe aſcends vp on high, knockes at heauen gate, clamours lowd in the eares of God; Iuſtice, my Lord, vengeance, vengeance. Their repentance aſcends higher, and cries lowder in the eares of God; mercy, good Lord, mercy; ſpare vs, O ſpare vs, we beſeech thee. Repentance gets the victory; GOD is not ſo much enclined to iudgement, as to mercy: he regards not the <hi>cry of ſinne,</hi> if he once heare the <hi>cry of ſinners:</hi> he accepts their ſorrow and humiliation; he puts vp his ſword, hee holds his hand; hee ſees them turne from their wicked wayes, and he turnes from his fierce wrath: he ſees them repent of their euill deedes, and he alſo repents of the euill hee pronounced againſt them. The ſinnes of our Land like the ſinns of <hi>Nintueh,</hi> are aſcended vp on high, and cry alowde for reuenge to the GOD of heauen: but our religious King hath proclaim'd a Faſt; hee and his Nobles haue led the way; if we, with him, and them, ſend vp repentance, and prayers, and teares, to cry alowd in Gods eares; they will dull the cry of our ſinnes, that he ſhall not heare it; and dull the edge of his ſword that it ſhall not wound vs.</p>
            <p>Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> had grieuouſly ſinned, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſentence was paſt vpon him; yet vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance though it were but ſuperficiall in outward ſhew,<note place="margin">1 King. 21.19.</note> GOD was mercifull and ſpared him: <hi>Seeſt thou not</hi> (ſayes God to <hi>Elijah</hi>) <hi>how Ahab is humbled before me? becauſe he ſubmitteth himſelfe before mee, I will not bring that euill in his dayes, but in his ſonnes dayes will I bring euill vpon is houſe.</hi> If God were ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21197:23"/>
mercifull to that wicked man vpon his falſe &amp; fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentance, how much more if we turne vnto him, with true &amp; vnfained repentance will he be mercifull to vs, &amp; not bring this euill in our daies?</p>
            <p>A ſecond meanes to diuert this iudgement, is vnceſſant prayer: wonderfull is the force of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the God of heauen: when the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and they of mount <hi>Seir,</hi> came vp againſt <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with an huge Army; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were amazed, not knowing what to doe, for they were not able to ſtand before ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in battell: <hi>Iehoſophat</hi> proclaimes a Faſt, the people all fall to their prayers;<note place="margin">2 Chro. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

not bee refreſhed therewith; they built all the broken wall, they raiſed vp the Towers, they repaired <hi>Millo</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Dauid,</hi> they made many Darts and Shields, they muſtered the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land, and ſet Captaines ouer them: teaching vs what to do; It is not enough to ſit ſtill, and cry, Lord haue mercy vpon vs, without vſing meanes for our defence and ſafety; for GOD workes by meanes be it ſmall or great; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> vſeth the beſt meanes hee can, to withſtand and keepe out the Enemie: and then he and his people pray vnto God for a good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and rely on him, as then ſureſt ſtay for help and deliuerance: <hi>Feare not, neither bee afraid of the King of Aſhur; nor for all the multitude that is with him, for there be more with vs, then with him; with him is an arme of fleſh, but with vs is the Lord our GOD, for to helpe vs, and to fight our battels.</hi> And the Lord ſeeing their confidence, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their prayers, gaue them a meruailous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance; ſent forth a Captaine out of his owne Hoſt, a holy Angell which in one night ſlew an hundred ſomeſcore and fiue thouſand of their Enemieſ. So through this ſtrong and ſterne foe ſhould come againſt vs; yet let vs not be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we repent heartily for our ſinnes, pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vnto God, truſt to him; no doubt but hee will in mercy looke vpon vs, and worke ſome meanes for their confuſion, as hee did in 88. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our expectation: there bee more with vs then with them; GOD is on our ſide; it is his quarrell; he will defend his Church, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

conſtant in his ſeruice, feruent in prayer.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Moſes</hi> by prayer, ſaued a whole Nation, from a fearefull deſtruction: when the people forgetting Gods commandement, made them a God of gold, and worſhipped it, and ſo prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the holy one of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> that hee was minded to make a cleane riddance, and conſume them vtterly for it. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtepping into the gap, and praying for them, ſtayed his hand. The people ſinne, God is angry, drawes his ſword, lifts vp his hand to ſtrike; and <hi>Moſes</hi> lifts vp his hands in prayer: and ſo long as he prayes, God cannot ſtrike, his hands were held by <hi>Moſes</hi> prayers:<note place="margin">Exod. 32.11.</note> 
               <hi>Let me alone, Moſes,</hi> (ſaith God) let me alone, that my wrath may waxe hot againſt them, for I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them at once, but I will make of thee a mighty people.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes <hi>Moſes</hi> by his prayers did hinder and hold God backe from deſtroying <hi>Iſraell;</hi> prayer is like a chaine or manacle to tye the hands of an angry Lord: <hi>Vincit inuincibilem,</hi> It ouercomes him, that ouercomes all things. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſtill prayes, <hi>O Lord turne from thy fierce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill toward thy people:</hi> and ſuch was the power of his prayer, that GOD altered his ſentence, turned from his anger, deſtroyed them not as he had intended.</p>
            <p>Though Gods anger bee kindled againſt this Land for our ſinnes, yet if ſome <hi>Moſes</hi> doe ſtand in the gap, if ſome holy, deuout, and faithfull men doe intercede for it, no doubt but God will bee mercifull: And herein lyes our ſtrongeſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;

for as God would haue ſpared ſinfull <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> if there had bin but fifty, but fiue and forty, but forty, but thirty, but twenty, nay but tenne righteous therein: So, vndoubtedly, it is for ſome good peoples ſake that GOD hath ſpared vs ſo long: for though many are ſinfull, yet it is to be hoped, there is here and there a <hi>Moſes</hi> that holds vp his hands; here and there a <hi>Lot</hi> that grieues for the ſinnes of the time; here and there an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that makes requeſt for <hi>Sodome:</hi> for their ſakes GOD ſpares the whole, let them continue conſtant in Gods ſeruice, zealous in prayer; yea, let vs all betake our ſelues to earneſt, and hearty prayer, for now it is time and more then time ſo to doe. <hi>Spare vs good Lord, ſpare vs wee beſeech thee: O remember not our olde ſinnes and offences, but haue mercy vpon vs, and that ſoone, for elſe wee are like to come to great miſery; helpe vs O God, of and ſaluation for the glory of thy name, O deliuer vs and be mercifull vnto our ſins for thy names ſake.</hi> Or as the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> exhorts, <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, (yea and all the people) weepe betweene the Porch and the Altar in the Lords houſe; and let them ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord, ſpare thy people, and giue not thine heritage into reproach, that the Heathen ſhould rule ouer them.</hi>

ſtrong for thine owne ſelfe: cloath his Enemies with ſhame and confuſion: be as a wall of fire to him and his Realmes: Let thoſe that riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, be like <hi>Siſera</hi> and <hi>Iabin,</hi> who periſhed at <hi>Endor,</hi> and became as the dung of the earth, make them and their Princes like <hi>Oreb</hi> and <hi>Zeb,</hi> yea make all their Princes like as <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> O my God, make them like a wheele, and as the ſtubble before the winde. Let them fall vpon the edge of the ſword, that they may be a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Foxes: ſo ſhall the King reioyce in thy ſtrength, exceeding glad ſhall he be of thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For why he putteth his truſt in thee; and in thy mercy, O thou moſt high, let him not miſcary. So we that be thy people, and Sheepe of thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſhall giue thee thankers for euer, and will be ſhewing forth thy praiſe from one generation to another. So ſhall thy name be glorified, thy Son magnified, thy truth defended, thy Goſpell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, thy poore Church comforted: which we humbly beſeech thee to graunt, (O Father of mercies, and God of all conſolation) for our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake; to whom with thee and thy holy Spirit, three glorious perſons, one eternall, omnipotent God, be giuen all honour, glory, praiſe and power, now and euermore.</p>
