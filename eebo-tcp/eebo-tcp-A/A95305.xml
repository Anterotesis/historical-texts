            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day of Aprill, 1653.
A true Report of the great Coſts and Charges of the
five Hoſpitalls in the City of London under the Care of the Lord Mayor, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
and Citizens of London, in the maintaining of a very great
Number of poore the yeare laſt paſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hildren kept and and maintained this laſt year at the Charge of Chriſts Hoſpitall in
the ſaid Houſe, in divers places in this City and Subburbs, and with ſundry Nurſes
in the Country—674</p>
            <p>The names of all which are Regiſtred in the Books kept in Chriſts Hoſpitall,
there to be ſeen from what Pariſhes, and by what meanes they have beene from
time to time admitted.</p>
            <p>Children put forth Apprentices, diſcharged, and dead this yeare laſt paſt—70</p>
            <p>So remaines now in the Houſe, and kept abroad at the ſaid Hoſpitalls Charge—604</p>
            <p>And lately admitted into the ſaid Hoſpitall—200</p>
            <p>Which in all is—804</p>
            <p>THe ſaid Hoſpital hath divers wayes fallen very ſhort of means formerly Received, <hi>viz.</hi> heretofore
many have given Monies privately, others very bountifull at their Deaths: And ſeverall Pariſhes
in <hi>London</hi> have ſent in large Contributions, and now but one that ſends any thing at all: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all theſe diſcouragements, by reaſon of theſe hard and miſerable times among poore people,
and the great number of diſtreſſed, needy, and comfortleſſe ſuiters: The Governours of the ſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitall,
have lately admitted as aboveſaid, into their Care and Charge 200. poor Children, with hopes
that divers able and well affected perſons, will liberally Contribute towards the Charges of the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the aforeſaid 804. Children, which yearly amounts unto ſo great a ſum of Money, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the ſaid Hoſpitall doth not diſcharge the Moytie thereof</p>
            <p>THere hath been Cured this yeare laſt paſt, at the Charge of St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Hoſpitall, of maimed
Souldiers and other diſeaſed perſons, to the number of—1096</p>
            <p>Many whereof being Souldiers, have been relieved with Money, and other neceſſaries at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>Buried this yeare after much Charge in their Sickneſſe—168</p>
            <p>Remaining under Cure, at this preſent, at the Charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall—322</p>
            <p>THere hath been Cured at the Charge of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpitall, this year laſt paſt, of diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whereof many being Souldiers, have been relieved with Money and other neceſſaries at their
departure.—985</p>
            <p>Buried this yeare paſt, after much Charge in the time of their ſickneſſe—152</p>
            <p>Remaining under Cure at preſent, upon the Charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall—262</p>
            <p>THere hath been brought to the Hoſpitall of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> within the ſpace of one whole year laſt paſt
of wandring Souldiers, and other Vagrant people, to the number of—705</p>
            <p>Many whereof have been very chargeable to the ſaid Hoſpitall, for Apparel, ſick dyet, and Surgery,
beſides the ordinary dyet, and other proviſions and charges expended about them, which could not be
avoided by reaſon of their neceſſities, and many of them have been paſſed into their Countries, with
Clothing Apparell, and other charges which could not be avoided conſidering their naked and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition, nor they thence paſſed without ſuch charge. And there are now kept and maintained
in Arts and Occupations, and other ſervile works and labours, at the charge of the ſaid Hoſpitall, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
and of her perſons, to the number of—177</p>
            <p>The Hoſpital of <hi>Bethlem</hi> is of great Antiquity, uſe, and neceſſity, for keeping and curing diſtracted
perſons, who are of all others the moſt miſerable, by reaſon of their wants, both for ſoule and body,
and have no ſence thereof.</p>
            <p>The charge thereof is very great, there being kept and maintained with Phyſick, Dyet, and other
reliefe: 43. diſtracted perſons conſtantly at leaſt, beſides the charge of Servants to look to them, they
being moſt unruly and not able to help themſelves, and the Rents and Revenues of the ſaid Hoſpitall
being very ſmall, not amounting to two third parts of the yearly charge, and therefore this Hoſpitall
is a fit object of charity, there having been of late by the bleſſing of God, upon the charge of the ſaid
Hoſpital, and the care of thoſe that are intruſted with the ſaid diſtracted people, divers reduced to their
former ſenſes.</p>
