            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout <hi>fiue hundred</hi> yeares
after Christ, when the
Romans vast Dominion
began to decline, there
was great affliction and
trouble thoroughout the
world; plagues, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,
and warres, and
earth-quakes, and other
euils, conspir'd together to vexe all places: so
that the people of God, euery where, both in the
Greeke and Latine Churches, fearing their turne
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3963:3"/>
might be next to come vnder the scourge, had
formes of holy Prayers, composed by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
which the Greeke Church termed<note n="a" place="margin">Basil. ep. 63. Niceph. lib. 14. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
the Latine <hi>Rogations,</hi> to be spoken often into
the eares of the Lord of heauen and earth, to
preuent imminent iudgements; so godlily wise
were the Christians of old time, that those cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which they knew, being present, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would bewaile with teares, being absent, they
laboured by their prayers to keep away.</p>
            <p>And if I take not my marke amisse, that's the
intention of this meeting:<note place="margin">Iob 19. 12.</note> Gods <hi>troupes of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as holy Iob cals them, are abroad in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, making hauocke of men and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and wee, conscious to our selues, that our
sinnes deserue to haue them come, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe
about our tabernacles, are met here toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to make prayers to our God, to keepe them
away from vs: and to set a greater edge vpon our
deuotion, and the more to testifie our humiliation
to the World, and to Angels; a Fast is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which is to bee obserued by vs in a strict
manner: all the time is to bee spent in confession
of sinnes, in bitter lamentations, in deiection and
humiliation for transgressions, in abstinence from
meates and drinkes, and all other corporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that may cheare the heart, and so hinder it
from being truely sorrowfull and afflicted, in
almes deedes and visiting the sicke, in mourning
and weeping for angring God, and in <hi>crying
mightily vnto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ionah 3. 8.</note> to diuert iudgements ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3963:3"/>
And to helpe to these exercises of repentance,
the Word of God must be preached, the sinnes of
a Nation must bee ript vp, Gods iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne must be denounced, for nothing doth
further more to humiliation and compunction,
than a serious consideration, how infinitely ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
doth anger God, and how seuerely he hath,
and doth, and will punish it. It was the course,
which God himselfe directed the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah
to runne, when Israel and Iudah were vpon
the point of destruction:<note place="margin">Ier. 36. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>This word came vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah
from the Lord, saying, Take thee a roule of a
booke, and write therein all the words that I haue
spoken vnto thee against Israel, and against Iudah,
and against all the Nations, from the day I spake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, from the dayes of king Iosiah, euen vnto this
day: it may be, that the house of Iudah will heare all
the euill which I purpose to doe vnto them, that they
may returne euery man from his euill way, that I may
forgiue their iniquity and their sinne.</hi> And in that
roule of the booke, the Rabbins say, was written
the booke of Lamentations:<note place="margin">Six. Sen. lib. 2. Bibl.</note> in which booke,
Ieremiah the Prophet, doth in a most mournfull
<hi>Elegie,</hi> lament the miserable condition, which
Ierusalem, because of sinne, was to come vnto. I
haue resolued to follow that tract, to speake vnto
you of a people, whose damnable impiety
brought vpon them such a misery, the relation
whereof, may make all, that worke vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with greedinesse, to tremble to heare it, and
so to abhorre and auoide crying sinnes, lest they
should proue likewise their ruine and confusion.</p>

            <p>4. The place from whence it rained: <hi>Out of

The act and the materials, giue way to treate of

            <p>Thus then wee will proceed, Gods grace assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</p>

            <p>First of Gods clemency, and of Sodome and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Gomorrah's impiety.</p>
            <p>There is not a greater antipathy betwixt any
two natures in the world, than there is betwixt
the nature of God and sinne: You may sooner
reconcile fire and water, heate and cold, light and
darknesse, than God and Mammon, Christ and
Belial, the holy Ghost and Dagon. God hates
sinne wheresoeuer he findes it, be it in Heauen or
Earth, in Men or Angels, in Elect or Reprobates.
Indeed his Mercy, his sweet blessed Mercy, to
which mankinde hath beene euer much bound,
neuer ceaseth solliciting him to treat Adams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with all the fauour hee may, and like to an
importunate suitor, neuer giueth ouer crauing of
him, vntill he make her a promise, that <hi>hee will not
execute the fiercenesse of his anger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea 11. 9.</note> otherwise the
world should heare oftner from him than it doth.
Howsoeuer though mercy doth much with God,
yet mercy doth not all, iustice may bee heard: if
the suspension of iudgement worke no remorse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3963:5"/>
in sinners hearts, to take pitie vpon their owne
soules, and to please God, iustice will procure
that God shall render <hi>indignation and wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
and anguish, vpon euery soule of man that
doth euill, to the Iew first, and also to the Gentile.
Misericordia Deo attribuitur secundum effectum,</hi>

               <hi>non
secundum passionis affectum;</hi> Mercy is attributed
vnto God according to the effect, not according
to the affect of the passion: it doth neuer transport
him beyond himselfe, neither causeth it him vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to stop his eares to his iustice, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for indignation. Tis euident in holy Writ,
that Mercy is potent with God, hath a great hand
with him; hee will heare her mediating for the
most notorious malefactors in the world, if hee
can discerne in them any hope of amendment.</p>
            <p>How long did he protract Sodom's ruine, and
what courses did hee take to reclaime them? sent
Lot to preach to them, stirr'd vp foure Kings to
make warre vpon them, gaue them victory ouer
them, and when they had taken the people, and
were carrying of them into captiuity, prest Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
out to rescue them,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 15, 16.</note> who <hi>diuided himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, he and his seruants by night, and smote
them, and pursued them vnto Hoba, which is on the
left hand of Damascus, and he brought backe all the
goods, and also brought againe his brother Lot, and
his goods, and the women also, and the people.</hi> Yea,
when their sinnes cryed out for brimstone, flames
&amp; wrath was gone out from God, and he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
his ministring spirits <hi>to goe downe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and see
whether they had done altogether according to the cry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3963:5"/>
of it which came vp vnto him.</hi> Hee protected vnto
Abraham, if hee could finde ten righteous men
there, <hi>he would not destroy them for tens sake.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 32.</note> Gods
goodnesse towards them, doth surpasse all orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to expresse, all cogitation to thinke; he would
haue spared them vpon any tolerable termes, they
might haue made their peace vpon any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
conditions: God, I say, tooke no delight in
their desolation. At last, when hee saw that no
preaching, no warre, no captiuity, no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from captiuity, could beget any piety among
them, <hi>Then the Lord rained vpon Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah
brimstone and fire, from the Lord out of
Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their sinnes were insufferable; not ordinarie,
but great, very great transgressions: they did
prouoke the iustice of God from the greatest of
them, to the littlest of them, they did euen against
nature and common reason agree to bee wicked,
they were not onely sinners, drawne to iniquitie
by the strong incitations of nature, but they were
wicked, industriously wicked, willingly wicked;
like to the house of Iacob,<note place="margin">Micah 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>they deuised iniquity
vpon their beddes, and when the morning was light,
they practis'd it:</hi> They were <hi>scelerum principes, &amp;

There was such a habit of filthinesse, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3963:8"/>
it may danger to marre the word, though not so
much as if a vowell bee defaced; so in a City or

that City or Kingdome, yet not so soone as if a
man of higher place be blurd with impiety.</p>
            <p>Here were sins enow to set patience in a rage,
and to transforme the God of mercy into wrath,
and yet God respited their subuersion so long,
vntill their sins came bellowing vp into Heauen,
and were ready to lay an imputation of partiality
vpon his iustice. Three hundred and forty
yeares, Chronologie saith, passed betwixt the
drowning of the world with water, and the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sodome with brimstone and fire, all, or a
great part of which time, God was grieued with
that generation; and if euer they would haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselues to alter their conditions, had
there beene but a sprinkling, a gleaning of good
people in her, one honest soule for a thousand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
God would haue repented him of his
purpose: at last, when the Lord looked, nay sent
downe from Heauen, saw there was no hope, they
were altogether corrupt, and become abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in their doings, there were none that did
good, no not <hi>Ten, Then the Lord rained upon Sodom
and Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from the Lord, ut
of Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis recorded of Iulius Caesar, that hee neuer
entertained hatred against any man so deeply, but
he was willing to lay downe the same vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
offered;<note place="margin">Sueton. vita Iul. Caes.</note> and the author doth instance in this,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3963:8"/>
when C. Memnius put-in for the Consulship, hee
befriended him before others of the Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
notwithstanding that C. Memnius had made
bitter inuectiues against him. Our God, to whom
all the Caesars &amp; Kings of the earth are tributaries
and homagers, doth neuer hate (I take hatred as
tis an intention of God in punishing) so irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileably,
but true humiliation will worke a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation;
that maketh him say, <hi>Patientia Dei pios

can indure such palpable dishonour, and suspend

was an argument of his mercy:<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 21.</note> God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it should be planted ouer the Arke, in which

<hi>Psalme, Verse</hi> 5. he doubles the epithite mercifull,
<hi>Mercifull is the Lord, and righteous; yea, and our God
is mercifull:</hi> as if he had two quantities of mercy
in him for one of iustice; as if no act of iustice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3963:9"/>
could passe from him, but thorow the gate of
mercy. Longanimity is as Gods naturall childe;
the holy Deity is in trauell with it: euen as any
thing great with young doth desire to bee rid of
the burthen, so doth God desire to poure forth
his mercy: neuer Nurse, when her breasts were
full of milke, was in greater paine for children to
sucke them, than God is in paine to haue children
to draw his mercy from him. Iustice commeth
from God, as a sting from a Bee, constrainedly;
Mercy floweth from him, as honey from a Bee,
most willingly: Mercy is as essentiall to him, as
light is to the sunne, or as heate is to the fire; hee
delights in mercy, as any sense or faculty of our
soules doe in their actions, the eye in seeing, or
the eare in hearing, or the memory in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring:
Patience, and clemency, and mercy, and
compassion, and peace, are the fruits of his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
the off-spring which the diuine nature doth
produce; fury, and rage, and anger, and affliction,
and warre, and flaming fire, are forced into him
by the prouoking exorbitances of the world.</p>
            <p>God doth all along the Scripture euen court
sinners to turne from their vicious courses; the
omnipotent Creatour doth euen turne begger, to
beseech his creatures to walke in his wayes; not
that tis any aduantage to him, if all the world
should worship him with a holy worship: <hi>Can a

A man cannot say he doth the fountain good

they should amend their manners, before hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

yea and after hee had threatned a deluge, hee gaue

their iniquities, like rebels, make a head, as if they

from thence you may make an obseruation, how
deare in the sight of the Lord a righteous man is:
Sodome could not bee burnt before Lot was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
<hi>Haste thee, escape to Zoar: for I cannot doe

God is no way so long suffering in bearing, that
he is not as iust in punishing; If a man will not
turne, he will whet his sword. God spun out the
thread of his loue to an immeasurable length, to
try whether the men of Sodome would lay hold
of it; hee did angle for them, sate in heauen, let
downe the line of his loue, and baited it with his
mercy, to proue whether the men of Sodome
would swallow it, that hee might catch their
soules. Twas long before he was prouoked, he did
smother indignation many yeares, before it
kindled and came to bee deuouring flame; and
when all would not preuaile, <hi>Then the Lord rained
vpon Sodome and Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from

As God is infinite in suffering, vrged,
thoroughly vrged, before he will breake out into
fury, so hee is violent and fierce in the execution
of his iudgement, when hee is resolued vpon it:
The longer the archer drawes before hee looses,
the sorer shot hee maketh; the longer God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he poureth forth his vengeance, the more
twill scorch. I need not search other Chronicles
for examples to verifie this collection, Sodome
and Gomorrah ratifie the truth of it. Strabo saith,
nature wrought this act,<note place="margin">Strabo. Geog. lib. 16.</note> and that the fire issued
out of the earth which consumed these cities; but
Strabo vnderstood not the Scriptures, nor the

brimstone hereafter, fire and brimstone <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
doth it stand with diuine Iustice? I confesse,
calamities poured downe vpon good people, are
the earnest of an euerlasting inheritance; good
people,<note place="margin">Psal. 126. 5.</note> if they <hi>sow in teares, shall reape in ioy;</hi> but
the iudgements which the wrath of God raines
downe in this life vpon the wicked, such as the
Sodomites were, are but the preambles to future
woes; but entrances into, not exemptions from
ensuing miseries: <hi>Great plagues remaine for the
vngodly.</hi> Tis said,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that the heauie night which was
spread ouer the Egyptians, was but an image of that
darknesse which should afterward receiue them:</hi> And
I may say,<note place="margin">Wisd. 17. 21.</note> the fire and brimstone which fell vpon
the Sodomites in this life, was but a figure of that
fire and brimstone which shall feed vpon them in
the life to come. God, by the holy Prophet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum,<note place="margin">Nahum 1. 9.</note>
threatens his enemies to bring vpon them so
much tribulation, <hi>that affliction should not rise vp
the second time:</hi> There should be no need of a new
plague, he would pay them home at once. From
whence Pelagius concludes, God will not punish
sinners twice. Ah Pelagius, if they be such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3963:17"/>
as the Apostle St. Paul speaketh of, that <hi>doe
not like to retaine God in their knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note> as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites
were, tis not the vtter ruinating of their
dwelling places, and the rooting out of them and
their posterity from the earth, will acquit them
and satisfie Gods iustice; a worser doome is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
infinite extremity, deuouring fire, euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
burnings; the Sodomites <hi>suffer the vengeance
of eternall fire:</hi> and the reason is,<note place="margin">Epist. Iud. ver. 7</note> wicked men, if
it were in their power, would liue without end,
that they might sinne without end; and therefore
tis agreeable to Gods iustice, that their soules
should neuer want woe in the next world, that by
their good will would neuer want wickednesse in
this. Let no man flatter himselfe in his owne
heart, because tis said,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 9.</note> 
               <hi>God will not alwaies chide,
neyther will he keepe his anger for euer.</hi> Let no man
reason, Man sin'd but a time, and God will punish
him but for a time; rather let him know, hee that
sins against an infinite Maiesty, must expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
infinite misery, if it be not preuented by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mercy: Hee that neglects ineffable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
must looke to bee exposed to ineffable fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Man by sinne destroyed that good, which
if he had kept, would haue made him eternally
blessed; and loued that euill, which not repented
of, will make him eternally cursed, if it be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, and not satisfied for by the bloud of
Christ. God doth not measure sinne <hi>temporis lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudine,</hi>
by the quantity of time in which it is
committed, nor proportion the punishment after
that rate; then a beastly Sodomite should haue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3963:18"/>
but a few minuts torment: he doth iudge of sinne
as Augustine saith,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 21. c. 11 de ciuit. Dei.</note> 
               <hi>iniquitatis magnitudine,</hi> by the
greatnesse of the iniquity, and correspondent to
that allots the plague.</p>
            <p>Then are the Sodomites vtterly vnhappy;
first, to be turned to destruction; and then to bee
turned into hell: Who can help it? the Holy One
of Israel is not to be sleighted, is not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
My heart danceth for ioy to muse vpon the
depth of his mercie, yet had wee best to be adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that wee abuse it not by presumption; hee is
not a God of wood, nor of stone, insensible of

               </gap>ipension; if hee be
long prouoked, hee will at last awake like a gyant
out of sleepe, and teare those in his wrath, that
feare not the Lord and his strength: A wretched
people they were, the Sodomites were, to liue so
as to deserue to haue their country and their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ruined so irreparably; yet more wretched, to
liue so as to deserue to haue their bodies and
soules damned eternally. Tis lamentable to
thinke of their iudgement past, tis more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thinke of their iudgement to come: though
their bodies are consumed vnto dust, as small as
that which the whirlewinde scatters, yet God
will collect together all parts of euery one of
them (for tis as easie to him to raise a dead man
out of his graue, as tis for one of vs to raise a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
man out of his bedde) and when hee hath so
done, he will touch their flesh with such a touch
of immortality, that they shall fry in flames, bee
sensible of the paine, and yet not bee consumed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3963:18"/>
with the fire, as they were when they were Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Sodome, before that their mortall had
put on immortality; and as the moth is to the
garment, and the worme is to the wood, so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shall eate their hearts: <hi>poena sensus, &amp; poena

suffer, intermixt with the consideration of what
they are bereft of, will crucifie their soules with
vnspeakable woe.</p>
            <p>But, saith one to mee, omit the eternall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and presse the temporall: for carnall men
will quake more to heare of the losse of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and estates, than of their soules. I can make
no farther illustration of it than this: There were
sundry goodly Cities, of which Sodome was the
<hi>Metropolis,</hi> fairely situated in a champian in the
plaine of Iordan, plentifully peopled with men,
women, and children, delicately prouided for, of
corne, and wine, and oyle, and all other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that might any way conduce to earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
as it might be this morning, and on the same
day before noone, the soile was cursed with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse,
the beasts suffered for their masters
transgressions, the people perished euery one, that
there might bee an end of the race of Sodomites;
<hi>The Lord from the Lord,</hi> God the Son from God
the Father being the agent of this astonishing
act, <hi>fire and brimstone</hi> being his instruments, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinnes the incitements, and the reason Saint

               <hi>condemned them with an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,

mee to my Application.</p>
            <p>I neede not search into the manners of other
Nations, nor lay my seene abroad to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of my discourse, it holds at home in many
things, and in some things better than I would it
did; we can vie blessings with Sodome, heauenly
and earthly blessings with Gomorrah, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of peace, the blessing of plenty, the blessing
of Gods Word that inestimable blessing, and wee
may tell sinnes with them too, and I feare ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
them: If I had a Catalogue of the number of
Sodomes sinnes, and a relation of their will and
greedinesse to commit them, and were tasked to
compare ours with theirs, I beleeue for quantity
and manner, wee are neare euen with them: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

Though thou build the wals of thy palaces as

               <hi>Art thou better than populous No,

            </p>
            <p>Tremble therefore, thou secure Nation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

            <p>To conclude all, the way to keep vs from these
fearfull punishments, are fasting, prayer, godly
sorrow for sins past, and the amendment of our
sinfull liues in the time to come: <hi>Not a day for a
man to afflict his soule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 58. 5.</note> 
               <hi>to bow downe his head as a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush,
to spread sackcloth and ashes vnder him,</hi> it is <hi>not
such a fast that the Lord hath chosen:</hi>
               <note place="margin">August.</note> 
               <hi>Opus est perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuâ
poenitentiâ, quia perpetuò peccamus;</hi> We sin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
wherefore we had need to repent perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
though wee doe draine our hearts dry of
water to day, wee shall haue need againe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to water our couches with our teares. Our
griefe for our sins must be equiualent, it must hold
proportion with the delight we haue taken in our
sins: our sins haue been wonderous great, and our
mourning must be maruellous deep: we haue bin
out of measure sinfull, and we must be out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
sorrowfull; we haue sinned with greedinesse,
and we must repent with bitternesse; we haue bin
transported with delight in the commission of
our sins, and wee must be swallowed vp with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse
in our submission for our sins: <hi>Qui culpam

hath augmented his sin, must augment his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3963:26"/>
greater crimes are to be washt away with
greater lamentations. Some run abominable ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
act such iniquities the Angels of God wonder
at; and when they haue done, will say each man
for his owne particular, <hi>Miserere mei Deus,</hi> Lord
haue mercy on mee, and that too <hi>ex more magis
quàm ex animo,</hi> rather out of custome than hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as Saul said to Dauid, when hee was going to

               <hi>Goe, and the Lord bee with

O Lord God, that a man should dare to
sinne so damnably, and dreame to quit himselfe
of the guilt of it so eastly! tis not bare Lord haue
mercy vpon vs will doe it, there belongs more to
repentance than so; the faculties of our soules
must bee griped with griefe, and wearied with
groaning, and tired with supplications: we must
double our words as Daniel doth, and say, <hi>O Lord
heare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 19.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord forgiue, O Lord hearken, and deferre
not for thine owne sake, O our God.</hi> We must renue
our complaints with Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 55. 17.</note> 
               <hi>euening, and morning,
and at noone day, we must pray, and make a noise,</hi> and
God will hear our voice. We must weep and wipe
our eyes, and weep againe and wipe our eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if we haue loued many sinnes, before many
sins can be forgiuen vs. We must draw a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in our owne bosomes, that no Nation hath
bin more bound to God than we, no Nation hath
sinned against God with a higher hand than wee;
and therfore no Nation hath greater cause to fast
and weepe, mourne and lament for their sins, than
we. We must giue way to the thoughts of our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3963:27"/>
hearts, to reflect vpon the distressed condition of
the Church of Christ abroad, and note how that
the bed doth not priuiledge the sick man, nor the
cradle the suckling babe, nor the great belly the
woman, nor the altar the Priest, nor the seate of
iustice the Magistrate, from the fury of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
souldier: They fight and are kil'd, they
yeeld and are murthered, they flye and are pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they remaine and are beleaguered, they hide
themselues and are hunger-starued, their corne
fields are deuoured by troupes of horses, their
streams of water are coloured red with the bloud
of men and beasts, and in some places their earth
is voide, as if it were returning into the <hi>Chaos</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
<hi>as tis, Zech.</hi> 8. 10.<note place="margin">Zech. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>there is no hyre for man nor
beast, neither is there any peace to him that goeth out,
nor to him that commeth in, because of affliction; for
all men are set, euery man against his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet wee, a sinfull Nation, a people laden
with as much iniquity as any Nation in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, are at rest; no trumpet is heard in our
streetes, no <hi>solitude ante ostia,</hi> no desolation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our gates, our plow-shares are not beaten
into swords, nor our mattockes into speares: the
seate of iustice is not interrupted, the Word of
God hath a free passage, we lay vs down to sleep,
and take our rest, God making vs to dwell in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and vpon the comparison of these things, wee
must bethinke our selues, what vngratefull
wretches we haue bin to dishonour our God with
our sinnes, that hath and doth follow vs with so
much louing kindnesse aboue other people that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3963:27"/>
are more righteous than we; we must earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and be heartily sorry for our misdoings past,
and we <hi>must sweare vnto the Lord, and vow a vow
vnto the Almighty God of Iacob,</hi> to renounce our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
waies, and to serue him in spirit and truth, in
sincerity and with good conscience in the time to
come; and then our God will not forsake vs, nor
giue vs vp for a reproach, that strangers should
rule ouer vs, but blesse vs all our lines long in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and soules, and entaile the blessings more
firmly, than by any law you can deuise, to descend
vpon our posterity successiuely, so long as the
Sunne and Moone shall endure: And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
let vs pray vnto him, and say, O most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God, let not our manifold sins make a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
betwixt thee and vs, let them not prouoke
thee to remoue thy spirituall and corporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
from vs; Giue vs, O Lord giue vs, broken
hearts, contrite spirits, and bleeding soules, to
offer vp in sacrifice vnto thee, that thou mayest be
reconciled, and at an attonement with vs: Our
sins are great, Lord, we confesse it, but thy mercy
is greater, Lord, we beleeue it; mercy therefore,
deare Father, haue mercy vpon our King, vpon
our Queene, vpon our Nobility, vpon our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
vpon our Magistracy, vpon our Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
vpon our whole Land, for thy Sions sake, for
thy Gospels sake, for thy beloued sonne Iesus

charge ouer vs, let them pitch their tents about
vs, that no pestilence come among vs to deuoure
vs, no famine befall vs to starue vs, no sword of

an enemy inuade vs to destroy vs, and then, O
Lord our God, if thou wilt giue vs grace, we will
blesse thee, we will praise thee, we will magnifie
thee, wee will sing songs of thanksgiuing vnto
thee, wee will ascribe all honour and glory vnto
thee, and to thy Sonne, our blessed Sauiour and
Mediatour Iesus Christ, and to thy holy Spirit, to
which blessed and glorious Trinity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and but one God, bee giuen all
might, maiesty, dominion, and
praise, now and euer.
