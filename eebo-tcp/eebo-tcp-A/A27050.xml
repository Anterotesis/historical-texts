            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Hiſtory of the Production of this Treatiſe, with its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Sum; to prevent miſ-underſtanding.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe many of late, as well as Juſtice <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange,</hi> do ſeem to believe themſelves in their accuſation of me, as <hi>changing with the Times;</hi> though I greatly affect the change of a Proficient, and know not at what age it is that ſuch men would fix us that we may grow no wiſer, nor ever repent of former Ignorance or Errour; yet I will here confeſs to them that if what I here write againſt be good and right, I have been forty years unchanged in my Errour.</p>
            <p>My mutability hath been little to my advantage for this world, For further than I was for the King, I never was one year on that which was called the <hi>upper</hi> or <hi>ſtronger</hi> prevailing ſide, as far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. Nor to the very day that I was turned out of all, did my Preferments, or Riches ever ſerve me, ſo much as to have a Houſe, or keep a Servant man, (ſave in Travail) or Woman (ſave one aged Woman that provided me neceſſaries, in a few top rooms of another mans Houſe;) which I mention for the ſake of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken <hi>French</hi> ſtranger, Mr. <hi>Durel,</hi> that tells the World another ſtory.</p>
            <p>And as to this Subject, this is the Breviate of its Hiſtory, <hi>ab ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi> I was in my Child hood, firſt bred up under the School, and Church-teaching, of eight ſeveral men, of whom only two preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once a month, and the reſt were but Readers of the Liturgie, and moſt of very ſcandalous lives. After that I fell into the hands of a Teacher, that ſtudied for preferment, and reviled Puritanes; and after that I fell into the happier acquaintance of three ancient Divines, that were called then Conformable Puritanes; and all of them bred in me an Opinion, that <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> were <hi>unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, addicted to</hi> humorous, cauſeleſs Singularity: For I knew but one <note n="*" place="margin">Where Dr. Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtree was bred: His next Neighbor.</note> who was an honeſt plain Preacher but of little learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And to ſettle me, the Divines that I followed, made me read Biſhop <hi>Downame's</hi> Defence, Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and others for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> and others for the Ceremonies: And I verily judged them to be in the right: But as ſoon as I was ordained, I removed into a Countrey where were ſome Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, ſome few of them Learned Miniſters, and many Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; of whom, one in the houſe with me, was oft diſputing the Caſe with me, and I thought I had ſtill the better: And the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable Miniſters</hi> there, were men of ſo much Holineſs, and
<pb facs="tcp:61252:3"/>
Peace, that they would ſcarce ever talk of the matters in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and repreſſing the over-much heat of the Lay men: And the famous <hi>William Fenner</hi> being late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the next Pariſh, a Conformiſt of learning, yet plain and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in preaching, God had bleſt his Miniſtry with ſo great ſucceſs in the Converſion of many ungodly Perſons; as that the reverence of him, kept up the honour of Conformity among the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people thereabouts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But in 1640. I was removed to <hi>Brignorth,</hi> and the Canons newly made, impoſed on us an <hi>Oath,</hi> which had theſe words, [I A. B. <hi>do ſwear that I do approve of the Doctrine, and Diſcipline, or Government of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as concerning all things neceſſary to Salvation—Nor will I ever give my</hi> CONSENT <hi>to alter the Government of this Church, by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As it ſtands now eſtabliſhed, and as by right it ought to ſtand—And all theſe things I do plainly and ſincerely acknowledge and ſwear, according to the plain and common ſence and underſtanding of the ſame words, without any equivocation, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal evaſion, or ſecret reſervation whatſoever; And this I do heartily, willingly, and truly, upon the Faith of a Chriſtian: So help me God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Though every Miniſter in the Countrey, as well I, was for Epiſcopacy, yet this Oath ſo ſtartled them that they appointed a meeting at <hi>Brignorth</hi> to conſult about it. It fell out on my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture day, and at the meeting, it fell to my lot to be the Objecter, or Opponent, againſt Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Cartwright</hi> (a good Man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably beyond me in Learning, the Derender of K. Ch. 1. againſt the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the Author of the Rabbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Commentary on <hi>Gen.</hi> whoſe Papers of Juſtification, I ſince an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) He defended the Oath; and though my Objections were ſuch as were none of the ſtrongeſt, the Miniſters thought he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in anſwering them, and we broke up more dubious than before.</p>
            <p>I had a little before ſet my ſelf to a more ſerious ſtudy of the Caſe of the Ceremonies than before; and upon the reading of Dr. <hi>Ames Freſh ſuit,</hi> and ſome others (having before read little on that ſide) I came to ſee that there was a great difference between the determination of ſuch Circumſtances of <hi>Order</hi> as the Law of Nature, or Scripture allow and oblige men to determine one way or other, the <hi>Genus</hi> being neceſſary, and the making of new myſtical ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant teaching Ordinances, and Symbols of Chriſtianity (of which ſee Biſhop <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> cited in my 2d. Plea.) And hereupon I had ſetled my Judgment only againſt the impoſed uſe of the Croſs in
<pb facs="tcp:61252:3"/>
Baptiſm, and the abuſe of undertaking Godfathers.</p>
            <p>But now I reſolved before I took ſuch an Oath as this, to ſtudy over again the Controverſie of Epiſcopacy, (which elſe I think I ſhould ſcarce have done) For I ſaw 1. That ſuch an <hi>Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> ſo Univerſally impoſed, was made the teſt and terms of Church concord, and ſo would be an Engine of diviſion by ſhutting out all that could not take it. The Scotch Oath, and Covenant was not the firſt impoſed on us: The Biſhops Oath and Covenant to the contrary went here before it. 2. I ſaw that the whole frame of the preſent Church-Government, was about to be fixed, as by an Oath of Allegiance, on the Land, as if it were as neceſſary as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and to be woven into the fundamental unchangeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and it were true, <hi>No Biſhop, no King.</hi> 3. I askt, <hi>What was the meaning of the Et caetera,</hi> and could have no ſolution, but from the following words [<hi>As it ſtands now eſtabliſhed</hi>] And underſtood not well how far Lay chancellous, Officials, Surrogates, Regiſters, Proctors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Advocates, were part of the eſtabliſhed Government; but I ſaw it certainly included, Arch-biſhops, Deans, and Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. 4. I askt whether the King and Parliament had not power to ſet up a Biſhop in every Corporation? and to take down Deans, Arch-Deacons, Chancellours, Officials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſew denied it. 5. I askt my ſelf i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the King and Parliament make ſuch a change, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Conſent, whether I muſt diſobey them, and foreſtall my obedience by a Covenant and Oath? 6. I thought that what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on all the Clergie to day, may be impoſed on the Laity next; And then all Parliament men will be Sworn and Covenanted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Parliament ſo much as to Conſent to change any of the Church Government now eſtabliſhed. 7. I found that I muſt alſo ſwear [<hi>That it ought ſo to ſtand.</hi>] which could mean no leſs, than by a Divine Law, when Mans Law may not alter it. 8. I found ſuch Heartineſs, Willingneſs required in the Swearer, as required very full ſatisfaction in all this. And that with the terrible re-nunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Help of God in Chriſt,</hi> if I do not all that I ſwear to. 9. And I muſt be deprived of my Office (for Benefice I had none) and caſt out of the miniſtry, if I refuſed to take this Epiſcopal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Oath. 10. And I knew that he that made no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of deliberate Perjury, had little reaſon to hope that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Conſcience, true Grace, or Honeſty; and ſpecially if he concurred to involve all the Clergie, or Nation in the guilt.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations, I ſet my ſelf to a more ſearching ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the matter: I read <hi>Gerſom Bucer, Didoclaue, Jacob,</hi> (and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Parker, Bains,</hi>) and others on one ſide, and all that I could get
<pb facs="tcp:61252:4"/>
on the other, (<hi>Downam</hi> again, <hi>Bilſon, Hooker, Saravia, Andrews,</hi> and many more) And the reſult of my ſearch was this, I wondered to find ſo many write <hi>for</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> Epiſcopacy, without diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſorts of Epiſcopacy: For I found reaſon to think one ſort at leaſt Tolerable, yea, deſirable; but that which the Oath of 1640. would have bound me to, I found great reaſon to judge to be but what I have deſcribed it in this Book: And I here give notice to the Reader, that whereever he findeth me ſpeak, as againſt the <hi>Engliſh Dioceſane Prelacy;</hi> I mean it as deſcribed by <hi>Couſins,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Zouch;</hi> and as relating to that Oath and Canon, and not in oppoſition to the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>This Judgment then ſetled, I never could ſee cauſe to change, but the more I read of the Ancients, Church Hiſtory, Counſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And many other Writers for Epiſcopacie, (<hi>Petavius, Sancta Clara Spalatenſis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> and many more) the more was I confirmed in it to this day. When Uſurpation was at the higheſt, I wrote accordingly in my book, called <hi>Diſputations of Church Government.</hi> When the King came home I accordingly uſed my Endeavours as a Reconciler with the Miniſters here called Presbyterians, who ſeemed moſtly of the ſame mind, And how little an alteration of the Church Government in the Kings Declaration of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, did we receive with thankfulneſs, and it would have been with a conforming joy, but that we knew the leading Men, that treated with us, too well to hope that they had any intention to continue it, but to uſe it—they knew to what, till they had done their work and got <hi>this</hi> Act of <hi>Uniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1668. After I had been in the Goal, and yet men called for the reaſons of my Nonconformity, I drew up ſome of my thoughts rudely: And in 1671. The call being renewed I wrote this Book, as now it is (ſaving a few additional Notes): But caſt it by my Friends and my experience perſwading me, that the Biſhops, and their Parliament adherence could not patiently bear it.</p>
            <p>Many years after ſome Letters paſt between Mr. <hi>Henry Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> (then of <hi>Ireland</hi>) and me: And his laſt being tedious, and he ſeeming not to intend or deſire a publication of them, I gave him but a ſhort general return, inſtead of a voluminous particular Anſwer, eſpecially becauſe I had this Book written by me, in which I had more than anſwered him, and was not willing or at leaſure to write over the ſame things again: But when I had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrote in my <hi>Book of Concord</hi> a <hi>ſummary</hi> conſutation of Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> ſchiſmatical Volumne, in which he degradeth, unchurcheth, if not unchriſteneth, ſo many of the Proteſtants, as having no

Sacraments, no Covenant right to Salvation, but ſinning againſt the Holy-Ghoſt; and all for want of a Miniſtery derived by an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion of Epiſcopal Ordination from the Apoſtles, (and could not by importunity prevaile with him to anſwer <hi>Voetius de deſperata cauſa Papatus,</hi> or my <hi>Diſpute of Ordination,</hi> at laſt I received a Letter from him, ſignifying his purpoſe, upon his Friends deſire to Publiſh his long Letter written to me out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> So that I ſaw a neceſſity of Publiſhing my Treatiſe which contained more than an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him: And the rather becauſe ſome R. Reverend Biſhops and others had urged me, to give an Account of the Reaſons of my Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity: So that I had not leave to ſuppreſs this book, nor be longer ſilent. And yet I fear that they that ſo called for it, will not eaſily bear it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſumme</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dodwels</hi> Letter to me, now in the preſs, is to prove the poſſibility of right Diſcipline, by our Dioceſane Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it is, 1. Becauſe Magiſtrates can exerciſe theirs by as few: 2. Becauſe the Ancients <hi>de facto</hi> did it by ſuch: Therefore it may be done.</p>
            <p>To anſwer theſe two is to anſwer his Letter, which one would think ſhould be ſo eaſy, that no Scholar ſhould have need of help to do it.</p>
            <p>1. If any man canby an harrangue of words be brought to renounce his reaſon and experience, ſo far as to believe that the Office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor may be performed to as many Pariſhes, as the Office of a Major or Juſtice of Peace may, and that Paſtors have no more to do in watching over particular Souls, inſtructing, exhorting, convincing, comforting, viſiting, worpſhing, Governing, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> than the works of a Juſtice of Peace amount to, and that Dr. Stillingfleet (<hi>e. g.</hi>) ſhall be excuſed if he do no more for his Pariſh, than Juſtice <hi>Rog. L'Eſtrange</hi> doth, I undertake not to convince that man of any thing. Read over the work of a Biſhop as I have here diſcribed it from the Scripture and Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> and compare it with a Juſtices work, and if you can yet be deceived by Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> be deceived.</p>
            <p>And yet I think there are in divers Pariſhes about us many Juſtices for one Paſtor: I am confident <hi>London</hi> Dioceſs hath a great number for one Biſhop.</p>
            <p>And either our <hi>Juſtices</hi> are bound (beſides what now they doe) to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as much to bring ſome to Repentance, and ſuch other work, as the Paſtors are bound to do, or not: If not, it will not follow that as large a Circuit may be Governed by one Paſtor as by one Juſtice: If yea, then he doth but condemne the Juſtices for unfaithfulneſs; which will not prove, that a Paſtor muſt be as bad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61252:5"/>2. And as to his appeal to the diſcipline <hi>of the</hi> Ancients; I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the deceit of this mans arguings, 1. If he cannot find it fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Book, that the Churches of the ancient Biſhops were not ſo big as our greateſt Pariſhes, as to the number of Souls, much leſs as our Dioceſſes. 2. And if in my abſtruct of <hi>Church-Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Counſels,</hi> I have not fully proved, that Diſcipline was neglected corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or overthrown dy degrees as Biſhops-Churches overſwelled. When we read ſuch doleful complaints in Hiſtory, Fathers, Counſels and their Canons of the corruption of the Churches, is this the true uſe to be made of all, <hi>that we muſt be like them, and not blame them, leſt we open the nakedneſs of our Fathers?</hi> 3. And if men can make themſelves willingly ſo blind, as by a ſtory that the Fathers did ſuch things among People and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which we know not, to renounce <hi>common</hi> experience that it is not now any where done, nor can poſſibly be done; If men can be ſo ignorant what our Pariſhes and Dioceſſes are, and what a Biſhop and Chancellor do and can do, Let ſuch err, for I am unable to cure them, any more than if they were confident, that my Lord Major can Govern all the Families of <hi>London</hi> as their Maſters, by ſtewards, without Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Maſters, or that one Phyſitian, or one Tutor, could ſerve inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the City.</p>
            <p>Indeed they that have as low an eſteem of true Diſcipline, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> in his Letter ſeems to have, may eaſily believe that a few men may do it. And thoſe Papiſts that can let the Church be the ſink of common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and a Nurſery of Ignorance, Vice, and Prophaneneſs; ſo they may but keep up their Wealth, and Eaſe, and Honour, by crying up <hi>Order, Government,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> may accordingly believe, that no more knowledge, Piety or Diſcipline is a duty, than ſerveth the ends of their worldly Dominion.</p>
            <p>I muſt again give notice to the Reader that whereas the Common Objections of the greatneſs of Biſhops Churches in the ſecond Centurie, are fetcht from the inſtances of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> I have anſwered even thoſe two in the beginning of my Breviate of <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> to which I muſt refer you, and not again repeat it here.</p>
            <p>I know that poor ingnorant Perſons muſt expect ſuch a ſhameful Cant of old reproach as this, to cheat them into the hatred of Chriſts Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government, into a love of Clergie bondage, a ſcornful ſmile ſhall tell them [Mr. <hi>Baxter would have as many Biſhops as Pariſhes, and a Pope in every Pariſh; when men think one in a Dioceſs too much: When every ignorant or raſh Prieſt ſhall be the Maſter of all the Pariſh, and you have no remedy againſt his Tyranny; what a brave reformation will this be?</hi>] And ſuch a deceitful ſcorn will ſerve to delude the ignorant and ungodly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61252:5"/>But if they truly underſtood the caſe, they would ſee the ſhame of this deriding objection. 1. A Pope is a Monarch or Governour of the world, and a Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan of a multitude of Pariſhes. And ſure he uſurpeth not ſo much, who will be but the Church-guide of one? A man is abler to guide one School, Colledge, Hoſpital, or Family, than a hundred or thouſand, without any true Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, School, Colledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under him.</p>
            <p>2. Why is not this fooliſh ſcorne uſed againſt theſe foreſaid relations alſo? Why ſay they, not every Maſter maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Pope or Biſhop to his own houſe, and every School-Maſter to his School, whereas one Maſter over a thouſand would do better with bare Teaching Uſhers, that had no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>3. Let it be remembred that we would have no Pariſh Paſtor to have any forceing power, by Fines, Mulcts, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But only to prevaile ſo farr as his management of Divine authority on mens Conſciences can prevail: And we would not have Magiſtrates puniſh men meerly becauſe they ſtand excommunicate, or becauſe they tell not the Clergy that they repent. True excommunication is a heavy puniſhment fitted to its proper uſe, and not to be corrupted by the force of the Sword, but to operate by it ſelf; And <hi>valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi> He that deſpiſeth it will not ſay he is enſlaved by it. But is this all that the Biſhops deſire?</p>
            <p>4. We would have no man become the Paſtor of a Church without the peoples <hi>conſent</hi> (if not choice) no more than a Phyſician ſhould be forced on the ſick. And as the Servant that conſenteth to be a Servant, conſenteth to his Maſters Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and he that conſenteth to a Phyſician, conſenteth to be ruled by him for his health, and neither take this for a ſlavery: So he that conſenteth to a Paſtor, conſenteth to his Paſtoral conduct: And if he think it to his injury, he may chooſe.</p>
            <p>5. And yet we believe that the Magiſtrate may conſtrein Atheiſts, Infidels, and ſuch as refuſe all proper Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to hear Gods word Preached, and make all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh allow the Teacher his tythes and maintenance due by Law: But he may force no man to Receive the great gift of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, or a pardon delivered and ſealed by
<pb facs="tcp:61252:6"/>
Baptiſm or the Euchariſt, and to be a member of the Church as ſuch, againſt his will. For none but deſirous conſenters are capable of the gifts, ſo that the ſame Miniſter may be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Teacher of all the Pariſh, and yet the Church-Paſtor only of fit conſenters. And when Sacraments are free and no Miniſter conſtrained to deliver them againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor any unwilling man to receive them, who is by this enſlaved?</p>
            <p>6. And if a Church-Paſtor do diſpleaſe the Church, and the main body of them withdraw their conſent, we would not have any man continue their Paſtor while they conſent not, but diſclaim him. Though in caſe of need the Rulers may continue him in his Benefice as the publick Preacher, if the people be groſly and obſtinately culpable in refuſing him.</p>
            <p>7. And we would have that Pariſh Paſtor to have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hinder any other Miniſter from giving any one the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament whom he denyeth it to, or that refuſeth it from him: Though he that for a common cauſe is caſt out of our Church, ſhould not be received by others, till he repenteth, yet that holds not in all private cauſes, between the particular Paſtor and him; nor in caſe of unjuſt excommunication: And other Miniſters muſt judge of their own actions, whom to receive; and an injuring Miniſter may not hinder any other, nor the injured perſon from communicating elſewhere.</p>
            <p>8. And we would have Pariſh Churches be as large as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal communion doth require or allow, and every Church to have divers Miniſters; and if one be chief or Biſhop, and the reſt aſſiſtants, and if three or four ſmall Pariſhes make one ſuch communicating Church, we reſiſt not.</p>
            <p>9. And we deſire frequent meeting or Synods of neighbour Paſtors; and that there every ſingle Paſtor be ready to give an account of his Miniſtry, and to anſwer any thing that ſhall be alledged againſt him: And that the vote of the Synod ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth all againſt unneceſſary ſingularity.</p>
            <p>10. We refuſe not that one in every ſuch Synod be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator; and if as of old every City (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) or Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had a Biſhop, ſo if but every Corporation or market Town, or every circuit that hath as many Communican<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as
<pb facs="tcp:61252:6"/>
can know one another by neighbourhood and ſome conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and ſometimes aſſembling (like a great Pariſh with many Chappels) had but ſo much power as is eſſential to a true particular Paſtor and Church; yea or but the power that a free Tutor, Philoſopher or Phyſician hath, to manage his office by his skill, and not as an Apothecary or meer executor of a ſtrangers dictates, we ſhould quietly ſubmit.</p>
            <p>11. And as we refuſe not ſuch Biſhops (even <hi>durante vita &amp; capacitate</hi>) in every Church or City that is Corporation; ſo if it pleaſe either the King, or the Churches by his permiſſion to give one grave and able man a general care of many Churches, (as even the Scots ſuperintendents had at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as <hi>Spotſwood</hi> of <hi>Lothian,</hi> &amp;c.) not by violence to ſilence, and oppreſs, but by meer Paſtoral power, and only ſuch as the Apoſtles themſelves uſed to inſtruct junior Paſtors, to reprove, admoniſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we reſiſt not: And ſo if Godly Dioceſans will become Arch-biſhops only of this ſort, and promote o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r work inſtead of hindering it, we ſhall ſubmit, though we cannot Swear approbation, it being a thing that Chriſtian Miniſters may doubt of, and no Article of our Creed.</p>
            <p>12. And if the King do cumulate wealth and honour on them, and give them their place in Parliaments, to keep the Clergy from contempt, yea, or truſt any of them under him as Magiſtrates with the Sword, whether we like it or not, we ſhall peaceably ſubmit, and obey them as Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>13. And if for order ſake theſe Dioceſans ſhould have a negative voice (unleſs in caſes of forfeiture or neceſſity) in the ordination of Miniſters to the Church univerſal, not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the power of particular Churches to chooſe, or at leaſt freely conſent or diſſent, as to the fixing of Paſtors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, we would ſubmit to all this for common peace. Specially if the Magiſtrate only chooſe men to Benefices and Magiſtracies, and none had the Paſtoral power of the Keyes, but by the Election of the Clergy and the peoples conſent, which was the judgment and practice of the univerſal Church, from the beginning of Epiſcopacy till of late.</p>
            <p>14. And laſtly we hold the Magiſtrate the only Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by the Sword, as well of Paſtors as of Phyſicians and all
<pb facs="tcp:61252:7"/>
others: And though he may not take the work of our proper calling out of our hands no more than the Phyſicians, yet he may (by juſtice and diſcretion) puniſh us for male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and drive us to our duty, though not hinder us from it; And we conſent to do all under his Government: Judge now whether we ſet up Popes or Tyrants.</p>
            <p>By all this it is apparent that it is none of the deſigne of this Treatiſe to overthrow or weaken the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but to ſtrengthen and ſecure it againſt all its notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dangers. 1. By reforming thoſe things, which elſe undoubtedly will cauſe a ſucceſſion of diſſenters in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, though all we the preſent Nonconformiſts are quickly like to be paſt troubling them, or being troubled by them, even of themſelves many will turne upon the ſame reaſons which have convinced us. 2. By uniting all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and turning their odious wrath and contentions, into a reverence of their Paſtors, and into mutual Love and help.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe being haſtened in three preſſes ſince Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> ſent me his Letter that required it, I have not time to gather the Printers Errata, but muſt leave them to the diſcretion of the Reader. Only for [<hi>Engliſh Prelacy</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Chapter and in many other places ſhould be [<hi>The deſcribed Prelacy</hi>].</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> The Reaſons of this Writing.</head>
               <p>I Am not ignorant how diſpleaſing it will be to the Prelates, that I publiſh theſe Reaſons of my Nonconformity to the Subſcriptions and Oaths by which they would have me become an obliged Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of their Function. Nor am I ignorant what Power, Wit and Will they have to expreſs and exerciſe their diſpleaſure: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, how probable it is that I ſhall ſuffer by them for this work. And I well know that peaceable ſubjects ſhould not unneceſſarily ſay any thing againſt that which is required by their Rulers Laws, nor cheriſh the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples diſcontents, but do all that is lawful for the common Peace: And I am not of ſo pugnacious or ſelf-hating a diſpoſition, as to be willing of mens diſpleaſure, eſpecially my Superiours, or to be ruined in this World, and all that I may but vent my Opinion, in a caſe wherein I have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already ſo much that is ſtill unanſwered, as in my Diſputations of Church-Government is to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61252:12"/>And upon ſuch Reaſons (but above all, that I might not caſt away my opportunity for ſome more uſeful writings, nor put an end to my own labours before God put an end to them) I have been ſilent in this Cauſe ſince our publick debates in 1661, above ten years. I have lived peaceably; I have endeavoured to preſerve the due reputation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtry, and to perſwade all others to due ſubjection, love and quietneſs: I have by Word and Writing oppoſed the Principles of ſuch as are exaſperated by their ſufferings into the Dividing and Separating extream; Though I knew, that by ſo doing, I was like to incur the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſur and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of the Separatiſts, as much as I had before of the Prelates, (though not to ſuffer ſo much by them.) And I thought that the Prelates themſelves who would not underſtand the true ſtate of the People, nor the tendency of their way, by our informations, and evident Reaſons, might yet come in time to know all by experience, and ſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what they have done amiſs.</p>
               <p>But now I dare be no longer ſilent for the Reaſons given <hi>Apol. ch.</hi> 1. which I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y to ſum up. 1. I find that experience it ſelf doth not Teach ſome men, but Harden them.</p>
               <p>2. I perceive that thoſe that are now convinced by experience, and wiſh they had taken another courſe, and rather have united the Miniſtry, than ſilenced them, are not able to undo what they have done, nor to amend what is done amiſs, much leſs to retrieve all the doleful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; but the matter is gone out of their hands and beyond their power.</p>
               <p>3. I ſee that while we wait, the Devil's work goeth on, by the ſilence and by the Diviſions of the Miniſters: Popery greatly increaſeth; Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers multiply; Atheiſm and Infidelity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faced among thoſe that are accounted men of reputation: Malice, and bitter hatred of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with common backbitings, cenſurings and ſlanders, inſtead of ſweet Love and Concord, do notoriouſly encreaſe. Thouſands are every day committing theſe ſins, to the increaſe of their guilt, and the haſtening of Gods judgments on the Land: The ſufferers call the Prelates perſecuters, and wolves in ſheeps cloathings, who are known by their fruits, their teeth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>laws. The Prelatiſts ſtill ſay that the Nonconformiſts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, diſcontented, peeviſh, factious, unpeaceable, unruly ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; that will rather ſee all confounded than they will yield to things indifferent. And ſhall we ſtill ſtand by, and ſilently ſee this work go on?</p>
               <p>4. And to love and defend Truth, Honeſty and Innocency is to be like to God. It is pity that thoſe that Chriſt hath done ſo much to juſtifie, and will ſo gloriouſly juſtifie at the laſt, ſhould have nothing ſaid on their behalf by men. But we are much more obliged to juſtifie a righteous cauſe, than righteous men; For all men have ſomewhat that is unjuſtifiable, but ſo hath not the truth of God.</p>
               <p>5. And he that in his Baptiſmal Covenant is engaged againſt the Fleſh, the World and the Devil, ſhould be loath to ſee all their work go on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61252:12"/>
and not oppoſe it; and to ſee, that which he taketh to be no better than deliberate Lying, or Juſtifying ſin, and Perjury it ſelf, and covenanting never to obey God in lawful and neceſſary Church-reformation, to be all called; Things indifferent.</p>
               <p>6. Nature and Scripture teach us to have a due and moderate regard of our own reputation as men; but much more as Miniſters of Chriſt; ſeeing the doctrine of Chriſt which we preach or write, is uſually diſhonoured in the Miniſters diſhonour and the edification of the ſouls of them that hear us or read our writings, is greatly hindered by it.</p>
               <p>7. While Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen, conformable Clergy men, and many others of all Ranks, are poſſeſſed with theſe thoughts of us, that we are perſons who hypocritically pretend to Godlineſs, while indeed we are ſo humourſome, that we will forbear our Miniſtry, and our Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſuffer any thing, and divide the Church, rather than yield to indifferent things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a ſcandal, a grievous ſcandal, either given or taken, and tendeth to wrong their ſouls that are ſcandalized: And if we give them this ſcandal, it is our heinous ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if they take it by miſinformation, we are obliged to do our part to heal it: Souls are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and ſcandal doth endanger them, even to diſtaſt Religion it ſelf, for the ſakes of ſuch as they take us to be: And we must not ſtand by and ſee men periſh, if we can do any thing to ſave them.</p>
               <p>8. The ſufferings of many of the Miniſters are very great, that have not bread for their children, nor cloaths to cover them, and are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make known their wants: And if with all this, we ſuffer the burden of unreproved calumny to lie on them, and keep them not to the neceſſary comfort which conſcience ſhould find in ſufferings with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, we ſhall be guilty of uncharitableneſs our ſelves.</p>
               <p>9. It is part of our Honouring the King and Parliament and other Magiſtrates, not to deſpiſe or ſlight their cenſures: And the judgment which they have publickly paſſed on us, in an Act of Confinement, which impoſeth the Oath for Prelacy, is ſo hard and grievous, that if we are guilty, it is fit we ſhould be made the common reproach of men; And if we are not, (as Non-conformiſts) it is our duty to rectifie the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſuperiours where they are miſinformed. And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that no good Chriſtian ſhould be patient under an imputation of Hereſie; ſo I may ſay that no good Subject ſhould be ſenſleſly patient under an imputation of diſloyalty and ſedition: That better beſeemeth the anarchical and truly diſloyal and ſeditious, who take it for no crime.</p>
               <p>10. And we know how pleaſantly the Papiſts inſult to hear us ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized for Villains and ſeditious Perſons by our brethren, and what uſe they will make of it at preſent and in future Hiſtory to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their malice, and injury to the truth: which we ought not ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtill to ſuffer; while we ſee how hereby they do already multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61252:13"/>11. And how unlikely ſoever it be, it is not impoſſible, that our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, that at once depoſed and ſilenced about 1800. Miniſters of Chriſt, when they ſee what Reaſons we have for our Non-conformity, may be moved to reſtore thoſe that yet ſurvive: And then how many thouſand ſouls would have the joy and benefit?</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, Truth and the juſt information of Poſterity, is a thing exceedingly deſirable to ingenuous minds: It is a great trouble to think that the Ages to come, ſhould be injured by falſe Hiſtory. Therefore we muſt do our beſt, that they may but truly know our Caſe; and then let them judge of the Perſons and Actions of this our Age, as they ſhall find Cauſe, when Truth is opened to-them.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe Reaſons, though to my own great labour, and to the greater contradiction of my natural love of ſilent quietneſs, and to the probable incurring of mens diſpleaſure, I take it to be my duty to give my <hi>Superlours, Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Poſterity,</hi> a true Account of the Reaſons which have moved my ſelf and others of my mind, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Subſcribe and Swear to the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dioceſan Prelacy: Committing my Life and Liberty to the pleaſure of God, in obedience to whom I have both refuſed to Conform, and written theſe Reaſons of my Non-conformity.</p>

               <p>IT being not Epiſcopacy in General, but (the Popiſh and) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Species of Prelacy, which our Judgments cannot approve, and which we cannot ſwear to as approvers, it is neceſſary that we tell ſtrangers, what this Prelacy is, that the ſubject of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie be not unknown, or miſunderſtood. But the ſubject is ſo large, that the very naming of the parts of our Eccleſiaſtical Government, in Tables by Dr. <hi>Ri. Coſins,</hi> maketh up a Volume in 16 Tables, and many hundred branches. Which being written in <hi>Latin</hi> I muſt refer the Foreign Reader to it; Not at all for the underſtanding of our Practice, but only of our Rule, or Laws with our Church-Conſtitution: ſeeing it would take up a conſiderable Volume to open but one half of his Scheme. All that I ſhall now do is to give you this brief Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That in <hi>England</hi> there are 26 or 27 Biſhopricks: of which two are Archbiſhops: In all theſe ſet together there was when <hi>Speed</hi> numbred them, nine thouſand ſeven hundred twenty five Pariſh Churches, but now many more. In the Dioceſs that I live in (<hi>Lincoln</hi>) there is above a 1000 or 1100. In very many of theſe Pariſhes, beſides the Pariſh-Churches, there are Chapels, that have Curates, in ſome Pariſhes one Chapel, in ſome two, in ſome three, if not more. In theſe Pariſhes the number of Inhabitants is various, as they are greater or leſſer: The greateſt about <hi>London,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Stepny, Giles-Cripplegate, Sepulchres, Martins, &amp;c.</hi> have ſome about 50000 perſons, (ſome ſay much more) ſome about 30000, ſome about 20000, &amp;c. But ordinarily in Cities and Market-Towns through the Country, the number is about 2000, or 3000, or 4000, or 5000 at the moſt, except <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſome few great Pariſhes that have far more. And in Villages, in ſome 2000, in ſome 1000, in ſome ſmall ones 500, or 300, or in ſome very ſmall ones fewer. There are in <hi>England</hi> 641 Market-Towns (ſaith <hi>Speed</hi>) which are of the greater ſort of Pariſhes, and ſuch as in old times were called Cities, though now a few have got that title; at leaſt a great number of them are equal, and ſome much greater and richer than ſome that now are named Cities. The Dioceſs that I live in is about ſix-ſcore Miles in length. By all this you may conjecture how many hundred thouſand ſouls are in ſome Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and at what a diſtance from each other: and what perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61252:14"/>
it is that they are capable of: I my ſelf who have travelled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver moſt of <hi>England</hi> never ſaw the face or heard the name of one Perſon (I think) of many thouſands in the Dioceſs that I live in: Nor have we any other Communion with the reſt of the Dioceſs (even with above a thouſand Pariſhes in it) than we have with the People of any other Church or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the land about us, ſave that <hi>One</hi> Biſhop and his Chancellor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers, are over us all.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates Civil Governmeut of the Church I ſhall not meddle with, as having no exceptions againſt it. The Sacerdotal or Spiritual Power, called the Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> determineth who ſhall be Members of the Church, and partake of its Communion, and exerciſeth other acts of Spiritual Diſcipline, of which more anon. This power is ſaid to be in Archbiſhops and Biſhops <hi>in foro eccleſiae publico vel exteriore,</hi> though alſo in the Governed Presbyters, <hi>in foro privato interiore,</hi> as they may privately comfort a penitent perſon, and declare God's promiſe of the pardon of his ſin. [<note n="a" place="margin">Coſins Tab. 3.</note>] The Archbiſhops have it in eminency: As alſo the power of confirming the Election of the Biſhops of their Provinces; and the power of Conſecrating Biſhops with two others: and the power of Convocating Provincial Synods upon the Kings Preſcript; and of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in them. The power of receiving Appeals, and of Viſiting the whole Provinces: yea to receive Appeals from the lower Judges, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the middle ones; and to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in any vacant Dioceſs under them. They have [<note n="b" place="margin">Coſins Tab. 4.</note>] power of Diſpenſation in all Cauſes (not judged contrary to Gods word) wherever the Pope had power; and where the Pope had not power, if the King or Council per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it them. They may diſpenſe with the Eating of fleſh on Faſting-days, with Marrying without previous publication; with divers irregularities, and ſometime may aboliſh <hi>ſimoniacum ambitum.</hi> They may grant Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, and Diſpence with Non-reſidence, and with the keeping of divers Churches called Benefices, in ſeveral Caſes, and with a Sons ſucceeding his Father, and with Lay-mens poſſeſſing the Church-maintenance, called Prebends.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops (who take place in Parliament of other Barons, as the Archbiſhops do of Dukes) [<note n="c" place="margin">Coſins Tab. 5.</note>] are all choſen really by the King, who nominateth in a Writ to the Dean and Chapter the man whom they muſt chuſe; who <hi>pro forma</hi> do chuſe him, never contradicting the Kings Nomination.</p>
               <p>Their proper Office conſiſteth in the powers of <hi>Order</hi> and of <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (as they diſtinguiſh them:) Their power of Order is threefold, 1. To Ordain Prieſts and Deacons. 2. To Conſecrate Churches and Burying pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; 3. To Confirm Children after Baptiſm, when they can ſpeak and ſay the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue, and others that were not Confirmed in their Childhood. Beſides, that they may be Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, Lord-Keepers of the Great Seal, Lord Treaſurers, Embaſſadours, &amp;c. Their ordinary Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction extendeth, 1. to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61252:14"/>
of Divine Offices; 2. to publick Admonitions and Penances, 3. to ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, and from ingreſs into the Church, and 4. to Excommunication and Abſolution, and 5. to Anathematiſms. And as to Miniſters, 1. They may Sequeſter Benefices. 2. They may Suſpend <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio,</hi> and forbid them to Preach or Pray; Or grant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to ſuch as ſhall be tolerated to Preach. 3. They may deprive; 4. And depoſe Miniſters by <hi>ſentence</hi> verbal, and <hi>degradation</hi> actually.</p>
               <p>This Church Juriſdiction of Biſhops is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Voluntary</hi> and <hi>Contentious;</hi> [<note n="d" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 6.</note>] The Voluntary extendeth to abundance of things grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by Statute, and by Common Law, which I paſs by: That which they claim both by Municipal Law and Eccleſiaſtical, is, 1. The probate of the Teſtaments of the dead; 2. The granting Adminiſtration of Goods to the next of Kin, 3. Keeping the <hi>bona caduca</hi> where none claimeth the Inheritance, 4. To receive Reaſons of Adminiſtring, and to be Judges of them. 5. To confer Benefices, or Inſtitute ſuch as others preſent. 6. To grant Induction to the Inſtituted. 7. To receive the Fruits of vacant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. 8. To allow the Vicar a fit proportion. 9. To grant Letters Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory, or Teſtimonial. 10. To Viſit their Dioceſs once in three years. In which Triennial Viſitation, they uſually go to one Town in a County, (and never ſee the face of the people in the many ſcore or hundred Churches about them;) and thither they ſummon the Miniſters, and the Church-Wardens and Sides-men; Where one Miniſter preacheth, and then the Miniſters muſt dine with the Biſhop; and in Court he (or his Officer) giveth a Book of Printed Articles, containing a multitude of particulars, which the Church-warden muſt ſwear to preſent by, where becauſe of the <hi>quality</hi> of them ſome Church-Wardens refuſe, and others becauſe of the number; ſome ſaying it is <hi>unlawful</hi> to undo their Miniſters and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by ſuch Preſentments (as for omitting a Ceremony, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or keeping a Faſt in private, &amp;c.) and ſome ſaying it is impoſſible to keep the Oath, and ſome ſaying that if they do it, they ſhall be hated of their Neighbours: Whereupon thoſe that refuſe are proſecuted to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And the reſt take the Oath and Articles; but not one of many doth preſent accordingly; though the Canon enquires after the perjured. And many that fear perjury or perſecution themſelves, do hire ſome poor man to be Church-Warden in their ſtead, that will venture upon all. I muſt intreat the Reader to peruſe ſome of their Books of Articles (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wrens</hi>) to ſee what was then enquired after.

               <p>This Juriſdiction of Biſhops is exerciſed either Univerſally by a Vicar General, uſually a Lay-man; or qarticularly by a Commiſſary. [<note n="e" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 2.</note>] And when he pleaſe the Biſhop may do it himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61252:15"/>The other part of their Juriſdiction is called Contentious; And here the Biſhop may himſelf judge in ſome Caſes <note n="f" place="margin">Coſ.

This Chancellor keepeth an Ordinary Court, in the form of a Civil Court, where are Advocates for Council, and Proctors for pleading: <note n="g" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 2. &amp; Tab. 8.</note> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men called Apparitors (whoſe name is commonly a ſcorn among the people,) do from abroad the Country bring them in Accuſations, and Summon the perſons accuſed; beſides thoſe that by Plaintiffs are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. Here are judged Cauſes about Church Materials, and Cauſes Criminal; which he that readeth the whole Book of Canons and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation Articles may ſee, they being too many for me to recite. <note n="h" place="margin">Coſ. ibid.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a multitude of Caſes about Marriages (to be contracted, diſſolved, ſeparation) and Teſtaments, and the Goods of Inteſtate perſons. <note n="i" place="margin">Coſ. ibid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Prieſts, Deacons and Lay-men are judged in theſe Courts; The final conſtraining penalty is Excommunication, or before that Suſpenſion, and other degrees of Church puniſhment before mentioned as belonging to the Biſhop: The ſuppoſed offenders are no otherwiſe dealt with to bring them to true Repentance, than as in Civil Courts by other Lay-Judges. They that appear not, and they that pay not the Fees of the Court and Officers, are Excommunicate, and they that obey not the Orders of the Court. In Excommunications and Abſolutions the Lay-Chancellor is Judg, but he writeth the Decree in the Biſhops name: And (at leaſt ſometimes) <hi>pro formâ,</hi> ſome Prieſt or other is procured to be preſent (no Biſhop,) to utter the Sentence which the Lay Judge Decreeth: This Sentence is ſent by the Chancellor to the Miniſter of the Pariſh where the offender liveth, who muſt publiſh it in the Church openly (as the Cryer doth the Kings Proclamation;) But if it be the Miniſter himſelf that is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, another Miniſter readeth it. The whole proceſs of their Judicial Tryals, Sentences and Executions you may ſee in <hi>Coſin's, Tab.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Chancellor's Courts (called the Biſhops) the Archdeacons have certain inferiour Courts, where they enquire after faults, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the great ones to the Biſhops Courts. <note n="k" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 2.</note> And they Induct or give poſſeſſion of Benefices.</p>
               <p>As for the Pariſh Prieſts or Miniſters, ordinary Pariſhes have but one to each; but Great Pariſhes cannot be ſerved (as they call it) without a Curate; and each Chapel hath a Curate; but all under <hi>One,</hi> that hath the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61252:15"/>
ſole poſſeſſion of the Benefice, whether he be Parſon or Vicar. Theſe Prieſts are Ordained by the Biſhop (ſome one, two, or three Presbyters if preſent alſo impoſing hands:) They are choſen to the Church and Benefice by the Patron who preſents them to the Biſhop; who giveth them Inſtitution for Title, and Induction for poſſeſſion. When he is Ordained, Inſtituted and Inducted, he muſt not Preach to his People, till he hath got a <note n="l" place="margin">Act of Uniform.</note> Licenſe from the Biſhop of that Dioceſs; no though he were before Licenſed in another Dioceſs: Nor muſt he Preach or Officiate, or have any Benefice or Church, till he have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,<note place="margin">That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſts have no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, ſee Dr. Zouch; as alſo that the King is the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Supream.</note> and done as is expreſſed in the Act of Uniformity: And he muſt declare his Aſſent and Conſent to all things contained in and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by three Books (the Liturgy, the Book of Ordination, and the Articles.) And he muſt ſwear obedience to his Biſhop.</p>
               <p>His Office is (when after Licenſed) to Preach, to Read the Scriptures, and the Apocrypha, and many Acts of Parliament, and Homilies, to read the Liturgy or Prayers; To give notice of Holy-days and Faſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days: To Baptize all Children, without exception, that are offered him, by Godfathers and Godmothers (the Parents not Covenanting for them, but others;) To Marry perſons; To Church Women after Child bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; To hear Children in Church ſay the Catechiſm that is in the Liturgy (but many have been forbidden by the Biſhops to expound it, or tell the Children the meaning of the words which they ſay by rote:) To celebrate and give the Sacrament to the Pariſhioners: To viſit the Sick, and abſolve them, if they ſay they repent: To bury the Dead, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of them all that God in mercy hath taken their ſouls, as our dear brethren, to himſelf; excepting only, 1. Thoſe that die unbaptized (though Children of Princes or godly Parents) 2. Thoſe that are Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate (uſually ſuch as durſt not Conform to them:) 3. And thoſe that kill themſelves (though in a Frenſie:) To uſe the Croſs, Surplice, and other Ceremonies of the Church: And to joyn with the Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens (if they pleaſe) in preſenting ſuch to the Biſhops Courts, as break their Laws; And if he deny any notorious offender the Sacrament, he muſt become his Accuſer before the Chancellour, or Biſhops Court. <note n="m" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 13.</note> This is the Office of a Pariſh Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Where you muſt note 1. in <hi>general,</hi> that he hath no <hi>Judicial Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration in the Church:</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Coſ. Tab. 11.</note> They ordinarily ſay, that he hath no <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> but meer <hi>Prieſtly Orders;</hi> As if they knew not that <hi>Prieſtly Order</hi> is nothing but the Sacred Office; and that that Office is the Power of the Keys, or eſſentially containeth the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Guiding</hi> the <hi>Flock</hi> in <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Worſhip</hi> and Diſcipline, under Chriſt the Chief Prophet, Prieſt and King. Civil Juriſdiction over the Church is the Kings, and Spiritual is part of the Prieſtly Office or Order (as to the ſubject people to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.)</p>
               <p>2. Particularly note, 1. that the Miniſter hath in <hi>England</hi> no power to Judge whom to Baptize, and whom not, but muſt Baptize all that are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61252:16"/>
offered, though the Children of Jews, Infidels, Turks, Apoſtates.</p>
               <p>2. That he hath no power to hinder the admiſſion of any ſo baptized, into the ſtate of adult Members by the Biſhops Confirmation. For though it be ſaid Children ſhall bring his Certificate, that they can ſay the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, yet 1. thoſe Children may go without it, and do ordinarily: When I was confirmed my ſelf, none was required, nor did I ever ſee any given. 2. And if it were, the poor Children ſeldom underſtand any thing that they ſay, or much. 3. There is not one of multitudes in our Churches that ever ſought or minded ſuch Confirmation, becauſe of its abuſe.</p>
               <p>3. That he hath no power to hinder any confirmed, or adult perſons from the Sacraments, on the account of the groſſeſt ignorance or infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: when multitudes among us know not what the Sacrament is, nor know the eſſentials of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>4. He hath no power to convent any open offender before him, to call him to repentance: They may chuſe to come to him, or to open their doors to him, or ſpeak to him, if he come to them.</p>
               <p>5. He hath no power to call them to Repentance openly before the Church, or pray by name for their Repentance; or admoniſh them.</p>
               <p>6. He hath no power to judge any perſon to be Excommunicate.</p>
               <p>7. Nor to abſolve any that is penitent after Excommunication; But only to read the Lay-Chancellours ſentences, ſent him in the Biſhops name.</p>
               <p>8. He hath no power to forbear giving the Lords Supper to any one how notorious an offender ſoever, unleſs he will proſecute him at the Biſhops Court, nor then, but for once: So that if he pay his Fees and be Abſolved there, though the Miniſter know him to be never ſo bad, he muſt give the Sacrament the next time. And the proſecution is ſo odious and fruitleſs that I never knew any do it, except againſt the Nonconformiſts.</p>
               <p>9. He that ſeeth never ſo great ſigns of Impenitency in any man that is ſick, or will but ſay that he is ſick, hath no power to deny him private Abſolution and the Sacrament, if he do but ſay, I Repent.</p>
               <p>10. He hath no power to forbear pronouncing of all Traytors, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, Adulterers, Perjured, Atheiſts, &amp;c. that never profeſt Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, at their Burial, that <hi>God hath of his mercy taken to himſelf the ſoul of this our dear brother;</hi> except the unbaptized, &amp;c. aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And note, 1. that the Pariſh Prieſt hath no power to do theſe things ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelf, or in conjunction with the Biſhop, or any other.</p>
               <p>2. And that there is not one Suffragan Biſhop or Chorepiſcopus in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> under the 26 Biſhops, to do any part of their work in theſe 97025 Pariſhes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Our Judgment of the Hiſtory of the Antient Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the riſe of the Dioceſan Prelacy.</head>
               <p>I Shall anon ſhew more fully, that there are two things eſpecially in which we think the very <hi>Species</hi> of our Dioceſan Prelacy to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the antient Epiſcopacy. One is in the Extent of their Office, as to their ſubject Charge, a Biſhop <hi>infimae ſpeciei,</hi> of the loweſt <hi>ſpecies,</hi> having then but <hi>One Church,</hi> and now a Biſhop <hi>infimae ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciei</hi> having many hundred Churches made into one, or nullified to make One. 2. In the <hi>Work</hi> of their Office, which was then purely Spiritual or Paſtoral, and is now mixt of Magiſtratical and Miniſterial, exerciſed by mixed Officers in Courts much like to Civil Judicatures. The Hiſtory of their riſe I ſuppoſe is this.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt made a difference among his Miniſters himſelf, while he choſe twelve to be Apoſtles, and ſpecial Witneſſes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his Doctrine, Life, and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and to be the Founders of his Church, and the Publiſhers of his Goſpel abroad the World.</p>
               <p>2. As theſe Apoſtles preached the Goſpel themſelves, and planted Churches, ſo did many others as their helpers, partly the ſeventy ſent by Chriſt, and partly called by the Apoſtles themſelves; And all theſe exerciſed indefinitely a preparing Miniſtry, before particular Churches were gathered abroad the World, and afterwards went on in gathering and calling more.</p>
               <p>3. Beſides this preparing unfixed Miniſtration, the ſame Apoſtles alſo<note place="margin">Acts 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5.</note> placed, by the peoples conſent, particular fixed Miniſters over all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches which they gathered.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe <hi>fixed Miniſters</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> they named indifferently, Biſhops, Elders, Paſtors and Teachers. Whereas thoſe of the ſame Office in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral yet unfixed, are called either by the General name of <hi>Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or <hi>Stewards of his Myſteries;</hi> And in regard of their ſpecial works, ſome were called Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>5. Theſe Apoſtles though unfixed and having an Indefinite charge, yet went not all one way, but as God's Spirit and prudence guided them, they diſperſed themſelves into ſeveral parts of the World.</p>
               <p>6. But as they did many of them firſt ſtay long at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in planting and ſetling Churches, they ſometimes ſtayed ſeveral months or years in one place, and then went to another. And ſo did the Evangeliſts or Indefinite Aſſiſtants whom they ſent forth on the ſame work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61252:17"/>7. While they ſtayed in theſe newly planted Churches they were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the chief Guides of the People: And alſo of their fixed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>8. This abode in ſettling the particular Churches and their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Biſhops or Elders, occaſioned Hiſtorians, afterward to call both A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Evangeliſts (ſuch as <hi>Timothy, Titus, Silas, Silvanus, Luke, Apollo, &amp;c.</hi>) the Biſhops of thoſe Churches; though they were not ſuch as the fixed Biſhops were, who undertook a ſpecial Charge and care of one particular Church alone, or above all other Churches.</p>
               <p>9. On this account the ſame Apoſtle is ſaid to be the firſt Biſhop of many Churches; (as <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Rome; Paul</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus Philippi, &amp;c.</hi>) When indeed the Apoſtles were the particular fixed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of no Churches, but the Biſhops equally of many, as a ſort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed Epiſcopacy is included in Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>10. On this account alſo it is that <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to be Biſhop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> becauſe he was left there for a time to ſettle that and other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia</hi> near it, as an Aſſiſtant of the Apoſtles: And ſo <hi>Titus</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Biſhop of <hi>Crete,</hi> becauſe he ſtaid in that Iſland (which was ſaid to have an hundred Cities) on this work, which belonged not to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Biſhop, but to the more indefinite Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>11. How many ſuch fixed Biſhops, Elders, Paſtors, or Teachers, each particular Church muſt have, the Apoſtles never determined by a Law: But did <hi>de facto</hi> ſettle them according to the number of ſouls, and ſtore of qualified perſons: In ſome Churches it is poſſible there might be but one (with Deacons:) In others it is evident that there were many; as at <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. The particular Churches which were the charge of theſe fixed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Elders were Societies of Chriſtians conjoyned for <hi>Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in God's Worſhip, and mutual aſſiſtance in holy living:</hi> And though for want of convenient room, or liberty, they did not always meet all in the ſame place, yet were they ordinarily no more than <hi>could</hi> meet in one place when they had liberty: and never more than could hold <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion,</hi> if not at once, yet at ſeveral times in publick worſhip: (As it is now in thoſe places where one part of the Family goeth to Church one part of the day, and another on the other part.) And thoſe by-Meetings which any had that came not conſtantly to the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, were but as our Houſe-Meetings, or Chapel-Meetings, but never as another Church: Nor were their Churches more numerous than our Pariſhes, nor near ſo great.</p>
               <p>13. At the firſt they had no Conſecrated nor Separated places for their Church-Meetings, but Houſes or Fields, as neceſſity and opportunity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them. But as ſoon as they could, even nature taught them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame appointed and ſtated places for ſuch Aſſemblies: Which as ſoon as the Churches had peace and ſettlement, they appropriated to thoſe ſacred uſes only, though they had not yet the ſhape or name of Temples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61252:17"/>14. Though the Paſtors of the Church were all of one <hi>Office,</hi> now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Order,</hi> being all ſubordinate Miniſters of Chriſt, in the Prophetical, Prieſtly and Regal parts of his Office, in the Power and Duty of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Worſhiping and Government; yet was the diſparity of Age, Grace and Guifts to be obſerved among them, and the younger Paſtors (as well as people) owed a meet reverence and ſubmiſſion to the Elder, and the weaker to the ſtronger who had notoriouſly more of God's Grace and Guifts. So that in a Church where there were many Paſtors it was not unlawful nor unneceſſary, to acknowledge this diſparity, and for the younger and weaker to ſubmit much to the judgment of the elder and more able.</p>
               <p>15. While they kept only to the exerciſe of the meer Paſtoral work of Teaching, and Worſhiping, and that Government which belongeth hereunto, they had little temptation (comparatively) to ſtrive for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in Rule, or for a Negative Voice; But aliene or accidental work, did further that as followeth.</p>
               <p>16. The Apoſtles did reprove thoſe Worldly contentious and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Chriſtians, who went to Law before Heathen Judges: And the thing ſhewed ſo little of the Chriſtian Spirit of Love, and was alſo of ſo ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, by ſcandals and diſſentions, that it was worthy to be reproved, eſpecially in Chriſtians that were perſecuted by thoſe Magiſtrates. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almoſt all the differences of Chriſtians were neceſſarily decided by Arbitration: And none were thought ſo fit to be the Arbitrators, as the Elders or Paſtors of the Churches. By which it came to paſs, that where Churches were great, and the ceaſing of perſecution (which came but as ſtorms that paſſed away) did reſtore that peace which cheriſhed diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the work of the Elders in theſe Arbitrations, was not ſmall; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as added to their greater proper Office-work.</p>
               <p>17. At the ſame time many Hereſies aroſe, which occaſioned Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Churches, and ſometimes among the Officers themſelves.</p>
               <p>18. And the Miniſters being, though holy, yet imperfect, as well as other Chriſtians, the remnants of ſelf-conceitedneſs and pride, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned alſo the trouble of the Churches: For when the Apoſtles themſelves while Chriſt was with them ſtrove who ſhould be the Greateſt, and have the higheſt place, it is no wonder if they did ſo afterward, who had not ſo great a meaſure of Grace as they.</p>
               <p>19. Beſides all this, when the Apoſtolical Virtues ceaſed, there were few Philoſophers or Learned men that turned Chriſtians, and few that had excellent Gifts of Oratory, fit to be Teachers of the Churches; And the moſt of the Elders were good men but of inferiour parts; Like the better ſort of our unlearned godly Chriſtians. By which means it came to paſs, that ſome one of the Clergy in every Church, (when there were many) having ſo much Knowledge, and Oratory as to overtop the reſt, he was ordinarily more eſteemed than the reſt.</p>
               <p>20. By theſe four means conjunct it quickly came to paſs, that in every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61252:18"/>
Church that had many Elders, ſome one was choſen by the reſt and by the people, to be the chief, and to have ſome ſpecial power of Church affairs: And 1. In caſes of frequent Arbitration, there ſeemed a kind of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſome One be Umpire: For if half go one way and half the other, there can be no end: 2. And in caſe of Hereſies and different Opinions in Religion, if One had not in each Church ſome deciding, over-ruling power, or Negative Voice, it is no wonder if Diviſions were the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier prevented, and the Churches Unity hardly kept. 3. And eſpecially when ſome <hi>One</hi> was really <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>abler</hi> than the reſt, it was thought but ſuitable to Nature, that he rather ruled the juniors and weaker ſort, than that their Votes ſhould rule him, or rule without him. 4. And when all men have too much ſelf-love and Pride, which enclineth them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire pre-eminence, and maketh them judge too high of themſelves, it was thought ſafer for all the Clergy and People, to judge who among them was really the beſt and wiſeſt man, than to leave every man to be judge of himſelf and of the reſt: For ſo it was too likely that every man would think himſelf the wiſeſt. Therefore one was choſen as ſuppoſed by others (even by the whole Church) as the fitteſt man to have a deciding and overſeeing power among the reſt, to avoid contention, which their own ſtrife about pre-eminence would cauſe.</p>
               <p>21. And there was a fifth cauſe, which was not much leſs than any of the reſt: which was, that often through the ſcarcity of fit perſons, One man was firſt ſettled over a new-gathered Church, before any others could be had to joyn with him. And therefore he being there firſt alone, and that in ſole power, it was thought unfit that any that came after him, ſhould come in without his conſent or Ordination, becauſe he was the ſole Governour; ſo that, 1. becauſe they came <hi>after</hi> him, 2. and that by his <hi>Will,</hi> if not Ordination, it muſt needs follow that he would uſually have the pre-eminence. As it is now among us, where the Rector of the Pariſh where there are divers Chapels, chuſing his Curates, who are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his Juniors, he is conſtantly of greater power than they, and ruleth them accidentally, though his Office be the ſame as theirs.</p>
               <p>22. As by theſe means one Paſtor got a pre-eminence of eſteem and power above the reſt, ſo in a ſhort time he got the title of <hi>Epiſcopus,</hi> Biſhop, to be appropriated to himſelf alone, leaving the name of Elders, and Paſtors, and Prieſts unto the reſt in common with himſelf: For he was now become the prime Overſeer of the whole Church, both people and Elders.</p>
               <p>23. Our own experience ſheweth us how it came to paſs, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves not only conſented to all this, but alſo deſired and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: (eſpecially then when the effects of Clergy-ambition had not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to the World:) For even now when a great Pariſh can get one Learned able Paſtor, they ſay, we will allow you ſo much, but your Curates muſt take leſs: And they will not endure that the young and weak Curates, have either equal maintenance, or equal honour or power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61252:18"/>
over them, as the chief Paſtor of the Pariſh hath; ſo that the people themſelves are againſt an equality of power, where there is not an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of worth.</p>
               <p>24. Though we cannot prove that this fixed Epiſcopacy was either ſet up by the Apoſtles, or countenanced by them, nor yet that it was begun and in being in their days; yet it could not be long after their days that it begun; And if <hi>Hierome</hi> miſtake not, it began at <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſome years before the death of St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>25. All this while the Biſhop was not ſuppoſed to be of a diſtinct Office, or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Miniſtry, (now called <hi>An Order</hi>) but only an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer and chief of perſons in the ſame Office with him; being in common with the reſt, <hi>Epiſcopus plebis,</hi> and extraordinarily, <hi>Epiſcopus Cleri vel E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoporum ſeu Presbyterorum.</hi> As one of the Monks is made Abbot in a Monaſtery, or as one Juſtice among many is of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> or one Judge on the Bench is the chief Juſtice: Or as the Preſident in an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick College.</p>
               <p>26. The chief thing in which a ſpecial power was given to the Biſhops above their fellow Presbyters was in <hi>Ordination,</hi> that none ſhould be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without them; It being a matter of exceeding great conſequence to the Churches, what Miniſters were ſet over them, and therefore put chiefly in the power of theſe choſen men. And the next part of their power was in having the chief diſpoſal of all Church affairs, as our Pariſh Paſtors have now among their Curates: ſo that nothing was to be done in the Church without and againſt their conſent and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>27. This Epiſcopacy did ſo univerſally obtain, that I remember not to have read of any ſort of Chriſtians, Orthodox or Heretical, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Schiſmatical, who ever refuſed it, or ſpake againſt it, till <hi>Aerius</hi>'s time. And even he ſpake not againſt it as flatly unlawful, but as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as far as I can gather from <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And after him all ſorts and Sects of Chriſtians ſtill owned it: Even the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> who had their Biſhops as well as others.</p>
               <p>28. In Scripture times we read not of any meer fixed Biſhops of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, who Ordained either Biſhops or Presbyters; but only Apoſtles and their unfixed Aſſiſtants, who had an equal charge of many Churches. Not that the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Indefinite unfixed</hi> Miniſtry was not the ſame with the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>fixed</hi> Biſhops <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> (For both had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do all the Miniſterial work, as they had a call and opportunity to exerciſe it.) But becauſe it being the employment, of the Indefinite or unfixed Miniſters to Gather and plant Churches, before they could be Governed, the Ordination of Elders over them, was part of the planting of them; and ſo fell to their lot, as part of their conſtituting work.</p>
               <p>29. How it came to paſs that the Itinerant or Indefinite exerciſe of the Miniſtry for planting Churches, ſo quickly almoſt ceaſed after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles days, is a matter worthy to be enquired after: For whereas ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61252:19"/>
think, that <hi>de jure &amp; obligatione,</hi> it ceaſed with the Apoſtles, as being their proper work, that cannot be true, 1. Becauſe many others were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame work in the Apoſtles days: 2. Becauſe it is Chriſt's own deſcription of that Miniſtry to whom he promiſeth his preſence, to the end of the Age or World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. 3. Becauſe to this day, there is ſtill lamentable neceſſity of ſuch: Five parts in ſix of the World being yet Infidels.</p>
               <p>30. It is moſt probable that this ſervice abated and withered gradually by the ſloth and ſelfiſhneſs of Paſtors. And that it was the purpoſe of the Apoſtles, that the fixed Biſhops ſhould do their part of both theſe works; that is, Both to preach for the Converting of all the Infidel Countries near them, and alſo Govern their particular Churches (yet not but that ſome others might be deputed to the Gathering of Churches alone.) And then theſe Biſhops finding ſo much work at home, and finding that the Itinerant work among Infidels, was very difficult, by reaſon of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Danger, and their want of Apoſtolical gifts, hereupon they ſpared themſelves, and too much neglected the Itinerant work. Yet I muſt confeſs that ſuch Evangeliſts did not yet wholly ceaſe. <hi>Euſebius Hiſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>Pantaenus</hi> is ſaid to have ſhewed ſuch a willing mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the publiſhing of the Doctrine of Chriſt, that he became a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Goſpel to the <hi>Eaſtern Gentiles,</hi> and was ſent as far as <hi>India:</hi> For there were, I ſay there were then, many Evangeliſts prepared for<note place="margin">☞</note> this purpoſe, to promote and plant the Heavenly Word with Godly Zeal, after the manner of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>31. It was the ordinary cuſtome of the Apoſtles to preach and plant Churches firſt in Cities, and not in Country Villages. Becauſe in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there were, 1. the greateſt number of Auditors, and 2. the greateſt number of Converts; And ſo there only were found a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to conſtitute a Church. Not that this was done through any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of the City, or ignobility of Villages; but for the competent numbers ſake. And had there been perſons enow for a Church in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, they would have placed Churches and Paſtors there alſo (as at <hi>Cenchrea</hi> it ſeems they did.)</p>
               <p>32. When there was a Church of Chriſtians in the City, and a few Converts in the Country Villages that joyned with them, they all made up but one full Aſſembly, or Church, fit for perſonal Communion, for a long time after the Apoſtles days; the main body of the people being ſtill Infidels: ſo that the Chriſtian Churches ſtood among the Infidels as thin, as the Churches of the Anabaptiſts, Separatiſts and Independants did among us here in <hi>England,</hi> in the days when they had greateſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and countenance.</p>
               <p>33. Though at firſt the Biſhops being men of the ſame Office with the other Presbyters, were not to do a work diſtinct and of any other kind than the Presbyters might do, but only Lead them and Preſide among them in the ſame work as their Conductors (as I ſaid before of a chief Juſtice, &amp;c.)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61252:19"/>
Yet afterward the Biſhop for the honour of his calling appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting certain actions to himſelf alone, the Presbyters not exerciſing thoſe acts in time, the not exerciſing them ſeemed to ſignifie a want of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or power to exerciſe them; and ſo ſubject Presbyters (who were never made by the Apoſtles that can be proved, nor by their command) were like a diſtinct Order or Species of Church-Officers, and grew from ſyn-Presbyters or aſſeſſours of the ſame Office <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to be as much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Biſhops, as the Deacons were to the Presbyters.</p>
               <p>34. All this while the Biſhop with his fellow Elders and Deacons dwelt together in the ſame City, and often in the ſame Houſe, and met in the ſame Church, the Biſhop ſitting in the midſt on a higher ſeat, and the Presbyters on each hand him in a ſemi-circle, and the Deacons ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And the Presbyters Preaching and otherwiſe officiating as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop appointed, who ruled the action. And the Converts of the Villages came to this City Church as Members of it, and joyned with the reſt. In the days of the Author of the Epiſtles aſcribed to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> every Church had but One Altar, and One Biſhop with his Fellow Elders and Deacons as the note of its Unity; or Individuation. For ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as had perſonal Communion at <hi>One Altar,</hi> with the <hi>Biſhop or Elders</hi> were the conſtitutive parts of the Churches.</p>
               <p>35. Thus it continued alſo in the days of <hi>Juſtin, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian;</hi> no Biſhop having more than <hi>one Church</hi> or <hi>Altar,</hi> without any other formed <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating Church</hi> under him, but only Oratories in City or Country.</p>
               <p>36. The firſt that brake this Order were <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> where Converts ſoon multiplyed to a greater number than could meet in one place, or Communicate at one Altar: wherefore ſub-aſſemblies with their particular Presbyters, were there firſt formed, who Communicated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly by themſelves. (Though there is no proof that they Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated there in the Sacrament of a long time after that they met for Preaching and Prayer.) Yet even in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> the only places that had more than one ſtated Aſſembly for 200 years or more, there were not ſo many Chriſtians then as in the Pariſh that I now live in; See more of my Proof in the beginning of my <hi>Church Hiſtory abridged:</hi> whoſe firſt and ſecond Chapters belogn ſpecially to this Treatiſe, and therefore I muſt refer the Reader to them.</p>
               <p>37. Even in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> time about 370 years after Chriſt, it is noted by him as a ſingularity in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they had diſtinct Aſſemblies beſides the Biſhops; whereupon <hi>Petavius</hi> himſelf largely giveth us notice, that in thoſe days, except in a few very great Cities, there was but one Church-aſſembly in a Biſhops charge.</p>
               <p>38. After that in Cities, or Country Villages, the Converts multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into more than could meet in one Aſſembly, and had allowance to Communicate in their ſub-aſſemblies; yet were they appointed on certain great and ſolemn Feſtivals, to Communicate all with the Biſhops at the chief City Church, which ſheweth that the ſub-aſſemblies then were few and ſmall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61252:20"/>39. Thus was the Apoſtles Order by degrees ſubverted; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſettled diſtinct Churches with their diſtinct Biſhops, no Biſhop having two Churches under him, (that had not alſo their proper Biſhop) now One Church was made of many without many Biſhops; ſub-Presbyters firſt in the ſame Church being introduced, at laſt ſub-Churches alſo were ſet up. And when they ſhould have done as we do with Bees, let every new Swarm have a new Hive, and ſhould have multiplyed Biſhops and Churches, homogeneal, as ſufficient numbers of Converts came in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, the City Biſhops kept all <hi>under them</hi> as if they had been ſtill <hi>one Church</hi> (yet not as Archbiſhops that have Biſhops under them) and kept their ſub-Presbyters as their Curates to officiate in the ſeveral Churches that had all no Biſhops but One.</p>
               <p>40. The cauſes of this were apparently moſt of the ſame which are mentioned before for the making of ſub-Presbyters: Eſpecially, 1. The ſelfiſhneſs of the Biſhops, who were loth to let go any of the people from under their ſuperiority: Becauſe it was more honour to rule many than one ſingle Congregation; and he was a greater man that had many ſub-Presbyters and whole Aſſemblies at his command, than he that had not: And alſo <hi>many</hi> afforded greater maintenance than a <hi>few.</hi> And 2. the ſame Reaſons that made men at firſt ſet up one Presbyter as Biſhop over the reſt, to avoid Diviſions, and to determine Arbitrations, did now ſeem ſtrong to them, for the keeping up the Authority of the City Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over the ſub-Aſſemblies round about them. 3. And Cities only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been poſſeſſed of Biſhops for many Years if not Ages, before there were Chriſtians enow to make up Country Churches, both the Biſhops and the City Inhabitants, (eaſily overlooking the Reaſon of it) took this for their Prerogative, and did plead Preſcription; As if <hi>Schools</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Vid.

And thus the Cities being far the ſtrongeſt, and the Intereſt of the Citizens and Biſhops in point of honour being conjunct, and none being capable of a Country charge, but ſuch as the City Biſhops at firſt Ordained to it (becauſe then there were no other Biſhops,) without reſiſtance it came to paſs that both Churches and Presbyters were ſubjected to the City Biſhops. 4. And it greatly advanced this deſign that the Churches which were planted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, did ſeek to participate of all ſecular honour that belonged to the place of their Reſidence: And (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath largely opened, though not well juſtified) did form themſelves according to the Model of the Civil Government: ſo that thoſe Cities that had the Preſidents or chief Civil Rulers and Judicatures in them, did plead a right of having alſo the chief Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Judicatures: And thus not only Cities ruled the Country Villages, but in time the diſtinct pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and pre-eminences of Archbiſhops, Metropolitans, Primates, Patriarchs, and the <hi>Roman</hi> chief Patriarch or Pope came up: And the Pagan Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

For, 1. As <hi>Conſtantine</hi> perceived that it was the Chriſtians that were his ſureſt ſtrength, and when the Heathen Soldiers turned from one Emperour to another, as they were tempted, he knew that if he only did own the Chriſtians they would unanimouſly own him, and be conſtant to him; ſo alſo his Judgment and Zeal for Chriſtianity did concur with his Intereſt and Policy: And as all the Secular and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rulers depended on him for honour and power, throughout the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> world, he thought it not ſeemly to give the chief Chriſtians who were the Biſhops, leſs honour than he did to the Heathens, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men: Nor did he think meet to deny to the Chriſtian Churches ſuch priviledges, as might ſomewhat ſet them higher than his other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 2. And the Biſhops and Chriſtians coming from under long ſcorn and contempt, and coming newly from under the cruel Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and affrighted anew by <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and <hi>Licenius,</hi> they were not only glad to be now honoured and advanced, but greatly lifted up with ſuch a ſudden wonderous change, as to be brought from ſcorn and cruel torments, to be ſet up above all others: As we ſhould have been, had we been in their caſe, and it's like ſhould no more have feared the ill conſequents of too much exaltation than they did. 3. And the Chriſtian people thought that the exaltation of their Biſhops was the honour and exaltation of their Religion it ſelf, as well as of their perſons.</p>

Whereas (as is aforeſaid) the Chriſtians had commonly ſtated the power of Arbitrating all their Civil differences in the Biſhop alone (when the Apoſtle intimated that any <hi>Wiſe man</hi> among them, as ſuch, was fit for that buſineſs) it grew preſently to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a heynous crime or ſcandal, for any Chriſtians to go to Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil Magiſtrate. And <hi>Conſtantine</hi> finding them in poſſeſſion of this cuſtom, did by his Edict confirm it and enlarge it: decreeing that all Biſhops ſhould be Judges of all the Chriſtians cauſes by conſent, and that no Civil Judge or Magiſtrate ſhould compel any Chriſtian to his bar: Inſomuch that in <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his days, when one of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his<note place="margin">Invit. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. per Baron.</note> Presbyters had a cauſe to be tryed, he denyed himſelf to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that he might have it decided by the Civil Magiſtrate, that was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian alſo. So that even Chriſtian Magiſtrates might not judge unwilling Chriſtians but the Biſhops only. Yet had not the Biſhops then the power of the Sword, but decided all as Arbitrators, and enforced their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences with rigorous penances and Church-cenſures: By which means, 1. many the more turned Chriſtians (without the Faith and Holineſs of Chriſtians) that they might both partake of the Chriſtians honour and immunities, and ſpecially that they might be free from corporal penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61252:21"/>
for their crimes. (And who would not do ſo, if it were now our caſe.) 2. And by this means the rigorous penalties of the Church by penances were the more eaſily ſubmitted to, as being more eaſie than corporal pains and mulcts. And when thus by the Laws and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſo great an Emperour, the Biſhops were made the Judges of all that were Chriſtians at preſent, and all that would turn Chriſtians that deſired it, it is eaſie to underſtand, 1. what a Lordſhip they muſt needs have as to the kind of power; 2. How their Office muſt dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from purely ſpiritual, into ſecular or mixt: 3. And how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous their Flocks, and large their Provinces would ſoon be.</p>
               <p>And here you muſt note theſe things, 1. That the Biſhop of every Church was made Judge of theſe cauſes; not alone by himſelf, but with his Presbyters or Clergy, who judged with him. 2. That yet this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was not then taken to be any eſſential or integral part at all of the Paſtoral Office; but an Accidental work, which Lay-men might do as well as Paſtors; and that it was committed to the Biſhop only as the beſt able for Arbitration; becauſe of his abilities and intereſt, and that as a matter of meer convenience; and alſo for the honour of his place. 3. That therefore this Judging power for ending ſtrife and differences, might be alienated from the Clergy and done by Lay-men, where there was cauſe. 4. And that the Biſhop had ſo much more power than the Presbyters that he could commit it from them to Lay-men. All this that one inſtance of <hi>Silvanus</hi> in <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. (and in <hi>Hanmer, cap.</hi> 36.) whoſe words were thus [Silvanus <hi>alſo no leſs expreſſed in his other acts and dealings, the good motion of his Godly mind. For when he perceived that the Clergy reſpected nothing but gain in deciding the Controverſies of their Clients,</hi> (O woful Clergy!) <hi>he thenceforth ſuffered none of the Clergy to be judge, but took the ſupplications, and requeſts of ſuiters, and appointed</hi> One <hi>of the</hi> Laity, <hi>whom for certain he knew to be a juſt and godly man, and gave him the hearing of their cauſes, and ſo ended quietly all contentions and quarrels.</hi>] (And the likelieſt way it was.) You ſee here, 1. that when Princes will needs make the Clergy Magiſtrates to honour them, the wiſe and good men of the Clergy will return ſuch power to the Laity, as uſually fitter for it. 2. And that it is no wonder that when Law-buſineſs is caſt upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, if they grow worſe than Lawyers in covetouſneſs and injuſtice. 3. And yet this was not a making Lay-men to be Chancellors that had the power of the Keys! For <hi>Silvanus</hi> did only appoint Lay-men to do Lay-mens work; to arbitrate differences: but not to excommunicate, nor to judge men to excommunication, as they do now. 4. And this was not a making of Eccleſiaſtical Elders that were not Paſtors: and therefore it is no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for ſuch: but it was a prudent caſting back that work on the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which good Emperours had in imprudent piety caſt upon the Clergy, that each might do his proper work. 5. But this was but one good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that was ſo wiſe and honeſt; and therefore it proved no general refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61252:21"/>This Judicial power went ſo far and took up ſo much of the Clergies time, that the Synod <hi>Taraconenſ.</hi> was after this put to Decree, <hi>Can.</hi> 4. that the Clergy ſhould not judge Cauſes on the Lords day; and <hi>Can.</hi> 10. that no Biſhop or Clergy-man ſhould take rewards or bribes for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Canons</hi> ſo deterred Chriſtians from ſeeking Juſtice from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Judicatures, that they had few but Heathens to be Judges of. Yea the Chriſtians thought ſo hardly of the Judges themſelves (for puniſhing men by the Sword, when the Biſhops even for murder it ſelf did puniſh them but with Penance,) that they doubted ſometime whether thoſe Chriſtians that exerciſed Magiſtracy or Civil Judgment after Baptiſme, were not therefore to be taken for ſinners; as is viſible in <hi>Innocent</hi> 1. his <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. to <hi>Exuper.

               <p>But of this whole matter of the Riſe of ſuch Prelacy, their Courts and power, <hi>Pardre Paulus</hi> hath ſpoken ſo well and truly in his <hi>Hiſtor. Concil.

               <p>43. The countenance of the Emperour with theſe honours and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, having brought the <hi>World</hi> into the Church, or filled the Churches with Carnal temporizers, the numbers were now ſo great, that quickly the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61252:22"/>
great Cities had many Pariſh Churches, and the Country Villages about had ſome; ſo that now about 400 or 500 Years after Chriſt, moſt Biſhops of great Cities had more Churches than one, even ſeveral ſub Aſſemblies, and Altars, as dependant on their Mother Church.</p>
               <p>44. Yet were their Dioceſſes (which at firſt were called Pariſhes) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bounded, by the Canon and Edicts, which decreed that every City where there were Chriſtians enow to make a Church, ſhould have a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of their own, and that no Biſhop (except two, who bordered one on <hi>Scithia</hi> a rude unconverted Countrey, and the other on the like caſe, of which more in due place.)</p>
               <p>45. And then every <hi>oppidum</hi> or populous Town, like our Market-Towns and Corporations, was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a City, and not only a few among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have that name by priviledge, as it is in <hi>England</hi> now. So that even at this height of Prelacy, about 500, 600 or 700 Years after Chriſt, they were but as if every Corporation or Market-Town in <hi>England</hi> had a Biſhop, who ruled alſo the adjacent Villages. For though when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwell, it was once decreed by one Council, that Villages and every ſmall City ſhould not have a Biſhop, leſt the Name of a Biſhop ſhould grow vile or cheap; yet this was but with this addition, [thoſe Villages or ſmall Cities where there was not a ſufficient number of Chriſtians:] (whereas <hi>Gregory</hi> at <hi>Neoceſarea</hi> thought ſeventeen a ſufficient number to have a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.) And the Canons, that every City ſhould have a Biſhop, remained ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>45. Yet was it for about 440 Years ſo far from theſe great Biſhops to uſurp the Sword, or any coercive or coactive power, on mens Bodies or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that they unanimouſly held that the Magiſtrate himſelf was not to puniſh mens Bodies for Hereſie or a falſe Religion. Till at laſt the bloody violence of the <hi>Circumcellian Donatiſts,</hi> did cauſe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in this to change his mind, and think them meet for the Magiſtrates coercion.</p>
               <p>46. When Biſhops grew carnal and ungodly, and more regarded the keeping up their Power, Parties and Opinions, than Charity, they began<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſtruſt the Spiritual Weapons of their warfare; and inſtead of true vigilancy againſt errours, and confutation of them, by clear reaſon and a holy life, they fled to the Rulers to do it by the Sword. But though <hi>Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> with their Synod of Biſhops, excited <hi>Maximus</hi> to take this<note place="margin">Vit. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. per Baron.</note> courſe againſt the <hi>Priſcilianiſts;</hi> yet not only St. <hi>Martyn</hi> did therefore to the death avoid their Synods and Communion, and petitioned the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for the Hereticks peace; but even St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo at <hi>Milan</hi> would have no Communion with thoſe Biſhops, that had done this thing.</p>
               <p>47. About the Year 430, or after, <hi>Cyril</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> did lead the way, and actually uſed the Sword againſt the Lives, Eſtates and Liberties of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders: An example which others quickly followed: And eaſily did he ſtep from the great Judicial Power before deſcribed, to a forcing power, the preparations being ſo great, and the Emperour ſo ready to exalt them, and the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſo turbulent and inclined by pride and paſſion to ſuch ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61252:22"/>48. As the Prelacy thus ſwelled, ſo the Churches grew ſuddenly more corrupted with all manner of Vice. The Biſhops began with ſorrow to confeſs unto the Hereticks, that the greater number in the Churches were naught. When they ſhould chuſe their Biſhops they could ſeldom agree; but frequently inſtead of holy peaceable Votes, did turn to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh rage and blood-ſhed, and covered the Streets and Church-floors with the Carkaſſes of the ſlain; (eſpecially in the Caſe of <hi>Damaſus</hi> and others at <hi>Rome,</hi> and oft at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>) Frequently they fell into fewds, and fought it out, and murdered people by multitudes: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſtrict holy Monks of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deſarts, were as forward as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to fighting, blood-ſhed and ſedition: Even in their ignorance, for ſuch a paultry and ſottiſh an Opinion, as that of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> as that God hath the ſhape and parts of a man: ſo that they forced that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful treacherous Biſhop <hi>Theophilus Alexandr.</hi> to flatter them, and curſe the Books of <hi>Origen</hi> (not for his errours, but for the oppoſite truth) and to take on him to hold as they did. When God tryed them with a <hi>Julian</hi> (who did perſecute them very little,) they reproached him to his face, and tryed his patience as well as he did theirs. The <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">Socrat l. 3. c. 15.</note> bid him ſhave his Beard and make Halters of it. In a word, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had brought the World into the Church, the Church grew quickly too like the World.</p>
               <p>49. But it was not the people only, but the Paſtors, both Prelates and Presbyters, that grew licentious, wicked, proud, contentious, turbulent, and the ſhame of their Order and Profeſſion, and the great diſturbers and dividers of the Churches: except here and there an <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> a <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> a <hi>Baſil,</hi> a <hi>Gregory,</hi> an <hi>Atticus,</hi> a <hi>Proclus,</hi> and a few ſuch that ſo ſhined among a darkened degenerate Clergy, as to be ſingled out for Saints. Abundance got theſe great and tempting Prelacies by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and more by making friends to Courtiers: And not a few by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal compliances with the people: what abundance of moſt ſharp Epiſtles did <hi>Iſidore Peluſiota</hi> write to <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Biſhop, and to <hi>Soſimus, Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Euſtathius, &amp;c.</hi> of all their horrible wicked lives, and yet could never procure their Reformation? What abundance of Epiſtles did he write againſt them to other Biſhops, and yet could not procure their correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or removal? What a ſad character doth <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> give of the Biſhops that proſecuted the <hi>Priſcilianiſts,</hi> and in particular of their Leader <hi>Ithacius,</hi> of his own knowledge? What abundance of Prelates are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtigmatized, by <hi>Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Euagrius, &amp;c?</hi> When a Rebel roſe up againſt his Prince, and got but the ſtronger party, and poſſeſſion, how quickly did they flatter him and own him. I find but one Biſhop beſides St. <hi>Martin</hi> in all <hi>France</hi> and that part of <hi>Germany,</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned <hi>Maximus</hi> that murdered <hi>Gratian:</hi> The reſt applauded him for their own ends: Nor in that part of <hi>Italy</hi> I find not any beſides <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and one <hi>Hyginus</hi> that diſowned him: (Not that I think it my part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the holy Biſhops who profeſſed ſubjection to Uſurpers in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:

Even holy <hi>Ambroſe</hi> could write to the odious Tyrant <hi>Eugenius,</hi> [<hi>Clementiſſimo Imperatori Eugenio</hi>] concluding [<hi>Nam cum privato detulerim corde intimo, quomodo non deferrem Imperatori.</hi>] <hi>When I honoured thee a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man from the bottom of my heart, how can I but honour thee being Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?</hi>] And how far have the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops gone in this, even to <hi>Phocas,</hi> and ſuch as he?)</p>
               <p>When good <hi>Gregory Nazianz.</hi> was choſen and ſettled Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and loved and honoured by a good Emperour, yet was he rejected (though he eaſily yielded) even by the Synod of Biſhops, in the arrogancy of their minds, becauſe that he came not in by them.

               <p>And that Epiſcopacy which was ſet up to prevent Hereſie and Diviſions, did afford the Heads of moſt of the Hereſies and Diviſions that befell the Churches.

               <p>And their fewds and inhumane contentions were ſo many and odious, that it is a ſhame to read them. Multitudes of Cities had Biſhops ſet up againſt Biſhops, and ſome Cities had more than two, or three: The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reviling and hating each other, and ſometime fighting tumultuouſly unto blood, for their ſeveral Prelates.

What ſhall I ſay of them, that in the very Palace of the Emperours, and in the preſence of Princes lived moſt familiarly: which eſteemed of their Miniſters ſo highly, that they granted them in their preſence freely to deal in matters of Religion, both by word and deed; together with their wives and children and ſervants? And thus one might then have ſeen the Biſhops of all Churches in great reverence and favour among all ſorts of men, and with all Magiſtrates. Who can worthily deſcribe thoſe innumerable heaps, and flocking multitudes, throughout all Cities and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Aſſemblies, frequenting the places dedicated to prayer: Becauſe of which circumſtances, they not contented with the old and ancient buildings (which could not receive them) have throughout all Cities, builded them from the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wide and ample Churches: Theſe things thus prevailed in proceſs of time, and daily increaſed far and nigh: ſo that no malice could intercept, no ſpiteful fiend bewitch, no wight with cunning at all hinder it, as long as the Divine and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hand of God upheld and viſited his People, whom as yet he worthily accepted. But after that our affairs through too much liberty, eaſe and ſecurity, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Natural rule of piety; and after that one purſued another with open contumely and hatred; and when that we</hi> impugned our ſelves by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than our ſelves, <hi>with the armour of ſpite, and ſharp ſpears of approbrious words, ſo that Biſhops againſt Biſhops, and People againſt People, raiſed ſedition; laſt of all, when that curſed hypocriſie and diſſimulation had ſwam even to the brim of malice; The heavy hand of Gods high judgment after his wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (whileſt as yet the Eccleſiaſtical Societies aſſembled themſelves nevertheleſs) began ſoftly by little and little to viſit us; ſo that the perſecution that was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt us took firſt his Original, from the Brethren that were under Banner in the Camp. When as we were touched with no ſenſe thereof, nor went about so pacific God, we heaped ſin upon ſin, thinking like careleſs Epicures, that God neither cared, nor would viſit our ſins; And they which ſeemed our Shepherds, Laying aſide the rule of piety, practiſed contention and ſchiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and whilſt they aggravated theſe things, that is, contentious, threatnings, mutual hatred and enmity, and every one proceeded in Ambition, much like Tyranny it ſelf, then I ſay, then did the Lord make the daughter of</hi> Zion <hi>obſcure, and overthrew from above the glory of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—c. 2. <hi>We ſaw with our eyes the Oratories thrown down: to the ground, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons digged up, the holy Scriptures burned to aſhes in the open Market-place, and the Paſtors of the Churches ſome ſhamefully hid themſelves.—Yet is it not our drift to deſcribe the bitter calamities of theſe men, which at length they ſuffered,</hi>

               <p>But after this, alas, how much greater were their enormities and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when their Tyranny was much encreaſed; It would grieve any ſober Chriſtian to read how the Chriſtian World hath been toſſed up and down, and the people diſtracted, and Princes diſturbed and dethroned, and Hereſies fomented, and horrid Perſecutions, and bloodſhed cauſed, by the pride and contentiouſneſs of Prelates: And moſt of all this, in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Controverſie, which Chriſt decided ſo long ago, <hi>viz. Who ſhould be greateſt. It was not Religion,</hi> ſaith <hi>Socrates, l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>that the two</hi> Arian <hi>Sects of</hi> Marinus <hi>and</hi> Agapius <hi>was about, but Primacy: They ſtrove which of them ſhould be the chief: wherefore many Clergy-men under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of theſe Biſhops, perceiving the ambition, the rancour and malice of theſe proud Prelates, forſook them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macedonius</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſo Tyrannical, that as he came in by cruelty, ſo he cauſed more, by preſumptuous removal of the bones of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> to another Church, that he might pull down that, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperours knowledge: where the people in Factions fought it out, till the Church and Streets were full of Carkaſſes and ſtreams of blood, ſaith <hi>Socrates.</hi> The ſame man ſet four Companies of<note place="margin">Socrat. l. 2. c. 3. Id. ib.</note> Souldiers on the <hi>Novations</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> till he enraged the people with Clubs and Bills to kill them all. And he was ſo Tyrannical in forcing Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that he not only forced men to the Sacrament, but gagged their mouths and popt it in.</p>
               <p>Nor was this only the vice of the Heterodox but the Orthodox, as is aforeſaid. And as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Biſhops aforeſaid did againſt the <hi>Priſcillinaiſts,</hi> ſo for their own intereſt againſt one another, they flattered and reſtleſly inſtigated the Civil power, even Uuſurpers to execute their Wills: and favoured that power that moſt favoured them. When the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Maximus</hi> had killed <hi>Gratian</hi> and reigned in <hi>France,</hi> and entered <hi>Italy,</hi> (after that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had ſtopt him a while) <hi>Theophilus Alexandr.</hi> ſendeth an Agent Presbyter with two Letters, and a rich preſent, one to <hi>Maximus</hi> and one to <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> ordering him to ſtay the iſſue of the Fight, and give the Preſent with his Letter to him that proved the Conqueror: But a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſtole the Letters from the Prieſt, and opened the whole buſineſs, and cauſed the Prieſt to fly and hide himſelf.</p>
               <p>50. Theſe contentions of the Biſhops and corruption of manners, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted the more Religious ſort of the people, that it occaſioned the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of ſeparating Hereſies: and greatly encreaſed and confirmed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Novations;</hi> becauſe men thought them to be of better lives than the Orthodox.</p>
               <p>51. Yea, by their very abuſe of good and holy men, they drove even
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61252:24"/>
the Orthodox often to ſeparated Societies, as thinking ſo bad Prelates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be communicated with. As in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> their abuſe, ejection and baniſhment of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cauſed great numbers of his faithful people to forſake the Church; and meet only in ſeparated Conventicles; And though they differed in no point of Doctrine, Worſhip or Diſcipline from the reſt, all that they could do by tyranny and threats would never bring them again to the Church; but they were called <hi>Joannites,</hi> and aſſembled by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; till <hi>Atticus</hi> by wiſe and honeſt means firſt began the reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>, by the publick inſerting of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s name among their honoured Biſhops in the daily Liturgy of the Church, and <hi>Proclus</hi> after wiſely perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, by fetching the bones of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with honour, from the place of his baniſhment into the Church.

For ſaith <hi>Socrates, c.</hi> 40. <hi>Proclus behaved himſelf fairly towards all men, perſwading himſelf that it was far eaſier for him by fair means to allure men to the Church, than by force to compel them to the Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>52. The multitudes of Schiſmes and horrid enormities in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the grand corruption of Religion by them; the ſhameful diviſions between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, began ſo long ago and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day, with much more ſuch evidence, do tell the World that is willing to ſee, what all this tended to as it's perfection.</p>
               <p>53. And having thus ſhewed how the Biſhops of the Flock came to be Biſhops of Biſhops, and how they grew from the Paſtoral Office to a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous denomination moſtly ſecular, and how the Biſhops of ſingle Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, did grow to be the Biſhops of multitudes of Churches turned into one Dioceſan Church of another ſpecies, we ſhall leave it to thoſe that are wiſe and impartial, to judge whether a true Reformation muſt retrieve them, and what Age and ſtate of the Church muſt be our pattern, to which we ſhould endeavour to return; and in what point it is that it is meet or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for Chriſtians unanimouſly to fix between the Apoſtolical inſtitution and the height of Popery? And what ſatisfying proof any man can give that in a line of 1500 Years, that it is the right point that he hath choſen.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Judgement of thoſe Nonconformiſts (now ſilenced) who 1660. addreſſed themſelves to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second for Concord in the matter of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: what they then offered, and what thoſe of the Authors mind now hold, as to the Right of what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hiſtorically related.</head>
               <p>AS I have delivered our Judgment about the Hiſtory of Prelacy, ſo ſhall I next freely and truly expreſs my own Judgment and thoſe that have concurred with me about the right of Church-Government it ſelf, (ſuppoſing thoſe 100 <hi>Propoſ. ad Lud. Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> which I have publiſhed about the Nature of Church-power, and the extent of the Magiſtrates power in Church-matters.) For Truth hath great advantage when it appeareth, 1. compact, and entire, 2. and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen light. Since the writing of this our judgment is more fully publiſhed in the Nonconformiſts firſt and ſecond Plea for Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Since the Fall of Man, as God hath given a Saviour to the<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 22. Gen. 3. 15. Joh. 17. 2. Mat. 28. 18, 19. Eph. 1. 21, 22.</note> World, by whom he hath made a new Covenant with or for Mankind; ſo hath he delivered all things into the Redeemer's hands, and given him all power in Heaven and Earth, making him the Adminiſtrator General, and Head over all things to the Church.</p>
               <p>2. Some things are under Chriſt as <hi>Utenſils,</hi> viz, <hi>Inanimates and Braites;</hi> ſome are under him as <hi>meer enemies</hi> ſubdued, as <hi>Devils;</hi> ſome are under him as <hi>generally Redeemed,</hi> and <hi>ſubjects de jure,</hi> or <hi>quoad obligationem,</hi> to be Ruled and uſed upon terms of Mercy; And ſo are all Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, till the day of life and grace is paſt: ſome are under him as Viſible Conſenters, and Profeſſed ſubjects; ſo are the Baptized and viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity: And ſome are under him as ſincere Heart-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, Juſtified and Sanctified, and to be Glorified by him.</p>
               <p>3. As <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf is now delivered up to Chriſt, and the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is now part of <hi>his Law,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtrument of his Government,</hi> both for the <hi>common good</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>Redeemed World,</hi> and alſo as <hi>ſanctified</hi> to the <hi>ſpecial good</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> Even ſo is the Office of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy</hi> now under him, and derived from him, and dependant on him, in both theſe forementioned reſpects. (Notwithſtanding all the vain arguments which Mr. <hi>Brown a Scotch</hi> Divine, <hi>Cont. Velthuſium</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the contrary; which need no confutation to an intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61252:25"/>4. But the Office of the Sacred Miniſtry is much of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and leſs of <hi>Natural original</hi> than Magiſtracy. For though it be of <hi>Natural</hi> obligation, that one man teach another, and that there be ſome fitter perſons than the multitude to inſtruct the people and guide them in Gods Worſhip; Yet that in <hi>ſpecie</hi> there ſhould be <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel,</hi> and Adminiſtrators of this inſtituted worſhip and Church-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, this is it ſelf of <hi>Chriſts Inſtitution,</hi> as the <hi>Doctrine, worſhip</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> which are their Office-work are of his Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>5. And though a great part of a Chriſtian Magiſtrates work be alſo. Inſtituted, <hi>viz.</hi> to promote Chriſts Inſtituted Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, yet ſo much alſo of his work is natural, as that he may be called a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> though he be not a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, while he executeth Gods Laws of Nature, for the common good: But he is (at leaſt) leſs fitly called a Miniſter or Prieſt of God, who ſhall only teach the Law of Nature, and guide an Aſſembly in meer Natural Worſhip, (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all that is by Inſtitution:) Or if any think otherwiſe, it being but <hi>de nomine,</hi> at leaſt this is certain, that the Chriſtian or Evangelical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is by Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>6. Therefore, though ſo far as the Moſaical Magiſtracy was founded in Nature, or in any Revelation expounding the Law of Nature, we may under the Goſpel fetch proofs thence for the Chriſtian Magiſtrates Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Obligation; Yet can we fetch no Model of a Goſpel Miniſtry, nor proof of our Authority or obligation as inſtituted, from the Inſtituted Miniſtry of the Moſaical Church: Becauſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is abrogate and indeed did never bind the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (as I have fullier proved in my Treat. of the Lords day.) Nor is it ſafe to argue from parity of reaſon that we muſt now be or do as they did, in point of pure inſtitution, while we ſo little know the total reaſon of God's inſtitutions, and when he himſelf hath taken them down and ſet up new ones we muſt not then plead our Reaſon againſt the alterations which God himſelf hath made.</p>
               <p>7. Therefore though Chriſt be now the Head and Fountain of Power, both to Magiſtrates and Miniſters, yet he did not inſtitute a new Office of Magiſtracy, but add new Laws for them to rule by as part of their Rule of Government; Becauſe their Office was ſo much founded in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo much of their work lay in ruling mankind according to their common Natural Law: But a Miniſtry he did inſtitute a-new, as to the ſpecies and great eſſentials of the Office.</p>
               <p>8. Chriſt changing both the Inſtituted Moſaical Law, and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, did begin himſelf in his own perſon as the Great Prophet, High Prieſt and King of his Church, to exerciſe his Office in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>9. Being not to continue corporally on earth, nor his bodily preſence being ubiquitary, he deſigned that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be his <hi>Agent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally</hi> to carry on his work in the World; And he appointed the Sacred Office of the Miniſtry, that meet men might be his Agents external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61252:26"/>
in the Teaching and Governing of his Redeemed ones in a holy order, and in conducting them in holy worſhip, in a Miniſterial ſubordination to his Prophetical, Regal and Prieſtly Office.</p>
               <p>10. As he himſelf did Officiate among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo he firſt placed this Miniſterial Power in twelve choſen men, and ſeventy Aſſiſtants with ſome relation to the twelve Tribes and ſeventy Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom he ſent them.</p>
               <p>11. During the time of Chriſt's abode among them in the fleſh, they were but as Pupils and Learners while they were Teachers; and their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, Commiſſions, Office</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> and ſo their <hi>ſucceſs</hi> were all yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: They were not yet authorized openly and commonly ſo much as to declare Chriſt to be the Meſſiah and Saviour, but only to prepare men for that belief: Becauſe thoſe works were not yet done, which muſt be the <hi>Evidences</hi> of their Doctrine and the Inſtruments of mens Conviction, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and his ſending the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>12. When Chriſt was riſen before his Aſcenſion, he perfected their Commiſſion, both as to their Work and Province; but appointed them to ſtay till the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, (as the ſealing and full delivery of it, giving them full ability for their work) before they ſet themſelves about the ſolemn performance of it.</p>
               <p>13. Their Commiſſion and Office was, 1. to Teach men and make them Chriſtians (or Chriſt's Diſciples,) 2. and then to Baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo to take them into his Covenant and Church; and, 3. to Teach them as Covenanted and en-Churched perſons, to obſerve all his commands; The firſt part of their work was to be exerciſed unlimitedly on all the World, as far as they were able; The ſecond part on the new Converted Believers (and their infant ſeed;) And the third part on the Baptized (that were adult.) And he added the promiſe of his preſence with them to the end.</p>
               <p>14. As he now enlarged their Commiſſion to <hi>All the World</hi> as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the firſt part of their Office; ſo he added one (<hi>Paul</hi>) by a voice from Heaven, unto the number of the Apoſtles, who was eſpecially made an Apoſtle to the Gentiles, to ſhew the reſt that they were no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. Becauſe theſe Apoſtles were entruſted not only with a common Preaching of the Goſpel, but as Founders of the Churches, to be the eye and ear witneſſes, of the life, miracles, reſurrection and doctrine of Chriſt, and to acquaint men certainly with the Laws of Chriſt, therefore he promiſed them the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghoſt, to lead them infallibly into all truth, and to bring all things to their remembrance, which he had taught and given them in Charge, and ſo to enable them to perform all their Commiſſion, which he gave them accordingly, and ſo made them the Foundations of his Church, and the infallible deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61252:26"/>
of his Will to the World, by their preaching and practice firſt, and afterwards by their Writings.</p>
               <p>16. Therefore ſince their miraculous reception of the Spirit, all their Doctrines Writings and Eſtabliſhments which were done in the Execution of their Commiſſion, are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt: It was the Holy Ghoſt that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndited the Sacred Scriptures; and it was the Holy Ghoſt that ſettled the Churches, and that wrought the Miracles, and that bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and the Chriſtian verity. For the Apoſtles ſpake not of themſelves, but as the Holy Ghoſt inſpired them.</p>
               <p>17. As others in that time were employed as their aſſiſtants in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Chriſtian Faith, ſo had they alſo the ſame ſpirit, though in ſeveral meaſures, and gifts. And ſo far as they had that ſpirit, he was the ſeal of their doctrine: But becauſe it was the Apoſtles that had the promiſe of Infallibility, we have greater aſſurance of the Infallibility of their writings, than of others; It being <hi>their approbation,</hi> which is much of our aſſurance that the writings of their Aſſiſtants were infallible, and the teſtimony which they give of the perſons that wrote them (<hi>viz. Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi>)</p>
               <p>18. Theſe Apoſtles with their many Aſſiſtants, (Prophets and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts) did by <hi>preaching, holineſs</hi> and <hi>miracles,</hi> (the effects of Divine <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>) convert multitudes, and baptize them, and did not only thus gather them into the Catholick Church to Chriſt, but alſo ſettled them in a holy Order in particular Churches, for perſonal communion among themſelves in holy worſhip and holy living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they made ſuch regular Church-communion a duty to all that could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
               <p>19. By the authority of Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt they ordained others to the ſacred Office of the Miniſtry; The ſame office with their own as to the common works of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Teaching</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>Worſhiping</hi> and <hi>Guiding</hi> the Churches by holy <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> which are the common eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of the ſacred Miniſtry: But not the ſame in reſpect of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary endowments and works before deſcribed (as eye and ear witneſſes, infallibly delivering the will of Chriſt.)</p>
               <p>20. Though in the Nature of the Office all Chriſts Miniſters have the Power before mentioned, (1. to convert men to the Faith by preaching, 2. to take them into the holy Covenant and Church by Baptiſm, 3. to teach, worſhip and rule, in particular Churches; or, 1. to gather Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by preaching and baptizing, 2. and then to teach and guide them;) Yet all are not called equally to the exerciſe of all theſe parts; But ſome were by the Apoſtles and the Holy Ghoſt indefinitely employed in an unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe, in converting men and gathering Churches; yet officiating alſo in gathered Churches where they came; And others were fixed in the ſtated relation of Paſtors to particular gathered Churches, to teach and rule them, and worſhip among them; yet ſo as alſo to Preach for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unbelievers, as far as they had ability and opportunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61252:27"/>21. The unfixed Officers were called Miniſters in General, and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of God's Myſteries, and Evangeliſts: But the fixed Officers, were alſo eſpecially called Biſhops, Paſtors, and Elders: Though ſometime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arely the other alſo had ſuch Titles, becauſe of their doing the ſame work tranſiently in the Churches where they came.</p>
               <p>22. They that were unfixed Preachers or Evangeliſts, had not that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and particular Charge of all the ſouls in particular Churches, and in ſome one Church above all the reſt, as fixed Biſhops or Paſtors have: But they had a greater Obligation than theſe Biſhops to preach to Infidels, becauſe it was their ordinary chief work.</p>
               <p>23. The Paſtors of particular Churches had ſuch a Charge of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Flocks, above all other Flocks (materially,) as that they were not obliged equally to do the ſame for others as they did for them: Though yet when they had a particular call, they might tranſiently or occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform the work of the Paſtoral Office, to other Churches.</p>
               <p>24. This relation to their particular Flock, was not ſuch as diſobliged them from their higher regard of the Univerſal Church: For our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that is ſtricter and more indiſſoluble than to any particular Church: And we muſt always <hi>finally</hi> prefer the Church Univerſal, though <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi> we are to labour in our particular Churches principally (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only) becauſe by ſuch Order the Church Univerſal is beſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>25. The Apoſtles uſually (but not only) planted Churches in great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; rather than in Country Villages.</p>
               <p>26. This was not that hereby they might oblige others to confine Churches to Cities only, nor becauſe they had any ſpecial honour for a City, but becauſe they were the places of greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>course, and had beſt opportunity for Aſſemblies, and moſt materials to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>27. Neither the Apoſtles nor others for ſome Ages after Chriſt, did divide the Countries about ſuch Cities, and aſſign part of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be the Dioceſs of one Biſhop, and the other part to the Biſhop of the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning City: Nor was there any bounding of Pariſhes or Dioceſs, nor any determination, to which Biſhop ſuch and ſuch ground, or Villages of unconverted Infidels did belong. Only as natural prudence guided them (and the ſpirit of God,) they ſo diſperſed themſelves that none might hinder another in his work; but as moſt tended to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and orderly governing of the Churches.</p>
               <p>28. Therefore no City Biſhop had ſuch a Particular Charge of the ſouls of all the individual Infidels, either in his City or the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him (which ſome feign to have been his Dioceſs) as he had of the ſouls of the Church which he was Paſtor of. Though he was bound to do all that he could to convert all as he had opportunity, he ſtood not in any Paſtoral relation to this or that individual Infidel, as he did to all the individual Chriſtians of his charge. <hi>Ignatius</hi> requireth the Biſhop to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61252:27"/>
know all his Flock by name, and enquire after them, even the ſervants; but not ſo of all Infidels in his City or Circuit.</p>
               <p>29. No man was therefore the Paſtor of any Chriſtians in a particular Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>relation meerly becauſe he converted them: Nor was there ever any Law made by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, that all ſhould be members of that particular Church whoſe Overſeer did convert them; much leſs that at a diſtance they ſhould be the members of his Epiſcopal charge, though in another Church.</p>
               <p>30. The Apoſtles ſetled in every particular Church, one or more with the Paſtoral power of the Keys, to teach and govern that Church, and to lead them in publick worſhip. And every ſuch Body ſhould ſtill have one or more Paſtors with ſuch power. And no Paſtor or Biſhop ſhould have more particular Churches under his ſpecial immediate Charge, than one, unleſs as an Archbiſhop who hath Biſhops in thoſe particular Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>
               <p>31. A particular Church of Chriſt's Inſtitution by his Apoſtles, is [<hi>A ſacrrd Society conſiſting of one or more Paſtors, and a capable number of Chriſtian Neighbours, conſociate by Chriſts appointment and their own conſent, for perſonal communion in God's publick worſhip and in holy living.</hi>] In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, 1. The Genus is [<hi>a ſacred Society</hi>] ſo called, 1. to diſtinguiſh it from a meer community, or unbodied company of Chriſtians; 2. and to diſtinguiſh it from Civil and prophane Societies, (For the <hi>Genus</hi> is ſubalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the ſpecies of a ſuperiour <hi>Genus.</hi>) 2. The conſtitutive parts are Paſtor and People. 3. I ſay [<hi>Paſtors</hi>] as diſtinguiſhing it from all other ſocieties as headed by other Officers or Rulers; As Kingdoms by Kings, Colleges by their Governours, Schools by School-maſters, Families by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp;c. For Societies are ſpecified by their Governours. 4. I ſay [<hi>one or more</hi>] becauſe it is the <hi>Office in ſome perſon</hi> that is the conſtitutive part, the number being indifferent as to the <hi>Beings,</hi> though not as to the <hi>well being</hi> of the Society. 5. The <hi>People</hi> being the other material part of the Society, I call them [<hi>Chriſtians</hi>] that is <hi>Baptized Profeſſing Chriſtians,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from all Infidels, who are uncapable to be members. 6. I call them [<hi>Neighbours</hi>] becauſe the Proximity muſt be ſuch as rendereth them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Ends of the <hi>Society,</hi> For at an uncapable diſtance they cannot have Church-communion. 7. I put in [<hi>a capable number</hi>] becauſe <hi>too few or too many</hi> may be utterly uncapable of the Ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One or two are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defectively: ſuch multitudes as can have no Church communion, are uncapable through exceſs (of which more after.) 8. The <hi>form</hi> is the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Union</hi> of Paſtor and People, in reference to the Ends; Which I mean in the word [<hi>Conſociate.</hi>] 9. The foundation or prime efficient, is [<hi>Chriſt's Inſtitution.</hi>] 10. The Condition, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> is [<hi>their mutual conſent.</hi>] 11. The end or <hi>terminus</hi> is their [<hi>Communion.</hi>] 12. The <hi>matter</hi> of this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is both [<hi>God's publickworſhip</hi>] and a <hi>holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>life;</hi> which diſtinguiſheth them from ſuch as aſſociate for civil ends, or any other beſides theſe. 13. The proper ſpecies of this holy Communion is that it be [<hi>Perſonal.</hi>] By
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61252:28"/>
which I mean ſuch as Paſtor and People may ordinarily exerciſe in <hi>preſence;</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that ſort of Communion, 1. which we have only in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in <hi>faith, judgment</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> with Chriſtians in all parts of the World: And, 2. from that external Communion which ſeveral Churches hold together by Meſſengers, Delegates, or Letters. For if that kind of diſtant Communion would ſerve to the being of a particular Church, we might be of the ſame particular Church with men in the ſeveral parts of the World.</p>
               <p>32. Deacons are ſubordinate Officers, or Miniſters to Chriſts Miniſters, not eſſential to the Church, but only Integral, as needful to its well being, in ſuch Churches, where the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of the People do require them.</p>
               <p>33. The neceſſity of theſe Individual or particular Churches, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the neceſſity of the foreſaid publick worſhiping of God, and in the uſe of the mutual aſſiſtance of Chriſtian Neighbours in the matters of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the need of the perſonal inſpection and conduct of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors over all the Flock.</p>
               <p>34. The difference between this <hi>perſonal Communion,</hi> and the diſtant Communion by Letters or Delegates, or meerly internal in Faith and Love, is ſo great and notorious, as muſt make thoſe Societies <hi>ſpecifically</hi> diſtinct, which are aſſociated for ſuch diſtinct Ends.</p>
               <p>35. Yet do we not hold that all true Churches do Aſſemble together in one place; or that they conſiſt of no more than can meet at once: For whole Families ſeldom go all at once to the Aſſembly: Therefore if one part go to day, and another the next day, they worſhip God publickly in perſonal Communion, though not all at the ſame time. 2. And many may be ſick, and many infants, and many aged, and the great diſtance of ſome may make a Chapel or ſubordinate Meeting often needful. And yet, 1. they may all come together in one place at ſeveral times for Church communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. And they may live ſo near, that one may be capable of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe with others, and of admoniſhing, exhorting and encouraging each other, in their Chriſtian Courſe.</p>
               <p>36. Where a Church is ſo ſmall as to need but one Paſtor, Chriſt doth not require that they have more; And One can neither be ſuperiour or inferiour to himſelf.</p>
               <p>37. But it is moſt deſirable that a Church be as numerous or great, as will conſiſt with that ſort of Communion which is the end of the Society; and conſequently that they have many Paſtors; Becauſe this tendeth to their <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> and it is a joyful thing to worſhip God in full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>38. The work of a Biſhop or Paſtor of a ſingle Church is, (to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it more particularly) to Teach the Church the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, eſpecially of all the Articles of Faith, and the things to be Deſired in Prayer, and the matters and order of Obedience to all the commands of Chriſt. To inſtruct the Children in the Catechiſtical or Fundamental
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61252:28"/>
verities. To Baptize, to Pray in the Aſſembly, to praiſe God, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Lords Supper, to viſit the Sick, and pray for them: To viſit the ſeveral Families, or perſonally inſtruct thoſe ignorant ones, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not publick Preaching, as far as he hath opportunity: To watch over the Converſations of the ſeveral Members, and to receive informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them: To reſolve the doubts of thoſe that ſeek reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to offer help to them that are ſo ſenſleſs as not to ſeek it, when their need appeareth: To comfort the ſad and afflicted: To reprove the ſcandalous: To admoniſh the obſtinate before all: To cenſure and caſt out the impenitent that continue to reject ſuch admonition: To abſolve the penitent: To take care of the Poor: And to be exemplary in holineſs, ſobriety, juſtice and charity. I paſs by Marriage, Burials, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Offices. And I meddle not here with Ordination, or any thing that concerneth other Churches; but only with the work of a Biſhop or Paſtor to the People of his proper Flock.</p>
               <p>39. The ableſt Man among us, for mind and body, may find full and needful employment of this ſort, among an hundred perſons, eſpecially ſuch as our common Chriſtians are: But if he have five hundred or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, he hath ſo much to do, as will conſtrain him to leave ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done which belongeth to his Office. Therefore our Market<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Towns, and large Country Pariſhes, where there are ordinarily two, three, or four thouſand in a Pariſh, have need of many paſtors, to do that for which the Paſtoral Office was ordained: Much more our greateſt City and Town Pariſhes that have ten thouſand, twenty thouſand, and ſome above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if not forty or fifty thouſand in a Pariſh.</p>
               <p>40. The office of a Paſtor, containing the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Miniſterially to Chriſt in his Teaching, Ruling and prieſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> work, is not by man to be divided and part of it to be given to one ſort, and part to another (though they that have the <hi>whole power</hi> may variouſly <hi>exerciſe it,</hi> as there is cauſe.) But every Church muſt have ſuch as have the <hi>whole power,</hi> as far as concerneth the People of that Church.</p>
               <p>41. To divide the eſſential parts of the Sacred Office, (as to give one the power of <hi>Teaching</hi> only, another of <hi>Worſhiping</hi> only; and another of Ruling only; or any two of theſe without the third, is to deſtroy it, and change the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as much as in them lieth that do it.) And as no one is a <hi>man</hi> without his Animal, Vital and Natural parts; ſo no one is a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor without the threefold power forementioned, of Teaching, Rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Church by Paſtoral means, and Conducting them in publick Worſhip. He may be a Paſtor that is hindered from the exerciſe of ſome one of theſe or more; but not he that hath not the <hi>Power</hi> in his Office. Dividers therefore make new Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Offices, and deſtroy the old.</p>
               <p>42. Churches headed by ſuch a new ſort of Officers, ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the old of Chriſt's Inſtitution, are Churches ſpecifically differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Churches which Chriſt Inſtituted: Becauſe the Society is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of its Head or Governour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61252:29"/>43. To make a new ſort of Church-Heads or Rulers, as their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts, is to make a new ſort of Churches.</p>
               <p>44. The three forſaid Eſſential parts of the Paſtoral Office are not to be exerciſed by any Lay-man, nor by any man that hath not that Office: Nor may the Paſtors do that work <hi>per alios,</hi> or delegate Lay-men, or men of another Office to do it as in their ſtead. For the Office is nothing but juſt <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> to do that work: And if they convey ſuch <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> to another, they convey the <hi>Office</hi> to another; And ſo he is no longer a Lay-man, or of another Office only.</p>
               <p>45. Therefore though many Paſtors of the ſame Office may in a great Church diſtribute the work among them, yet none of them muſt do it only as the delegate of another, not having himſelf from God the Office which containeth the power of doing it.</p>
               <p>46. But the <hi>Accidentals</hi> of the Paſtoral Office may be committed to a Lay-man, or one that is no Paſtor (As to ſummon Aſſemblies, to keep Regiſters, or the Church Books, Goods, Buildings, with many the like:) And ſo ſome think that the Apoſtles inſtituting Deacons was but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the Accidentals of their Office to other men. Therefore if Chancellors did only theſe accidental works (or Lay Elder either) and meddled not with the ſacred power of the Keys, we ſhould not be ſo quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome, as to condemn their undertaking, unleſs it were for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.</p>
               <p>47. We doubt not but in a Church that hath many Paſtors, thoſe that are young and weak ſhould much ſubmit to the elder and more able, and be as far ruled by them, as the difference of age, experience and abilities, without a difference of Office, doth require.</p>
               <p>48. And we doubt not, but where Temples and Church-maintenance are at the diſpoſe of Patrons, People or Magiſtrates, they may give them to ſome one Paſtor as the preſent poſſeſſor, ſo that no other ſhall have part but by his conceſſion. And this difference there is between the Parſon and his Curates in our Pariſhes, and an accidental ſuperiority and inferiority thereby, without a difference of Office.</p>
               <p>49. If Magiſtrates, or Councils, or Cuſtome, ſhould in each particular Church that hath many Paſtors, give one a Governing, that is a negative voice among the reſt, in the management of the affairs of that Church, ſo that the reſt ſhould not go againſt him or without him, as Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops now are over Biſhops, and Archpresbyters were formerly over Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and Archdeacons over Deacons, and Preſidents over Colleges, and Courts of Juſtice, without claiming a diſtinct Office; though the ſad experience of Mens inclination to Church-tyranny, make us doubtful whether we ſhould wiſh for ſuch an inequality, yet would we not unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſturb or quarrel with ſuch an Order, when it is ſettled: Our Pariſh Order aforeſaid being indeed but ſuch.</p>
               <p>50. Whether God himſelf hath appointed another ſort of Biſhops who may be better called Archbiſhops, as Succeſſors of the Apoſtles in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61252:29"/>
Ruling part of their Office; and whether theſe have not a Power above particular Church Paſtors in Ordinations, and in the overſight of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors themſelves, and in the Care of many Churches, I have long ago con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is a Caſe of too much difficulty for me to determine. On the one ſide, though the Apoſtles have no Succeſſors in the extraordinary and temporary part of their Office, yet Church-government being an ordinary and permanent part, as doctrine is, I can hardly think that when we find one Form of Church-government inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing till the end of that Age, that we ſhould preſume to ſay that this Form then ceaſed and another muſt ſucceed it without good proof. What we find enacted and ſetled muſt ſtand, till we can prove it abrogate. And unleſs it were a thing which in the nature of it were temporary, it ſeemeth a harſh imputation of mutability, to feign Chriſt to ſet up a Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhould be in force but for an hundred years. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide it puzleth me, 1. to find it ſo hard to prove, that the Apoſtles themſelves did indeed exerciſe any Office power over other Paſtors, which one may not do towards another, over and above that which accrewed to them from the meer extraordinary advantage of their gifts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical proper work: 2. And to find it ſo obſcure, whether they ſettled any as their Succeſſors in that ſuperiority of power which they had.</p>
               <p>51. But being in ſuch doubt, and being uncertain whether ſuch Arch-Biſhops or Apoſtolical Succeſſors in the points of Ordination and overſight of many Churches, be of Divine right or not, I reſolve not to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ſuch Order, nor to diſobey any juſt commands of ſuch, nor to reproach the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the Churches.</p>
               <p>52. And though I know that Paſtors ſhould not unneceſſarily be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any aliene works, yet if it pleaſe the Magiſtrate to commit ſome of his power of Church-government by the Sword, (about things extrinſick, to the Paſtoral Office) into the hands of ſome Miniſters as his Officers, and if he call them Biſhops, and command us to obey them, and if he make them Barons, and endow them with Lordſhips and great revenues, though I ſee the great peril to the Church from hence, by reaſon of mens pride and worldlineſs; yet will I not reproach this Order, nor deny any juſt obedience to any ſuch Officers of the King.</p>
               <p>53. If any acknowledging the Paſtors of each Church to have the whole Paſtoral Office, and <hi>power of the Keys</hi> of that Church which he overſeeth, ſhall yet affirm that the aforeſaid ſuperiour General Biſhops (or Arch-Biſhops) have a <hi>ſuperiour power of the Keys,</hi> and therefore ſhall have the deciſion of controverſies that ariſe in particular Churches between the Paſtors and the People, and that appeals may be made by the people to them, and that they may viſit the particular Churches at their pleaſure, and have power to cenſure the particular Biſhops (or Paſtors) when they deſerve it, or to Ordain Miniſters, remove them, and depoſe them as there is juſt cauſe, (by bare ſentence, and the peoples conſent,) and all this <hi>jure divino,</hi> as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in their Government, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61252:30"/>
to ſuch Archbiſhops (or General Biſhops) as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> I ſhall not contend againſt any of this, for the reaſons aforeſaid, being uncertain of the thing in queſtion. But if I muſt be put to ſubſcribe, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all this to be true, (as if it were an Article of my Faith) the ſame uncertainty would forbid me.</p>
               <p>54. And here I muſt take occaſion to ſay, that I take unneceſſary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Declarations, Promiſes and Oaths, to be one of the chiefeſt of the Devil's Engines, to divide Chriſt's Churches, and to fiſh out thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that make conſcience of perjury and lying, and to turn them out of the work of Chriſt, and to leave in thoſe that do not, (when Conſcience can find but any ſhifting pretence;) And how fit ſuch are for the Sacred Miniſtry, and whoſe ſervants really they are, and how they are like to do Chriſt's work, and what a Caſe the Churches will be in that have ſuch, and what the effects will be with the common people, and how the lovers of Godlineſs will reſent all this, and what elſe will follow hereupon, I leave to the Reader that hath the brains of a man, or ever opened his eyes to mark what is done abroad in the World, or that ever read with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation the things that in other Ages have befallen the Churches, or that knoweth what relation light hath to darkneſs, good to evil, and Chriſt to <hi>Belial.</hi> I think that the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and the matters of our <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> are ſo to be diſtinguiſhed, as that there is a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Believing</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> and therefore we may be called to profeſs that we do <hi>Believe them;</hi> And for the other, (the <hi>Agenda</hi>) we muſt be called to <hi>Do</hi> them, (and if they be plain and neceſſary duties of our Religion, being to be <hi>Believed</hi> to be <hi>Duties</hi> before we do them, we may ſometime be put to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Belief.) But <hi>duties</hi> of humane impoſition, or of doubtful nature, may <hi>be done</hi> as <hi>things lawful</hi> by thouſands of peaceable men, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay or ſwear that they are duties; or may be done as of humane obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by thoſe that cannot ſay they are of Divine obligation.</p>
               <p>55. We hold that the firſt Churches that did divolve all arbitrations of differences among Chriſtians upon the Paſtors, did that which brought no great preſent inconvenience, when the People were but few and the Paſtors had ſufficient leiſure; but that which prepared for the degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Miniſtry and the Churches lamentable corruption; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould have foreſeen this, and done as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directed them, and referred matters to any fit [<hi>wiſe man among them.</hi>] And when they ſaw the miſchief, they ſhould have quickly reformed it, as <hi>Silvanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troas</hi> aforementioned did: And that if there were Lay Elders in any of the ancient Churches, (as one paſſage in <hi>Origen,</hi> and one in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and this of <hi>Silvanus</hi> in <hi>Socrates</hi> have made ſome think) they were truly Lay, and appointed only to ſuch Arbitrations as theſe, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animadverſions over the reſt, as Lay-men may do; (A help that I once tryed and found to be very great.)</p>
               <p>56. We hold that when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gave the Clergy the ſole Power of Judging the Cauſes (Civil and Criminal) of all the Chriſtians, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61252:30"/>
more ignorant zeal, than true diſcretion, and did let in a peſtilence into the Church; and that inſtead of that he ſhould have only left Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations to mans free choice, and have ſet up a Chriſtian or Righteous Magiſtracy, to whom both Biſhops and all other Chriſtians ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p>57. We hold that when Chriſtians ſo multiplyed, as that they grew uncapable of <hi>Perſonal Communion,</hi> at <hi>one Altar,</hi> it was the duty of them and the Biſhops, to have ordered them into new Churches, whcih ſhould every one have had its proper Biſhop, or plenary Paſtoral Office among them; and not to have kept them all ſtill in the name of one particular Church (<hi>infimi ordinis</hi>) when they were uncapable of the nature and end.</p>
               <p>58. We hold that it was ſinfully done, to make a new Office or Order of <hi>ſubject Presbyters,</hi> that had not the Governing power of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, neither alone, nor conjunct; but had only the power to Teach and Worſhip, the Government being reſerved only to the Biſhop of another (called a Mother) Church.</p>
               <p>59. But we believe that this came not in till many hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and that but by ſlow degrees, and that after ſubordinate Churches and Altars were invented, and ſet up, yet the Paſtors under the name of Presbyters, had much of the Governing power (of the Keys) though with and under the Biſhop of the Mother Church.</p>
               <p>60. The depoſing of all the firſt rank or Order of Biſhops, which were before over each particular Church, the making of a new Office of half Presbyters, the making of Churches of a new <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as being under a new ſort of Officers, the making Archbiſhops, who ſhould have many Churches and Biſhops under them, to become the Biſhops of the loweſt rank, having none under them; but above all theſe, the making of the Paſtoral work, eſpecially diſcipline become utterly impoſſible, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that into one mans hand, that cannot be done but by many (or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred,) theſe and ſuch like are the things that we can neither ſwear to nor approve.</p>
               <p>61. We hold that though the Magiſtrate may ſhape his part of the Church Government variouſly, according to the Intereſt of the common good, yet that the Spiritual or Paſtoral part ſhould not have been mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the ſhape of the Civil Imperial Government; And that ſo doing did give the Papacy that countenance which is the ground of its uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>62. For we hold that the <hi>eſſential conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Paſtoral Office,</hi> and <hi>its work,</hi> and the eſſential conſtitution of the <hi>Church Univerſal,</hi> and of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> (or particular) <hi>Churches,</hi> are all of Divine unalterable Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And that all Laws of Chriſt for ſuch Conſtitution, and for Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, are unalterable by man: Though we hold that Circumſtancials and Accidentals are alterable, as being not ſetled by any Divine determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. (As <hi>e. g.</hi> how many Miniſters ſhall be in each Church, which of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61252:31"/>
them ſhall be more regarded than the reſt, as being of greater wiſdom, how oſt and when and where they ſhall aſſemble, with many the like.)</p>
               <p>63. We hold that as all Chriſtians (ordinarily) ſhould have <hi>perſonal Communion</hi> in particular Churches, ſo thoſe Churches and their Biſhops ſhould hold ſuch Communion as is needful to their ſtrength and concord, and the common good.</p>
               <p>64. This Communion of Churches is to be held internally by Concord in the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and externally by the ſame <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and <hi>inſtrumentally,</hi> 1. by Meſſengers and Letters, and, 2. by Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Synods when there is need; (which as is ſaid, for Time, Place, Numbers, Provinces, Orders, are left to humane Prudence.)</p>
               <p>65. If any that divide the Country into Provinces, will ſettle Synods accordingly, and ſettle over them Preſidents for the ordering of their proceedings, and will give power to one above others, to call ſuch Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and will call theſe Provinces, or Nations, or Empires, by the name of Provincial, National, or Imperial Churches, and the Biſhops ſo exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of Metropolitans, Primates, Patriarchs, &amp;c. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not againſt this as unlawful in it ſelf (though we eaſily ſee the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal danger, being taught it by long and ſad experience;) ſo be it, 1. that none of theſe be pretended to be of Divine Inſtitution, but of humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; 2. and that they meddle with nothing but ſuch accidentals as are left to humane prudence; 3. and that they equal not their humane Aſſociation with the Chriſtian Worſhiping Churches, which are of Chriſt's Inſtitution, 4. and that much leſs they do not oppreſs their brethren, and tyrannize, nor deprive the particular Paſtors and Churches of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per priviledges and work. But alas when were theſe Rules obſerved by humane Churches?</p>
               <p>66. The Canons of ſuch Synods or Councils of Biſhops, may be made Laws indeed by the Civil power, and they are (if juſt) obligatory to the people, by virtue of the Paſtoral Authority of the Biſhops: But as to the particular Biſhops, they are only <hi>Agreements,</hi> and no proper Laws (the Major Vote of Biſhops being not proper Governours of the reſt) and bind only by virtue of Chriſt's General Laws for Love and Concord.</p>
               <p>67. The Paſtoral power is not at all Coactive by ſecular force, on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or eſtate, but only Nunciative and perſwaſive, commanding in Chriſt's name as authorized by him, and executed no otherwiſe than by a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial word,</hi> and by with-holding our own acts of Adminiſtration, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our Communion to offenders: Nor did the Apoſtles themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any other than this power of the <hi>Word</hi> (for the Keys are exerciſed but thus) excepting what they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did by Miracle. And if Biſhops would go no further, they would work on none but Voluntiers, and their uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be the more eaſily born.</p>
               <p>67. And indeed we are fully perſwaded, that none but Voluntiers are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61252:31"/>
the unwilling that had but rather endure it than a Priſon, is a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of it, and a cheat to poor ſouls, and a horrid corrupting of Chriſt's Churches and Ordinances.</p>
               <p>68. If wilful Church-corruptions have made any places uncapable of a preſent conformity to Chriſt's Inſtitutions, their incapacity muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the meaſure and rule of our Reformation; But a true Conformity to the Inſtitution muſt be intended and endeavoured, though all cannot come up to it at the firſt.</p>
               <p>69. We do not hold that every Corruption in Number, or Officers, or Order, nullifieth a Church, or maketh all Communion with it unlawful, as long as the eſſential conſtitution doth remain. Yea, though my own judgment is, that every Church in Town or Country ſhould have a Biſhop, yet if they would but ſet up one Biſhop with his aſſiſtant Presbyters in every Corporation and Great Town, with the neighbour Villages, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the antient practiſe, from the middle of the third Century for many following; ſo that true diſcipline might but be made poſſible to them that had a heart to practice it, I ſhould greatly rejoyce in ſuch a Reformation; much more, if every Pariſh Paſtor were reſtored to all the parts of his Office, though he exerciſed all under the Government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>70. We hold the Pariſh Churches of <hi>England,</hi> that have true Miniſters (that are, not utterly uncapable through Ignorance, Hereſie, Inſufficiency, or Wickedneſs,) to be true Churches of Chriſt; But that is, becauſe we hold the particular Miniſters to be true Biſhops (<hi>Epiſcopos Gregis etſi non Epiſcoporum,</hi>) and to have the power of the Keys over all their Flocks: And that is, becauſe we hold that it is not in our Biſhops power to deprive them of it though they would; And becauſe we hold that when Chriſt hath inſtituted and deſcribed the Office of a Paſtor or Presbyter, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers ordain a man to that Office, their power ſhall be judged of by Chriſts inſtitution, and not by the Ordainers will, though he miſtake or would maim and change it by his wrong deſcription. And that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer is but a Miniſterial Inveſter, delivering poſſeſſion according to his Maſters will and not his own: And as long as Chriſt giveth to Paſtors the power of the Keys, and they themſelves conſent to receive and uſe them, (eſpecially if the People alſo conſent to the exerciſe of them) it is not the Biſhops <hi>will</hi> or <hi>words</hi> that can nullifie this power. And if this Anſwer were not good, I confeſs, I were not able to Anſwer a <hi>Browniſt,</hi> who ſaith, that we have no true Publick Churches of God's Inſtitution, Dioceſan Churches being but Humane, if they had Biſhops in each Church under them, and being ſinful when they have none, and Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being Humane or null, as having no Biſhops of their own, nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Chriſt's Inſtitution, but half Paſtors; and therefore being but part of a Dioceſan Church. But all this is ſufficiently anſwered by our foreſaid Reaſons; which no high Prelatiſt can ſoundly anſwer.</p>
               <p>71. I do hold that thoſe Pariſh Aſſemblies, that have no Miniſters, [but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61252:32"/>
ſuch as are uncapable, either through notorious Ignorance, or Hereſie, or utter Inſufficiency as to the Eſſentials of their Office, or by diſclaiming themſelves any Eſſential part of the Paſtoral Office, or by notorious Preaching againſt Godlineſs, and oppoſing the Churches neceſſary good,] are indeed no true Churches of Chriſt, but only are Analogically or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally ſo called; As you may call a Community of Chriſtians that have no Paſtor or Church, which is no Organized or Political Society.</p>
               <p>72. But yet I think it not ſimply unlawful to joyn at any time with ſuch an Aſſembly: For I may joyn with a Chriſtian Family, or occaſional Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, though not as with a Church.</p>
               <p>73. We hold that all the Chriſtians in the World (in particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or out) do make up one Catholick or Univerſal Church: which is Myſtical and Inviſible, in that, 1. the Faith of Mens minds is Inviſible, 2. and Chriſt is Inviſible to us Mortals now he is in Heaven. But it is alſo Viſible, 1. In reſpect of the Members and their outward Baptiſm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, 2. and becauſe that Chriſt the Head was once Viſible on Earth, and is ſtill Viſible in Heaven to the Glorified part (as the King is to his Courtiers, when the reſt of the Kingdom ſeeth him not.) and will Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appear again to all.</p>
               <p>74. We hold that this Univerſal Church is One in Chriſt alone, and that it hath no other King or Head; That he hath Inſtituted no Vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Head, either Pope or General Council; Nor is any mortal man or men capable of ſuch an Office.</p>
               <p>75. We hold therefore that the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope (and General Councils, if they claim ſuch an Headſhip) is an Uſurper of part of Chriſt's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; which having uſurped he hath uſed againſt Chriſt, and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; againſt the Soveraignty of Princes, and againſt the true Unity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Peace and Holineſs of the Churches.</p>
               <p>76. And we hold that it was the modelling of the Church to the Policy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which gave the Pope the advantage for this uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Papal Church is a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Humane Form, and an Imperial Church, as much as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the reſt of <hi>England</hi> is of Man, and that Body ſo united is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church: And that the General Councils were never truly General, as to all the Churches in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Imperial Church; None conſiderable ever coming to ſuch Councils, but thoſe that were or had been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, or ſome very few that cloſely bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on them: Nor had the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour (who uſually called, or gave his Warrant for ſuch Councils, or Governed them) any power over the Clergy of all the reſt of the Chriſtian World, (in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the outer <hi>Armenia, Perſia, India, &amp;c.</hi>) Nor did the Imperial Pope then exerciſe any power over them. And we are perſwaded that the power of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Jeruſalem, Conſtantinople, and of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, Primates, &amp;c.</hi> ſtood on the ſame foundation with the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Pope, and that one is no more of Divine right than the other;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61252:32"/>
But that the Papacy is the far more wicked Uſurpation, as pretending to more of Chriſt's Prerogative.</p>
               <p>77. We hold therefore that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as ſuch, that is, as pretending to be the Church-Catholick, Headed by an (Uſurping) Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, is no true Church of Chriſt, but a Humane and traiterous Uſurpation and conſpiracy, therefore by Proteſtants called Antichriſtian: Though thoſe that are true Chriſtians among them are Parts of Chriſt's Catholick Church, and thoſe that are true Paſtors among them, may be the Guides of true particular Churches.</p>
               <p>78. We hold therefore that no Power on Earth, Popes, Council or Prince, hath power to make Univerſal Laws to bind the whole Church of Chriſt on Earth, becauſe there is no Univerſal Head or Soveraign but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>79. By all this it is evident that we grant all theſe following diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the Church: 1. The diſparity of Age, ſtanding, and Gifts among Miniſters of the ſame Order: 2. A kind of paternal priority where one was the Teacher, Educater, or Ordainer of the other. 3. An accidental diſparity, when one only by the Patron or Magiſtrate hath the ſole poſſeſſion of the Maintenance and power of the Temple. 4. We will not unpeaceably contend againſt the guiding power or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Vote of One Biſhop in a particular Church over the reſt of the Paſtors of the ſame Office; Nor do we take ſuch a power to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Office. 5. We do not ſtrive againſt the Preſidency of one, in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, as Moderator; No though it were <hi>durante vitâ</hi> (which Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> thought would ſerve to heal us.) 6. We do not deny Obedience to any Biſhop, who is Commiſſioned by the King, to exerciſe as a Church-Magiſtrate, his part of the Church-Government. 7. Much leſs do we ſtrive againſt the Power of Kings and Lawful Magiſtrates <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> (of which <hi>Grotius</hi> hath excellently written <hi>de Imper.</hi>) But we take the Magiſtrate to be the neceſſary and only Ruler by the Sword, to keep Peace and Order among Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, as well as among men of all other Profeſſions. 8. Yea, I do not contend againſt the Divine Right of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Biſhops, (or Archbiſhops) ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> nor will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obedience to them, who take care as Viſitors of Many Churches, which have every one their proper Biſhop, one or more, with true ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtoral power of the Keys, to guide the people of their charge. 9. We refuſe not to receive Ordination from ſuch General Biſhops. 10. Nor do we refuſe to be reſponſible to them, when we are accuſed of any male Adminiſtration, or to admit of Appeals from us to them.</p>
               <p>80. By all which it appeareth, 1. How falſly we are charged to be againſt all Epiſcopacy. 2. And how falſly and deceitfully all thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtate the Caſe and plead againſt us, that only plead for a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational or Parochial Epiſcopacy, or any of this which we grant; and how they cheat their Readers, who make them believe, that our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is, whether there ſhould be <hi>any Epiſcopacy,</hi> and not what <hi>kind</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61252:33"/>
it ſhould be. 3. What friends they will prove to the Church, that will rather do all that is done againſt it, than endure thoſe that grant all this which we do grant them.</p>
               <p>81. That I am not ſingular in all this, I prove in that it was only Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Reduction of Epiſcopacy to the Primitive ſtate, which the Nonconformiſts, (malitiouſly called Presbyterians) did offer to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the Biſhops, 1660. as the means of our Concord, and which was rejected: Yea, that they <note n="*" place="margin">The Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the King is to be ſeen in Print: As alſo their deſire of B.

               <p>And now, I ſuppoſe, I have given <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Poſterity</hi> a truer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Judgment of the preſent Nonconformiſts, than malicious turbulent ambitious Perſons uſe to give of them, or than the extreams and freaks of a few Sectaries would allow men to receive.</p>

               <p>I Have not been altogether negligent to read the Controverſies on this Subject, nor I hope partial in Reading them; If I have, it hath been becauſe I had rather have found Conformity to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy to be lawful; for then I had not above <note n="*" place="margin">Now 18 years, this being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 9 years ago.</note> nine years been ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and denied not only all Church maintenance, but leave to preach Chriſt's Goſpel, nor had I been expoſed as I have been to ſo much wrath and malice, expreſſed in ſo many ſcurrilous lying invectives and libells, beſides other ways. Even when I doubted of the uſe of the tranſient Image of the Croſs, I was of opinion that Prelacy was lawful, and ſo was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue, if the Prelates would have given me leave: But in 1640, they put a New Oath upon us, <hi>Never to Conſent to the Alteration</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent frame of Prelacy, as under Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, &amp;c. and that it <hi>ought ſo to ſtand.</hi> And I thought it was then time, when I was put to ſuch a ſolemn Oath, to ſearch more throughly into all the matter before I ſware. And in ſearching, I found in general that almoſt all Writers for Epiſcopacy, either confound Dioceſan Prelacy, ſuch as ours, with the Epiſcopacy of a ſingle Church, or at leaſt all their proof extendeth to no more than I have here granted. When they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61252:33"/>
offer us the definition of a Biſhop (which few of them do) it is ſuch as neither ſuppoſeth any more Churches than one to be his Charge, nor any Presbyters under him at all; but only a Power of Ordaining Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ruling them when he hath them, whether in one Church or more.</p>
               <p>And I find that they are ſo far from proving that ever the Apoſtles appointed a diſtinct Office of Presbyters which had not the power of the Keys over the People, <hi>in foro interiore &amp; exteriore</hi> (as they call them) but had only power to Teach and Worſhip, under Biſhops as a ſuperior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Order, as that they prove not any ſuch to have ever been under the Apoſtles themſelves; and ſome of themſelves do plainly deny it: Nor do they prove that long after the Presbyters were any more ſubject to the Biſhops, than the Deacons are now to the Archdeacon, or the Biſhops to the Archbiſhop, who are of the ſame Order. So that whoever elſe they ſpeak to, they ſay nothing to me, and ſeem not to know where the Controverſie lyeth, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Whether a Biſhop of the loweſt rank</hi> (being <hi>no Archbiſhop,</hi> or having no Biſhops under him) over many Churches, (or Societies of Chriſtians ſtated under their proper Paſtors, or Presbyters, for ordinary perſonal Communion in all God's publick Worſhip,) be of <hi>Divine,</hi> or Lawful Humane, Inſtitution? 2. Whether an Order or Office of Presbyters that have not the power of the Keys even <hi>in foro exteriore,</hi> be of Divine, or Lawful Humane Inſtitution? (whom for brevity I ſhall hereafter call <hi>half-Presbyters.</hi>) So that the Queſtion is not, whether one Man was after ſometime called peculiarly the Biſhop, and in the ſame Church ſate over Presbyters of the ſame Office, as Archpresbyters, or as Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons over Deacons, or Archbiſhops over Biſhops; Nor yet whether there were or ſhould be a General ſort of Biſhops (or Archbiſhops) over the Biſhops of particular Churches? But whether any ſtated Body of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping Chriſtians, as afore deſcribed (like our Pariſh Churches that have <hi>unum altare</hi>) ſhould be without a Biſhop of their own, or without a Paſtor that hath the threefold power before deſcribed, of Leading the People in Doctrine Worſhip and Diſcipline, called the power of the Keys? And whether he be a true Presbyter or Miniſter of Chriſt that wants this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? And whether they that depoſe the Pariſh Miniſters of this power, do not degrade the Presbyters, nullifie the Churches under them, and depoſe the ancient ſort of Epiſcopacy <hi>quantum in ſe?</hi> and ſet up another Humane ſort of Churches called Dioceſan, and of Archbiſhops turned into Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>infimi gradus,</hi> in their ſtead, together with a new <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Presbyters?</hi>

How far <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s Diſputations againſt <hi>Cartwright</hi> are guilty of this<note place="margin">Whitgift.</note> overlooking the true Queſtion, I leave to the Reader: Only I muſt ſay for him, that when his Adverſarie ſtandeth moſt upon the denial of all ſuperior Epiſcopacy, it was his part to prove what was denied.

Which granteth the main Queſtion which we Nonconformiſt now contend for. And I confes that <hi>Saravia</hi>'s Writings were the firſt and chief that brought me to ſuſpect that the Apoſtles have Succeſſors in the point of Government, as being but an ordinary and durable part of their Office: which Argument he hath better managed than any man elſe that I have ſeen.

And yet were theſe People without any proper Paſtor? Without a Prelate? it's like they were. Yea, when <hi>Paul</hi> directeth them to deliver the inceſtuous man to Satan, and to exerciſe Church-diſcipline upon others that were ſcandalous, doth not this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that they had among them ſuch as were impowred to do it? If only tranſiently and occaſionally, they could Worſhip God publickly and deliver Sacraments, and Govern the Church but tranſiently and rarely: How did they ſpend the Lords days, when thoſe tranſient guides were

Did the major part of the people, who <hi>Saravia</hi> thinketh were to exerciſe the foreſaid Diſcipline, alſo Conſecrate and Adminiſter the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</note> Sacrament, or publickly pray and worſhip God without a Paſtor? Were they every Lords day to depoſit their Collections, and have no Paſtors, and ſo no Church-Aſſemblies? Had they ſo many Sects and falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to trouble them, and yet no Paſtors? When <hi>Clem.

And ſo you have what muſt be expected from Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> for the information of you, what Epiſcopacy he pleads for: Where it is obvious how fraudulently (through overſight or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality I know not) he dealeth: For whereas he durſt put no more into the definition of Epiſcopacy about Juriſdiction but [<hi>a power of Chiefty in Government over Presbyters as well as Lay-men.</hi>] yet would not tell us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> (under the Biſhop) belong to the Presbyters or not: His words ſeem plainly to imply it; what uſe elſe is there for his [<hi>Chiefly</hi>] and [<hi>as well as Lay-men.</hi>] And yet twice over he would name nothing but, <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> which belong to the Paſtor as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor in general; leaving it as a thing which he would neither affirm nor deny, whether Paſtors Governed their Flocks. Yet all that Decantate Book turneth on the Hinges of this lame Definition (which hath other defects which I paſs by;) And without this we cannot know what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he diſputeth of. Whereas <hi>Saravia</hi> well noted and acknowledged three Eſſential parts of the Miniſtry in General, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> who leaveth out one of them, and yet durſt not deny it, ſhould have told us, whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it or not; ſeeing it is the matter of moſt of our difference; and we take him for no Paſtor or Presbyter that is without the <hi>power</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor that to be a true Church (<hi>in ſenſu politico</hi>) that hath no other Paſtor.</p>
               <p>2.

When, alas, we poor undertrodden Perſons, not only deſired to be low our ſelves, but yielded to ſubmit to all their heights, their Lordſhips, Parliament dignities, grandure, and to let them alone with their (real) ſole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ordination and Juriſdiction over us poor Presbyters, and to have taken as much care of the People as they would, ſo we could but have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any tolerable degree of Government to be ſetled in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, either in all the Presbyters or in one Biſhop, and not have had all the particular Churches deprived of Biſhops and all the Paſtoral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
               <p>But our great Controverſie is handled by Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> in his ſecond Book, wherein he laboureth to prove that the Biſhops Church, or rather Charge, was not a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> but a <hi>Dioceſs.</hi> And firſt, <hi>page</hi> 4. he giveth us a ſcheme of the Scripture acception of the word [<hi>Church</hi>] as preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his deſign: In which there are many Texts cited, not only without any ſhew of proof, that they ſpeak of what he affirmeth them to ſpeak, but contrary to the plain ſcope of the places. And he tells us that the <hi>word</hi> [<hi>Church</hi>] <hi>is used in Scripture for the Church Militant Congregated in an Univerſal or Occumenical Synod:</hi> And offereth us not one Text for inſtance,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61252:38"/>
which he doth though injuriouſly, for all the reſt: Nor is there any that ſo ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>He tells us that the word is uſed <hi>particularly to ſignifie the Church of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſingular number;</hi> but could name no ſuch place as to any Church ſince Chriſt, but only the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
               <p>And he ſaith, it is uſed to ſignifie, <hi>particularly and definitely the Church of a Nation in the plural number.</hi> And is not this a ſtrange kind of Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Scripture ſpeaketh of [<hi>the Churches in a Nation.</hi>] Therefore it uſeth the word for the <hi>Church of a Nation, in the plural number.</hi> Is <hi>one Church</hi> and <hi>many</hi> all one with him: Would he have applauded that man that would have ſaid, that ſuch an Author uſeth the word [<hi>College</hi>] (for the College of an Univerſity in the plural number,) because he named the College in an Univerſity? and this to prove that an Univerſity is one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege? Had it not been better ſaid, The New Teſtament never uſeth the word <hi>Church</hi> for all the Churches in one Nation (ſince Chriſt) definitely, but ever calleth them plurally Churches: Therefore to call them all <hi>One (National) Church</hi> is not to imitate the Scripture.</p>
               <p>His firſt Inſtance is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>All the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi> A ſad proof of a <hi>National Church!</hi> What Nation is it that the word [<hi>Gentiles</hi>] ſignifieth? No doubt the Gentile Churches were in Gentile Nations: But that doth not prove that the Chriſtians in any Nation are ever called in Scripture (ſince the Jews Nation) <hi>One Church</hi> but <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next inſtance is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>The Churches of Galatia:</hi> And the reſt are all ſuch, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2. 22. The Churches of <hi>Aſia, Macedonia, Judaea:</hi> But I hope he intended no more than to tell you that the Chriſtians of ſeveral Nations, are never called a <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> as having any ſort of Union than National.</p>
               <p>He giveth many inſtances when the word [<hi>Church</hi>] is uſed definitely to ſignifie the <hi>Church of a City and Country adjoyning:</hi> But to prove it uſed to ſignifie <hi>ſeveral Churches</hi> in City and Country adjoyning, but <hi>one only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Texts he alledgeth to prove that the word [<hi>Church</hi>] is uſed definitely to ſignifie theſe Churches Congregate into a Synod or Conſiſtory: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his word of neither place. One is <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Tell the Church, &amp;c.</hi> If I ſay that [<hi>tell the Church</hi>] ſignifieth [<hi>tell the Society containing Paſtors and Chriſtians</hi>] though it is the Paſtors that you muſt immediately ſpeak to and the offender muſt hear, I give as good proof of my expoſition as he doth of his. If I ſpeak to a <hi>man,</hi> and hear a <hi>man,</hi> though it be only his <hi>ears</hi> that <hi>hear</hi> me, and his <hi>tongue</hi> that ſpeaketh to me, yet by the word [<hi>man</hi>] I mean not only <hi>ears</hi> and <hi>tongue.</hi> If the King ſend a Command to a <hi>Corporation</hi> to expel a ſeditious member, though the Mayor or Aldermen only do it Authoritatively, and the People but executively, yet the word [<hi>Corporation</hi>] doth not therefore ſignifie the Officers only. The other Text is, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. But I will not believe him that [<hi>the whole Church</hi>] ſignifieth the Synod only: For though they only <hi>decreed</hi> it, I think the reſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61252:38"/>
conſented and approved it, and are meant in the word [<hi>the whole Church.</hi>]</p>
               <p>I grant him that (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1.) the word ſignifieth the Church of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or Town; But he will never prove that it is not meant of a Church of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> as City Churches were. And as to the Houſe or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Churches which he mentioneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. Dr. <hi>Hammond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> expoundeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. of the Church that did <hi>meet in his houſe,</hi> and ſo ſome do all the reſt: But that we ſtand not for, nor doth it concern us.</p>
               <p>But when he addeth a multitude of Texts, as uſing the word Church <hi>indefinitely,</hi> not defining the place, Society of a Nation or City, quantity, &amp;c. moſt of the inſtances brought are of Churches definite, as to <hi>place,</hi> and of the ſame Species as the Apoſtles Inſtituted; though when the Church of ſuch a place is ſaid to do a thing, it's no determination what number of the members did it. His firſt inſtance is <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. and next <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 3, 9, &amp;c. <hi>The Churches had reſt through all Judaea, and Gallile, and Samaria: Acts</hi> 15. 3. Speaks of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which <hi>v.</hi> 27. it's ſaid they gathered together: <hi>v.</hi> 4. mentioneth the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, v.</hi> 11. mentioneth the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia. Acts</hi> 18. 22. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Church at <hi>Caeſarea. Rom.</hi> 16. 16. Speaks of the Churches where <hi>Paul</hi> lately travelled. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Gaius</hi> was the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of a definite whole Church, at <hi>Corinth.</hi> And when 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. he ſpeaketh of his teaching in <hi>every</hi> Church, it is an Univerſal enunciation, but of Churches of a certain or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>p.</hi> 5. he telleth us what <hi>is truly and properly a Church on Earth;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Every company of men profeſſing the true faith of Chriſt is both tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Church and a true Church. Ans.</hi> Yes, As <hi>Canis caeleſtis</hi> is <hi>truly a Dog,</hi> and a <hi>true Dog:</hi> but not properly, but equivocally: A Church in its moſt famous ſignification is a <hi>Society</hi> conſtituted of the <hi>Paſtor</hi> and Flock, as a School of the Schoolmaſter and Schollars: And an accidental meeting of Chriſtians in a Market or Ship, is no more properly called a Church, than School-boys meeting in ſuch places are a School: No nor occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praying together neither.</p>
               <p>So <hi>p.</hi> 5. He concludeth that the Chriſtian People of one City, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adjoyning, whether Province or Dioceſs are one Church; yea of any Nation or part of the World, not becauſe under one Spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Prieſt-hood, but becauſe one People or Commonwealth ruled by the ſame Laws, profeſſing the ſame Religion. All this is <hi>de nomine</hi> only. But are we not likely to diſpute well, when we never agree of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or terms of the Queſtion? We have no mind to contend about Names: Let him call the World, or a Corporation, or Kingdom, or <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam Malignantium</hi> by the name of a Church if he will, ſo that we firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree what <hi>Church</hi> we diſpute of. We talk not of any accidental meeting or Community, but a Society before defined, <hi>conſtituted of the pars guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans</hi> and <hi>pars ſubdita.</hi> And of this ſort we know of Divine Inſtitution,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61252:39"/>
an <hi>Univerſal Church Headed by Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>particular Churches</hi> headed under him by their Biſhops or Paſtors: A Church without a <hi>Head,</hi> (in Fair, Ship, or Temple) we talk not of: Nor yet of a Church that hath but an Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, Extrinſick, and not an Eſſential Conſtitutive Head, to them, as they are Churches of Chriſt's Inſtitution: Whether it be the Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> or of <hi>Conſtantinople, Mahometan,</hi> Chriſtian, Papiſt, or Proteſtant, we believe that every Soveraign is ſo the Head, that is the Ruler of the Church, that is, of the Chriſtians in his Dominions. We denominate <hi>â formâ:</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> may denominate whence he pleaſe, <hi>à materiâ</hi> or <hi>ab accidente, &amp;c.</hi> and ſay, They are one Church that are under one Prince, Law, of one Religion. Do with your Equivocals what you will; But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not that it is a <hi>Pastoral particular</hi> Church of the Holy Ghoſt's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we Diſpute about. Otherwiſe I deny not Dioceſan, or Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Churches, nor deny that the Papal Kingdom is a Church of a certain <hi>ſpecies</hi> right or wrong.</p>
               <p>And forget not his Conceſſion <hi>p.</hi> 6. and we need no more, [<hi>Indeed at the very firſt converſion of Cities, the whole number of the People converted (being ſometimes not much greater than the number of the Presbyters placed among them) were able to make but a ſmall Congregation. But thoſe Churches were in Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, they were not fully Conſtituted, till their number being increaſed they had their Biſhop or Paſtor, their Presbyters and Deacons, without which,</hi> Ignatius <hi>ſaith, there was no Church, &amp;c.</hi>] Of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>h after.</p>
               <p>He next, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. laboureth much to prove that the words <hi>Eccleſia, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raecia,</hi> and <hi>Diocaeſis,</hi> of old were of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e ſignification; About words we have no mind to ſtrive: But all the proofs that he brings of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a Church to more than one Congregation or Altar, are fetcht from later times, when indeed Churches were transformed into Societies much different from thoſe before them.</p>
               <p>He citeth <hi>Concil. Carth.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 42, 43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that places that had no Biſhops before ſhould not receive Biſhops without the conſent of the Biſhop whom they were before under. Indeed by theſe Canons we ſee much of the ſtate of the Church in thoſe times, and partly how the Caſe was altered. Every Church had a Biſhop of its own: Thoſe Churches were almoſt all firſt planted in Cities: The multitudes were Heathens: but the City Chriſtians with thoſe in the Country near them, were enow to make a Church or Congregation. In time ſo many were Converted in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Villages, that they were allowed Aſſemblies like our Chappels at home: And ſome of them had Country Biſhops ſet over them: And in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces greater Towns (which they then called Cities) were anew convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Presbyters that were abroad among theſe new Converts or ſcatered Chriſtians, made them know that every Church ſhould have a Biſhop, and that they might chooſe one of their own: And few Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being then Learned able men in Compariſon of the Biſhops, by this advantage of preſence among them, many raw and ſchiſmatical Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters crept into the Peoples affections, and perſwaded them to chooſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61252:39"/>
them for their Biſhops: when they were choſen and ordained, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on the reſt of the old Biſhops Dioceſs, and alſo refuſed to come to the Synods, leſt their failings ſhould be known, pretending that they muſt ſtay with their own People. Now the Biſhops that complained of this, did not alledge, 1. That no Biſhop ſhould be made but in a City, 2. Nor that when Chriſtians multiplyed, they muſt not multiply Biſhops accordingly, but all be under their firſt Biſhop only, 3. Nor that a new Congregation had not as good right to have and chuſe a Biſhop of their own, as the firſt City Congregation had. But only to keep ignorant Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Presbyters from deceiving the People for their own exaltation, and from hindering Synodical Concord, they Decreed that none in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſhould have Biſhops, without the firſt Biſhops conſent; And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo Conſecrated they ſhould frequent Synods, and ſhould be Biſhops on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that People that firſt choſe them, and not encroach on the reſt of the Dioceſs. And whereas he hence gathereth that the Country Churches [<hi>ever from the beginning belonged to the City Biſhops.</hi>] There were no ſuch things as Appendant Country Churches from the beginning of the City Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But it's true, that from the beginning of the Country Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, when they were not enow to make Churches themſelves, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the City Churches as Members (Even as now the Anabaptiſts and Independent Churches conſiſt of the People of Market-Towns, and the adjoyning Country Aſſociated into one Aſſembly.) After that the Country Meetings were but as Oratories or Chappels: And when they came to be enow to make dinſtinct Churches of, ſome good Biſhops had the Wit and Grace to help them to <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> Biſhops of their own; but moſt did chooſe rather to enlarge their own Poſſeſſions or Powers, and ſet Subject Presbyters only over the People.</p>
               <p>And that theſe new Biſhopricks muſt be by the old Biſhops conſent, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently a point of Order to avoid inconveniences (if not of Uſurpation:) For what power had the old Biſhop to keep any Church of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop of their own, when it was for there good?</p>
               <p>That he hath ſome countenance from <hi>Leo,</hi> for the New Church-Form (without Biſhops) I wonder not, when <hi>Leo</hi> was one of the hotteſt that betimes maintained the <hi>Roman</hi> Primacy, if not Univerſal Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>And as the Care againſt placing Biſhops in ſmall places, <hi>ne vileſcat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Epiſcopi,</hi> came in late, ſo 1. It intimateth that it was otherwiſe done, at leaſt by ſome before, 2. And it is but the Prelatical grandure which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had pufft up, which is then alledged as the Reaſon of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p>His Argument is, [<hi>That which was judged unlawful by the Canons of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Councils, and Decrees of Godly Biſhops, was never lawfully, regularly and ordinarily practiſed: But, &amp;c.</hi> I deny the Major. Kneeling at Prayer or Sacrament on the Lords day, the Marriage of Prieſts, the Reading of the Heathens Writings, and abundance ſuch-like, were forbidden by ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Councils; eſpecially a multitude of things depending on the new
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61252:40"/>
Imperial ſhape of the Churches, which are now lawful, and were lawful, and ordinarily practiſed before: <hi>Paul</hi> Kneeled and Prayed on the Lord's day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the placing of Biſhops in Country Pariſhes was not unlawful before, becauſe the Councils of Biſhops afterward forbad it, nor was it ever unlawful by Gods Law. Methinks a Biſhop that ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which mentioneth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils erring, even in matters of Faith, ſhould never have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they cannot erre in matter of Government, nor retract and alter that which was well practiſed before them.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is this, If there were any Pariſh Biſhops then, they were the <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> But the <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> were not ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I deny the Major: There were then many City Biſhops that were but Pariſh Biſhops, or had but one Church, as ſhall be further proved. 2. Yet as to a great number it is granted that their Dioceſſes had many Churches, at the time of <hi>Concil. Eliber. Sardic. &amp;c.</hi> which he mentioneth. But it followeth not that therefore it was ſo with any in the time of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> or with many in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. 3. If it were all granted <hi>de facto,</hi> it will not follow, that <hi>de jure,</hi> it was well done, and that the old Form was not ſinfully changed. 4. The <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> themſelves might have many Congregations under them, like our Chapels, and yet be Pariſh Biſhops; And it's moſt probable that at firſt they had no more than one of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Pariſhes, though afterwards they had many Churches under them, as City Biſhops had.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is, [<hi>Churches endued with Power Eccleſiaſtical, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Government of themſelves, having alſo a Biſhop and Presbytery, had the power of Ordination: But Country Pariſhes had not the Power of Ordination: Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Government is Inferiour or Superiour: They might have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inferiour power of Government, though they had none of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power, ſuch as belongeth to Archbiſhops, to whom Appeals were made: As a Corporation that hath a Mayor and Aſſiſtants hath ſufficient Inferiour power, but not Regal, nor ſuch as Judges, Lord Lieutenants, &amp;c. have. And if it were proved, (as ſome hold) that only General, or unfixed Miniſters, like the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, or Archbiſhops that were over many Churches, had the power of Ordination, and not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Biſhops of ſingle Churches, it would not follow that theſe Inferiour Biſhops had not the power of Governing their own Churches with aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyters: And if he will prove for us, that every fixed Biſhop hath the power of Ordination, who hath but the Inferiour power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſingle Church, by Admonitions, Excommunications, and Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will but do our work for us.</p>
               <p>2. I deny his Minor Propoſ. If by [Country Pariſhes] he mean [the Biſhops of Country Pariſhes] they had the <hi>Power</hi> of Ordination: And all that he ſaith againſt it, is only to prove, that <hi>de facto,</hi> they had not the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it in the times he mentioneth, and that <hi>de jure humano,</hi> it was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61252:40"/>
not allowed them by Canons. But, 3. We grant ſo much of the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as that <hi>de facto,</hi> few Country Pariſhes had a Biſhop and Presbytery: Becauſe there were but few Country Pariſhes in the World, till the third Century, that were really Chriſtian Churches, or fixed Societies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that had ordinary Church-communion together in the Sacrament, or had an Altar. But our Caſe is, <hi>About ſingle Churches,</hi> now called Pariſh Churches, and not about [<hi>Country Churches.</hi>] For they might be but <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> Pariſh Churches, though they were in Cities only, and the Country Members joyned with them in the Cities.</p>
               <p>And his own Confeſſion is, <hi>page</hi> 35. that beſides <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> that had many Churches in the City, <hi>there is not the like evidence for multitude of Pariſhes in other Cities, imediately after the Apoſtles times.</hi>] I ſuppoſe by his Citations, he meaneth till the third Century. And if this be granted us of all the great Cities of the World, that they cannot be proved to have many Churches, we have no great reaſon to look for many in the Country Villages.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is, [<hi>Churches containing within their Circuit, not only Cities with their Suburbs, but alſo whole Countries ſubject to them, were Dioceſſes. But the Churches, ſubject to the ancient Biſhops in the Primitive Church, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. Therefore they were Dioceſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Either this is his Deſcription of a Dioceſs, or we have none from him that I can find: And let who will Diſpute about the Names of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Pariſh, for I will not. And if by a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> he meaneth a Church conſiſting of all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in City and Country aſſociated for Perſonal holy Communion, having One Altar and One Biſhop, this is that which we call a <hi>ſingle Church,</hi> or ſome a Pariſh-Church, and if he call it a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he may pleaſe himſelf.</p>
               <p>But if he mean that in theſe Cities and whole Countries were ſeveral ſuch Churches, that had each an Altar, and were fixed Societies for perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal holy Communion, not having any proper Biſhop of their own, but one Biſhop in Common, with whoſe Cathedral Church, they did not, and could not Communicate, (through Number or diſtance) I deny his Minor propoſed in this ſenſe, as to the two firſt Centuries; though not as to the following Ages. But if by [<hi>Cities, Suburbs, and whole Countries ſubject</hi>] he mean all the unconverted Infidels of that ſpace (for doubtleſs he calls not the ſoil or place, the Church) I deny the very ſubject; There were no ſuch Churches: Infidels and Heathens make not Churches, (Though Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks made ſomewhat like them, <hi>ſicut veſpa faciunt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avos,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.) If the Dioceſan Churches Diſputed for, be Churches of Pagans and Infidels, we know no ſuch things.</p>
               <p>But if he mean that all the Heathens in that Circuit are the Biſhops Charge in order to Converſion, I anſwer, 1. That maketh them no parts of the Church: Therefore the Church is of never the larger extent for the ſoil or Infidel Inhabitants. 2. The Apoſtles, and other General Preachers (like the Jeſuits in the <hi>Indies</hi>) may divide their Labourers by Provinces
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61252:41"/>
for the Peoples Convetſion, before there be any Churches at all. 3. This diſtribution is a meer prudential Ordering of an accident or circumſtance; and therefore not the Divine Inſtitution of a Church Form or Species. 4. Neither Scripture nor prudence ſo diſtributeth Circuits or Provinces to Preachers, in order to converſion of Infidels, as that other Preachers may not come and Preach there, as freely as one that claimeth it as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For, 1. Chriſt ſent out his Apoſtles by two and two at firſt. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>Barnabas</hi> or ſome other Evangeliſt or General Preacher uſually with him. And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are both ſaid to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: And many Apoſtles were long together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even many years after Chriſt's Reſurrection. Chriſt that bid them go into all the World, never commanded that one ſhould not come where another was, nor have power to Preach to Infidels in that Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>And what is the Epiſcopal power over Infidels, which is claimed? It is not a power to <hi>Ordain,</hi> or to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> them. It can be no other than a power to Preach to them, and Baptize them when converted. And this is confeſſed to belong to Presbyters. If the Biſhops would divide the World into Dioceſſes, and be the only Preachers in thoſe Dioceſſes, it would be no wonder if the World be unconverted. It is not Biſhops that are ſent by the Papiſts themſelves to convert the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps you may ſay that the Biſhops rule thoſe Presbyters that do it. I anſwer, 1. It's an imperfect kind of Government, which a Biſhop in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can exerciſe over Presbyters that daily Preach, as Mr. <hi>Eliat</hi> his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to the Natives in a Wilderneſs many thouſand Miles from them. 2. But if they do rule the Preachers, that maketh not the Soil nor the Heathens to be any parts of their Church, but the Preachers only. Therefore a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with them, and a Church, muſt be different things.</p>
               <p>His firſt Reaſon therefore, <hi>page</hi> 36. from the Circuit is vain. His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>page</hi> 37. that the City Biſhops had a right from the beginning over many Churches, (that had no other Biſhops) and did not after uſurp it, he proveth not at all: For the words of Men three or four hundred years after Chriſt, alledging <hi>ancient cuſtome</hi> are no proof: When the 25 <hi>Can. Trull.</hi> cited by himſelf, maketh thirty years poſſeſſion enough againſt all that would queſtion their Title. And abundance of things had Cuſtome and Antiquity alledged for them ſo long after, that were known Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>His third Reaſon is from the <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> as the Biſhops ſuffragan, which ſheweth no more, but that the City Biſhops (whether juſtly or by uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were at laſt really Archbiſhops, or Rulers of Biſhops: But of this before.</p>
               <p>His fourth Reaſon, from Succeſſion will be good, when he that affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that no Church was governed by the Pariſh Diſcipline, hath proved that all, many, yea, or any Biſhops from the Apoſtles days, had many Churches under them that had no Biſhops of their own. Till then he ſaith nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61252:41"/>As to his inſtance of the <hi>Scythians</hi> having but one Biſhop, the Reaſon was, becauſe it was but little of their Country at firſt that were made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or that were at all in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: So that the Biſhop was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Tomis,</hi> in the borders of the Empire (in the Maritine part of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea,) that thence he might have an influence on the reſt of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> over whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had no power, and where there were many Cities indeed, but few Chriſtians: as may be ſeen in <hi>Theodoret, Tripart.

               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. He pretends to prove that the ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches were Dioceſan, and not Parochial, and never defineth a Dioceſs and Pariſh; which is loſt labour.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument is, [<hi>Churches, whoſe Circuit contained Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adjoining, were Dioceſſes. But, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is before anſwered: Our Queſtion is, Whether they were as our Dioceſan Churches, ſuch as had in theſe Cities and Countries many Altars and Churches without Biſhops under them: Trees, and Houſes, and Fields, and Heathen People, make not Churches, nor yet ſcattered Chriſtians, that were Members only of the City Church.</p>
               <p>His proof of the Minor is, 1. Theſe Churches comprized all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

               <p>In §. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 49. He would prove that the <hi>Circuit of a Church was in the Intention of the Apoſtles, or firſt Founders, the ſame from the beginning, befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the diviſion of Churches as after:</hi> Which I ſhall in due place diſprove: His reaſons are, 1. <hi>Becauſe the whole Church ſince the Apoſtles days hath ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the intention of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is not proved. 2. I ſhall anone prove the contrary; that the Apoſtles had no intention that Churches ſhould be defined by the limits
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61252:42"/>
of the place and Country: nor did they themſelves ever appoint any ſuch bounds to any one Church, and ſay <hi>ſo far it ſhall extend:</hi> Nor did they ever take any but Chriſtians in any Circuits for Members of the Church. And I ſhall prove that all Churches were but ſuch as I deſcribed, ſingle Churches with their Biſhops at the firſt, and that ſome Villages had Biſhops four or five hundred years after: And his own Reaſon that <hi>Churches fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Civil Form,</hi> proveth the mutability of their bounds, ſeeing the Civil Forms were mutable.</p>
               <p>His next Reaſon is becauſe [<hi>that diviſion of Churches which was</hi> 300 <hi>or</hi> 400 <hi>Years after Chriſt, with their Limits and Circuits, were ordinarily the ſame which had been from the beginning, as divers Councils teſtifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe Councils mean no more, than that it had been an old or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cuſtome, (as many Learned men have proved.) And if they could be proved to mean that from the Apoſtolical plantations the bounds of all the Dioceſs were ſet, I marvel that any man could believe them. But they ſay no ſuch thing, as were it not tedious to the Reader, an examination of each particular would ſhew. Elſe no new Churches and Biſhops muſt be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the World, but thoſe that the Apoſtles converted in any Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween or near them; For the unconverted Cities in the inter-ſpaces, were as much thoſe Biſhops Dioceſſes as the Villages of equal diſtance: And then the making of new Cities would have made one a Biſhop of many Cities, contrary to the Canons.</p>
               <p>His third Reaſon is, that <hi>the Diſtribution of the Churches uſually followed the diviſion of the Common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If ſo (as is ſaid) they muſt be various and mutable. All the World was not divided juſt as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was: And the Imperial diviſions had great changes. 2. I think it loſt labour to diſpute with him that holdeth this aſſimilating the Church to the Civil Form, was of Divine Apoſtolical Inſtitution. If any can think ſo, let him give us his proof that the Church Conſtitution muſt vary as Monarchical, Ariſtocratical and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical States do; As Empires and free Cities do: And that from the King to the Conſtable, we muſt have a correſpondent Officer: And that the Papacy as Capital in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was of Gods Inſtitution. And that an Emperour, King, or popular State may change the Form of the Churches, as oft as they may the Form of their ſubordinate Governments. Are not theſe ſmall Reaſons to prove, that when the Apoſtles planted Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in all ſingle Churches, they intended that thoſe Biſhops ſhould be the ſole Biſhops of many hundred Churches, when they ſhould be raiſed in the Circuit of ground, which now is called their Dioceſſes. But more of this in due place.</p>
               <p>But next he appealeth to <hi>mens conſciences, Whether it be not unlikely that there was but one Congregation belonging to theſe famous Cities towards the end of the Apoſtles days.</hi> Of which more afterward.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 69. He argueth, [<hi>The Presbyteries ordained by the Apoſtles, were appointed for Dioceſſes, and not to Pariſhes: Therefore the Churches endued</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61252:42"/>
                  <hi>with the power of Eccleſiaſtical Government were not Pariſhes but Dioceſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Queſtion is, Whether they were ſingle Churches as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, or only One Dioceſan Church made up of many ſuch ſingle Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: 1. If by <hi>Presbyteries</hi> be meant many Presbyters, a College, or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſus,</hi> I deny the Conſequence; becauſe every Church that had Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not ſuch a Presbytery; But one Biſhop or Paſtor did ſerve for ſome of the leſſer Churches, and yet that one had Governing power. 2. I deny the Major: It was ſingle Churches that had then many Elders ſet over them. 3. Reader, it ſeemeth to me no ſmall diſparagement to the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Cauſe, that the grand Patrons of it ſo extreamly differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> holdeth that in all the Scripture times, no one Church had any Presbyters at all, ſave only one ſingle Biſhop. This Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Downame</hi> ſeemeth to hold, that <hi>every Governed Church</hi> had a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And [<hi>no one</hi>] and [<hi>every one</hi>] extreamly differ: Yet either of them would have cenſure him that had gain-ſayed them.</p>
               <p>His proof of the Antecedent is this. [<hi>They who were appointed to whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countries to labour ſo far as they were able the converſion of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to God, were appointed to Dioceſſes, not to Pariſhes: But, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is not here fruſtration inſtead of edification to the Reader, for want of defining a Dioceſs and a Pariſh. I thought we had talkt of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Church; and here is a Dioceſs deſcribed which may be a <hi>ſingle Church,</hi> or no Church at all as the Biſhop pleaſeth. Here is not ſo much as any Chriſtians, much leſs Congregations of them mentioned as the Biſhops Flock: But many an Apoſtle, Evangeliſt, and Converting Preacher, hath been ſet over Cities and Countries to labour mens Converſion, as far as they were able, before they had converted any, or at leaſt enow to make a Church; and after that, before they had converted more than one Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The Jeſuits in the <hi>Indies</hi> thus laboured in ſeveral Provinces, before they were Biſhops of thoſe Provinces, or called them Provincial Churches. But now we perceive what he meaneth by a Dioceſs, even a ſpace of Ground containing Inhabitants to be converted if we can.</p>
               <p>I will ſhorten my Anſwer to the reſt of his Reaſonings for ſuch Dioceſan Churches.</p>
               <p>I will put a few Queſtions, more pertinent than his Queries <hi>p.</hi> 67. about the ſtate of ſuch Dioceſan Churches.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. Whether the Apoſtles were not, by this deſcription, Biſhops of all the World as their Dioceſſes? And whether therefore it follow that there were no Biſhops under them in particular Churches?</p>
               <p>Q. 2. Whether Apoſtles and Evangeliſts did not go from City to City, ſometime ſtaying ſome Months or Years at one, and then paſſing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And whether this made all the interjacent Countries their Dioceſſes, changing their Biſhops as oft as they thus changed their Habitations?</p>
               <p>Q. 3. Whether more than one ſuch Apoſtle or Evangeliſt were not both at once, and ſucceſſively in the ſame place, to labour the converſion of all they could? And whether therefore there were many Biſhops to a Dioceſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61252:43"/>Q. 4. Where we ſhall find the proof that the Apoſtles or Evangeliſts ſet the bounds of Dioceſſes? And whether this deſcription of his own do make Dioceſſes bounded by circuit or ſpace of Ground, or by the Abilities of the Biſhop to endeavour converſion?</p>
               <p>Q. 5. When the Apoſtles forbad any other to labour mens converſion in their Cities or Countries where they or others had been before them? And did not one plant and another water, (and uſually more than one at once?)</p>
               <p>Q. 6. Whether (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.) Diſcipling or Preaching to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert men, and then baptizing them, be not the way of gathering Churches, and therefore proveth that before converſion they are no Churches? and are not Chriſtians only members of the Church? And are thoſe Dioceſan Churches that are no Churches?</p>
               <p>Q. 7. If one be ſetled in a ſingle Congregation in the City, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to endeavour the converſion of the Country, is not a Dioceſan Church there the ſame as a ſingle Congregation, though the Dioceſs be larger?</p>
               <p>Q. 8. If when Congregations multiplyed, Biſhops were not multiplyed, but one would keep many Churches under himſelf alone, doth it prove that this was well done becauſe it was done? and that God conſented to this change?</p>
               <p>His next Reaſon is, <hi>becauſe Churches were not then divided into Pariſhes.</hi> Which in due place I ſhall prove to be a ſufficient Reaſon againſt him. Churches were Societies conſtituted of Paſtors and their Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as afore defined: And his inference is vain, that [<hi>Presbyteries were not ſettled in Pariſhes, becauſe the Churches were not yet divided into Pariſhes.</hi> For they were Pariſhes, that is, <hi>ſingle Churches,</hi> without <hi>dividing.</hi> The ſpace of Ground called Pariſhes was not then marked out; Nor was a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Church (like ours) that hath no ſubordinate Biſhops divided into Pariſhes; for there were no ſuch Dioceſan Churches to be ſo divided. But the Univerſal Church and the Apoſtolical Provinces were made up (or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted) of Pariſhes, I mean of particular <hi>Churches,</hi> as greater numbers are of unites, and as Villages are of Houſes. But to ſay that <hi>Churches were not divided into Pariſhes,</hi> in the ſence in queſtion, is all one as to ſay, <hi>Churches were not divided into Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Controverſie is like this, Whether all the Families in the Town ſhould have but One common Maſter? And he that affirmeth it, ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus; Maſters were not at firſt appointed to Families but to Villages; For Villages were not at firſt divided into Families, (when there were none but ſingle Houſes erected.) True; but Families were Families before there were Villages to be divided. As Villages were not made before Houſes, and then divided into Houſes, nor Cities before Streets, and afterwards divided into Streets; nor Kingdoms before Cities and Corporations, and then divided into Corporations, (or inferiour Societies) Nor Academies before Colleges, and then divided into Colleges; ſo neither were Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or Dioceſan Churches made before <hi>ſingle Churches,</hi> and after divided
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61252:43"/>
into them; but were made by the coalition of many ſingle Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which ſhould not have been changed for that uſe <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of their Paſtors, and depriving them of their Proper Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>5th Chap.</hi> He pretendeth to confute the Aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion that for the firſt 200 years, the City Churches were but ſingle Congregations. Here we uſe to except only <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in all the World: And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently extend the time to 150 years, and very probably to 200; and moreover ſay, that till the fourth Century, moſt or very many Churches were no other, if not long after in many Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>All his talk, <hi>p.</hi> 80. againſt <hi>ſhallow giddy Heads, that ſee no further than their Noſe end,</hi> becauſe it was denied that Paſtors were ſet in ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to convert alſo the Infidels about, I have nothing to do with: For I aſſert that as all Miniſters are bound to endeavour the converſion of ſuch, if they have opportunity (not wanting power,) ſo thoſe are moſt bound to it that have beſt opportunity, which is the Neighbour Biſhops. But till men are converted they are no parts of the Church; no, nor of that particular Church, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe converted by that Biſhop (as ſhall be proved,) without ſome further conſent and ground. The reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the largeneſs of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be conſidered in due place.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 104. I deſire it may be noted that he ſaith, [<hi>I do not deny but that at the firſt, and namely in the time of the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>the moſt of the Churches ſo ſoon after their converſion, did not each of them exceed the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a populous Congregation.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 114. that <hi>Metropolitans he thinks were intended by the Apoſtles, or at leaſt, ſuadente naturâ &amp; neceſſitate flagitante,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith: And I ſuppoſe a Dioceſan Church will find no better ground than a Metropolitan, <hi>viz.</hi> Humane Prudence, or (I think intended.)</p>
               <p>In <hi>chap.</hi> 7. He pretendeth to prove, that in the Apoſtles times Pariſhes began to be diſtinguiſhed under one only Biſhop, &amp;c. But what's the proof? <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> are all the Inſtances. <note n="†" place="margin">In my Treat. of the true way of Concord, I have alſo diſproved the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Rome and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</note> But, 1. his proof that <hi>Evariſtus</hi> divided Pariſhes about <hi>An.</hi> 100 is worth nothing, as having no ſufficient evidence, but fabulous reports. 2.

Becauſe <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s following words out of <hi>Philo</hi> do make it moſt probable, that by [<hi>the Churches of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria] he meant [<hi>the Churches in and about</hi> Alexandria,] which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not many in the City it ſelf. 2. If he had planted many Churches in the City, it is no proof that he varied from the practice of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who (as <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23.) placed Elders (that is, ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Biſhops) in every Church: Or that the Elders of each Church had not the true Paſtoral or Epiſcopal power of Governing the Flock, (which is all that we plead for.) And if it had been proved that <hi>Mark</hi> had been over them: it followeth not that he was not over them as an Archbiſhop, but as a meer Biſhop only. 3. <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> think they prove that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61252:44"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and other great Cities then had more Biſhops than one, by reaſon of the peoples diverſity in Languages, &amp;c. As <hi>Peter</hi> of the Circumciſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> of the Uncircumciſion. 4. <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentioneth not this as a certainty, but with an [<hi>it</hi>'s <hi>ſaid</hi>] which is the uſual note of his uncertain reports (of which he hath not a few, as is commonly confeſſed.) 5. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is ſo far from believing this (that many Pariſhes were committed ſo early to Presbyters under one Biſhop) that he thinketh there is no proof that any ſuch Presbyters were in being in the Scripture times. And though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> had divers Churches in them long before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, there is no proof or probability that it was ſo in the Apoſtles days. And <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Euſebius</hi> expreſly ſaith, [<hi>But how many and what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere followers have governed the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, it cannot be affirmed, but ſo far as may be gathered from the words of</hi> Paul. And <hi>c.</hi> 19. he mentioneth in the ſingular number the <hi>Church</hi> (not the Churches) of <hi>Rome, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. he ſaith <hi>Celadion</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. So long after it is not denied, but that <hi>Alexandria</hi> had more Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies than one. 2. Yet it is moſt likely that by the Churches in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Alexandria, Euſebius</hi> meant the Churches under the Archbiſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which had Biſhops of their own. 3. Before they had a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there might be ſeveral leſſer Meetings in the City, which were but as our Chapels, or the Independants Meeting in ſeveral Houſes at once, when yet the Church was but one, becauſe they were aſſociated for <hi>Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> 4. When the Pariſhes were divided to ſeveral Presbyters, yet then each Presbyter had the true Epiſcopal Office as to the People, though not the Name; and though they were under a ſuperiour Biſhop; that is, they had the whole Office of a Presbyter or Paſtor, to <hi>Govern</hi> the People as well as <hi>Teach</hi> them and <hi>Worſhip</hi> with them. And ſo there was then no Pariſh like ours, which is but part of a Dioceſan Church, and no Church of it ſelf (as the Biſhops Form it) becauſe it hath but a half Paſtor. 5. And is not the caſe of all other Churches in the World, that to this time were but ſingle Churches, more conſiderable than the caſe of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> which differed from all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But all the reſt did the ſame, as ſoon as they had People enow to make many Churches?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I have told you <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> think that there were more Biſhops than one in a City for ſome time. 2. This multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not till long after in the third Century, and with moſt in the fourth, when it was no wonder that the Church fell into the Imperial Form: And when they did ſo, the <hi>Roman</hi> Primacy aroſe with the reſt. 3. Yet even
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61252:44"/>
then the Presbyters were <hi>Epiſcopi gregis,</hi> and had the true, full, Paſtoral power as to their Flocks, as aforeſaid. So that there were no Biſhops that yet depoſed the Presbyters as now.</p>

He ſaith, [<hi>Neither was this a thing peculiar to the Biſhops of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, <hi>but common to others.</hi>—Ignatius <hi>was Biſhop not only of</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, <hi>but of</hi> Syria: Irenaeus, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Lyons, <hi>was Biſhop of the Churches in</hi> France, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This openeth the former caſe: Theſe were not Dioceſanes, depoſing all the <hi>Epiſcopos gregis,</hi> and become ſole Biſhops, but Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that had under them Biſhops in each particular Church. Yet note, that it is the <hi>French</hi> Synod of Biſhops which <hi>Euſeb. ib. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>Iren.</hi> is ſaid to overſee, as it's ſaid, <hi>ibid.</hi> that <hi>Palmas</hi> did ſo among the Biſhops of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in their Synod, and that <hi>Victor</hi> was Preſident in the Biſhops Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> Synod: Which is nothing to our caſe.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid, that <hi>Optatus</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Rome</hi> were 40 Churches, and that <hi>Theodoret</hi> had 800.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is granted, that in <hi>Optatus</hi>'s days <hi>Rome</hi> had 40, which is nothing to our caſe in hand. 2. In thoſe 40 ſo late, there were no half Presbyters, but as this Doctor confeſſeth, they had not only a joynt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Governing the Flocks, but in Ordination too. 3. I confeſs <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>'s caſe ſeemeth ſtrange, and though of late date is ſo incredible as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the caſe of other Churches, that I do the rather for that clauſe believe that Epiſtle to <hi>Leo</hi> to be a forgery, or corrupted at leaſt. And beſides this Reaſon, I have theſe alſo for it. 1. Becauſe he himſelf ſaith, that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> where he was Biſhop, was but two days journey from <hi>Antioch, Hiſt. Sanct. Patr. de Juliano.</hi> And he that knoweth how great the Dioceſs of <hi>Antioch</hi> was, will not eaſily believe that a Town within two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (to Monks that went on foot) was like to have eight hundred Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in it at that time. 2. And we know out of whoſe ſhop <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Epiſtles come. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ſaith, he read above 500 of his Epiſtles. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ſaith there is a Book in the <hi>Vaticane</hi> containing 150 of them: <hi>Meti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> tranſlated theſe into <hi>Latine.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Rivet. Crit. Sacr. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 455. the Reader muſt remember that they have been kept all this while in the Adverſaries Cabinets, and by them are brought into light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Latine, ſo that they have no authority, further than other Hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth them. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Leontius de Sectis</hi> ſaith, as <hi>Baronius</hi> confeſſeth, that Hereticks fained Epiſtles in <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s name; And <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine de ſcript. Eccl.</hi> mentioneth one that hath his name in <hi>Concil. Epheſ.</hi> that neither <hi>Theodoret</hi> nor any Chriſtian is to be charged with. 4. And that this one Epiſtle to <hi>Leo</hi> ſhould be cull'd out of all the reſt to be alone Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Works, ſheweth the deſign, and what credit is to be given to it. 5. And I ſhall anon cite much out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> himſelf, to ſhew the improbability that Dioceſſes had then ſo many Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61252:45"/>And ſo much as a juſt confutation of Biſhop <hi>Downame,</hi> not as referring to other men with whom he dealt, but to the cauſe which we have in hand. And that I anſwer not the whole Book, is becauſe I know of no more in it than what I have culled out, which needeth an anſwer as to the cauſe which I defend: Of which I make the judicious Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>6. Biſhop <hi>Hall's</hi> Defence of Epiſcopacy meddleth ſo little with the<note place="margin">Biſh. Hall.</note> point now in Queſtion, that I have no need to ſay any thing to it, more than is already ſaid. And he granteth all that I deſire.</p>
               <p>7.

His Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Aſſertion is, That the two Offices of Biſhops and Presbyters, were both placed in the ſame perſon, in the Apoſtles days; at which <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> juſtly laugheth: For what is that but to ſay, that then there was no ſuch perſon as a Subject Presbyter (much leſs as our half-Presbyters:) And <hi>Salmaſius</hi> juſtly congratulateth his conceſſion, [that <hi>ſolo confenſu hominum &amp; vitandi ſchiſmatis gratia, unus enumero Epiſcoporum, eorundem<expan>

[<hi>It was only by Mans conſent and for the avoiding of Schiſm, that one was choſen out of the number of Biſhops, who alſo were Presbyters, to be above the reſt: This ſaying none for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.

               </p>
               <p>8. The Learned Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> in his Epiſtles to <hi>Pet. Molinaeus,</hi> hath<note place="margin">Biſh.

And as to his Reaſons for Dioceſanes from the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, though the well ordering of them make them very taking, yet when examined, they are no other but what we have found and anſwered in others.</p>
               <p>9. The truly Learned, Reverend, and Godly Primate <hi>Uſher,</hi> in the<note place="margin">B.

The utmoſt which he pleadeth for is no more than we acquieſce in, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61252:45"/>
that it was his Model or Reduction (publiſhed ſince by Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi>) which we humbly offered to his Majeſty as the means of our common concord. And he hath himſelf told me his Judgment, that Biſhops and Presbyters differ not as two <hi>Orders,</hi> but in <hi>Degree;</hi> And that <hi>Ordinis eſt Ordinare,</hi> or that he that hath the <hi>Order</hi> hath intrinſical power to Ordain; though he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to do it under the Biſhops overſight; And therefore it is not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and null, but only irregular or ſchiſmatical, when it is done diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently againſt the Biſhop (and ſo may be diſabled <hi>in foro exteriore;</hi>) which Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> alſo hath publiſhed of him; and Dr. <hi>Maſon</hi> in the ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe fullier proveth. And he took Presbyters to be Governours of the Flocks; and the Synods of Biſhops to be but for Concord, and not to have a proper Governing power over the particular Biſhops, as he hath himſelf expreſſed to me. Him therefore that is for us, we need not confute. And yet I muſt confeſs, that the great Argument which he and Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and <hi>Saravia,</hi> and all others uſe, from the title of <hi>Angel</hi> given to the Biſhops, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. did never ſeem of any weight to me; nor moved my underſtanding that way at all: Believing that <hi>Tyconius</hi> his old Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mentioned by <hi>Auſtin</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 30. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.

               </p>
               <p>For the Prophecy coming by Viſion, the word [<hi>Angel</hi>] is mentioned in the Viſion phraſe, and oft in that book is by all confeſſed to ſignifie col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Bodies, and more than ſingle Individuals: As <hi>Uſher (de Babilone)</hi> himſelf holdeth, that by [<hi>the falſe Prophet</hi>] in the ſingular number, is meant the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy. It would be more tedious than neceſſary to recite the inſtances in that Book. I therefore who, becauſe of its obſcurity, am apt to be diſtruſtful of almoſt all Arguments that are fetcht from the dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelations,</hi> am little ſatisfied with this from the name <hi>Angel.</hi> And who can believe them that ſay <hi>Timothy</hi> was then the Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſo excellent a perſon, as that none <hi>was like minded,</hi> as <hi>deſcribed</hi> by <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet that Chriſt had this againſt him, that he <hi>had loſt his firſt love,</hi> and muſt remember from whence he is fallen and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and do his firſt works or be rejected, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5. And in a word, that the Apoſtles, who placed holy perſons in the Miniſtry, had ſet ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe eminent Churches, as were neither hot nor cold, and had the reſt of the faults that are mentioned by Chriſt. And the whole ſtyle of the Text doth eaſily prove this Expoſition againſt theirs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 4, 7. As the praiſes and diſpraiſes there ſeem to referr to the whole Church, ſo <hi>v.</hi> 7. what can be more expreſs than [<hi>Hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi>] And <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Behold the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that ye may be tryed, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches</hi>] which is repeated and ſpoken to every one of the ſeven. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.

to repent: And <hi>v.</hi> 20. that ſuffered the Woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> to teach: For the Biſhops could not hinder falſe Teachers, but by Excommunicating them, and diſſwading the People from hearing them: But the People could have done more, even refuſed to hear them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1.

               <p>Obj. <hi>But it is ſaid,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 20. <hi>The ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Churches; and the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The Biſhop was to deliver it to the Churches.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is precarious. 1. The Apoſtle wrote it, that both Paſtors and People might immediately read it, and did not intruſt it as an unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tradition to one, to be delivered to the reſt. 2. All the Paſtors were to deliver or teach it to the People, and not one Biſhop only. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no cogent Argument.</p>
               <p>10. As for the Diſputers for Epiſcopacy at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> with King<note place="margin">The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at the Iſle of Wight.</note> 
                  <hi>Charles,</hi> they manage <hi>Saravia's</hi> Argument (fetcht from the Continuance of the Ordinary part of the Apoſtles Office) as he did before them (and many others) ſo well, that for my part I cannot confute them, but remain in doubt; and therefore have nothing to ſay againſt them. But that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our Caſe, whether every particular Organized Church ſhould have a Biſhop or the full Paſtoral Office in it.</p>
               <p>11. As to <hi>Joh.

               <p>1. As to the Paſtoral power, it ſelf in whomſoever, he affirmeth it to be but Nuntiative, Declarative, Suaſory, and <hi>per conſenſum,</hi> and not any <hi>Imperium;</hi> Like the power of a Phyſitian, a Counſellor, and an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. But then by <hi>Imperium</hi> he meaneth that which is <hi>coactive</hi> by the Sword: And he acknowledgeth the power of the Miniſtry by the Word upon Conſenters, to be of Divine Inſtitution, ſo that they ſin againſt God, who do reject it. And if the Paſtors of the Church did meddle with no other power, we ſhould the ſooner be agreed. For my part I take the very power of the Keys, to be no other, than a power of applying God's Word to the Conſciences of the Penitent and Impenitent, and the Church; and a power of judging who is fit or unfit for Church-communion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's Word, which judgment we can no otherwiſe execute but by the ſame Word, and by forbearing or exerciſing our own Miniſterial actions to the perſon: (As a Phyſitian may refuſe to Medicate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly.)</p>
               <p>In <hi>chap.</hi> 6. He ſpeaketh juſtly of the Princes power (as in the former.)</p>
               <p>And ſo he doth <hi>chap.</hi> 7. of the uſe and power of Synods or Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. He well vindicateth the Magiſtrate, and denyeth to the Church or Biſhops, the Legiſlative power, <hi>circa ſacra:</hi> and ſheweth that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are not proper Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. He ſheweth the Juriſdiction, properly ſo called, belongeth to the Magiſtrate, and not to the Paſtors as ſuch, (Though of old they might be alſo Magiſtrates.)</p>
               <p>He ſheweth that the uſe of the Keys is called Juriſdiction, but by the ſame figure by which Preaching is called Legiſlation (which is true as to the Declaration who is bound or looſe, <hi>in foro caeli;</hi> but Paſtors more properly judge who is to be taken into Church-communion or excluded.)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61252:47"/>
The preſcript of Penance he ſaith is no Juriſdiction, but as the Councel of a Phyſitian, or Lawyer, or Philoſopher. That the denying of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not properly Juriſdiction, he thus (excellently) explaineth [<hi>p. 229. As he that Baptizeth, or as the old cuſtome was, puts the Euchariſt into ones mouth or hand, doth exerciſe an act of Miniſtry and not of Juriſdiction; ſo alſo he that abſtaineth from the ſame acts. For the reaſon of the viſible ſigns, and of the audible is the ſame: By what right therefore a Paſtor denounceth by-words to one that is manifeſtly flagitious, that he is an utter alien to the Grace of God; by the ſame right alſo he doth not Baptize him, becauſe it is the ſign of remiſſion of ſin; or if he be Baptized giveth him not the Euchariſt, as being the ſign of Communion with Chriſt. For the ſign is not to be given to him that the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified doth not agree to; nor are pearls to be given to ſwine: But, as the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was wont to cry in the Church [Holy things are for the Holy] Yea it were not only againſt Truth, but againſt charity, to make him partaksr of the Lords Supper, who diſcerneth not the Lords Body, but eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf: In theſe things while the Paſtor doth only ſuſpend his own act, and doth</hi>

                  <hi>not exerciſe any Dominion over the acts of others, it is apparent that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the vſe of Liberty, and not to the exerciſe of Juriſdiction. Such like is the caſe of a Phyſician refuſing to give an Hydropick water when he deſireth it, or in a grave perſon who reſuſeth to ſalute a profligate fellow, and in thoſe that avoid the company of the Leprous.</hi> (Only it muſt be remembred that this avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is by a Society governed therein by an Officer of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)</p>
               <p>Next he proceeds to the Churches duty, and ſheweth, 1. That as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Laity that is obedient to God's commands, ought to ſeparate themſelves from a ſinful Paſtor or Prelate</hi> (that is, that is <hi>groſly bad.</hi>) 2.

               </p>
               <p>Then for the Canonical Enquiries after faults, and impoſitions of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or delays of abſolution, he ſheweth that both the Canons and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by them being but prudential Determinations of Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, bound none but Conſenters, without the Magiſtrates Law, except as the Law of Nature bound them to avoid offences. (He ſhould add, [and as obedience in general is due to Church-guides of Chriſt's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.]) And how the Magiſtrate may conſtrain the Paſtors to their duty.</p>
               <p>Chap. 10. He ſheweth that there are <hi>two perpetual Functions in the Church, Presbyters and Deacons: I call them Presbyters</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with all the Ancient Church, who feed the Church with the Preaching of the Word, the Sacraments</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61252:47"/>
                  <hi>and the Keys, which by Divine Right are individual</hi> (or inſeparable.) (Note. that.)</p>
               <p>And §. 27. He ſaith, <hi>It is doubtful whether Paſtors where no Biſhops are,</hi> and ſo are under none, though over none, <hi>are to be numbered with Biſhops or meer Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 31. His counſel for the choice of Paſtors is, that (as in <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s time) <hi>none be forced on the People againſt their wills, and yet a power reſerv'd in the chief Rulers to reſcind ſuch elections as are made to the deſtruction of Church or Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. 11. §. 10. He ſheweth that <hi>Biſhops are not by Divine precept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And §. 1. That therefore the different Government of the Churches that have Biſhops, or that have none, ſhould be no hindrance to Unity.</p>
               <p>And §. 10, 11. That ſome Cities had no Biſhops, and ſome more than one: And that not only in the Apoſtles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He ſheweth that there have been at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere long <hi>vacancies</hi> of the Biſhops See, in which <hi>the Presbyters Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Church without a Biſhop;</hi> And ſaith, that all the Ancients do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that <hi>there is no act ſo proper to a Biſhop, but a Presbyter may do it, except the right of Ordination.</hi> Yet ſheweth, <hi>p.</hi> 358. that Presbyters ordained with Biſhops, and expoundeth the Canon thus, that <hi>Presbyters ſhould Ordain none, contemning the Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>p.</hi> 359. He ſheweth that where there is no Biſhop, Presbyters may Ordain, as <hi>Altiſiodorenſis</hi> ſaith among the Schoolmen. And queſtioneth again whether the Presbyters that have no Biſhops over them be not rather Biſhops than meer Presbyters; citing <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s words [<hi>He that had no one above him, was a Biſhop</hi>] (what would he have ſaid of our City and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration Paſtors that have divers Chapels and Curates under them: Or of our Preſidents of Synods: or ſuch as the Paſtor of the firſt Town that ever I was Preacher in (<hi>Bridgnorth</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire</hi>) who had ſix Pariſhes in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Juriſdiction, four or five of them great ones, and kept Court as ordinary like the Biſhops, being under none but the Archbiſhop.)</p>
               <p>And §. 12. He ſheweth that there was great cauſe for many Churches to lay by Epiſcopacy for a time.</p>
               <p>And <hi>p.</hi> 360. he ſaith [<hi>Certainly Chriſt gave the Keys to be exerciſed by the ſame men, to whom he gave the power of Preaching and Baptizing. That which God hath joyned let no man ſeparate.</hi>] (But then how ſhould Satan have uſed the Churches as he hath done?) And he ſheweth of meer ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (as he had done of Biſhops) that they are not neceſſary, but are lawful; and that it may be proved from Scripture that they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God; and that formerly the Laity joyned in Councils. Only he puts theſe Cautions (which I conſent to) 1. That they be not ſet up as by God's command. 2. That they meddle no otherwiſe with the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office, or Excommunication, than by way of Counſel. 3. That none be choſen that are unfit. 4. That they uſe no coactive power, but what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61252:48"/>
is given them by the Soveraign. 5. That they know their power to be mutable, as being not by Gods command, but from man.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. §. 8. He delivereth his opinion of the Original of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, that it was not fetcht from the Temple pattern ſo much as from the Synagogues,) where as he ſaid before, every Synagogue had a chief Ruler.)</p>
               <p>14. As for <hi>J. D.</hi> and many other leſſer Writers, (Sir <hi>Thomas Aſton,</hi> &amp;c.) who ſay but half the ſame with thoſe forementioned, it is not worth<note place="margin">J. D. &amp;c.</note> your time and labour to read any more. Animadverſions on them.</p>
               <p>15. But the great Learned <hi>M. Ant. de Dominis Spalatenſis</hi> deſerveth a more diſtinct conſideration: who in his very learned Books <hi>De Repub. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Ant. de Dom. Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latenſis.</note> doth copiouſly handle all the matter of Church-Government.

Where he overthroweth the old Schoolmens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> and ſheweth alſo the vanity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtinction of Power of Order and of Juriſdiction; and maintaineth, 1. that Power of Juriſdiction followeth, <hi>ab Ordine,</hi> as Light from the Sun: 2. That all the Power of the Keys which is exerciſed for Internal effects, although about External Matters, (of Worſhip or Government) belongeth directly to the <hi>Poteſtas Ordinis:</hi> 3. That the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>Order,</hi> and reſerved to the Biſhops, is but the power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ordering of External things, which is uſed <hi>Principally</hi> and <hi>Directly</hi> for an <hi>External</hi> Effect (that is <hi>Church order.</hi>) §. 5. <hi>p.</hi> 35. 4. That it is fooliſh to ſeparate power of Order from any power of Juriſdiction whatſoever, that is properly Eccleſiaſtical, it being wholly Spiritual. 5. The Epiſcopal Juriſdiction (not properly Eccleſiaſtical) he maketh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ordering Rites and Ceremonies and Circumſtances, and Temporals about the Church, and about ſuch Modal Determinations about particular perſons and actions as are matters of humane prudence, (which have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a General Rule in Nature or Scripture. 6. By which (though he hold Epiſcopacy <hi>Jure Divino</hi>) that it is but ſuch things that he ſuppoſeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Biſhop (which the Magiſtrate may determine and make Laws for, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and others prove at laſt, and himſelf after; and as Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Twiſden</hi> hath Hiſtorically proved to have been uſed by the Kings of <hi>England, Hiſtor.

That this equal power of the Biſhop and Presbyter floweth from Ordination; and is the <hi>Eſſential Ordinary Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power.</hi> 10. That this vain ſeparating Power of Order and Juriſdiction

is the whole Foundation of Popery. §. 7. <hi>p. 36. &amp; paſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> 37, &amp;c. 21. He frequently calleth that [<hi>the Eſſential power</hi>] in which Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are equal, and ſo taketh the reſt but for Accidental. 12. He thus deſcribeth the Biſhops power of Juriſdiction, <hi>c. 3. p.</hi> 39. §. 13. [<hi>About thoſe things which are conſtituted in the Church, only by Humane Eccleſiaſtical Right, there is in the Church true Juriſdiction not neceſſarily depending on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Order it ſelf, if there be any at all ſeparate from Order.</hi> Such as Licenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Biſhop to Ordain in anothers Dioceſs, &amp;c. <hi>For theſe acts are not Actus Sacri neque ſpirituales, neque attingunt directè quicquam ſupernaturale, ſed ſunt merè temporales, &amp; circa rem externam &amp; temporalem qua eſt mera ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio, &amp;c. Theſe are not Sacred nor Spiritual, nor touch any thing directly that is Supernatural, but are meerly Temporal, and about an External and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matter, Et his ſolis verum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is moſt evident, that as God hath left to Humane Prudence the Ordering of ſome Modes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Worſhip and Diſcipline and Church Order, and by his General Laws, ſo <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> thought that all the Biſhops proper Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lay in theſe things, which were of Humane Right, and that all things of divine appointment were equally belonging to the Presbyters. Where again I deſire it may be obſerved. 1. That Magiſtrates may determine of ſuch things, and ſo make void or needleſs ſuch an Epiſcopacy. 2. That it is moſt certain that many things of External Order belong to a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to determine, as to one that is the Conducter of the Sacred Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: As what Text to preach on, what Method to uſe, what Chapter to read: where and at what hour the People ſhall meet, how long they ſhall ſtay, what Tune to ſing a Pſalm in, and abundance of the like. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Juriſdiction which he excepeth to the Biſhop is common to him with the Presbyter that officiateth: And all that can be pretended is that it belongeth to him, to determine ſuch Circumſtances as equally belong to many Churches (which yet Synods of Presbyters may do as effectually for Concord.) 3. That indeed there is no true Eccleſiaſtical act which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to Internal Spiritual effects: Publick Admonitions and Confeſſions as well as private are for the humbling of the Sinner, and the exercise of Repentance; and Excommunications and Abſolutions in publick are not only nor chiefly for the external Order of the Church, but for the preſerving of the peoples ſouls from ſin, and for the warning of others, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in their minds a due eſteem of the holineſs of our Religion, and the neceſſity of holineſs in us, and to convince thoſe without, that God's Laws and Ways and People are more holy than thoſe of the World. This is a clear and certain truth: and therefore according to <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters muſt in publick as well as private Admonitions, and Abſolutions, and Excommunications, have equal power with Biſhops, except as to the ordering of the Circumſtantials of it. Which though he ſometime ſeem to reſerve for the Biſhop, yet (to do him right) when he doth ſo, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th that it is a mixt power: As it is the exerciſe of the Keys, it is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Sacred Office, common to both; but as it is a prudential deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61252:49"/>
of Circumſtances according to Humane Right, directly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for <hi>outward</hi> and not for <hi>inward effects,</hi> it is the Biſhops Juriſdiction. So that really he maketh the Biſhop, as ſuch, to be but the Maſter of Order and Ceremonies, where the Magiſtrate doth not do it himſelf, and where it belongeth not to the Officiating Paſtor as ſuch.</p>
               <p>His <hi>cap.</hi> 4. is to prove that the power for Internal Effects of Grace in the Church by External acts, is exerciſed only Miniſterially, by Miniſters as ſuch, Inſtanced <hi>cap:</hi> 5. in Baptiſme <hi>cap.</hi> 6. in the Lords Supper, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. in Confeſſions and Penance; and <hi>cap.</hi> 9. in that Fxcommunication which is the exerciſe of the Keys (for he miſtaketh in excluding Baptiſm from the Keys, which indeed is the firſt uſe for intromiſſion.) <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain purpoſely ſheweth who are the Miniſters of each Ordinance.

               <p>§. 4. <hi>p.</hi> 465. He confidently ſaith, that <hi>to him it is a moſt certain thing that the power of Order, is of the Word, Sacrament and Keys, and that it is, plena, tota, integra, fully, totally, intirely in every Biſhop and lawful Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 22. <hi>p.</hi> 472. He ſaith, that <hi>Confirmation is neither a true Sacrament, but a part of the Ceremonies of Baptiſm; nor is it at all of Divine, but of humane Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Inſtitution; nor doth it ſuppoſe any ſpecial power given by God to him that adminiſtreth it, for any ſpecial ſupernatural effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But the Church for honour reſerveth this Ceremony to the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And §. 24. He ſaith, [<hi>And why are Biſhops ſo rigid that they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Pariſh Miniſters the Faculty of Confirming, ſpecially when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves come very ſeldome</hi>

               <p>And here I will tell Poſterity, that if we could have but got our Prelates,<note place="margin">☞</note> &amp;c. to have Confirmed to us but one <hi>Word,</hi> which the King granted us, <hi>pre tempore,</hi> only in his <hi>Declar. of Eccleſ.

And yet their Rubrick ſaith, that we muſt not give the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to any that are <hi>not Confirmed,</hi> or <hi>ready for it:</hi> Yet have we no power to require of any Man a Proof or Certificate of his Confirmation, nor can we know whether he be Confirmed or not; Nor can we refuſe any at the

               <p>And in that 12. <hi>chap.</hi> §. 25, 26, 27. <hi>p.</hi> 473. <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> again ſheweth, that the <hi>Power of the Keys for binding and looſing, belongeth to</hi> Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as Miniſters. And though he reſerve the <hi>Publick uſe</hi> of them to the Biſhop, he ſaith, <hi>that he may commit it to a Presbyter. For it is Mixt, and hath partly the External Juriſdiction which the Biſhop received by his proper Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination; and partly, yea much rather</hi> (or more) <hi>the Internal, by the Keys, which they have by virtue of their Presbyterial Ordination, in equality with the Presbyters. The External, becauſe it is External, may therefore be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to another, even a Lay-man:</hi> (which is it, which the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> have lately declared to be in the King.) And doth not all this ſhew what Epiſcopacy is? Even a Magiſtrates Office, <hi>Circa Sacra, vindicated</hi> by <hi>Grotius</hi> and others. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they cannot delegate the inward power which is properly of the Keys, becauſe this dependeth of the Sacred Presbyterial Order,</hi> both in <hi>fieri, in eſſe, in conſervari &amp; operari.

               <p>And §. 28. <hi>p.</hi> 474. <hi>Seeing the Apoſtles gave the Keys equally to all Biſhops and Presbyters,—No man can by Divine Right, reſerve part of the Keys to himſelf alone, and leave another part to others.</hi>

               <p>And §. 5. To be plainly underſtood, he ſaith, <hi>We Biſhops therefore muſt all remember, that All the Presbyters are our Brethren, and Collegues in the Miniſtry; not our Servants or Slaves, and that by Divine Right they have no leſs power in feeding the people of God than we have: And if we exerciſe any Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>

                  </gap>. 13. <hi>p.</hi> 287. He ſheweth, that in Vacancies, or the Biſhops Abſence, the Clergy of Presbyters have the whole Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power of Government.</p>
               <p>And <hi>p.</hi> 288, 289. He laboureth to prove, that one Church had many Biſhops, and that it is but Eccleſiaſtical Law or Cuſtome that one Church ſhould have but one Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And §. 15. That if the Canons prohibited not, a Biſhop might make all his Pariſh Presbyters full Biſhops, as (§. 16.) in the <hi>Miniſterial Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als towards the Faithful, they are by Divine Right equals. Vid. &amp;</hi> §. 20. <hi>page</hi> 291.</p>
               <p>This is enough to ſay of <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> ſave that all that he ſaith for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops againſt us, is ſo little a part of what is ſaid by the reſt, that it can require no new Anſwer. And if this great Moderator, (who returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> though for a miſerable impriſonment and end) becauſe we are not yet near enough to Antiquity, (or rather being flattered into covetous and ambitious hopes) be able to prove no greater a difference between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters, we need not think that any other is like to do it.</p>
               <p>16. The laſt great, Learned, Sober Defender of Epiſcopacy, and the<note place="margin">Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> laſt that I need to mention here, is Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and his Treat. of the Keys, and eſpecially his Diſſertations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Blondel,</hi> and his Defence of them againſt the <hi>London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Miniſters, hath ſaid much in this Cauſe. But his way is new (ſave that he followeth <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> in the main ſuppoſition:) He forſaketh almoſt all the Fathers, and almoſt all the Patrons of Epiſcopacy of later times (who have written for it) in the Expoſition of all the Texts of Scripture which mention the Elders and Biſhops of Churches in thoſe times, ſuppoſing that they all ſpeak of Biſhops only.</p>
               <p>In his Treat. of the Keys, he maintaineth that the power of them was given to the Apoſtles onely by Chriſt, and to Biſhops as their Succeſſors by the Apoſtles. But I take it for undeniable truth, that the Biſhops and Elders ſettled in every Church by the Apoſtles in <hi>their own time,</hi> had this power, and I need not expect a contradiction in it. And how fitly thoſe are called the <hi>Apoſtles Succeſſors,</hi> whom they ſet over the Churches in their own time, even from the beginning that they ſettled Churches, and with whom they continued in the ſame Churches many Months or Years (as <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> I leave to others to judge.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is not whether Biſhops have the power of the Keys, but whether <hi>all Presbyters</hi> have it not alſo? And 1. He ſheweth that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons,) the Presbyters might do nothing in this or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acts of Miniſtration, without the Biſhop. 2. That our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers, though they ſay, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins you do remit, it</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61252:50"/>
                  <hi>ſhall be remitted, &amp;c.</hi> Do not give the Presbyters <hi>all the Power of binding and looſing but ſo much as the Biſhops or the Governours are preſumed to have thought ſit to impart to them</hi> (which he ſaith is. 1. The declaring in the Church the abſolution of penitents after the Confeſſion. 2. The abſolving them by way of prayer before the Sacrament. 3. And by Baptiſmal waſhing, and 4. Upon Confeſſion to the ſick, and in private Conference, and Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which yet he ſaith, [<hi>Is by Chriſts Authority committed to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>] 3. He ſaith, [<hi>All this will not extend to the abſolving from the bond of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or proportionably to ſuch power of binding, any further (at moſt,) thau to confer the firſt power of it; which if it be then given, doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main (as the other Power of Preaching, and adminiſtring the Sacraments) bound and reſtrained from being exerciſed, till they be further looſed by the donation of a Second Power.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But 1. Either he was not <hi>able,</hi> or not <hi>willing,</hi> to tell us whether this Power be given the Presbyters or not. For he avoideth it, by ſaying [<hi>at moſt</hi>] and <hi>if it be given.</hi>] If not able, his ability muſt be plainly defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as to the deciſion of our main controverſie of the difference between Biſhops and Presbyters, which dependeth on it: If unwilling, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give us any ſolid ſatisfactory deciſion of this Caſe.</p>
               <p>2. Being his Neighbour, I wrote in his Life time, a Confutation of that Aſſertion, that the ordained received their Office and Power properly from the Ordainer as the neereſt Efficient of it, (in my Diſput of Ordination, in my Diſput. of Church-Government) and I proved that the Power or Office is immediately from Chriſt, and that the Ordainers do but deſign the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſhall receive it, and Miniſterially deliver him poſſeſſion by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting Sign.</p>
               <p>3. Either the Office of a Presbyter is of Divine <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> or of <hi>Humane:</hi> Either fixed by the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles, immutably; or made, and alterable by the Biſhops? If the Office be of Divine inſtitution, and fixed for the Churches conſtant uſe, whether by Chriſt immediately or by the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles,) than it is not in the Biſhops Power to Altar it: And ſo whatever the Ordainers <hi>pleaſe to give them,</hi> is none of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Power: As the Arch-Biſhop may Crown or anoint the King, and yet not give him what Power he pleaſe: Or rather as it is of Divine appointment, that the Husband ſhould be the Governour of the Wife: And ſhe that chooſeth him, and he that Marrieth them, cannot alter it, nor do they give him his meaſure of Power as they pleaſe, but ſuppoſe him endowed with that by God, and do only chooſe the Perſon that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and Miniſterially inveſt him in the Poſſeſſion of it. And if the Prieſt that marrieth them ſhould by any words Contradict, or limit this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, it were a Nullity; and invalid. If he do but ſay, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce you Husband and Wife:</hi> He therefore pronounceth the man to have that Power of a Husband which God hath given him, though he vainly ſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you ſhall have but ſo much, or ſo much of it. And ſo it is in preſent Caſe: If God have made the Miniſterial Office, he hath made it <hi>ſomething</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61252:51"/>
conſtituted of its eſſential parts; And if ſo what man hath Power to alter it. But if it be <hi>humane,</hi> yea, and made by the Biſhops then I confeſs they may alter it, or deſtroy it. And if a Presbyter have what power the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers pleaſe to give him, every Ordainer may alter the Office and make a new <hi>Species</hi> of Church Miniſters at his pleaſure: Prove that and our diſpute is at an end. But Papiſts, Greeks, and Proteſtants are agreed againſt it.</p>
               <p>4. If Presbyters receive that which he calleth [<hi>the firſt Power</hi>] (which he would not deny, though he would not grant) it is all that at preſent I am pleading for it: And it isall that in their ordination they receive (as he ſaith) as to the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> If then the Office of a Presbyter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame Power of the Keys as to Excommunication, and Abſolution, as it doth of adminiſtring the Word and Sacraments, at preſent I reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this (In which Learned <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> and thoſe that go with him, cannot be confuted) For this proveth that their Divinely-inſtituted Office Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially containeth this Power of the Keys, though to be exerciſed under the inſpection of a Superiour.</p>
               <p>5. And if this Inſpection would prove that they have not the Power or that their Office, or Order is therefore diſtinct, it will alſo prove that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have not the Power of the Keys, becauſe they exerciſe it under the Inſpection of Metropolitans, Arch-Biſhops, Primates, or Patriarchs: And alſo that they are of a diſtinct Order from all theſe: And that a Phyſition hath no Power to Guide or Govern his voluntary Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in order to Cure, and that he is off a diſtinct Office from the Colledge and Preſident, becauſe he is under their inſpection. And are not all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops under the Government of the King, as well as Phyſitions and other Subjects: And have they no Power of the Keys, becauſe he ruleth them.</p>
               <p>And as a Presbyter might do nothing without the Biſhop, ſo no one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop could do any thing without other Biſhops: For he had no Epiſcopal Power till they ordained him.</p>
               <p>And as to after Government or that which he calleth the grant of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Power.</p>
               <p>6. Is it any thing but <hi>Humane Licenſe</hi> to Exerciſe the Power of Office of Divine inſtitution before received? And is not the Magiſtrates <hi>Licenſe</hi> as neceſſary to the Biſhop and the Presbyter too, as the Biſhops is to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
               <p>7. And I take it for undenied among Chriſtians, that humane Power of Government, extendeth but to the <hi>Ordering</hi> and not the <hi>Nulling</hi> of a Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtituted by God. It is not referred to King or Biſhop, whether there ſhall be a Preaching or none, Sacraments, or none, Church diſcipline and exerciſe of the Keys, or none; no more than whether there ſhall be a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and Divine Law, a Chriſt, a Heaven, and whether men ſhall be good or bad, ſaved or damned: But only by whom, and when, and how, this Divine Function ſhall be ſo exerciſed, as may beſt attain the end, as to thoſe circumſtances not determined of by God; and not contradicting Gods Inſtitutions. Therefore if the Biſhops ſay that the Preachers of the Goſpel
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61252:51"/>
ſhall be ſilenced (perhaps by hundreds or thouſands) while the neceſſity of the Peoples Souls is undeniable, their Authority in this ſhould hinder no man from going to Preach (further than their violence hindreth.) And ſo by his own Rule it muſt be as to Diſcipline, if Diſcipline be a Work belonging to a Presbyter. And as <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> ſaith of <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Presbyter ſhould do it, though the Biſhop rorbid him.</p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Second Power</hi> which the Presbyter muſt receive from the Prelate for Teaching, Worſhipping, and Governing the Plock, is either, 1. For the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it in <hi>General to any fit perſons,</hi> or elſe for the limitation of him to ſuch a particular Flock. 2. And it is either a General Licenſe or power at once given to do all his Work, or to do this of Government whenever there is cauſe, or elſe it is a particular Licenſe for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act.</p>
               <p>1. We deny not, but that as a Phyſician Licenſed to practice, is not thereby made the Phyſician of this or that Perſon, Hoſpital or City, but have a particular Call for ſuch an Exerciſe or Application of his skill. So an Ordained Miniſter of Chriſt hath no prepared Object on which to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Paſtoral Office, but by a particular Call to ſuch a Flock. But however you Cenſure our ſimplicity for it, we are reſolved to believe, till you ſay more againſt it, 1. That the ſame may be ſaid of a Biſhop too; and therefore by your Argument, when this Biſhop is fixed in a particular Flock, he receiveth a <hi>ſecond power</hi> as you call it, and ſo without it hath not the power of the Keys any more than the Presbyter; and ſo muſt be of a diſtinct Order from the Biſhops that give him his ſecond power: And who giveth them theirs? And if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you riſe to a Patriarch or Pope, what Superiour of another Order giveth them their <hi>ſecond</hi> Power? 2. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or fixing a man (before Ordained) to a particular Flock, doth not make him of another Order or Office, nor is a new Ordination; nor is he as oft Ordained and made of another Office, as he changeth his Flock, or receiveth a new Licenſe from the Biſhop or the King, (from whom I had rather have it.) 3. That the People as well as the Biſhop (if not much more) do give the Miniſter this opportunity for the exerciſe of his Office, (as the Patient chooſeth his Phyſician.) And yet it is my Opinion that this will not prove that the People are his Governours, much leſs that they give him a new Order or Office. And of old the People choſe their Biſhops themſelves: It will be as much honour for you Learnedly to prove that there were no Kings in the World till Biſhops made them, as to confute D. <hi>Blondels</hi> Hiſtorical proof of the Peoples ancient choice of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>2. And as to a General Licenſe, I will thank the King for it, yea, or any man that hath power to hinder me, that he will give me leave to Preach and Exerciſe my Office: But I do not think that every man that doth not hinder me when he can, doth give me power. And if a Biſhop be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good as not to ſilence nor hinder a Miniſter from Preaching Chriſt, I do not think that this man is an Uſurper in Preaching the Goſpel,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61252:52"/>
for want of a Licenſe or ſecond Power: Nor yet in exerciſing the reſt of his Office, where he and the People do conſent. Theſe things ſeem plain to us, and they that (whether by Learning, or the Love of Riches and Honour and Domination) are made wiſer than we, may ſuffer ſuch Fools gladly, while themſelves are (<hi>in re vel ſpe</hi>) Rich, Honourable and wiſe. 3. And what is Ordination but a General Inveſtiture in the power of performing the Miniſterial Office? And why may not the <hi>General Power</hi> or Licenſe be given at once as at twice? I think [<hi>Take thou Authority to Preach the Word of God, and Adminiſter the Holy Sacraments, and the Diſcipline of the Church, when thou art thereto lawfully called,</hi> (that is, haſt opportunity and fit Objects) <hi>is a General Licenſe:</hi> And a Man may preſently Exerciſe this Office on Conſenters: Unleſs the ſence be [<hi>Take thee power when it ſhall be given thee.</hi>]</p>
               <p>3. But if it be a <hi>Particular Licenſe</hi> that is here meant by the grant of <hi>ſecond power,</hi> I confeſs that there is ſomewhat conſiderable in it, and that in old time the Biſhop and his Clergy living together, and meeting in the ſame Church, the Presbyters (like our Pariſh Curates now) were in all the Worſhip of the day, and in their privater Miniſtry to the People to be ruled by the Biſhop, and to Modifie and Circumſtantiate all as he directed them: And ſo may it be again. But ſure a Miniſter is not to travel an hundred miles to the Biſhop, to know whether he ſhall viſit this ſick man, or give the Sacrament to the other, and to know what Chapter he ſhall read, and ſuch like? If it be not a <hi>General Licenſe</hi> that is meant, it muſt needs ſuppoſe the Biſhops preſence.</p>
               <p>9. And ſeeing the Biſhops may <hi>Licenſe</hi> a Presbyter to uſe the Keys, the opening of this will help our underſtandings about the nature of the Biſhops Office. There is no act of Juriſdiction which they do not Ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to others. The ſentence of Excommunication and Abſolution is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily decreed by a Lay-Chancellor. (And <hi>Spalatenſis</hi> ſaith, that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Juriſdiction may be done by a Lay Delegate.) The ſame ſentence is <hi>Pronounced</hi> in Court by a Lay-Man, or a meer Presbyter. The ſame ſentence is publiſhed in the Church by a Presbyter or Deacon. And a Prince may give a Licenſe to exerciſe the Miniſtry to which we were Ordained.</p>
               <p>I enquire then, 1. Whether the granting of this Epiſcopal Power, be a making that Man a Biſhop that it's granted to? If ſo, a Biſhop, a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and a Chancellor are all of one Office, when thus impowred. If not ſo, then a Lay-man, or one of another Office, may have power to do the Work of the Biſhops Office. And what is the Office (tell me if you can) beſide <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> to do the Work? A Lay-man and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter may by the Biſhop be Authorized and Obliged to do the Work of a Biſhop, and this <hi>ordinarily</hi> as an Office: (For ſo they do,) <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and a Presbyter may be made really a Biſhop, and yet in their eſteem remain a Lay-man and a Presbyter ſtill. And is not that a Lay Office which a Lay-man may be Commiſſioned to do? If a Lay-man were but Commiſſioned to do the Work of a Presbyter (to Teach a Church ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61252:52"/>
to Adminiſter the Sacraments, and to Excommunicate and Abſolve <hi>in foro internae poenitentialis,</hi> either it would make the Man a Presbyter, or it would be a Nullity. And if it be not ſo with the Biſhops Office, what is the Reaſon? Is it not becauſe it is not of Divine Specification and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but Humane, and therefore mutable, or ſuch as Men may parcel out, and commit to Lay-men by pieces as they pleaſe? So much to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Appropriation of the Power of the Keys in that Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>As to his Annotations, I ſhall have occaſion to recite them hereafter,<note place="margin">The Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> among thoſe that give up the Dioceſan Cauſe (as oppoſed by us) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall here paſs them by.</p>
               <p>His Diſſertations againſt <hi>Blondel,</hi> have a Premonition about Ordination, which though moſt confident, I ſhall manifeſt, when I come to the point of Ordination, to be moſt weak; and indeed have done it before his death in my Diſput. of Ordin.</p>
               <p>His firſt Preliminary Diſſertation of Antichriſt, of the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> I will not be ſo needleſly tedious as to meddle with any further then to ſay that I will believe Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> here, and in his Annot. on 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. when I am fallen into ſo deep a ſleep, as to dream, 1. That the famous Coming of Chriſt, and our gathering together to him, (which is a great Article of the Chriſtian Faith) is but <hi>Titus</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that the reward promiſed to all that love his appearing, is meant to all that love the ſaid Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> 2. And that this Deſtruction was not to be called <hi>nigh,</hi> or at <hi>hand,</hi> which fell out ſo few Years after. 3. And that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of remote Countries were ſo ſhaken in mind and moved about a Queſtion of a few Years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> more than about Chriſt's coming to the Common Judgment. 4. And that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were indeed ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſecutors of the Church, (who were diſperſed Subjects) when their Doctrine was but that they might diſſemble to eſcape Perſecution them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and greater Perſecutions were near? and not the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> nor <hi>Jews,</hi> but <hi>Nero</hi> beheaded <hi>Paul;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were baniſhed <hi>Rome?</hi> 5. And that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was indeed ſo famous a Fellow, as to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſupream God, when Church Writers ſpeak ſo uncertainly of his conflicts with <hi>Peter</hi> as of a doubtful ſtory, and the evidence is ſo obſcure, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories ſay ſo little of him? He might as well have thought the Apoſtle would have made all that ado about <hi>James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> if he had been then alive. 6. And that there were not many other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks as well as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> that troubled the Churches, if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> knew how to name them and deſcribe them rightly, or <hi>Irenaeus</hi> before him, or <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. before them. 7. And that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his Hereſie was a Myſtery of Iniquity <hi>not revealed</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> 8. And that many had not then followed him and fallen away to Hereſie. 9. Or that by the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> that muſt firſt come, is meant the Apoſtles ſeparation from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; As if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61252:53"/>
he had ſaid, we will firſt ſeparate, and that ſhall bring perſecution on you, but till we do that, it is with-held. 10. Or that the ſaid ſeparation was not done by degrees, ſome before this, and ſome after. 11. Or that the difference between the <hi>Jews</hi> perſecution of the Chriſtians, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Apoſtaſie, and after it, was indeed ſo great as to be the Criſis of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts Revelation. 12. And that poor <hi>Simon</hi> ſhould be the Man that <hi>ſitteth in the Temple of God, and oppoſed and exalted himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> when as the Scripture never once nameth him after his depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Apoſtles curſe or threatning; though <hi>Nicolaitanes</hi> are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and <hi>Alexander, Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> named, and other Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all the terrible things foretold, which are here ſuppoſed to be done by <hi>Simon,</hi> and his Doctrine? What, were all the Sacred Writers afraid to name him when they recited all the Evils that he muſt do, and are ſuppoſed to make it a great part of all the Epiſtles, and the Hiſtory in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and when he had been ſo ſharply rebuked and humbled before, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13. That the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he <hi>that with-holdeth, till he be taken out of the way,</hi> is not meant of any perſon, <hi>power</hi> or <hi>ſtate,</hi> but the aforeſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Apoſtles. 14. That <hi>verſe</hi> 8. that <hi>the breath of Chriſt's own mouth,</hi> ſignifieth St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words that caſt down <hi>Simon</hi> when he fell and hurt him; and that the <hi>brightneſs of his coming, or the appearing of his own preſence,</hi> is nothing but the foreſaid Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 15. And ſo many of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and Hereticks, that troubled all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and other Countries, were got together into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as that they might be ſaid to be conſumed and deſtroyed there, who ſo long after troubled the Churches. 16. And when I can believe that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is made up of ſuch a ſence, and that moſt or much of it, was fulfilled before it was revealed and written, and all the reſt fulfilled long ago (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s days) except one Parentheſis, or a few Verſes in the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter. And that the Reſurrection and Thouſand Years reign of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, is that 1000 Years from <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s beginning, in which the Biſhops had Wealth and Honour, and ſate on Thrones, and judged the People in Courts, as our Lay-Chancellors now do; and that this Glory, Wealth, and Grandure of Prelates, is the Churches Reſurrection, Glory and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: And that theſe happy thouſand Years continued 700 Years after the riſing of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and included thoſe <hi>8th, 9th, 10th,</hi> and <hi>11th</hi> Ages, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and all learned men (even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf) ſo dolefully bewail. And that when Boys, and Whores, and Sorcerers, and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks ruled the Church, they were <hi>happy that had a part in this firſt Reſurrection</hi> to all this Glory, yea, that theſe are <hi>Holy</hi> too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6.

But confidence goeth not for proof with us. He tells us of the name of Epiſcopacy, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 29. We never queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether the Apoſtles had the Overſight of the Church; but we hold, 1. That the World was the firſt Object of their Office, from whence they were to gather Churches. 2. That the Place, Courſe, or Circuit of their Travels and Miniſtry, was not of any Divine Inſtitution, but left to their prudent choice, by the Common Rules of Nature (doing all things in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to Edifying) and ſometime directed in their motions by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſpiration of the Holy-Ghoſt. 3. That more than one Apoſtle was oft in the ſame Cities and Countries, none claiming it as his peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, nor denying the right of others to be there. And where one was this Year, another was the next. 4. That when an Apoſtle planted a Church in any City, and ſettled Biſhops over the People, they themſelves were called by many of the Ancients, the firſt Biſhops of thoſe Cities; in which ſence, one Man had many Biſhopricks. 5. That the Apoſtles were Itinerant unfixed Biſhops, and not fixed Biſhops, ſuch as they themſelves confined to any one limited Church or Province. Nor can it be proved out of all Antiquity, that any one of all the Apoſtles, was confined to any one limited Province, much leſs what that Province was; but only that their Ability, Opportunity, Time and Prudence limited every Man, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him as the End required. 6. And that if the Apoſtles had fixed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in particular limited Provinces, they had diſobeyed their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was, to go Preach the Goſpel to all the World. And no Man did ever yet ſo dote, as to pretend that they divided the whole World into twelve Provinces, and there fixed themſelves: And ſuch twelve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as they had been capable of overſeeing, would have been but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the World: And it was but a little part, comparatively, that they Preacht the Goſpel to: Moſt Kingdoms of the World they never ſaw: And thoſe which they came into, were ſo great and many, that they Preached but to a few of the People. Yet this was not their culpable Omiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61252:54"/>
they were limited by Natural Impotency, and ſo by Impoſſibilities of doing more: But had it been by a Voluntary ſetling themſelves in twelve Provinces to the neglect of all the reſt, the Caſe had been otherwiſe. But whilſt they did their beſt for the whole World themſelves, and Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others to do the reſt, they performed their Office.</p>
               <p>There needeth no more to be ſaid as to thoſe Ancients that name the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Biſhops:</hi> Nor is their Epiſcopacy, if proved, any thing to our Caſe, as ſhall be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. He thought he had proved that <hi>Power in the Church is given by the Apoſtles to the Biſhops only.</hi> Whereas (with <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> and moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) we hold it given to Chriſt's Miniſters, as ſuch, and therefore to them all, though in an Eminency the Apoſtles only had it. And, 1. Whereas he denyeth the Power of the 70, becauſe they were not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but Diſciples: We Anſwer, 1. That Evangeliſts and other Miniſters that were not Apoſtles, had the Power of the Keys. 2. That to deny that the 70 were at leaſt Temporary Apoſtles limited to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had the power of Preaching and working Miracles, would be to deny the letter of the Text. And the Apoſtles themſelves could not Govern Churches, till they were gathered.</p>
               <p>2. And yet if neither they, nor <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, in Baptizing, did exerciſe any power of the Keys (which he can never prove) it is nothing to our Caſe.</p>
               <p>3. When will he prove that the Evangeliſts and the Itinerant Aſſiſtants of the Apoſtles, had not the power of the Keys? When themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that the higher Orders contain the powers of the lower? And are the Biſhops higher than the Evangeliſts?</p>
               <p>4. Nay, when will he prove, that ever any Presbyter was Ordained by the Apoſtles, or by any others as they appointed, without the power of the Keys? It would weary one that loveth not confuſion and loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour, to read long Diſcourſes of the Power of the Keys or Government, which diſtinguiſh not the Government of the Laity or Flocks, from the Government of the Miniſters themſelves? and that abuſe the Church by feigning an Office of Presbyters that are not Presbyters, and proving that Church-Governors are not Church-Governors? For what is the Office of the Presbyter or Paſtor eſſentially, but a Stated Power and obligation to Teach and Govern the People, and Worſhip as their mouth and guide?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. He ſeemeth, by denying the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> the power of the Keys, and of Church-teaching, and making them meer Preachers to the Inſidels, to favour the Independants Opinion, who think the Laymen ſent forth are to do that work. But, 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Chriſt maketh ſuch Officers as muſt Preach and Baptize and gather Churches among the Infidels before they govern them, to be them that he will be with to the end of the World. And the ſame men had the Power of teaching the Churches when they were gathered, as is there expreſſed. 2. Call them by what name you will, ſuch <hi>Itenirants</hi> were uſual in the Apoſtles daies, as <hi>Silas, Apollo,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

more. 3. It was not the twelve Apoſtles only that Converted the World, but ſuch other Miniſters, that were called thus to labour by them, or by the Spirit immediately. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> is ſaid by many to have preached here, and in other Countries. 4. What man will dream that when theſe went abroad the World to convert men, they were the fixed Biſhops of particular Churches firſt, which they thus forſook? 5. Who will believe that <hi>Joſeph, Silas, Apollo, Luke, Mark, Nathaniel, Philip,</hi> or any other, when they had converted any City, or Countrey, had no power after to teach them as a Church, or give them the Lords Supper, no nor to Baptize them firſt, nor to ordain them Biſhops, and ſettle them in order, but muſt either have an Apoſtle or a City Biſhop to come thither after them to do it? Such Fancies are obtruded on the Church, becauſe the one Miniſterial or Prieſtly Office is firſt diſmembred, and then new Officers feigned to be made up of the ſeveral Limbs.</p>

As he rob'd the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> of the Power of the Keys, he would now rob all the meer Presbyters of it; and all (without ſhew of Scripture proof) from ſuch words of Canons or Ancients as ſay the Presbyters ſhall do nothing without the Biſhops. 1. As if the Presbyters were no Rulers of the Flocks, becauſe the Biſhops are Rulers of the Presbyters? As if a Judge or a Juſtice were no Governour, becauſe he is under the King? 2. O Cruel Biſhops that will undertake to do that for the Souls of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pariſhes, which many hundred Miniſters are too little for, that the Souls of men and their own together may be damn'd by the Omiſſion of it!

And will not the impartial Reader wonder at humane frailty, how eaſily men believe what they would have to be true, and what, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Nothing</hi> will go for undenyable proof. Let the Reader Note, 1. That the queſtion is not whether an Apoſtle after that he had planted a Church remain ſtill an Apoſtle to them as well as others, and have the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eminency of Power, which is greater than any meer Biſhop had. 2. But firſt, Whether the Apoſtles had any fixed Provinces, or Cities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken as their ſpecial charge, in which no other Apoſtle had Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Power? And 2. Whether there were not fixed Biſhops ſetled by them in all the Churches which they planted? 3. And whether it was not ſo in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>' in particular? Yea, whether they had not more Biſhops or Presbyters than one? For by [<hi>Unius</hi>] which here he applyeth to <hi>Paul,</hi> he meaneth <hi>Unicus, Paul only,</hi> or elſe he abuſeth his Reader and himſelf. And 1. He that will follow <hi>Paul</hi> in his Travels, will find that he went the ſame way that ſome other Apoſtles went, <hi>viz. John</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore that they muſt have the ſame Dioceſſes, or have their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes notably intermixt: <hi>John</hi> was in <hi>Aſia</hi> as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> and no man can prove that he was the Second Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Paul's</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor only when he was dead. Nor will the <hi>Romans</hi> be willing to grant that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of no more at <hi>Rome</hi> but the Jews only (as this Dr. elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where intimateth) leſt that prove not that the Gentile Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by <hi>Peter,</hi> but by <hi>Paul</hi> alone. 2. What proof hath he that beſides <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> there were not many other Apoſtles <hi>per vices</hi> in the ſame Cities where <hi>Paul</hi> had been? And that when they did come thither, they had not Apoſtolical Power there? 3. Doth not the Text expreſly ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> long travelled together? And doth it any where inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that <hi>Paul</hi> was the Governour of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or the ſole Biſhop of the Churches planted by them both together? Sure the people that would have worſhipped <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> but as <hi>Mercury,</hi> did ſee no Sign of ſuch a Prelacy in <hi>Paul.</hi> And the Apoſtles ſeem ſo to have ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by going by Couples (as Chriſt ſometimes ſent two and two before him,) as if they had done it purpoſely to prevent theſe Monarchical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were together at the healing of the Criple, and the ſucceſsful preaching that followed thereupon. Sometime <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are together; ſometime <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Mark: Paul</hi> and <hi>Soſthenes</hi> are the inſcribed Names who ſend the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> the ſecond. And in the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it is ſaid, <hi>One ſaith I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and another I am of</hi> Apollo; and <hi>c.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Every one of you ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas.—And <hi>Paul</hi> baptized none of them ſave <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and the houſhold of <hi>Stephanus.</hi> By which it appeareth that <hi>Peter</hi> was among them as well as <hi>Paul;</hi> and if <hi>Peter</hi> had been only the Biſhop of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61252:56"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> here alſo, <hi>Apollos</hi> would not have been brought in as a third in a way of equality: And the Controverſie would have been otherwiſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Paul,</hi> by telling the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was their ſole Biſhop, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> was theirs, and all of them, that <hi>Apollos</hi> was but their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But he goeth quite another way to work, preferring none, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Dioceſes, but levelling Miniſters, as being but the helpers of their Faith. And though they had Apoſtolical preeminence above <hi>Apollos,</hi> yet <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are not ſaid to have a proper Epiſcopacy over him.</p>
               <p>And now to his Arguments. 1. <hi>Paul planted; Paul onely was their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo, Paul</hi> onely was their Biſhop. I deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and may long wait for a ſyllable of proof. Contrarily, <hi>Paul</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was not their Apoſtle: <hi>Ergo, Paul</hi> onely was not their Biſhop. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apoſtle you ſay hath Epiſcopal Power included in the Apoſtolical: and none of them ceaſed to have Apoſtolical Power where-ever they came, (though they were many together, as at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>Ergo,</hi> None of them ceaſed to have Epiſcopal Power. The conceit of Converſion and Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity entituling to ſole Epiſcopacy, I ſhall confute by it ſelf anon.</p>
               <p>2. But <hi>Paul judged the inceſtuous perſon,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaketh of coming with the rod.</hi> And what followeth? <hi>Ergo,</hi> None but <hi>Paul</hi> might do the ſame in that Dioceſs. I deny the Conſequence. Any other Apoſtle might do the ſame. Where is your Proof? And if all this were granted, it is nothing againſt the Cauſe that we maintain.</p>
               <p>And next let us inquire, whether this Church had no Biſhops or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters but <hi>Paul?</hi> As here is not a word of proof on their ſide, ſo I prove the contrary:</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the Apoſtles ordained Elders or Biſhops in every Church and City, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Therefore the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had ſuch.</p>
               <p>2. If they had not Presbyters or Biſhops, they could hold no ordinary Chriſtian Church-Aſſemblies, for all Gods publick Worſhip; <hi>e. g.</hi> They could not communicate in the Lords Supper; for Lay-men may not be the Miniſters of it, nor the ordinary Guides and Teachers of a Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Church. But they did hold ſuch ordinary Aſſemblies, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Lords Supper. And to ſay, that they had onely Paſtors that were itinerant <hi>in tranſitu</hi> as they came one after another that way, is to ſpeak without book, and againſt it; and to make them differ from all other Churches, without proof.</p>
               <p>3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. doth plainly end that Controverſie, with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. when they had ſo many Prophets, and Teachers, and gifted Perſons in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, that <hi>Paul</hi> is put to reſtrain and regulate their Publick Exerciſes, directing them to ſpeak but one or two, and the reſt to judge: and this rather by the way of edifying plainneſs, than by Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>c.</hi> 11. they had enow to be the ordinary Miniſters of the Sacraments. And <hi>cb.</hi> 5. they had Inſtructions for Church-Diſcipline, both as to the inceſtuous man, and for all the ſcandalous for the time to come, and are chidden for not

And I ſo avoid contending about <hi>Names,</hi> even where it is of ſome importance to the Matter, that I will not waſte my time upon it till it be neceſſary.

Anſw.</hi> 1. We doubt not but the Apoſtles had indefinite itinerant Aſſiſtants, and definite fixed Biſhops placed by them as aforeſaid: But the indefinite and the definite muſt not be confounded. 2. And were not <hi>Luke, Mark, Timothy,</hi> and other itinerant Evangeliſts, as ſuch, of the Clergy, and ſuch Aſſiſtants or ſecondary Apoſtles? Exclude them, and you can prove none but the fixed Biſhops: But if they were, why did you before deny Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, <hi>Diſſert.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. the power of the Keys, and make them meer convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers, below Doctors and Paſtors, and the ſame with Deacons? whereas <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. doth place them before Paſtors and Teachers. But avoiding the Controverſie <hi>de nomine,</hi> call them what you will, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe itinerant Aſſiſtants of the Apoſtles were of that One ſacred Office commonly called the Prieſthood or Miniſtry, though not yet fixed; and that the aſſigning them to particular Churches did not make them of a new Order, but onely give them a new object and opportunity to exerciſe the Power which they had before; and that <hi>Philip</hi> and other Deacons were not Evangeliſts meerly as Deacons (which term denoteth a fixed Office in one Church), but by a further Call: And that you never did prove, that ever the Scripture knew one Presbyter that had not the power of the Keys, as Biſhops have; yea, you confeſs your ſelf the contrary. All therefore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61252:57"/>
that followeth in that Chapter, and your Book, of <hi>James the Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and others having Epiſcopal power, is nothing againſt us: The thing that we put you to prove is, that ever the Apoſtles ordained ſuch an Officer as a Presbyter that hath not Epiſcopal Power and Obligation too, as to his Flock; that is, the Power of governing that Church according to God's Word.</p>
               <p>And I would learn, if I could, whether all the Apoſtles which ſtaid long at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> while <hi>James</hi> is ſuppoſed to be their Biſhop, were not Biſhops alſo with him? Whether they ceaſed to be Apoſtles to the People there? Or whether they were Apoſtles, and not Biſhops? And whether they loſt any of their Power by making <hi>James</hi> Biſhop? And whether one Church then had not many Biſhops at once? And if they made <hi>James</hi> greater than themſelves, Whether according to your Premonition they did not give a Power or Honour which they had not (which you think unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our Caſe)?</p>

Nay indeed, though the Society be ſpecified by the Government, yet the Name ſticketh in their teeth here in <hi>England,</hi> and they ſeldom uſe the Title of <hi>the Church of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi>] for the whole Province; and they uſe to ſay the <hi>Dioceſe</hi> of <hi>Lincoln, London, Wincheſter, Worceſter, Coventry and Litchfield, &amp;c.</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than [<hi>the Church of Lincoln, London, Coventry and Litchfield &amp;c.</hi>] leſt the Hearers would ſo hardly he ſeduced from the proper ſenſe of the word [<hi>Church</hi>] as not to underſtand them.</p>

The firſt Inſtance is <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 26. 16. 4. and 15. 2, 3, 22, 23, 30. Not a word elſe out of Scripture. And what's here?

And won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he may for me, unleſs this be it: The Apoſtles and Elders were at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> when they wrote this Letter, and thence ſent it to <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia: Ergo,</hi> They eſtabliſhed the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Metropolitan of <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> went from <hi>Antioch</hi> to other Cities, and delivered them theſe Decrees: <hi>Ergo, Antioch</hi> is the governing Metropolis of thoſe Cities. I think the major Propoſitions are, [Every City from which Apoſtles ſend their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to other Cities, and every City from which an Apoſtle carrieth ſuch Letters or Decrees to other Cities, is by thoſe Apoſtles made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Metropolis of thoſe other Cities.] What dull Heads are the Puritans, to queſtion ſuch a Propoſition as this! But it is not given to all Men to be wiſe: And we ignorant Perſons are left in doubt, <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether the Univerſal Headſhip or Papacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be not of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Inſtitution? and that more than by one Apoſtle, even by all of them that were then at <hi>Jeruſalem?

Whether Christ's Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſending the Apoſtles thence into all the World, (and not into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire onely) do not incomparably more evidently make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Univerſal Metropolis of the Earth, and ſo ſet it above <hi>Rome,</hi> which is but the Metropolis of one Empire? <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whether then an Univerſal Head of the Church or Vicar of Chriſt be not <hi>jure Divino?</hi> and ſo a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Papacy be not eſſential to the true Church and Religion? <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Whether then all the Emperours, Biſhops, and Churches, that did ſet up <hi>Rome, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> above <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were not Traytors againſt the Univerſal Sovereign of the Church, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Uſurpation and groſs Schiſm? <hi>Q.</hi> 6.

Whether <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome</hi> could alter this Church-Conſtitution? and one Apoſtle could undo what all together had done? <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Whether the Apoſtles carried this Metropolitical Prerogative with them from place to place, where-ever they came? And whether it did belong to the <hi>Men</hi> or the <hi>Place?</hi> And whether to the Place whence they firſt ſet out, or to every

place where they came? or to the place where they dyed? Judge what is the proof of any of theſe. <hi>Q.</hi> 9. When they were ſcattered; which of their Seats was the Metropolitan to the reſt? or were they all equal? <hi>Q.</hi> 10. If the Power followed the Civil Power of the Metropolitane Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whether <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not more in conſtituting the Church-Order, and giving power comparatively to the Metropolitanes, than Chriſt and his Apoſtles? <hi>Q.</hi> 11. Whether it was not in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s power to unmake all the Church Metropolitans and Biſhops at his pleaſure, by diſſolving the Priviledges and Charters of Cities? <hi>Q.</hi> 12. If it pleaſe any King, or be the Cuſtom of any Kingdom (as it is in many parts of <hi>America</hi>) that the Kingdom have no Cities or Metropolis, whether it muſt have any Churches, Biſhops, or Metropolitane? <hi>Q.</hi> 13. Whether when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Letters from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> he thereby made the Biſhop of <hi>Corinth</hi> the Governour of the Biſhop and Dioceſs of <hi>Rome?</hi> And whether little <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was over them alſo, becauſe <hi>Phoebe</hi> carried the Letter?

If <hi>Paul</hi>'s carrying the Letters from <hi>Antioch</hi> to other Cities, proved <hi>Antioch</hi> the Governour of the reſt? whether when he returned from the other to <hi>Antioch</hi> again, he made not the other the Governours of <hi>Antioch?</hi> I am aſhamed to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Fiction any further. His following Citations from the Fathers I think unworthy of an Anſwer, till it be proved, 1. That theſe Fathers took the Metropolitane Order, as ſuch, to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, and not in complyance with the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, by meer humane, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable policy.

And whether one amongſt them ſhall have a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or guidance of the reſt, we think (as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath proved) to be a matter alterable by humane prudence, according to the various condition of the Churches: And if any take both ſuch Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops

Philippi <hi>where there was no Biſhop,</hi> but in other Cities of <hi>Macedonia</hi> that had every one a Prelate without ever a Presbyter under him.] With ſome this expounding may go for modeſt, if not true.</p>
               <p>Two probable Arguments I object againſt his improbable Expoſitions of this Text and that <hi>Acts</hi> 20. before mentioned: 1. Where did he ever read that all the Province of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was called <hi>Philippi;</hi> and the Saints ſaid to dwell at <hi>Philippi</hi> that dwelt all over <hi>Macedonia?</hi> 2. Where did he ever read in Scripture many Epiſcopal Churches under one Metropolitan, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>One Church</hi> in the ſingular Number, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. or One Flock either? 3. Will any knowing man deny that he contradicteth not only <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> but the common Expoſition of the Fathers, by this his odd Opinion? And is it not groſs partiality for the ſame man that can ſo eaſily caſt off the judgment of almoſt all the Ancients at once, to lay ſo much of the whole ſtreſs of his Dioceſan and Metropolitan Cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fathers aſſertions, yea doubtful reports; and to take it for ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt a thing in others, to deny belief to them in ſuch uncertain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
               <p>But he ſetteth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words againſt <hi>Aerius</hi> againſt them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who ordained in the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Dioceſs to his diſpleaſure, and that combined with that <hi>Theophilus Alexand.</hi> (of whom <hi>Socrates</hi> writeth ſuch horrid and unchriſtian practices) to root out <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> and raiſe a flame in the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who liker a mad man than a ſober Biſhop, came from <hi>Cyprus</hi> not only into the City, but the Church where <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> uſed to officiate, to inflame his people, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame againſt, and cenſure their Biſhop, to whom he was an inferiour; and that parted with him in a wrathful Prognoſtick, and dyed by the way home: And yet even this one man ſaith nothing to his advantage, but that the Apoſtles placed Biſhops only with Deacons in ſome Churches that had not fit men to make Presbyters of: which we not only grant, but doubt whether ever they made any but Biſhops, (though in great Cities there were many of them.)</p>
               <p>And §. 8, 9, 10. when it ſeemed to ſerve his turn, he yet further grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth us, by granting, yea maintaining that <hi>one</hi> Congregation had not two Biſhops, yet [<hi>nothing hindreth but that in the ſame City there might ſometimes be two diſtinct Aſſemblies, converted by two Apoſtles, perhaps of diſtinct dialects and rites, and theſe governed by diſtinct Biſhops, with a divided or diſtinct Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>] which is almoſt as much as we deſire. If any more be neceſſary he granteth it us, §. 11. where having feigned and not proved that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all the Province of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were ſaid by <hi>Paul</hi> to be at <hi>Philippi;</hi> he confeſſeth that then every City had a Biſhop, and <hi>none of thoſe that we now call Presbyters.</hi> And it is more this Baſtard ſort of Presbyters Office that we deny than the Biſhops: And granting this he grants us all; even that then there was no ſuch half Officers, nor Biſhops that had the rule of any Presbyters: which he further proveth, §. 19, 20, 21. And by the way, §. 16, 17. he giveth us two more Obſervations, 1. That the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

gave precedency to ſome Churches. Where I would learn whether the Holy Ghoſt ſtill obſerved the order in converting men, to begin at the higheſt Metropolis, and deſcend by order to the loweſt, and ſo to the Villages? Or whether our Doctor do not here contradict what he ſaid before, of the Apoſtles every where diſpoſing of the Churches according to the Civil Metropolitical Order? I doubt his memory here failed him.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Philippi</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> being both in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and theſe Epiſtles being each written to all the Province, we hence learn that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and that to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> were written to the ſame men. Whether each Epiſtle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> was written to all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſo all the faults charged on all that are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on any one, I leave to your arbitrary belief. For none of theſe are proved, whatever proof is boaſted of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. he further gratifieth us in expounding 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. in the ſame manner, One Biſhop with Deacons then ſerving for a whole Dioceſs, that is for one Aſſembly, not having ſuch a thing as a half Presbyter ſubject to any Biſhop.</p>

The Biſhops do only mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially give them poſſeſſion: Chriſt is the only Inſtituter of the Office by himſelf (and his Spirit in his Apoſtles.) Can the Biſhops any more chuſe to deliver this poſſeſſion by Ordination, than to preach the Goſpel? Could they have made Presbyters that had no power to teach the people? Is the Biſhops liberality the original of the Office? How much then is Chriſt beholden to Biſhops, that when a thouſand Pariſhes are in ſome one of their Dioceſſes, they will give leave to any Presbyter to teach any of the people? and that when eighteen hundred of us were ſilenced in one day (<hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1662.) that all the reſt were not ſerved ſo too?</p>

But if yet any think that the Dr. hath not fully granted us our Cauſe, let him take theſe additions: §. 7. He well gathereth from <hi>Clemens</hi> that this <hi>form of Government, founded in Biſhops and Deacons</hi> (in each Church) <hi>being ſetled by Men entruſted by Chriſt, is no leſs to be aſcribed to Gods Command than if Chriſt himſelf had conſtituted</hi> Biſhops and <hi>Deacons in every City.</hi> (Let who dare then approve of the alteration by the Introduction of another Order of Prieſts.) And §. 8. He noteth alſo out of <hi>Clemens</hi> that the <hi>foreſight</hi> of the <hi>contention</hi> that would be about Epiſcopacy cauſed this eſtabliſhment of Biſhops and Deacons: No doubt God foreknew both that the popular ſort would oppoſe Government, and that the Monarchical Prelates would depoſe all the Biſhops of the ſame Church ſave themſelves, and the Arch-Prelates would depoſe all the Biſhops of particular Churches, and ſet up half Prieſts in their ſtead. And he doth well not to paſs the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words in <hi>Clemens</hi> (though hard, yet plainly ſubverting the Doctors opinion) that from this ſame foreſight the Apoſtles conſtituted the foreſaid Biſhops and Deacons (in every Church) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] can allow no ſuch doubt as ſhall make this much of the ſenſe to be queſtionable, 1. That upon the foreſight of the Contentions about Epiſcopacy the Apoſtles made (by the Spirit) an eſtabliſhed Deſcription of the Orders and Offices which ſhould be in the Church, not only in their times, but afterwards. 2. And that the approved men that ſhould hereafter be ordained, ſhould ſucceed in thoſe ſame Orders which the Apoſtles had eſtabliſhed and deſcribed, even to the ſame Work or Office, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) 3. That the Apoſtles thus ſetled or deſcribed no mungrel or half Prieſts, but only Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, nor any Churches that had not each a Biſhop and Deacon. 4.

               <p>I can ſcarce ſpeak my thoughts plainlier, than by the Doctors next words, § 9. [<hi>It is evident that by the immediate impulſe of the Spirit of God Biſhops were conſtituted (Deacons only joyned to them) in every Church, and ſo at</hi> Corinth, <hi>and the reſt of the Cities of</hi> Achaia: <hi>And that by the command of the ſame Divine Propheſie or Revelation, ſucceſſors were aſſigned to them after their departure;</hi> (not a new order invented) <hi>Chriſt thus conſulting and providing for the Churches peace,</hi> &amp;c.] And §. 14. he well granteth, 1. <hi>That the form of Church Government was no where changed by the Apoſtles</hi> (and ſo no middle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inſtituted by them.) 2. <hi>That through all their Age, and when they were conſummate in the middle, under their Diſciples,</hi> the Government of every Church was in the power of the <hi>Biſhops and Deacons in common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas §. 13, &amp;c. he layeth this as the ground of his Cauſe, 1. That it was not the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> alone, but of all <hi>Achaia</hi> that <hi>Clemens</hi> writeth to under this name. 2. And that there were not many Biſhops in one Church,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61252:63"/>
but one to each of theſe particular Churches: I deſire the Reader, 1. To try impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially whether in all the Drs.

               <p>1. As is ſaid, whether Scripture cuſtom of ſpeech will allow us to call all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a Region [<hi>A Church</hi>] in the ſingular Number: Shew one Text for it if you can.</p>
               <p>2. Whether any ancient Eccleſiaſtical uſe of ſpeech will allow us to ſay that the Churches of <hi>Achaia</hi> dwell at <hi>Corinth</hi> (as <hi>Clemens</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>p.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p>3. Whether I have not proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had more Miniſters, or Clergy men, or Paſtors in it than one in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time? And therefore was not without ſo ſoon after.</p>

               <p>5. Yea when <hi>Clemens</hi> whole ſcope intimateth that this one or two did this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they aſpired after Power or Preeminence themſelves: Could they expect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be made the Rulers of more than one or two Churches?</p>
               <p>6. And what was the cauſe of this one or two like to touch the Biſhops of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches? And what Cogniſance was all <hi>Achaia</hi> like to have of the cauſe of one or two diſtant perſons, ſo as for them to riſe up againſt their own Biſhops.</p>
               <p>7. If it was not all nor many Paſtors that were thus turned out (as <hi>Clemens</hi> words import) why ſhould all <hi>Achaia</hi> be called ſeditious, and blamed for it?</p>
               <p>8. Doth not the common Law of Charity and Juſtice forbid us to extend thoſe words of reproof to a whole Province, which cannot be proved to extend farther than to a ſingle Church, and principally toucht but one or two.</p>
               <p>9. I have before proved that <hi>Paul</hi> by [the Saints at <hi>Corinth</hi>] meaneth but one Church: Therefore it's like that <hi>Clemens</hi> doth ſo too.</p>

But it is not ſo much without reaſon as he maketh it: For if Biſhops and Presbyters were in the firſt times called by one Name; and the higheſt Perſon in the Church then was ordinarily known by the name Presbyter, and the appropriating of [<hi>Biſhop</hi>] to one ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> to another, came afterwards in by ſuch inſenſible degrees, that no man can tell when it was, it ſounds very probable, that it was the true Epiſcopal Power, or the ſame Office and Order, that was firſt commonly poſſeſſed by them to whom the name was Common.</p>

               <p>I muſt deſire the Reader to remember all this, when we come to uſe it in due place.

So that by this Rule the Biſhop of <hi>London, York, Norwich,</hi> and <hi>Briſtow</hi> would have indeed large Cities with narrow liberties: But the reſt would have Dioceſſes little bigger than we could allow to conſcionable Faithful Paſtors.</p>

If the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had ſeven Deacons, I will not belive him (pardon the incivility) that they had but one Presbyter. And (pardon me a greater boldneſs in ſaying) if he had tryed but as much as I have done what it is to do all the Paſtoral work for one Pariſh of 2 or 3000 Perſons in publick and private, he could not poſſibly have been of this Opinion.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That it is not of Gods inſtitution, nor is pleaſing to him that there be no Churches and Biſhops but in Cities; or that a City with its territories, or Country adjacent, be the bounds of each Church.</head>
               <p>SOme late moſt eſteemed defenders of <hi>Dioceſanes,</hi> eſpecially Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon the ſuppoſition, that the Apoſtles ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Churches in the Metropolitane and Dioceſane order, and that they did partly in imitation of the Jewiſh policy, and partly as a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the nature of the thing, that even in Heathen Kingdomes, when Churches are gathered in any Cities, they muſt have a difference of Church power over each other as they find the Cities to have a civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (as you heard before from Dr. <hi>H.</hi>) that I think it meet here breifly to prove, 1. That it was not of the Apoſtles purpoſe to have Churches and Biſhops placed only in Cities, and not in Villages. 2. Nor that Church power ſhould thus follow the civil; 3. Nor that a City with its territories ſhould be the meaſure of the habitation of each Churches members. The <hi>licet</hi> in ſome caſes I deny not, but the <hi>oportet</hi> is the queſtion, yea and the <hi>licet</hi> in other caſes. The two firſt are proved together by theſe reaſons, following.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt himſelf our grand examplar did not only preach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Chriſtians in Cities, but in Country villages, where he held aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and preacht and prayed, yea in mountains and in Ships: And though he planted no particular Churches with fixed Biſhops there, yet that was becauſe he did ſo no where. He performed all offices in the Country which he did in the Cities, except that which was appropriated to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Law and the inſtitution of his laſt ſupper, which could be done but in one place.</p>
               <p>2. There is no Law of God (direct or indirect) which maketh it a duty to ſettle Churches and Biſhops in Cities only, and forbiddeth the ſetling them in Country villages: This is moſt evident to him that will ſearch the Scripture, and but try the pretended proofs of the late Prelatiſts; for the vanity of their pretenſions will eaſily appear; They have not ſo fair a pretenſe in the New Teſtament for aſſerting ſuch a Law, as the Pop: hath for his ſupermacy in [<hi>Peter feed my ſheep</hi>]. And where there is no Law, there is no obligation on us unto duty, and no ſin in omiſſion.</p>
               <p>If they ſay that [<hi>the Apoſtles did plant Churches only in Cities compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending their territories</hi>] I anſwer, 1. They prove that they planted them in Cities; but the ſilence of the Scriptures proveth not the Negative, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61252:68"/>
they planted none in Villages. 2. Nor have they a word of proof that each Church contained all Chriſtians in the Cities, with all the interjacent Villages. 3. Much leſs that they muſt contain all ſuch, when all the Countries were converted, and the Chriſtians were enow for many Churches. 4. Nor can they ever prove that the Apoſtles planting Churches only in Cities, was intended as a Law, to reſtrain men from planting them any where elſe; Any more than their not converting the Villages or the generality of the Cities, will prove that they muſt not be converted by any other: Or than that their ſetting up no Chriſtian Magiſtrates, or converting no Princes, will prove that there muſt be no ſuch thing. Whoever extended the obligation of Apoſtolical example to ſuch Negatives, as to do nothing which they did not? 5. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is moſt apparent why they preached firſt in Cities, becauſe there is no ſuch fiſhing as in the Sea; They had there the frequenteſt fulleſt audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rories: And ſo they planted their firſt Churches there, becauſe they had moſt converts there. And it is known that <hi>Judea</hi> (a barren mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Coutrey of it ſelf) had been ſo harreſſed with Wars, that there was little ſafety and quiet expected in Countrey Villages; and the Roman Empire had been free from the ſame plague by ſuch ſhort intervals, that as many people as could, got into the Cities: (for all that know by experience what War is, do know the miſery of poor Country people who are at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked Soldiers mercy.) It was therefore among poor ſcattered la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, a hard thing to get a conſiderable auditory: which maketh Mr. <hi>Eliots</hi> and his helpers work go on ſo heavily among the ſcattered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, who have no Cities or great Towns, becauſe they can rarely ſpeak to any conſiderable numbers. Now to gather from hence either that Villages muſt have no Churches or no Biſhops, is an impiety next to a concluding that they muſt not be aſſembled, taught, or worſhip God.</p>
               <p>3. The reaſons are vain and null, which are pretended for ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling of Churches to the form of the civil Government, and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining them to Cities. For, 1. There is no need that one Biſhop be the Governour of another at all; 2. And therefore no need that the Biſhop of a Metropolis govern the Biſhop of a leſſer City, or he, the Biſhop of a Village. 1. God hath not given one Biſhop power over another, as meer Biſhops. As <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Carth. Council, none of us are Biſhops of Biſhops,</hi> but Colleagues. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf ſaith, that the Biſhops are the Apoſtles Succeſſors, and the Apoſtles were equal in power and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Annot. in 1 Tim. 3. c. p 732. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt diſpenſing them (all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches of the whole world by himſelf and adminiſtring them ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by any one Oeconomus, but by the ſeveral Biſhops as inferiour heads of unity to the ſeveralbodies ſo conſtituted by the ſeveral Apoſtles in their plantations, each of them having</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a ſeveral diſtinct commiſſion from Chriſt immediately, and ſubordinate to none but the ſupreme donor or plenipotentiary.</hi>] Indeed if it be not Biſhops, but Archbiſhops or Biſhops of Biſhops which are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Succeſſors, in order over the Biſhops as they are ſuppoſed to be over the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61252:68"/>
Prieſts, then ſuch an order of Arch-Biſhops is of divine right; But not as Metropolitanes, or for the Cities ſake, but as general Officers to take care of many Churches, ſucceeding the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>2. And that Apoſtolical ſucceſſion is not the foundation of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan or City power is plain; 1. Becauſe if the Biſhop or Arch-Biſhop be the immediate ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, there muſt be but juſt 13 or 14 in the whole world, if they ſucceed them fully in the accidentals of their office: But if not, than their reſidence in Cities, will not prove that they muſt ſucceed them in that accident, any more than in the number. 2. Becauſe (as is ſhewed) the Apoſtles tyed not themſelves to Cities only, and what they did in preferring Cities was <hi>occaſional</hi> (as is ſaid before): 3. Nor is there the leaſt proof (beyond an oſtentation of vain words and confidence) that ever the Apoſtles ſetled Churches according to the civil form, and put the Biſhops of leſſer Cities under the Metropolitans: No more than that among themſelves that Apoſtle was Ruler of the reſt, who had the Metropolis for his Seat: The Papiſts themſelves not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that <hi>Peter</hi> was Ruler of the reſt, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was his Seat, but that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt have the ruling Univerſal Biſhop, becauſe it was the Seat of <hi>Peter.</hi> And if the Metropolis made not one Apoſtle Ruler of the reſt, why ſhould it do ſo by their ſucceſſors? And I never heard any attempt to prove, that <hi>Mathew, Bartholomew, Lebbeus, James</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Philip</hi> and every one of the Apoſtles had a diſtinct independent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis for his Epiſcopal Seat. 4. Indeed its but vain words of them that pretend that the Apoſtles fixed themſelves in any Seat at all; but it is certain by their Office and by Hiſtory that they oft removed from place to place, in order to call as much of the world as they were capable, and were ſomtimes in <hi>Metropoles</hi> and ſometimes in other places: and though the ancients make them the firſt Biſhops of Churches, they do not ſay that they were Biſhops of any particular Churches only, excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely to all others. But the ſame Apoſtle that Planted ten or twenty Churches was the firſt Biſhop of them all <hi>pro tempore,</hi> ſetling fixed Biſhops to ſucceed them. 5. And whoever dreamed that <hi>Mark</hi> who was no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, was the Ruler of other Apoſtles, (at leaſt that came into <hi>his</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) becauſe <hi>Alexandria</hi> was the ſecond Metropolis?</p>
               <p>4. This pretended forming of the Churches as aforeſaid; is contrary to the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> inſtitution <hi>and</hi> Communion: which are the publick worſhipping of God, and perſonal Communion of Parochians or Cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in that worſhip, Sacraments and holy living, in mutual aſſiſtance. Whereas in a great part of the world, Country Villages are ſo far from any <hi>Cities,</hi> that if they muſt travel to them for this publick Communion, they muſt ſpend all the Lords day in travaile, and yet miſs their Ends, and come too late. Nor can Women, Children and aged ones poſſibly do it at all. But if they are to have no ſuch perſonal Communion with the City Churches, but have it ordinarily among themſelves, then (whatever men may ſay that ſtrive about the Name) they are not of that <hi>particular</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61252:69"/>
City Church as ſuch, but are of another Church at home, which muſt have a Biſhop<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe it is a Church.</p>
               <p>5. Their Civil and City or Dioceſan frame contradicteth the plain inſtitution or Law of Chriſt and of his Spirit. For 1. Math. 28. 19. 20. it is the very Commiſſion of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors (with whom Chriſt will be to the end of the world) to Teach or Diſciple all Nations, and then to Baptizc them, and ſo gather them into the Church Univerſal, and then Teach them as Diſciples all his Laws, which includeth Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating them in perticular Churches where they muſt be ſo taught. Now as it is all Nations, even the whole Countryes and not the Cities only that muſt be Diſcipled or convicted and Baptized, ſo it is the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Villages and all of Baptized perſons that muſt thus be <hi>Congregated into particular Churches</hi> and taught. 2. To which add Act. 14. 23. the poſitive exemplary and ſo obliging ordinary practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>They ordained them Elders in every Church:</hi> ſo that 1. It is Gods will that <hi>Villages</hi> have Churches. 2. And it is Gods will that every Church have a Biſhop (at leaſt) therefore it is Gods will that every Village have a Biſhop which have a Church; or that ſome Villages have Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And though [<hi>every</hi> City be mentioned Tit. 1. 5. that only ſheweth that <hi>de facto</hi> then and there, Village Churches were rare or none, but not <hi>de jure</hi> they muſt not be gathered: nor doth he ſay [<hi>ordain Elders in Cities only</hi>]: much leſs [give them Rule according to the City power.]</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Ceuchrea</hi> had a Church, which was no City, ſo Act. 14. 23. will prove that they ſhould have a Biſhop. For every Church is to have a Biſhop. And <hi>Ceuchrea</hi> was not a family-Church; and ſo the name not uſed equivocally: And Biſhop <hi>Downams</hi> aſſertion that it was a Church with a mean Presbyter under the Biſhop of Corinth, is a naked unproved ſaying that deſerveth no credit; and is contradicted by Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who ſaith there was there no meer Presbyter in being.</p>
               <p>6. Had this form been ſetled as they Pretend (in Cities only and Dioceſſes) there would have been uncertainty and contentions what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould have Biſhops and Churches, and what places ſhould have none. For it is uncertain and litigious, what place is to be taken for a City and what not. For <gap reason="foreign">

If it be ſaid, that the account and name then and thus uſed was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, they will then make Gods Church to depend for being upon a <hi>Name</hi> with heathen people. If they will call <hi>Ceucbrea</hi> a City, it ſhall have a Church; otherwiſe it ſhall have none. But there was no ſuch contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>7. According to their model Churches ſhall be mutable and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vible at the will of the Magiſtrate, yea of every Heathen Magiſtrate: For
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61252:69"/>
if he will but change the priviledges and title of a Town and make it no <hi>City,</hi> it muſt have no Church or Biſhop: And if he will remove the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and title, the Church and Biſhop muſt remove: And if he will endow a big Village or Town with City privileges and name, a Church and Biſhop muſt be then made anew. But who can believe that Chriſt thus modled his Churches in his inſtitution?</p>
               <p>8. Yea after their model, an infidel or Chriſtian King <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> that never thinketh on it or intendeth it, ſhall change the Churches, and deſtroy them. If by war a City be turned into no City, or if the King for other reaſons un-city it, or if change of Government put it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes power, that ſhall for his convenience un city it, the Church in City and Country is at an end, though there remain people enow to conſtitute a Church.</p>
               <p>9. Yea a fire or an Earthquake by this Rule may end a Church, by Wood and ſtone, though the Country ſtill have never ſo many Chriſtians: and when the City is gone, the Church is gone. 10. Yea it will be in the power of every king, even of Heathens, whether Chriſt ſhall have any Church or Biſhop in his kingdoms, or not. Becauſe he can un-city or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge all the Cities in his kingdom at his pleaſure, and conſequently unchurch all the Churches.</p>
               <p>11. And by their way Chriſt hath ſetled as various Church forms as there be forms of Government in the world: For all Dominions are not divided into Provinces, under Priſidents <hi>&amp;c</hi> as the Roman Empire was: In many Countries, the Metropolis hath no ſuperiority over the other City or the Country, and ſo that will be of divine inſtitution in one Country, which will be a ſin in others.</p>
               <p>12. Yea by this Rule many vaſt Countries muſt have no Biſhops or Churches at all, becauſe they have no Cities (as is known among the Americans); and others muſt have but one Church and Biſhop in a whole Country of many hundred Miles.</p>
               <p>13. And by their Rule all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> are unbiſhoped, and their Dioceſan <hi>Churches</hi> are unchurched. For 1. Some of them (in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Man</hi>) have no Cities now called ſuch. 2. Others of them have many Cities (not only <hi>Coventry and Lichfield, Bath and Wells</hi> now called Cities, but) abundance of Corporations really Cities. 3. And the Cities in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have no Civil Government o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Countries, Corporations, Villages of the Diocefe at all: nor are they Seats of Preſidents or Lieutenants that have ſuch Rule, ſo that our Dioceſes are not modelled to the form of the Civil Government. What ſubjection doth <hi>Hartfordſhire, Bedfordſhire, Buckinghamſhire, &amp;c.</hi> owe to the Town of Lincolne?</p>
               <p>14. By their model it is not Biſhops and Metropolitans alone that are of divine right: For if the Church Government muſt be modelled to the Civill, the Imperial Churches muſt have had Officers to anſwer all the Proconſuls and Preſects, the Lieutenants, the Vicars, the Conſular

               <p>15. They muſt by their rule, ſet up in <hi>England</hi> an inconſiſtent or ſelf deſtroying form. For in many if not moſt Counties our Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, and Sherifs, and moſt Juſtices dwell in Countrey mannors and Villages, and not in Cities. And ſo either Cities muſt not be the Seats of Biſhops and Churches, or elſe the Seat of Civil Government muſt not be the Seat of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. If they ſay that <hi>Aſſizes</hi> and Seſſions are kept in the County Towns, I anſwer. 1. So Church aſſemblies called Synods or Councils may be held in them, and yet not be the Biſhops Seat. For they are not the Judges or Juſtices Seat, becauſe of Aſſizes, and quarterly Seſſions. 2. The obſervation is not univerſally true: Yea no Aſſizes or Seſſions at all are therefore held in any Town becauſe it is the County Town, but becauſe it is the convenienteſt place for meeting; The choice of which is left to the Judges and Juſtices; who ſometimes chooſe the County-Town, and ſometimes another, as they pleaſe (As <hi>Bridgnorth</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Aleshury</hi> (not <hi>Buckingham</hi>) ordinarily in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and ſo of others. 3.

And at this day many Biſhops ordinarily dwell in their Country houſes, (As the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> did at <hi>Bugden,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Coventree</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) at <hi>Eccleſhall</hi> Caſtle; the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> (now) at <hi>Wigan,</hi> and ſo of others). And I think that is the Biſhops Seat where uſually his dwelling is, and not where a Lay-Chancellor keepes a Court, or where a Dean and Chapter dwell who are no Biſhops.</p>
               <p>19. There have (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath well proved) been of old ſeveral Churches in one City; one of <hi>Jews</hi> and one of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with their ſeveral Biſhops and Clergy. Therefore one City with its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories is not <hi>jure Divino</hi> the meaſure or boundaries of one only Church.</p>
               <p>20. If the Church Government muſt be modelled to the Civil, then in every Monarchie or Empire there muſt be one Univerſal Paſtor to rule all the reſt as there is one King: And in every Ariſtocracy, there muſt be a Synod of Prelates in Church Supremacy; and in every <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi>—who or what—But then the Papacy will be proved not only lawful, but of Divine inſtitution, as the Head or Church Soveraign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (though not of all the world) (at <hi>Rome</hi> firſt and at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> after) And indeed I know no word of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can be given to draw an impartial man of Judgment to doubt, but that <hi>Metropolitans, Primates, Patriarcks,</hi> and the Pope as Head of the Churches in the Empire, ſtood all on the ſame ground, and had the ſame Original; as all Fathers Councells and Hiſtory ſhew, which true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proveth that (as an Univerſal Papacy is a Treaſonable Uſurpation, ſo) an Imperial Papacy (that is, through the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) is but a human Creature, and <hi>Metropolitans, Patriarcks, &amp;c.</hi> are the like; and they that will feigne the one to be of Gods inſtitution or neceſſary, muſt ſay that the other is ſo to.</p>
               <p>But after all this, one conſequence puts the world in hope that <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi> may come in time to be reformed: For ſeeling Kings may make and unmake Cities, and conſequently Biſhop-pricks at their pleaſure, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty, or any other wiſe and Holy Prince, to declare every Corporation and Market Town to be a <hi>City,</hi> we muſt needs have a Biſhop in every one of them (according to the principles of the Prelates themſelves.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Definition and reaſons of a Dioceſan Church conſidered, and overthrown.</head>
               <p>I Have already ſhewed, that we diſpute not about aery notions, nor Non-exiſtence, but about ſuch Dioceſes as we ſee and have; and that by a Dioceſe we Non-conformiſts mean only a large circuit of ground with its inhabitants conteining many perticular Pariſhes: And by a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church, we mean all the Chriſtians within that circuit, who have but one Biſhop over them, though they be of many Pariſh Churches, yea few <hi>Presbyterians</hi> take the word ſo narrow as this. For (I think too) many of them do with <hi>Rutherford</hi> diſtinguiſh between a worſhipping Church and a Governed Church (and ſadling the horſe for Prelacy to mount on) do affirm that many (about twelve uſualy) of theſe worſhiping Churches (like our Pariſhes) may make but one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned or Presbyterial Church: But a Dioceſe in England containeth many hundred, and ſome above a thouſand Pariſhes (as is ſaid.)</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> (<hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Downam</hi>) define not a Dioceſe (as we ſee it) as conteining many Churches or holy aſſemblies; but only as being the Church of one City with its territories. Now the queſtion is, what it is that is the ſpecifying difference by which a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church is diſtinguiſhed from others, and conſtituted. 1. Not that it is in a City: For an Independent Church, or a Presbyterian Church may be in a City: When there is but <hi>one Church</hi> there, or many Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ones, theſe are no other than thoſe allow, whom you take for your chief adverſaries.</p>
               <p>2. Is it then the circuit of <hi>ground</hi> that is the boundary of theſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61252:71"/>
Churches, either this ground is inhabited, or not; if not, then earth and trees make their Churches. If inhabited, it is by Infidels, or by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or both. If by Infidels they are no <hi>members</hi> of any Chriſtian Church, and therefore not of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church. Unleſs they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to have Churhes of Infidels:</p>
               <p>If they be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> either they are no more, nor more diſtant than as that they may (at leaſt the main body of them) come on the Lords daies to the City Church into one aſſembly, or elſe they are enow to make more or many Church aſſemblies. If the former, than what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer they from a <hi>Pariſh Church,</hi> or an <hi>Independent Church,</hi> which is planted in a City? When each of them are but one congregation, where is the difference but in the arbitrary Name?</p>
               <p>But if the City and territories have Chriſtians enow for <hi>many Churches,</hi> then either they are formed into many or not. If they are, they ſhould (by their own confeſſion) have many Biſhops: If not, either Church Societies are Gods ordinance or not. If not, the City ſhould have none: If they are, where hath God exempted the Country from the priviledge or duty any more than the City?</p>
               <p>But if they ſhould ſay that a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church is one Church in a City and its territories conſiſting of Chriſtians enow to make many, of whom the moſt part take up with oratories for Churches, this would ſuite our Notion of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church, but not theirs. For they ſay that it is not neceſſary that a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church have more than one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>Therefore it muſt needs follow that their <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our Pariſh or Congregational Churches only <hi>in potentiâ</hi> and not <hi>in actu,</hi> or elſe earth or Infidels muſt be the differencing matter. Unleſs they will ſay that the <hi>Order of Prelacy</hi> in it maketh the difference, which is the office of a Paſtor who is actually Governour but of one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is <hi>in potentia</hi> to be the Governour of more when he can convert them, and then is the Governour of them all in that territory when they are converted. But if <hi>one</hi> congregation or <hi>many</hi> make not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, a meer poſſibility in the Infidels of becoming Chriſtians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the difference, becauſe the Subjects of that poſſibility are no members of the Church at all. Therefore the difference muſt be only in the office of the Biſhop. And if ſo, then an <hi>Independent</hi> Church that hath a Biſhop is a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church; And ſo an <hi>Independant</hi> and a <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> Church may be all one. And then if a Biſhop were but ſetled in a Pariſh Church in the City or Countrey, it would make it a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church. And then when we have proved that the Country ſhould have Churches, and not meer Oratories, and that every Church ſhould have a Biſhop, and ſo that a Biſhop is not to be appropriated to a City and its territories, we have done all. And that ſociety which ſhould have all Gods Church ordinances, ſhould have a Paſtor neceſſary for the exerciſing of them all. But every true Pariſh Church, ſhould have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61252:72"/>
all Gods ordinances (belonging to a ſingle Church) therefore they ſhould have a Paſtor (at leaſt) to exerciſe them. And, a Paſtor author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized to exerciſe all particular Church ordinances of Chriſts is a true Biſhop. But every true particular Church ſhould have ſuch a Paſtor. Therefore they ſhould have a Biſhop. By the <hi>Church ordinances</hi> I mean 1. Teaching. 2. Miniſterial Worſhip, in Prayer, Praiſe and Sacraments. 3. Diſcipline ſecret and publick in that Church. And let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they that inſtead of proof, do but crudely affirme, that Cities only may be Biſhops Seats, do but beg the queſtion.</p>
               <p>But becauſe he that puts us hardeſt to it (<hi>Downame</hi>) doth lay ſo much on theſe two differences of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church from a Parochial. 1. That a Dioceſe conteineth the City and territories, though at firſt it have but one Congregation. 2. That converting the reſt of the City and territories, giveth the Biſhop a right to Govern them all: I will further diſtinctly conſider of both theſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Whether the Infidel Territories or Citizens do make part of a Dioceſane Church.</head>
               <p>1. WE diſtinguiſh between a Dioceſe and a Dioceſane Church. 1. The word Dioceſe firſt was of civil ſignification, and ſo we have nothing to do with it. 2. It may ſignifie a Country of Infidels whom a Miniſter of Chriſt endeavoureth to convert: And ſo it is no Church of it ſelf, nor no part of a Church, if a Church be in it: (as is paſt all queſtion.) And ſo we deny not but that, 1. Every Miniſter ſhould convert as many Infidels as he can. 2. That he that is reſident on the place as Paſtor of a Cohabiting Church hath better opportunity than a ſtranger uſually to convert the neighbour infidels; And therefore hath more obligation to endeavour it; becauſe men muſt divide and order their work as their opportunities do invite and guide them. 3. But yet that God ſet no man his Miniſterial Charge by the meaſure of ground: And therefore that if ſuch a City-Biſhop have a ſmaller number of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in his territories, than will take up his time and labour (beſides the care of his Church) he ought not to confine his labour to them, nor neglect other territories that need his help, but may, muſt and ſhould go further in his endeavours, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and other later Biſhops among the Saxons, notwithſtanding the neighbourhood of the Brittains; and as <hi>Wilfred</hi> alias <hi>Boniface</hi> among the Germans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if any other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter come among the Infidels in the Territories of a City that hath a Church, while they have need of ſuch help, the Biſhop were a beaſt if he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61252:72"/>
ſhould forbid him on pretenſe that it is his Dioceſs where another hath nothing to do. But as unoccupied Countries belong to any occupant, ſo an Infidel Country belongeth to any preacher that hath opportunity to convert them. And if a Dioceſane prohibit ſuch preaching, he is to be neglected or reprehended, but not obeyed. Yet I deny not, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may direct preachers (as it would do occupants in the aforeſaid caſe) to diſtribute their labours ſo as one may not hinder but help another: But that is not a Law of propriety otherwiſe than as mutual conſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth. And it is, but the determination of circumſtances, and that not about any part of a Church, and therefore nothing to the conſtitution of a Church.</p>
               <p>And as is ſhewed, as Chriſt ſent his Diſciples out by two and two, ſo the Apoſtles oft went two together, or an Apoſtle and an Evangeliſt, which ſhewed that no one claimed the Dioceſs. But ſtill, were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Infidels are not of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Whether converting a Dioceſe give right to the Converter to be their Biſhop or Governour.</head>
               <p>1: WE deny not, but that Converts owe a peculiar love and reſpect to thoſe as their fathers in Chriſt which did convert them; which <hi>Paul</hi> claimeth of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 2. And we deny not but <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> that man being as fit a man as others, and his abode being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Church being not full, but capable of them, this advantage ſhould encline his converts, to chooſe him rather than another for their Paſtor,</p>
               <p>But yet converting them as ſuch giveth him not a right to govern them as their Paſtor, nor neceſſitateth them to chooſe him: As I prove.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe a Lay man (as <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Edeſius</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> &amp;c.) may convert men, who are not Paſtors to them or any.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe Converſion and Baptiſm as ſuch is but mens admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Univerſal</hi> Church (as in the Eunuchs caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. is manifeſt) and not into any particular Church: It uniteth them to Chriſt, but not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Paſtor: For they Baptize not into their own name.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe when two or three go together, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, Luke,</hi> &amp;c. it is to be ſuppoſed that one converteth not all, but one ſome and another ſome; and therefore if converting gave right there muſt be many Biſhops and Churches in a place.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe when a Church is ſettled, a ſtrange preacher that cometh
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61252:73"/>
after, yea one that hath a charge elſewhere, may convert many neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that were not Converted, and yet it will not follow that he muſt come, and ſet up another Church there for that, nor that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their dwelling to follow him.</p>
               <p>5. Becauſe a man may (and abundance of excellent preachers have<note place="margin">Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is fitteſt to be choſen for their Paſtor: on which account <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> was choſen at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> for the Succeſs of his Miniſtry againſt Arianiſm: And in my <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> I have told you of a Council that decreed, that if a Biſhop neglected to turn any of his City from here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, he that converted them ſhould have them for his flock: which ſheweth that there might on juſt cauſe be then more Biſhops and Churches than one in a City; and that they were not neceſſarily meaſured by the compaſs of ground, but Churches might be mixt among each other as to habitation, on ſuch occaſions.</note> done it) convert many ſouls in many Countries where they go at great diſtances from each other: But he cannot be the Biſhop of ſo many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Churches ſo far diſperſed.</p>
               <p>6. Becauſe it would make it uncertain who it is that hath any where the Epiſcopal power. For Converſion is, 1. a ſecret work known only to the perſon converted. 2. And it is an obſcure and uſually a gradual work, not done at once, but by ſuch degrees, that the convert ſeldome knoweth himſelf who it was that converted him: Though he may know that one mans miniſtry ſo far convinced him, and another ſo far, and ſo on; It will be hard to ſay juſt when it came to a converſion. And if you ſay it is he that perſwaded him to be baptized, that may be a lay man, or long after his Converſion. Princes in ſome Countries force or perſwade thouſands to be baptized. If you ſay, that it is he that <hi>Baptized</hi> him, than <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be Paſtor but to few of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who thanked God that he baptized none of them but <hi>Stephanus</hi> houſhold, <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Criſpus;</hi> as being not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>7. Becauſe elſe many perſons ſhould be neceſſitated to chooſe a bad or very weak man, if not a heretick for their Biſhop, when they may have far better and ablermen. For it hath been known that a bad Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and a heretical Miniſter, much more a very weak Miniſter hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted men. But God doth not allow ſuch converts therefore to caſt their Souls under the danger and diſadvantage of ſuch a ones Miniſtry, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſights when much fitter may be had.</p>
               <p>8. Becauſe both nature and Scripture example direct men to another courſe; that is, 1. To be members of the Church where they are coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, if there be a worthy Paſtor; 2. And to get the beſt they can. For cohabitation or proximity or vicinity is neceſſary to Church ends, both to publick and private communion and mutual help. But the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that converth them may dwell far off that.</p>
               <p>Therefore indeed the Reaſons why all in a City and vicinity were wont to be of the ſame Church (if there were room) was not becauſe that Miniſter converted them, but becauſe they were fit for ſuch Communion by cohabitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61252:73"/>9. And were it otherwiſe the Biſhop and his Presbyters preaching to the ſame people, the Presbyter might convert more and become joint Biſhop.</p>
               <p>10. And certainly it would unbiſhop all the Engliſh Biſhops almoſt that I am acquainted with, who nether converted their Dioceſes from Infidelity, nor baptized them, nor convert many that ever we hearof from a wicked life, to ſerious holineſs: which the Presbyters have done by very many, and ſo muſt there be made the Biſhops (if they would.)</p>

X.</hi> That a particular Church of the firſt or loweſt order, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Neighbour Chriſtians aſſociated for <hi>Perſonal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in <hi>local preſence,</hi> in holy worſhip and converſation; and not of ſtrangres ſo remote, as have only an Internal Heart-Communion, or an External Communion by the mediation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</head>
               <p>LEt it be here noted (that none dally with the Name [Church] as an equivocal, that, 1. I ſpeak of no meer Community of Chriſtians, nor of any accidentall aſſembly, which have no Paſtors, or no intent of ſacred ends; Call them what you will: But of a proper Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety conſtituted of the <hi>Pars gubernans</hi> and the <hi>Pars gubernata;</hi> the Paſtor and Flock. 2. That I ſpeak not of a Family Church, which conſiſteth of the Maſter and the Family. 3. Nor yet of the Univerſal Political Church, as viſible or as myſticall: which conſiſteth of Chriſt the head, and all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or ſincere believers. 4. Nor of any <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> confined by Agreement for <hi>Concord</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> being many. 5. Nor of any ſuch Churches accidentaly united in one kingdom, under one king or Civil Governor, whether Chriſtian or Infidel. 6. Nor of many Churches headed by humane appointment with one Metropolitane, Primate or Patriack, being a Paſtor thus exalted by men above the reſt. 7. Nor yet of many Churches under one Arch-Biſhop or general Apoſtolical Viſitor or Paſtor, claiming this general overſight by Divine right (whether right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or wrongfully I now take no notice) 8. But the Church which I treat of is, only the political ſociety of Chriſtians of the firſt ranck (and ſo of a Biſhop of the loweſt ranck, or a meer Biſhop that is no Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop). Not of an Oratory, or Chappel of eaſe, where part of a true Church often meet; but of a true entire Church of the firſt magnitude or rank.</p>
               <p>And I take it for granted 1. That ſuch Churches there ſhould be, 2.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61252:74"/>
and that every true Church ſhould have its Biſhop, as Doctor <hi>Hummond</hi> and many others grant, taking the Church in this political notion; or if that be not granted I will proove it further anon.</p>
               <p>And that theſe loweſt true political or Organized Churches, muſt be Neighbours united for Perſonal Communion, as aforeſaid, I prove.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt from all the Scripture inſtances: The Churches at <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Corinth &amp;c.</hi> were all ſuch as is fuller to be opened in the 2d. Part.</p>

               <p>2. To have the ſame Paſtors that are among them, and over them, and preach to them the word of God, and go before them by the example of an holy life. 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 12, 13. Heb. 13. 7, 17, 24. 1 Tim. 3. 6, 7, &amp;c.</hi> And how can they hear the Paſtors that never Preach to them, or be Guided by thoſe that never ſee them, or follow their example whom they never knew, or come for counſel to them that are out of their reach and knowledg?</p>
               <p>3. To ſend to their Paſtors when they are ſick, to pray with them, and adviſe them: which they cannot do to them that are out of their reach. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 4. To provoke one another to Love and to good works, and to <hi>conſider</hi> one another (<gap reason="foreign">

Related to the end, may be a member, though neglect or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments keep them from the exerciſe of much of that which they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe may do. He that dwelleth in the Neighborhood may do all theſe Offices to another, if he will when opportunity calleth for it; and therefore may be ſo obliged to it: But ſo cannot he that dwelleth out of reach. Citizens or members of Corporations are in a capacity for offices<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belonging to the ſociety, though ſome may neglect them, and others want opportunity to do them; but one out of reach is uncapable of the duty and therefore <hi>uncapable</hi> of the Relation, which is made up of <hi>obligation</hi> to that duty when there is cauſe. The <hi>Relation</hi> is eſſentially a <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to the Duty: And the <hi>Diſpoſitio materi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>materia diſpoſita,</hi> and can neither have <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>obligation</hi> to the dutyes of a Church member towards the reſt, and ſo cannot have the Relative form, or be indeed a member. And therefore all that write judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the definition of a particular Church, do make Propinquity or Cohabitation, to be the <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae ſine qua non;</hi> From which they are called <hi>Pariſhioners.</hi> They are not a Church becauſe a <hi>Pariſh;</hi> but they are therefore the <hi>materia diſpoſita</hi> as to this part of the capacity extrinſick (Chriſtianity being it that maketh them intrinſecally fit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials).</p>
               <p>2. And I deny not but ſome few members may be ſeveral waies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable naturally of the ordinary offices of members: Some by infancy, ſome by diſtraction, ſome by ſickneſs, ſome by the reſtraint of Parents Maſters or Husbands, and ſome by a retired diſpoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome Churches may be ſo ſinfully over-great, as that the number hindereth many of the members from a capacity of the ordinary duty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; which is the caſe of ſome great Pariſhes in <hi>London:</hi> But either this is the caſe of the greater part and main body of the Society, or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of a few. If but of a few, it may prove it a <hi>diſordered</hi> Church, but it cannot prove it <hi>no Church;</hi> no more than a few Hereticks can denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Church <hi>Heretical,</hi> or a few mad, or leprous perſons, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate it mad or leprous, or than the family of <hi>Noah, David, Chriſt,</hi> was denominated from a <hi>Cham,</hi> an <hi>Abſolom,</hi> a <hi>Judas.</hi> But if it be the main body (though in intrinſick qualifications, the Church may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the <hi>better</hi> part ſometimes and not from the greater, yet) in extrinſick qualifications, it is now to be denominated a Church only from the Paſtor and that number who are capable of the relation (as being the two conſtitutive parts) and all the reſt are none of the Church: And if there be no ſuch <hi>body</hi> united to the Paſtor for true Church ends, and capable of them, it is no Church.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But it is enough to make one Church, if they be all united in one Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op or Governour, though their diſtance make them uncapable of knowing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and doing what you have deſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is enough indeed to make a Church of another <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſuch as I before named, either the Catholick Church through out the world, or a Church compoſed of many particular Churches (if it may be called a Church): Becauſe their Communion is not to be Local or <hi>preſent,</hi> nor to the ends of a particular Church; but only intrinſical in Faith and Love, and extrinſical by Delegates or Mediators. But this is not enough to the <hi>being</hi> of a Church of the firſt order which now we ſpeak of, which ſhould have a Biſhop of their own, and is not compoſed of many united Churches. For elſe the Church of a Patriark or a Primate, or an Arch-Biſhop or Metropolitane, ſhould be a Church of the firſt order, and have no Church or Biſhop under it. For ſuch a Church is united in one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. (To ſay nothing of the Papal Church, which yet pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to depoſe all Biſhops.) Therefore the unity of the Governour
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61252:75"/>
will not ſuffice of it ſelf to make one Primary Church; though it may make one Compounded or General Church conteining many Churches and Biſhops. 2. And the nature of the thing telleth us, that as the <hi>People,</hi> have their <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> as well as the Paſtors, ſo the people muſt be united among themſelves, by ſome common Relation, conteining <hi>Power</hi> of and <hi>Obligation</hi> to that duty, and capacity of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: Which is paſt all <hi>doubt</hi> among knowing men. Therefore an uncapable body cannot be made one Primary Church, by the unity of a Prelate. 3. But as we diſtinguiſh of a <hi>Church ſingle</hi> and <hi>compounded of many, particular and General, Primary and Secondary,</hi> (all which termes I uſe to be clearly underſtood), ſo do we alſo of Biſhops or Paſtors: which are <hi>particular</hi> Biſhops of one Church, or <hi>General</hi> Biſhops of many Churches. Of the firſt ſort we confeſs all that is ſaid poſitively, that is, that <hi>one ſuch Biſhop</hi> maketh one <hi>Church.</hi> Becauſe the very nature of his office, as ſhall be after ſhewed, doth ſuppoſe a capable ſociety. It being his office in preſence perſonally to conduct them; which a General diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Biſhop cannot do, ſo that indeed, <hi>one Preſent Paſtor</hi> (or more) of a <hi>flock by Chriſtianity and Uicinity capable,</hi> and by <hi>conſent united with him and one another for preſential Communion in publick worſhip and holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are the conſtitutive parts by which a Primary Church is eſſentiated and muſt be defined.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But even the Presbyterians ſay that many worſhiping congregations may make up one Governed Church, though each congregation have ordinary Communion in the Sacrament, &amp;c. among themſelves diſtinct from the reſt; becauſe they may be all united in the Government of one Presbytery. And our ordinary Pariſhes have Chappels in them, and yet are one Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We muſt be excuſed from ſubmitting now to the opinions of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or any other party, while we are giving an account of our own judgment in the caſe.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not all of a mind in that point, whether each of thoſe Pariſhes be not a true political Church, and have not its own plenary Paſtor or Biſhop, and ſuch a Government as belongeth to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, though (as they all think) ſubordinate to a <hi>Presbytery</hi> of many Churches conjunct (or as ſome call it) of one Church denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſo from the higher Government.</p>
               <p>3. And as to our Chappels ordinarily they are but places for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of ſuch as by age or foul weather or weakneſs cannot travaile to the Pariſh Churches, and they are for diſtance and number in thoſe Pariſhes that have them, no more or other, than may conſiſt not only with the perſonal acquaintance of the members of the Pariſh Church, but alſo with the frequent Communion of them all, <hi>by turnes</hi> in the ſame Pariſh Church, if they pleaſe to travaile to it, as they may. So that theſe <hi>Chappels of caſe,</hi> as they are commonly called, are not inconſiſtent with all the fore-deſcribed ends and dutyes of Church-members: And even the Independants do confeſs that age, diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:61252:76"/>
may allow one of their Churches to meet at once in ſeveral houſes or places, where ſeveral Paſtors may <hi>pro tempore</hi> officiate: and yet, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth with all the forementioned ends of the relation.</p>
               <p>4. And indeed diſorders and confuſions in Churches, muſt not be our meaſure, to judge of their Nature and conſtitution by, though one in a Swoone may be hardly diſcerned from a dead man, yet life is nevertheleſs eſſential to a man. The Principalities in <hi>Germany</hi> may be ſo curtaled, and intangled, that it ſhall be hard for Lawyers to judge whether the Princes be proper Soverains and Monarchs or not. And yet what doth conſtitute Monarchy and Soveraignity is known. A Ship may be made ſo little, and a Barge ſo big, as that it may be hard to diſtinguiſh them by name: and yet a Ship and Barge are divers. If in one great houſe, there be ſeveral men with their Wives Children and Servants, in ſeveral rooms or parts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne have ſome ſuperiority over the reſt, they being free journy-men or labourers under him, the degree of the Power of the chief Maſter here may be in ſeveral caſes ſo various, as that it ſhall be hard for any man to ſay, whether this be <hi>one Family</hi> only or <hi>many.</hi> But muſt we therefore remove all diſtinction of Families, or forſake the old and uſual definition. The ſame I ſay of <hi>Primary perticular Churches. Stepney</hi> Pariſh, or <hi>Giles Criplegate,</hi> or <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields may be ſo great, as to make a doubt of it, whether they are ſingle Churches; and ſo may ſome <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Pariſhes, that have very diſtant and large Chapelries. But ſhall the diſeaſe or extraordinary caſe, or dicffiulty of ſuch a Pariſh, make us change the old and true definition of a Church?</p>
               <p>And thus ſome Presbyterians have argued from the Multitude of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that they could not be one particular Church, ſo as to meet all in one place (which is the common and ſtrongeſt objection againſt us). But 1. undoubtedly there were many ſtrangers there, that were ready to paſs away to other places. 2. And the Spirit knew that the Church was quickly by perſecution to be ſcattered. 3. And on a ſuddain there was not time to ſettle them in exact order, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they did in all the Churches. <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 23. But many Apoſtles being there they might tranſiently have divers meetings at once, 4. And the number and diſtance of them all was no greater then might conſiſt with the forementioned Church Ends and <hi>definition.</hi> They that meet one day with one Apoſtle, might meet the next day with another, and might have <hi>Perſonal Communion</hi> and <hi>Converſation.</hi> And 5. The text ſaith that they did meet all in one place: and as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> aforecited ſaith, they deny the plain text that do deny it: they were not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into divers aſſembles; and the [<hi>All</hi>] <hi>that meet together,</hi> muſt mean the <hi>greater part</hi> of the Church members at once. And I my ſelf have Preached to a Congregation, ſuppoſed by underſtanding perſons in it, to be ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and all to have heard: and as many more might have heard the next day: and ſo twenty thouſand might make a Church, when vicinity maketh them otherwiſe capable; and in <hi>Judaea</hi> we find that men ſpeaking
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61252:76"/>
to Armies, yea the Enemies Armies, ſhew that far more could hear at once, then can do with us (whether voices or aire did make the difference I Know not) and if the fore-named Pariſhes that have but one ordinary meeting place, have 30000 or 40000 or 50000 ſouls in them, we may conjecture at the caſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hereby; For though among thoſe new Converts, there were not ſo many neglecters of the Aſſemblies, yet the paſſing ſtrangers might be many.</p>
               <p>To make the caſe plain, I would but deſire the diſſenters to conſider. 4. Whether that Gods publick worſhip be not a duty? Even the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſtians in Doctrine, Prayer and Sacrament?</p>
               <p>2. Whether there muſt not be ſome preſent Paſtors to officiate before the Church in all theſe?</p>
               <p>3. Whether this Congregation muſt not be Chriſtians, and perſons qualified for Communion? and whether the Churches have not alwaies (by the holy Spirits appointment) differenced between <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and Infidels, and between Heretical or flagitious perſons, and the orderly and obedient? and admitted the firſt ſort only to Communion?</p>
               <p>4. Whether he that is preſent and delivereth the Sacrament, ſhould not know what he doth, and to whom he giveth it, and ſhould not in the adminiſtring make a difference, and keep away the Infidels, Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and openly flagitious, and ſhould not know the people whom he overſeeth?</p>
               <p>5. And whether he can do all or any of this, to a tranſient multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that as the waters of a river are paſſing away, when he <hi>ſtill</hi> ſeeth ſtrange faces only, and thoſe are his Auditors, and Commuicants, whom he never ſaw before, or knoweth: how can he know whether they are Baptized Chriſtians, or unbaptized, Jews or other Infidels?</p>
               <p>6. Therefore is not an ordinary Cohabitation, or vicinity, of neceſſity to a fixed Church and Paſtor, that he may know them, and they may know each other? Theſe things I ſuppoſe are paſt diſpute.</p>
               <p>7. And then I ask whether ſuch a ſociety as this be not a true Church? and ſuch as is deſcribed in ſcripture? and ſuch as ſhould ordinarily be continued in the world? whether it be part of a more compounded general Church, and under the general overſight of Apoſtolical Biſhops, is none of my queſtion now; but whether this be not an ordinary politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church, of the firſt order?</p>
               <p>8. And if ſo, whether every ſuch Church by <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 23, ſhould not have ſuch Elders as are there mentioned, which Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> maintaineth to be Biſhops? or ſhould not have ſuch <hi>Epiſcopos gregis</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of this flock, as are impowered to do all the foreſaid works of their proper Office? of which next.</p>

But he that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to do it by the vicarious labour of others, beſides that it is a great buſineſs to him to perſwade all mens minds well to performe the work; certainly he himſelf hath not ſo much remiſſion of his labour by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from that office, as he muſt ſuſtaine buſineſs and troubles from them that reſiſt, and ſtrive againſt his judgment and opinion.] And if ſo great a Biſhop as the Patriarks of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> muſt not do ſo ſmall a part of his work <hi>per alios,</hi> alas, what a life do our <hi>Dioceſans</hi> live.!</note>

                  </gap>n this controverſie, than want of <hi>experience:</hi> Judging by a noiſe of words of ſuch matters as they never faithfuly tryed. Had men well tryed a few years what it is to do the Office of a Paſtor, they would eaſily know to whom it belongeth. But when either Univerſity ſtudents, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Paſtors do ſtand by and look on, or read and hear only of the <hi>name,</hi> of Church-Power and Government, and never did more themſelves, than to preach and ſay the ſervice of the Church, or now and then viſit a ſick man, or dine or talk on the by with a neighbour, or at moſt hear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſay their Catechiſm, it is no wonder if they talk at randome, and think that a man may be the only Biſhop of many hundred Churches, and Govern them <hi>per alios,</hi> or at twenty, or fourty, or an hundred miles diſtance, by meer viſiting or meeting the Clergy, and dining with them once in three Years.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here therefore prove that the nature of the <hi>Primary Epiſcopacy</hi> (or <hi>Particular,</hi> if the word <hi>Primary</hi> be cavilled at) is ſuch, as cannot be done in <hi>abſence,</hi> nor <hi>per alios</hi> by ſubſtitutes, in any of its <hi>Proper parts,</hi> but only by a <hi>preſent Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Paſtor</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>And here firſt remember that I ſay [in <hi>any of its proper parts,</hi> as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper works of the ſacred Miniſtry, from thoſe that are <hi>common</hi> to other men, and thoſe that are but Accidents or Circumſtantial. As a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may plow his land, or build his houſe, or ſaddle his horſe, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo I doubt not but he may appoint another to toll the Bell to Church, to cover the holy Table, to receive Collections, to read Proclamations, to keep the Church doors, to repair the building, to bring relief to the Poor, to do that about ſacred things, which is common to Lay men
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61252:77"/>
with Miniſters; even to read the Pſalm, to chuſe it, to ſet the tune, to publiſh Marriages, to name to the people the times of meeting, to read the Scriptures, to be meſſengers to ſummon accuſed offenders, to tell the Church, to ſummon witneſſes, to hear witneſſes and confeſſions; All theſe he may appoint a ſervant or another to do, becauſe they are but accidental to his Office, and no part of his proper work; but that his <hi>proper work</hi> muſt be done by <hi>himſelf,</hi> and that as preſent ordinarily with the people whom he Governeth, the enumerations of the particular will evince.</p>
               <p>1. The work of ſuch a Biſhop is Publick in the ſacred Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>2. Or out of the Aſſemblies by way of applicatioon to particular Perſons and caſes.</p>
               <p>1. In the Aſſemblies, 1. It is the Biſhops office to be the <hi>chief Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the Church; to preach, inſtruct, exhort and comfort them uſually himſelf; And when he doth it not himſelf to appoint another, and judge of his performance. (I ſhall reſerve the proof to the 2d. part, where all this is to be reviewed to a further uſe.) And this is the work of one that is preſent.</p>
               <p>2. He is to be the mouth or Interceſſor of the people, as a Prieſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the Great high Prieſt and Interceſſor: To pray in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to be their mouth in the common confeſſion of ſins: To praiſe God and give thanks with and for them; to whom they are to joyn in conſent with their Amen, (at leaſt.) And this is the work of a <hi>preſent</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>3. He is to Baptize and admit perſons into the viſible Church; Or to try and judg who is fit to be Baptized, and to admit them by ſome other Miniſter of Chriſt; but he can neither Baptize, nor try and judge particularly who is to be baptized (at leaſt of the Adult) unleſs he be preſent and know the perſons, and hear his confeſſion and receive his claime.</p>
               <p>4. He is to Celebrate the Supper of the Lord, to conſecrate the Bread and Wine, to be the Meſſenger of Chriſt in his name to deliver them as his body and blood, and the Seals of his Love, and of Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins unto the people, and ſo to commemorate his death till he come, and as his Steward to give his houſeſhold meat in ſeaſon; but this is all the work of a <hi>Preſent</hi> and not an <hi>abſent Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He is to be the judge of the claime and title of the perſons that come to the Churches Communion; to ſee that Infidels and incapable perſons be not there, which is not well done by one that is not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, even in the Adminiſtration to ſee to whom it is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
               <p>6. He is to be the chief publick reprover, and admoniſher of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons by name, who are ſo to be openly reproved and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the Church, which he cannot well do if he be not in the Church himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61252:78"/>7. He is to be the chief publick Excommunicator of the obſtinately wicked, to declare before all that ſuch a perſon is uncapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church: which is not well done by one that is not there to do it; as ſhall anon be further opened.</p>

               <p>9. And the bleſſing of the people in the name of the Lord, at the diſmiſſion of the Aſſembly hath of old been reſerved to the Biſhop as his part which is to be done by one that is there preſent.</p>
               <p>II. And as for thoſe acts of <hi>Application</hi> to perſons and caſes which are to be done out of the Aſſembly, 1. To be at hand for the people to repair to in their greater doubts for reſolution, and greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for direction (as a Phyſician among the ſick) is not the leaſt part of the true Biſhops work. And this requireth his uſual preſence and ſome acquaintance uſually with the perſons life: No man will expect that all ſuch doubting people travaile to a ſtrange Biſhop many ſcore miles diſtant, or out of their reach.</p>
               <p>2. To hear the confeſſions and caſes of burdened penitent ſouls and to direct them in the true way to peace and comfort, is a ſpecial part of the Biſhops work beſides his reſolution of Doctrinal doubts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth preſence, and acquaintance (uſually) with the perſon.</p>
               <p>3. It is part of the Biſhops work to watch over the peoples converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſee that they live not in mortal ſinsor ſcandalous courſes; and to reprove them that do, and draw them to repentance. And all this is a preſent perſons work.</p>
               <p>4. It is the Biſhops work to ſee that the families of the flock be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the fear of God, and that Parents and Maſters do their duties, and indulge not wickedneſs in their houſes, which is alſo a preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons work.</p>

And it is confeſſed to be the Biſhops work to admoniſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, to reprove and exhort ungodly perſons, to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, to hear the accuſed ſpeak for themſelves, to hear what accuſers and witneſſes ſay againſt them; which requireth preſence, as ſhall be further ſhown anon.</p>

In caſe of <hi>title</hi> to lands or goods a civil Judicature may judge of perſons that are unknown: Becauſe the title dependeth not on the moral qualities of the perſons: And in criminal caſes where the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be judged or reſolved is, whether the perſon ſhall live or die, or ſhall be fined, impriſoned, baniſhed or not, the caſe may be judged of unknown perſons <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> For outward puniſhments muſt go upon outward proved crimes, and the Judges can poſſibly do no more, becauſe about twelve muſt judge a whole Kingdome. And yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there they greatly regard <hi>qua mente,</hi> with what mind and intent the deed was done, and they greatly regard the moral qualifications of a Witneſs as to his credibility, as far as they can find it out. But in Church caſes, it is mens conſciences that are to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt intention of the Paſtor is to bring the ſinner to repentance; yea though he continued in penitent never ſo long before, he is not to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excommunicated till at the preſent alſo he ſhew impenitency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is more neceſſary to be acquainted with the perſon, and many an admonition or exhortation (ordinarily) ſhould go before. And when it cometh to excommunication, the principal part of that Act is to acquaint the Congregation that the impenitent perſon is unfit for Church commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to charge and exhort them to avoid him And to do this it is neceſſary that the Church be taught to abhor the ſin, and to do it in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61252:79"/>
of the ſin, and therefore that they be convinced that the perſon is ſuch a one indeed. For ſeeing God commandeth them to Love all the faithful and to live with them in the exerciſes of that Love in peace, if Godly men be unjuſtly excommunicated, by a Diotrephes, who receiveth them not and excommunicateth ſuch as do receive them, the Church muſt not diſobey God in obeying ſuch a wicked excommunicater. And though its true, that for order ſake, they muſt oft reſt ſatisfied in the Paſtors judgment, when they have no reaſon to queſtion it; Yet it is as true, that it is a thing to be done before the Congregation, that they may not only exerciſe a bare obedience to the Paſtor in it, but alſo an abhorrence of the ſin, which they cannot do that have no ſatisfactory notice of the caſe; And alſo that all ſuſpitions of injuſtice and Church tyranny in their Paſtors may be avoided: And that the offender may be convinced before all, that he may be aſhamed: And ſeeing no man is to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for any ordinary great ſin, without impenitency in it; ſo that the queſtion is not then ſo much whether the man have ſinned, as whether he be Penitent, what man of any experience in theſe matters can believe that a Biſhops, or a Chancellors Court among ſtrangers, and alſo when he is in fear of being impriſoned and utterly undone if he be excommunicated, is ſo fit to try a mans repentance, as the face of the Congregation where he is known, and hath no ſuch motives to conſtrain him to lie, and uſe hypocriſie. Nay in very truth ſuch judicatures may as eaſily know beforehand, that all the impenitent perſons that almoſt ever come before them, (who are not conſcientious perſons that take the ſin for a duty) will ſay they <hi>repent,</hi> and play the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers as that a Child will cry for forgiveneſs to eſcape a whipping.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But is it not ſo much the better? The Church muſt have hypocrites: we cannot change the heart; that belongs to God: If we bring man to profeſs repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it is all thats our part to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hypocrites that cannot be lawfully detected muſt be in the Church: But we muſt not therefore <hi>make</hi> men hypocrites that they may be in it; and conſtrain them to apparent lying, and then make lying to be the Church Title, and the very conſtituting qualification of a viſible Chriſtian; elſe you may ſet men on the rack till they ſay they repent, and then abſolve them and pronounce them the pardoned Sons of God; which will be a ſurer way than an impriſonment. And in this practice this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which I leave all Chriſtians to judge of, is included, [<hi>Every Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Heretick Adulterer, Drunkard,</hi> &amp;c <hi>who had rather ſay that he repenteth, than lie in a Gaol and be undone ought to be a communicating member of the Church and to be declared pardoned by abſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea if there were no Penalty, the face of ſtrangers is no fit trial of repentance. If the ſinner be obſtinate, he will eaſilier ſtand it out before ſtrangers that know him not, than before the Congregation which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his guilt. But uſually he will think, that it is no great ſhame to ſay, I <hi>repent</hi> before a few ſtrangers, who are never like to ſee him
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61252:79"/>
more, and therefore this he will eaſily yield to, that would not yield to confeſſion and repentance before the Church that is acquainted with them: Experience proveth all this to be true: And I regard not their reaſonings which are againſt common experience.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we ſee that many now will rather ſtand it out, and go to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than they will profeſs repentance before a Biſhop, or at a Chancellours Court.</hi>

Not drunkards or fornicators or any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed livers: But men that more fear to ſin againſt God, who can caſt both ſoul and body into Hell, than to lie in priſon: perhaps it is ſuch Miniſters as now are ſilenced for not ſaying, ſubſcribing or ſwearing as they are bid: or it is ſome Church-Wardens who fear that they ſhould be guilty of <hi>Perſecution</hi> or <hi>Perjury</hi> (which in their opinion are neither of them <hi>things indifferent</hi>) if they ſhould take the Oaths with the Articles that ſometimes are offered them. Or perhaps it is ſome one for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, either when a troubled Conſcience maketh them fear leſt they ſhould eat and drink damnation to themſelves, or from a Miniſter, or with a Church, which they think the Scripture command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to avoid: whether ſuch be in the right or in the wrong, no wonder if they refuſe to repent, though they ſuffer, when they fear a greater ſuffering from God.</p>
               <p>Obj <hi>But the Miniſter of the place, though he excommunicates none, may ſeek to bring the ſinner to repentance, and may ſatisfie the Church of the juſtneſs of the excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In the nature of the thing, they go together, and are the work of the ſame perſons: And therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſureth us, that in his time, Diſcipline was exerciſed in the Church-meeting, when they had been worſhipping God. 2. Who is either ſo fit, or ſo obliged to ſatisfie the Church of the Act, as he that doth it, and hath examined all the Cauſe? A pariſh Miniſter cannot bring any unwilling perſon to come over to ſpeak with him, (not that we would have him have a forcing power: but he cannot do his own Miniſterial part, which is to refuſe to be the Paſtor of ſuch a man as refuſeth to ſpeak with him at all, or to take him for his Paſtor, nor to forbear himſelf to give him the Sacrament): ſo that he that neither heard the examination of the Cauſe by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, nor perhaps can have any ſpeech with the perſon, or at leaſt with the Accuſer, or any of the Witneſſes, is very unfit to juſtifie another mans act, and to ſatisfie the Church that it is well done; much leſs to exhort the offender to repent, who to him perhaps (if he vouchſafe to ſpeak to him) will juſtifie his own cauſe, when he cannot call witneſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him. And (to ſpeak to that which is our common caſe) we have few perſons excommunicated (that ever I ſaw or knew of in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years time) ſave only the Conſcientious perſons beforementioned: And when the pariſh Miniſter oft taketh them for the godlieſt perſons in his Pariſh, and the Biſhop or Chancellor excommunicates them as Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61252:80"/>
ſchiſmaticks, how ſhall ſuch a pariſh Miniſter juſtifie that, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the perſon or people of the juſtice of it, which he himſelf la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth as a hainous ſin, which tendeth to the diſſipation of his flock.</p>
               <p>But I come nearer to enquire into this <hi>officiating per alium</hi> by which an <hi>abſent Biſhop</hi> is ſuppoſed to do his office in the ſeveral Pariſhes of his Dioceſe.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>alius</hi> or Official is either a <hi>Layman,</hi> or a <hi>Clergyman.</hi> 2. If a <hi>Clergyman,</hi> he is either one of the <hi>ſame Order with the Biſhop</hi> or <hi>another.</hi> 3. Either it is the meer accidentals of his sacred function, which he committeth to another, or the <hi>proper Acts</hi> of it. 4. Either it is <hi>pro hac vice</hi> in ſome caſe of neceſſity, or it is as by an ordinary ſtated Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
               <p>1. If it be a Layman and the work be but Accidental or Extrinſick to the ſacred function, I grant that he may do it: But for ſuch works we need no Biſhop: For what a Layman may do when he bids him, he may do when the King or his Magiſtrates bids him. This is not the thing in queſtion. But if it be a <hi>proper Paſtoral Act,</hi> this Layman that doth it, either receiveth from <hi>the Biſhop power and obligation to do it, or not.</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> he cannot do it as his Official: If he do, then he is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> himſelf, and is <hi>Ordained,</hi> and ſo no <hi>Layman:</hi> For I provoke any diſſenter living to tell me wherein the ſacred office (or any other) lieth, but in a <hi>Power</hi> (or <hi>Authority</hi>) and an <hi>Obligation to do the proper works</hi> of that office, ſo that undeniably here is a contradiction.</p>
               <p>And if any were of opinion that <hi>pro tempore</hi> in a caſe of neceſſity a Layman might do any Miniſterial ſacred act, as Preach, Baptize, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood, excommunicate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. I anſwer, if that were true, if would but prove that thoſe Acts are not <hi>proper</hi> to the ſacred function in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity as ſingle Acts, but only as ordinarily and ſtatedly done by one ſeparated to them. 2. And therefore this would not at all concern our caſe, which is not about extroardinary Acts in caſes of neceſſity, but about an ordinary ſtated courſe, by Courts, Chancellors, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials.</p>
               <p>2. But if the Agent or Official were not a Lay Chancellor but a <hi>Clergyman,</hi> if he be of the ſame <hi>Order</hi> with the Biſhop, than I grant all, for it granteth me all; even that every Church ſhould have an (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) preſent Biſhop. But if he be ſuppoſed to be but of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Order, then I proceed as before; either the Biſhop giveth him <hi>power</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to do the <hi>proper work</hi> of the Biſhop or not: If not, he is not hereby enabled to do it. If yea, then he hath thereby made him a Biſhop: For to be a Biſhop is nothing elſe than to <hi>have Authority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> to do the proper <hi>work</hi> of a Biſhop. But if it be but an <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi> or a <hi>common</hi> work, which another may do, it is not that in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, nor do we need the Office of a Biſhop for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61252:80"/>Moreover either the Biſhop <hi>pro hic &amp;. nunc</hi> was himſelf obliged to do that <hi>Act</hi> which he committeth to another, or not he but the <hi>other</hi> was by office obliged to do it. If he himſelf was obliged to do it he ſinned in not doing it. If he were not it was not truly his act or part of his office work: nor did he do it by another, but that other did only his own work; for which not the Biſhop, but he ſhall have the reward.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not he that ſendeth his ſervant to pay a debt, himſelf in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe pay it </hi> per alium? <hi>what another doth as his Inſtrument, reputatively he doth himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. I grant it; becauſe it is none of the debtors proper work, nor is he at all obliged to it, to bring the money and deliver it himſelf, but to cauſe it to be delivered: Therefore in <hi>ſending</hi> it, he doth all that he is obliged to do, and when another is his inſtrument, it is ſuppoſed that he is not obliged himſelf to do that which his inſtrument doth but only to <hi>cauſe</hi> the doing of it, by himſelf or an Inſtrument, as he pleaſe: ſo that ſtil this is nothing to the caſe of a work that is proper to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Office.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we therefore grant that it is not proper to the Biſhops Office to Judge, Excommunicate, </hi> or <hi>Abſolve, but only to Rule</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi>  by <hi>giving another power to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If ſo, then nothing but Commiſſioning others, is the proper work of the Epiſcopal order: and then any Presbyter may <hi>in foro interno vel externo</hi> ordinarily exerciſe the whole power of the Keys upon the flocks, he may Excommunicate and abſolve publikly; as an act common to his Office with the Biſhops, if it Pleaſe the Biſhop to give him <hi>Power,</hi> which he may do without making him a Biſhop. And if ſo, I enquire whether God be not the maker of the Presbyters office, and not the Biſhop? and whether God only (deſcribing it) give not all the power by way of Law, Charter or Inſtitution, and the Biſhop give it not only by way of miniſterial ſolemnization and inveſtiture? and if ſo, whether he that is duely called to the Paſtoral office, which God only made and diſcribed, wuſt not (in ſeaſon) do the works of that office? whether men commiſſion him or not? or whether at leaſt he any more need the Biſhops commiſſion for Church Government, Excommunication and Abſolution, than for Preaching and Celebrating the Lords ſupper, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both are now thus confeſſed acts common to the order of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and the Biſhop? I think all this is paſt contradiction</p>
               <p>And I ask then whether that <hi>all giving of power to another</hi> be proper to the Biſhops order? If yea, than a Miniſter cannot give his Clerk power to chuſe the Pſalm, or tune, &amp;c. If not, then may not a Biſhop if he pleaſe alſo give power to the Presbyters to <hi>ordaine,</hi> and to give other men power? For if it be his proper work only to <hi>give power</hi> to others to do all the ſacred acts of office, he may give others power to ordain; and if ſo, then <hi>Ordination will be</hi> like <hi>Preaching,</hi> Sacraments, and Diſcipline, which are none of them proper to the Biſhops order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61252:81"/>And is not Church diſcipline the exerciſe of the power of the keys? If then the power of the keys may be exerciſed by the Presbyters, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Biſhops pleaſe, it ſeems it is common to them, with him, as well as Sacraments, and therefore belongeth not to a Biſhop as a Biſhop, but as a Presbyter.</p>
               <p>And if in my diſpute of ordination <note n="*" place="margin">Diſput. of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 2.</note> I have fully proved that the power of the Miniſtry is given by Chriſt ſo far immediatly, as that it paſſeth not through the hands of Electors or Ordainers to the receiver, but is given by the meer Inſtrumentality of the Law or inſtitution, and that the Electors and Ordainers do no more than determine of the qualified perſon that receives it, and publickly inveſt him, or miniſterially ſolemnize his Poſſeſſion, (as the Burgeſſes chuſe, and the Steward or Recorder inveſteth the Major of a Corparation, whoſe power floweth immediatly from the Charter granted by the King) then all this controverſie is at an end: and I doubt not but that's fully proved.</p>
               <p>And if commanding another to do an office work be all that is proper to the Biſhop, I ask <hi>whether any thing there</hi> be <hi>proper to him?</hi> and ſo whether we muſt have ſuch an office? For may not the King command the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to do all the work which belongeth to his function? may he not appoint Magiſtrates, and make Law to command it? may he not puniſh thoſe that do it not? Is he not <hi>cuſtos utriuſ<expan>

                     </expan> tabulae?</hi> and muſt he not corect mal-adminiſtration in miniſters, and drive them to do their duty? No doubt he may.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But he doth not ordaine Miniſters, though he command them to do their duty when ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Our preſent queſtion is not about Ordination, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Govern the Church by Diſcipline or fully to Rule by the Keys the people of a particular Church. If this ſo far belong to the Presbyters office that he may do it by the Biſhops Licence, let him that can, tell me why he may not do it by the <hi>Kings</hi> Licence? and then (as they were wont to ſay of old) <hi>exceptâ ordinatione,</hi> nothing but ordination only is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Biſhops office.</p>
               <p>And that this is not proper neither, 1. This objection it ſelf doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, ſeeing the Biſhop may give another <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>ordaine:</hi> (and then why may not the King?) 2. Many of the Schoolmen, and the Papiſts themſelves confeſs, that the Pope (say ſome), or Prelates (ſay others) may impower an Abbot or Presbyter to ordaine, of which ſee that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable book of <hi>Voetius de deſperata cauſa Papatus</hi> againſt <hi>Janſenius</hi> for Presbyters ordination. 3. And our Church of <hi>England</hi> cauſeth Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to impoſe hands with the Biſhops, and Biſhop <hi>Downam</hi> aforecited is angry with his anſwerer, for ſuppoſing that he pleaded for ſole power of ordination in the Biſhop, when he ſpake but for a chief power.</p>
               <p>And if nothing but a <hi>chief power</hi> in ordaining be proper to a Biſhop; why then are the Churches ſo confounded, and beggered, and altered, by a contrary practice? And why is a new office of Biſhops ſet up in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61252:81"/>
world? whoſe work is to hinder the Miniſters of Chriſt from their offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, under pretence of a power of Licenſing them to it? when God licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to the work, when he calleth them to that office, which eſſenti? ally conſiſteth in a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> to do it, when they have opportunity</p>
               <p>Moreover my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his conſiderations as hath well manifeſted (if impartiall wiſe men could have bin heard) that the office of a Biſhop is a <hi>function</hi> conſiſting in the exerciſe of <hi>perſonall skill,</hi> or abilities: and therefore muſt be done by him that hath them, and not committed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as the office of a Judg, or Lawyer, of a Phiſitian, of a Tutor, &amp;c. no man chooſeth a Tutor or Phiſitian meerly to ſend another to him for his Tutor or Phiſitian, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> do the work himſelf. It is not like the place of a King, whoſe right dependeth not on his parts or skill, becauſe he may Govern by others that are able.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Grotius</hi> (who one would think by their reſpect <hi>to him,</hi> ſhould have been regarded by them) truly ſaith <hi>de Imperio ſum. poteſt.</hi> Pag. 290 [<hi>Nam illud</hi> [<hi>Quod quis per alium facit, per ſe facere videtur</hi>] <hi>ad eas tantum pertinet actiones quarum cauſa efficiens proxima a jure indefinita eſt</hi>] that is [<hi>For this ſaying. That whoſe a man doth by another, he ſeemeth to do by himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only to thoſe actions, which neereſt efficient cauſe is not defined by the Law</hi>] But ſure when God made the Paſtoral office; he meant that the perſons called to it, ſhould do the work and not only appoint other men to do it.</p>
               <p>And I would know whether the work of a Presbyter (as to conſecrae and celebrate the Sacrament &amp;c) may be done <hi>per alium,</hi> by one that is no Presbyter. If not (as all ſay not) then I ask, whether the Biſhops work or the Presbyters be the more ſacred? If the Presbyters, then his Office is more ſacred: If the Biſhops (or both alike) then that Biſhops work, may no more be done <hi>per alium then</hi> the Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Moreover I know no Biſhops but would willingly be more Reſpected and Honoured than the Presbyters, and if they deſire, it ſhould be only by way of <hi>fear,</hi> they neither think or wiſh like Miniſters of Chriſt, nor like ſober men. But if by way of love, who <hi>knoweth not what advantage</hi> the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Paſtor hath above the abſent, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> to get the peoples love? and <hi>Paul</hi> would have it to be ſo, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>It is thoſe</hi> that <hi>Labour among them and admoniſh them,</hi> whom they <hi>muſt eſteem highly in Love,</hi> not for their titles and dignities, but for <hi>their work ſake.</hi> And who knoweth not that he that Loveth a man for Preaching the word of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, is likelier to come to him, whoſe doctrine daily edifieth him, and comforteth him, than to him whom one of a hundred of his Dioceſe never heard a Sermon or a good word from, in all their lives! If it be for the work ſake that they muſt or will be Loved, is not he liker to be moſt Loved who is ſtill with them, and prayeth and praiſeth God with them, and comforteth, and confirmeth them, and reſolveth their doubts, and quieteth their troubled Conſciences, and viſiteth them in ſickneſs, and taketh care of the poor, and viſiteth them from houſe to houſe, than he that once or never came among them, and is unknnown? And if the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61252:82"/>
people be Rebellious and wicked, it is the <hi>preſent Paſtor</hi> who ſhall be moſt hated and oppoſed (which if it be for Chriſt is a good and comfortable thing, and hath a ſpecial promiſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 10. 11, 12.) And that Paſtor who is moſt beloved of the good people, and moſt hated by the bad, is he that will <hi>do moſt</hi> good for mens ſalvation, and will have moſt comfort in his Soul, and at laſt the greateſt reward from God; and that is <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> the preſent Paſtor.</p>
               <p>And it were worth the noting (if blind men would ſee) that this is our great reaſon of the common calamities of the Churches: that when the beſt of the people love their <hi>preſent</hi> faithfull <hi>Paſtors</hi> and the worſt <hi>hate</hi> them moſt, and <hi>love beſt</hi> the <hi>Abſent Biſhops</hi> that trouble them (as they do the dead Saints for whom they keep holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

but whether we ſhall have order or anarchie, Church Government or none. As if neither the Magiſtrates Government of the Sword were any thing, nor yet the Paſtors Government by the word. But I would fain know of theſe men what more it is that they would have, and what is the Church Government which they ſo much contend for?</p>
               <p>1. Is it an <hi>Univerſal Legiſlation?</hi> It is high and damnable Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt for any mortal men to claime it. Univerſal Legiſlation is the prerogative of the Univerſal King. There is no Univerſal King but Chriſt, who elſe is Governour of all the world or all the Churches in the world? And Chriſt hath in nature and Scripture given the world already an Univerſal Law. If he hath done it well, take not on you to amend it. If you ſay he hath done it ill, either take not on you to be Chriſtians, or elſe call your ſelf the Chriſt, that is Anti-Chriſt, if you will take Chriſts place and take upon you to amend his work. If you dream of an Univerſal Pope or General Council as having this power, you will but make true Anti-Chriſts of them, and fooliſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a humane conſtitution with a Divine, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with <hi>all</hi> the <hi>world.</hi> For you are ignorant in Church Hiſtory if you ſee not plainly that Popes, Patriarks, and Primates ſtand all on the ſame foundation; And that both they and Councils (falſly called, General,) were but Imperial, or confined to one Princes Dominion, called or ruled uſually by the Emperours, who had no power in other Princes Territories: No Councils conteining any conſiderable members, but ſuch as were in that one Empire, or formerly had been of it, and ſo kept the cuſtome which then they had received, except that the <hi>Romans</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one Biſhop on the borders of <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartary,</hi> and one on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in hope that he might have influence further into the Countries, and rarely one or two ſuch might be at a Council called General, ſo that certainly there is no Univerſal Law-giver or Judge but Chriſt. This therefore is not the Church Government of Biſhops which men contend for.</p>
               <p>2. What is it then, is it an Univerſal Expoſition of the Scripture or of Chriſts Laws? why an expoſition truly Univerſal is for Regulation as the Law it ſelf: And none ever had ſuch power (even in civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) but the Law-givers themſelves: Elſe the Expoſitor of the Lawes ſhould be King, and not the maker, ſeeing it is his ſence that the ſubject muſt be ruled by. But if it be a particular <hi>deciſive</hi> expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you meane, ſuch as a Judge in deciding particular controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, I ſhall ſay more to that anon.</p>
               <p>3. If it be any Coactive or Coercive power of Church Government that you meant, by mulcts or Corporal penalties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no Biſhops as ſuch have any thing to do with it; not only <hi>Bilſon,</hi> but the generality of the Prelatiſts diſclaime it, and confeſs that it belongeth only to the King and Magiſtrates and that they receive it from the King, if ever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I am not of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> mind, that all Church Government belongeth to the Magiſtrates. I have lately publiſhed my judgment of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in certain Propoſitions to <hi>Ludov. Molinaeus.</hi> But I grant to him, and all ſober impartial Divines do grant, that all forceing Government by the Sword, belongeth to Magiſtrates (and Parents) only, and not to any Biſhops as ſuch.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore that no Biſhops power extendeth to any other effect, but only to work on the Conſciences of Volunteers, unleſs as the Magiſtrates or Parents may conſtraine them by penalties to ſubmit to it. Suppoſe therefore a while that the Magiſtrates force were withdrawn from your diſcipline, and left it to itſelf, you would then know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by experience wherein its ſtrength conſiſted: That man would then Rule the people moſt, who did moſt effectually convince their reaſon, aud prevaile with Conſcience: and further nothing would be done, Are not our Biſhops well aware of this—Do they not themſelves confeſs how little their Government would ſignifie above the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of preſent Presbyters, unleſs they could give clear convincing Reaſons to the people, which abſent ſtrangers are unlike to do? What do you think your peculiar power would ſignifie in one year above a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, if the Magiſtrate left all at liberty in their Church obedience to their Paſtors, would not the preſent Paſtors carry almoſt all, with the beſt and ſobereſt of the flocks? Eſpecially where Biſhops make it their office to forbid the Paſtors to do theirs, and to keep them from Preaching the word of life? Their holding faſt the ſecular conjunct power, and uſing it ſo much doth ſhew what they truſt to! they ſay themſelves, what would the Keys ſignifie without the Sword? and the Piſhops Government prevail, where none are puniſhed for deſpiſing it if the Biſhop excommunicate a faithfull Preacher, neither he nor his flock will much regardit, but goe on in the ſervice of the Lord. And perhaps ſome will excommunicate the Biſhop and be even with him. O! that the Magiſtrates would a few Years try what the Keys can do in <hi>England</hi> of themſelves, and <hi>valeant quantum valere poſſunt.</hi> Not that I would wiſh him to leave off his own duty, to puniſh ſin; but let it not be mixed with Church Offices, ſo, as that all that ſhall be imputed to the Biſhops Keys, which is effected only by the Magiſtrates Sword. I deny not but the Magiſtrate may moderately drive men to hear Gods word, and to do
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61252:83"/>
the immediate duties of their places? But not to profeſs that they are Chriſtians when they are not, or that they conſent to Church Communion, when they do not: Nor to take thoſe Privileges which belong not to them: <hi>No man hath right to Church Communion,</hi> who <hi>had rather be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated then repent of ſin:</hi> Therefore if Gods word and an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication will not bring him to profeſs Repentance, he ſhould not be either Rackt or Impriſoned, to force him to ſay he doth repent, when it is certain that he doth not indeed repent, who will not profeſs it by eaſier means: Nor hath that man right to abſolutiaon and Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who only prefereth it before a Goale. The effects of the Church Keyes are talked of but are indeed unknown, where ſecular force doth deterr men into lyeing profeſſions of repentance and drive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing perſons in to the Communion of the Church: No unwilling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould have the Seal of pardon put into his hands.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we cannot ſay they are unwilling who conſent, though moved by the penalty of the Law and Sword.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; he is to be called <hi>unwilling,</hi> who hath not the willingneſs which Chriſt maketh neceſſary: He that is not <hi>willing</hi> to have <hi>Church Communion for it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>for Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his ſalvation,</hi> is not willing of it at all indeed, nor in Gods account: For it is <hi>only freedome from a Priſon</hi> that he is willing of, and of Church <hi>Communion</hi> as a <hi>means</hi> to that, and not as a means to the end that God appointed it: As he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to be Baptized only to heal the Kings evil, or to ſave his life, is not to be Baptized nor taken for a Chriſtian, nor is it Baptiſm indeed, but <hi>touching only</hi> which he conſenteth to; ſo is it in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But how know you but them in hath righter ends together with theſe, puniſhment brings many a man to reaſon and true repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> You ſuppoſe your ſelves that <hi>the word and</hi> Keys will not prevail with him of themſelves; and therefore it is that you deſire force; your own Conſciences tell you that it is but to avoid puniſhment that you ſuppoſe him to profeſs repentance: Otherwiſe when your threats have brought him to repentance, try what is the cauſe by remitting the penalty on his body, and after freely leaving him to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But ſome are like Children that will hear reaſon when their ſtubbornneſs is taken down: Therefore it may alſo have better motives for ought you know.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Men that are dealt with in the matters of Salvation, are not to be thus uſed as Fools and Children about common things; but as men that muſt live and die as they chooſe. 2. And God hath left us no ſuch means to bring men into a right Choice in things of this nature. Otherwiſe you might ſet Infidels on the Rack till they conſent to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or ſend them to Priſon, and then ſay, how know you but this, as the Rod doth Children, hath brought them to their witts. But the Church of Chriſt never took this courſe, nor never thus underſtood his will. 3. The caſe is plain to men that will underſtand: When God hath made mens <hi>free conſent</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of their <hi>Salvation</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:61252:84"/>
                  <hi>of a free conſent</hi> to be the Condition of Church Communion (and what wiſe man would have lower that will not make the Church a ſwine ſtie)? It followeth that the Paſtors muſt have the <hi>evidence</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Profeſſion of free</hi> and <hi>voluntary conſent,</hi> or elſe they muſt not receive ſuch perſons: Now ſuch a one <hi>that hath</hi> been long tried by the word, and by the penalty of Excomunication it ſelf, and refuſeth to profeſs Repentance, but only profeſſeth it when no other means will eſcape a Priſon, doth not give the Paſtor an evidence in the Court of Reaſon acceptable, to ſignifie a voluntary Repentance or conſent; and therefore what ever poſſibly may be known to God, he is not to be taken into the Church: For we muſt judge by evidence, and that is by ſuch free profeſſion of Repentance, as Chriſt hath taught us to expect: and therefore we can only Judge that perſon to be one, that had rather ſay he repenteth than be impriſoned, but not as one that indeed repenteth or deſireth Church Communion as ſuch, and for true ends.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if he be in the Church though without Repentance, he may there he brought to Repentance afterward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Poſſibilities are no Rule for us to go by in ſuch caſes, ſo you may ſay if <hi>one be Baptized,</hi> before he profeſs to believe or repent, he may be brought to it after by hearing in the Church: But this is but to make Lawes for the Church inſtead of Chriſts, when we have caſt out his Lawes, and to confound the world and the Church by our fooliſh adverſe reaſon. He that is in the Church notoriouſly againſt or without his will, ſtands there but as a teſtimony of the Biſhops perfidiouſneſs: And he that will not come in by any reaſoning or intreating, without the violence of the Sword, is in all proceſs of humane Judgments to be eſteemed unwilling: The ancient Churches would indeed importune men to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; but they never baptized any (at age) that did not intreat to be baptized, and voluntarily make profeſſion of faith and repentance. And Papiſts and Proteſtants commonly affirm, that none ſhould be conſtrained to be baptized, or to make profeſſion of Chriſtianity. But the Papiſts come after and tell us that vet when <hi>one is baptized,</hi> he may be compelled by force to all his duty, and ſo may be conſtrained to ſtay in the Church, or to return if he forſake it: Their Reaſons are, 1. Becauſe now he is obliged by his own conſent. 2. Becauſe he hath put himſelf under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and therefore muſt be Governed by it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But 1. to conſent to be a Chriſtian Ruled by Chriſt, and to conſent to be conſtrained by force to continue this conſent, are two things. Prove the latter if you can to be included in our Baptiſm? Contrarily as we <hi>freely</hi> and not forcedly conſent, it is ſuppoſed that we are accordingly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it as we began it. 2. And to put our ſelves under the Government of the Church, is not to put our ſelves under the ſword: the Church puniſhment reacheth no further then excomunication: and where a man is fully excomunicated, he is caſt out of the Church again: and when he is out of it, he is not under its Government: Indeed he is under the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61252:84"/>
                  <hi>Magiſtrates Government:</hi> But if that will prove that he may be puniſhed for not repenting and returning to the Church when Excomunicate, it will prove too that he might be puniſhed before Baptiſm, for not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being baptized. For though there be ſome aggravations of his ſin that Apoſtatizeth to it, yet that differeth the caſe but as to the <hi>degree.</hi> It is for the quality of the crime itſelf, that the Magiſtrate is to puniſh (as Murder, Theft, Adultery, Blaſphemy <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Whether it be in the unbaptized, or baptized, or excomunicate: But it <hi>is for Impenitency</hi> only in ſome crime that the Church doth excommunicate. And if the Magiſtrate muſt impriſon or kill men properly for Impeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>encie, it muſt be as it aggravateth the <hi>crime</hi> itſelf, and it may be as well the unbaptized as the baptized, for he is the Governour of both: It is therefore a meer fiction of Papiſts Church Tyrants, that there is ſuch a difference between the unbaptized and the excommunicate, as that the firſt muſt not have Church priviledges till they diſire them, and the later may have them if they be but commpelled to keep them, or return to them by the ſword.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſchiſmaticaly different are they from the Catholick Church for many hundered years after Chriſt, as directly to contradict them. For all the Canons as well as the Hiſtory tell us, that all the antient Churches when they had excommunicated a ſinner, would not receive him till he had penitently begged readmiſſion: Yea they uſed to caſt down themſelves on the earth (as even great <hi>Theodoſtus</hi> did before <hi>Ambroſe</hi> when but ſuſpended), and to beg pardon and readmiſſion with tears: nay for great faults, this was not received till many months or years continued penitence, ſhewed their deſires to be ſincere; and now Prelates muſt have a Blaſphemer, or a common Drunkard, compelled by the ſword to ſay that he repenteth, that he may the next day have the honour and priviledge of a Chriſtian: Communicant, whether he will or not.

Though yet it is too evident, that the pride and paſſion of the Prelates that were orthodox, did quickly and ſterely flame out to the conſtagration of the Churches, when they found that the Chriſtian Emperours were ready to ſerve their paſſions with the ſword </p>
               <p>It is then paſt denial, that all the power of Biſhops or any Paſtors is but the <hi>

                  <hi>that believe them and voluntarily receive that word:</hi> only with this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that they do not this as <hi>private men,</hi> but as <hi>Officers appointed</hi> ſo to mannage this <hi>word.</hi> And therefore he that diſobeyeth the word of God truly delivered and applied by them, committeth a double ſin; one as he diſobeyeth Gods word as ſuch, in the matter in hand, and the other as he diſobeyeth that particular word of God, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him to hear and obey his Paſtors. But if men will ſo ſin, we have nothing but that <hi>word of God,</hi> which they deſpiſe to cure them by.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, 1. In our admonitions and reproofs, of the greateſt ſinners, we can do no more but ſhew them Gods Law, which they have broken, and which threatneth damnation to them, and to perſwade them by Scripture arguments to repent that they may eſcape.</p>
               <p>2. In <hi>excommunication</hi> it ſelf, we have nothing to do but to ſhew them the ſame word, and ſhew them how God hath threatned to puniſh them, and to ſhew them and the Church that word which commandeth us to have no Communion with them but to avoid them, and according to that word to declare them (Impenitency openly Characterizing them) to be perſons unmeet for Chriſtian Communion, and ſuch as (till they repent) are under the wrath of God, and muſt expect his dreadful judgment; and to command the Church in Chriſts name to withdraw from the Impenitent perſon, and to have no Communion with him. And all this is but the application of Gods word to his Conſcience and the Churches. If his ſeared Conſcience deride it all, we can do no more. If he will forcibly intrude into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church againſt their wills, it is like ones breaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my houſe; the Magiſtrate muſt reſtrain him as a violater of the peace as well as of the Churches liberties: If the Magiſtrate will not, the Church moſt remove from him. If they cannot, they muſt pronounce him morally abſent, as a forcible intruder and none of their Communion. If the Church will not obey the Paſtors ſentence, he hath no inſtrument but the ſame word to bring them to it. Now all this being paſt denial, let us come more particularly to enquire in all this, what part there is eſſential to a Biſhops office as ſuch.</p>
               <p>1. Is it the making of Church Lawes or Canons? About what? 1. Either theſe Canons are but the Commanding of that which Gods Law made a duty before, or of ſomewhat newly made a duty by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: 2. Either they are Lawes or Commands to the Laity only, or to the Presbyters, or to the particular Biſhops, or all.</p>
               <p>1. If they do but urge the performing of ſome duty already made ſuch by God, in Scripture or Nature, who ever doubted, but Presbyters may do that even to teach and charge the people from God to obey his Laws.</p>
               <p>And note that God daily maketh new duties by the Law of nature, even providentially altering the Nature of things; And ſo he maketh
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61252:85"/>
this or that to become <hi>Decent</hi> and <hi>Orderly</hi> and ſo a duty. And mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it my duty to ſpeak this or that word, to this or that perſon, or to do this or that particular good work. Even by varying occaſions, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and circumſtances of things.</p>
               <p>2. But if theſe Canons make new duties which God hath not made, 1. If it be to the <hi>Laity,</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> may do the like; for they are Guides alſo of the Laity, unleſs they are forbidden by a ſuperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: If it be only to the Presbyters, that will not reach our preſent caſe, as ſhall be further ſhewed afterward. 3. If it be to the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they cannot be Laws, but meer agreements, becauſe one Biſhop is not the proper Governour of another; nor <hi>many</hi> of <hi>one;</hi> nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Council of the abſent as ſuch.</p>
               <p>And here by the way it is worthy to be noted how much the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanes contradict themſelves, in this claim of Government: They ſay that they are of a diſtinct order and office from meer Presbyters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have power to Govern them. And yet they make, 1. A Council of Biſhops to have as high a governing power over particular Biſhops of the ſame order: 2. And an Arch-Biſhop to be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Biſhops; 3. And a Primate or Patriarch to be the Governour of Arch-Biſhops; and yet not to be of a diſtinct <hi>Order,</hi> or office, but only of a diſtinct <hi>degree</hi> in the accidentals of the ſame order. If Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment prove a diſtinct <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> in one, it will do ſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And why may not the Magiſtrate make all the ſame Canons who ruleth them all?</p>
               <p>But let us conſider what theſe Canons may be. 1. The Biſhops make Canons, how often Synods or Councils ſhall be held, and when and where, and when they ſhall be diſſolved. But, 1. May not the <hi>King</hi> do the ſame? And can that be proper to Biſhops which the King may do? Yea which all Emperours have formerly uſed? 2. And is not this Cannon made to rule <hi>Biſhops themſelves?</hi> who is it but Biſhops (or ſo much as them) that you think ſhould be called unto Councils? And are the Biſhops in Council of another <hi>order</hi> than themſelves out of Council? Need we an office of Biſhops to rule Biſhops of the ſame office?</p>
               <p>2. Canons are made about Temples, Buildings, Tithes, Glebes, Bells, Pulpits, Seats Tables, Cups, Fonts, and other utenſils. And 1. who doubteth but the Magiſtrate may do all this? yea that it belongeth to him to regulate ſuch things as theſe? 2. And who knoweth not that even Biſhops are under theſe Canons alſo, who are of the ſame order? 3. And that Presbyters (even in <hi>England</hi>) are members of theſe Synods, and ſo make Canons to rule the Biſhops? Ergo they are of a ſuperior order to Biſhops by your reaſoning.</p>
               <p>3. Canons are made for the regulating of Miniſters attire, in the Church and out, and for officiating garments, as ſurplices <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of theſe I ſay the ſame as of the former. The King may do the ſame as Biſhops may do, and Biſhops themſelves are bound by them, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61252:86"/>
Presbyters make them, which three things prove that it is not the proper work of Biſhops as a diſtinct order from meer Presbyters.</p>
               <p>4. Canons are made for worſhip <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ures;</hi> in what geſture to pray, to receive the Sacrament, to uſe the Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ſame three an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſerve to this alſo, as to the caſe in hand.</p>
               <p>5. Canons are made for Holidaies, publick Faſts, and Thankſgivings, and Lecture daies. And the ſame three conſiderations fall in here.</p>
               <p>6. Canons are made for the ordering officers, fees, and ſuch like in Biſhops Courts. And here all the ſame three things fall in, 1. The King may do it, 2. It is Biſhops that are ruled, 3. Presbyters alſo make the Canons, therefore it is not <hi>jure divino</hi> the proper work of a diſtinct <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Canons are made for the choice of what <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> ſhall be uſed in all the Churches, and what verſion or meetre of the ſinging Pſalmes. And of this alſo the three former things hold true.</p>
               <p>8. Canons are made to impoſe a Liturgie, in what words Miniſters ſhall ſpeak to God and to the people. And, 1. This alſo the King may do and doth, 2. And it obligeth Biſhops. 3. And Presbyters make it.</p>
               <p>9. Canons are made againſt Schiſmaticks, new Diſcipline and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, non-ſubſcribers, unlicenſed Preachers, for the book of Articles, of ordination, for Catechizing, Preaching, Marrying, Burying, Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch like: In all which each of the ſaid three anſwers hold.</p>
               <p>10. Canons are made to keep Parents from open covenanting to God for their Children in Baptiſm, that they ſhall not be urged to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that God-fathers do that office and not they; As alſo that none be baptized without the tranſient <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Croſs,</hi> and ſuch like: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be well or ill done, the three former anſwers all hold in this.</p>
               <p>11. All the Canons that are for the reſtraint of ſin, as neglect of Church worſhip, prophaning of it, and other abuſes, have the ſame cenſure.</p>
               <p>12. The circumſtantiating Canons, how oft Biſhops ſhall confirm, and whom they ſhall ordaine, and how oft, and how oft the Common prayer be read, the Surplice worne, the Sacraments adminiſtred, in what place, what Regiſters to be kept, what order to be obſerved in reading the Scriptures and the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> with abundance the like, have all the foreſaid anſwers to prove that they are no proper work of a diſtinct order.</p>
               <p>There remaineth therefore but the determination of preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are part of the Miniſters proper work, or the Lecturer or Clerkes at leaſt. As, 1. What text to Preach on to day. How to expound it, and apply it: In what method to Preach: What words to uſe: How long to Preach: 2. In what method, words and length to pray (where free Prayer is allowed) 3. What particular Pſalm to

Sing, and in what tune; 4. On what particular daies to adminiſter the Lords Supper, beſides the great daies (Eaſter, Whitſontide) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At what hour to go to Church, and when to end, 5. What particular ſick perſon to viſit, and when: And what ſinner to reprove or admoniſh perſonally. And who is to be taken for a true penitent and abſolved <hi>in foro poenitentiali</hi> or privately (as they diſtinguiſh, all theſe are either the perſonal work of him that officiateth) (as chewing his meat of a man before he ſwallow it and degeſt it; or as chooſing his medicaments is to the Phyſician) and belongeth to his calling, which none ſhould hinder him in (of which I make no queſtion; And if ſo, it is not the proper work of a Biſhop. Or elſe it is fit that this liberty be taken from him, and that other men chooſe for him every day his Text, his Method, his words, his tune, his hour and the reſt. And if ſo, when this alſo ſhall be made a Canon, no doubt but the King and Parliament and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in convocation, will all have a hand in it; and perhaps the Biſhops be under the Canon as well as others. Yet then we have not found out a Biſhops proper work unleſs it were when he is preſent in the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to governe the work in all theſe circumſtances, in which I do not contend againſt him.</p>
               <p>II. If then it lie not in Legiſlation or Canon making, let us conſider whether it lie in <hi>judging</hi> or <hi>executing.</hi> And this muſt be chiefly about <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Abſolution,</hi> as it concerneth the Laity. And here, 1. The buſineſs is not to judge of the Law, but of the <hi>Perſon by the</hi> Law. It is not to judge in plaine caſes, whether we muſt avoid an impenitent Fornicator, a Drunkard, a Blaſphemer, an Heretick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if the Biſhops ſay nay, we muſt not believe him or obey him. And for diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult inſtances, of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of ſins deſerving, it is partly the work of an expoſitor of Scripture, to determine of them, and partly of the Canons and Laws of the land, where Magiſtrates and Presbyters are efficient, and Biſhops themſelves obliged as well as Presbyters.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs therefore is to judge whether <hi>this</hi> perſon be guilty of such<note place="margin">That unjuſt excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations bind not, ſee the judgment of the moſt approved caſuiſts in Bapt.

Whether he be impenitent therein. And that this is the work of a <hi>Parochus,</hi> that is, a Cohabiting Paſtor, who is upon the place, and knoweth the parties, and not of a ſtrange Biſhop over a a thouſand or many hundred Churches, I have partly ſhewed before, and partly ſhall ſhew now, and partly hereafter. At the preſent let the unexperienced conſider of this which any Novice that is upon the place may know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61252:87"/>1. A Biſhop (eſpecially armed with penal terrour) or a Chancellour's Court, is not like to know of one ſcandalous Impenitent perſon of a hundred, which the preſent Paſtor is like to know of. For experience telleth us that few honeſt men will accuſe their neighbours, where they ſhall but get hatred, and foreſee no more probality of procuring the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons repentance by it: And that Church-Wardens do not and will not do it. Many men that fear perjury, refuſe the oath, leſt they ſhould break it, or ſin in keeping it, as it bindeth them to proſecute many men for Conſcientious Nonconformity: And thoſe that take the Cath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fear an oath, will make no Conſcience at all of breaking it. So that a matter of notorious fact is paſt diſpute. The land know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that not one Swearer, Curſer, Fornicator, Adulterer, Railer, Thief, Derider of Scripture and Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a multitude, is ever accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Biſhops Court. Whereas the Preſent Paſtor can ſcarce chooſe but know the greateſt part of theſe in his Pariſh, by dwelling among them, where he ſhall have frequent notice of it. Say as long as you will that this is long of the Miniſter, or Long of the Church-Wardens, or of the Apparitor, we know that the thing is ſo.</p>
               <p>2. And in Church judgments where a mans repentance is the cauſe in queſtion, he hath the advantage an hundred fold that is preſent. For the tenor of his life before, and after, will be of great ſignification in judging of this: A man that never fell into ſuch a ſin before, and that quickly lamenteth it by free confeſſion (known to the Paſtor) may eaſily be believed to be penitent. But a man that hath many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a wicked life, and that after all admonition and perſwaſions to repent, confeſſing one day and ſinning the next, and perhaps derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſtor, and making a jeſt of his own confeſſions, is not ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be believed. And yet the ſtrange <hi>Dioceſans</hi> or Chancellour ſhall not know the difference, nor hear any more at the beſt, than [I repent] And whereas they ſay, if he ſin again he is to be accuſed again] 1. They know <hi>de facio,</hi> that this is ſeldome done, except againſt ſome Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nonconformiſts. 2. And when neighbours ſee that the man whom they enraged againſt them by an accuſation, cometh home again, by ſaying <hi>I Repent,</hi> and paying his fees, and doth but watch to execute his malice againſt the accuſers, they will meddle in ſuch improfitable work no more.</p>
               <p>3. And whereas the Chancelor or Dioceſane muſt go upon the witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es report. 1. The credit of the witneſſes will be unknown to them; becauſe it lyeth upon the honeſty of the perſons, whom they know not but by other perſons; nor thoſe other but by others; and they are forced to take all our ſlight reports, uſualy from ſome flatterers of themſelves, almoſt the worſt men in the Pariſh, accounted by them the beſt and moſt credible, becauſe they know not them aright, nor the reſt at all. 2. And how unſatisfactory a thing it is to a mans Conſcience, to Judge at random, or upon the uncertain credit of they ſcarce know who, in a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61252:87"/>
of Excommunication or Abſolution; whereas the preſent Paſtor may goe on far more cleare and ſatisfactory grounds.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover the Conviction of a ſinner before Excommunication or Abſolution, requireth a great deal of time, and a great many words, and thoſe choſen with the greateſt skill, and ſet home with the greateſt Life, and Light, and Love, that can be manifeſted by the ſpeaker; Many a time I have tried it, and could never ſatisfie my Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more frequent, long and earneſt exhortation, and prayer with it, than ever I knew Chancelor or Biſhop uſe to fourty delinquents ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The preſent Paſtor hath opportunity to do this: But the Chancelor or Dioceſane hath not. I never heard of any ſuch means uſed in their Courts that was of ſuch a nature as true Paſtoral exhortations are, to melt a ſinners heart into repentance. But of this before.</p>
               <p>2. Another caſe of perticular <hi>judgment</hi> is, what ſinner in his ſicknneſs before death, is fit for Abſolution. Here they cannot make the Biſhop Judge, who is many a mile off; nor can they tell how to deny it to be without the office of the Pariſh Paſtor, and therefore they allow him to be the Abſolver; and yet, leſt he be the Judge, they bind him to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all that require it, and do but ſay they repent: which muſt needs be a pernicious deceiving courſe to impenitent ſouls, when it is known that nothing is more ordinary with many in ſickneſs and in health, than to ſay I repent of ſome one groſs diſgraceful ſin, and live in others worſe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſion of repentance, and die ſo at laſt. And muſt I abſolve him from that ſin which he repenteth of without the reſt? or from all becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth <hi>of one?</hi> yea, commonly men have a Confeſſion which is like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their ſin, and a Repentance which declareth it ſelf to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence it ſelf: ſome ſtoutly ſome ſtupidly ſaying [I comfeſs I am a ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and a drunkard, a whoremonger, but you Preciſians are as bad and worſe, for you are but hypocrites: I repent of my ſins daily, and aske God mercy, though I commit them daily, and I doubt not of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for all are ſinners] and if one of theſe ſay alſo on his ſick bed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, without any ſigns of ſerious contrition or change of heart, we muſt Abſolve him: But yet though we are not free in this, it is no Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſanes proper work, and therefore requireth not their office.</p>
               <p>3. Another Judgment of individuals neceſſary is <hi>who is to be baptized, at leaſt of perſons at age; in Infidell Countries, or ſuch as ours, where many thouſand Anapabtiſts</hi> Children are <hi>unbaptized till they come to age?</hi> The queſtion is not what ſhall be the Law and Rule (whether Scripture or Canon) but who ſhall judge whether the perſon be capable according to the rule. Doubtleſs every one hath not faith: The profeſſion that entitleth to baptiſme muſt be, 1. Of the whole eſſence of our part of the Covenant, faith, conſent and future obedience. 2. With tolerable <hi>underſtanding</hi> of what they ſay. 3. With ſeeming ſeriouſneſs. 4. With ſeeming Voluntarineſs and fixed reſolution. Now how can a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> judge of this, that is not within many miles of the place, nor never ſaw
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61252:88"/>
the perſon in his life? It hath ever been confeſſed to be part of the Baptizers work, though under the Government of Magiſtrates, and in the Church the preſent Biſhop is not denyed a negative vote or a guiding judgment in the affair.</p>
               <p>4. The very fame throughout is to be ſaid of judging what individual perſons in a Pariſh are grown up to a capacity of the Lords Supper; (whither it be done in confirmation or at any other time) certainly they muſt renew their baptiſmal Covenant, and moreover underſtand the ſenſe of the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſhall the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> that never ſeeth one of an hundred of his Dioceſe judge of every one of theſe? I will ſtay no longer on ſuch inſtances; I think we need no more.</p>
               <p>III. If the caſes of Teſtaments, Adminiſtrations, Licenſes to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, judgement of caſes of divorce, diſpenſations and ſuch like be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as the proper works of Biſhops, I think I need not ſtay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, while it is known that ſo much as is not every Paſtors work in it, belongeth to the Magiſirate, and is done among us by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and that uſually by Laymen.</p>
               <p>IV. We have therefore the Government of the Miniſters themſelves to ſpeak of next, which conſiſteth, 1. In ordination, 2. Inſtituting and inducting, 3. Licenſing, 4. Suſpending, ejecting, ſilencing and degrading.</p>
               <p>1. And <hi>ordination</hi> being that great and notable work, which ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was taken to be all that was <hi>proper</hi> to the Biſhop, by many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as <hi>Hierome,</hi> this above all muſt be well conſidered. And 1. Let us conſider of the Reaſons for it; and 2. Of the different caſes.</p>
               <p>1. The reaſons given for appropriating ordination to <hi>Dioceſans,</hi> or Biſhops are theſe, 1. Becauſe no man can give that which he hath not: 2. Becauſe it is an act of ſuperiority: 3. Becauſe none but Biſhops ever did it in Scripture times, or ſince without the Churches condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt of theſe reaſons Dr. <hi>Hammond Praemon. Diſſert.</hi> is earneſt in urging. To which I ſay, 1. It is granted, that <hi>no man giveth that which be hath not. But Presbyters have the office of Presbyters, therefore</hi> by your ſuppoſition) they may give it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But (ſaith he.) Presbyters had never a power given by the ordainers to ordain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny it, and prove the contrary (whatever the ordainers mean) 1. Thoſe who in their ordination had an Office, Power or Keys of Chriſts making, conteining the power of ordination, delivered to them Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially, had the power of ordination delivered to them Miniſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But all true Paſtors or Presbyters ordained in <hi>England</hi> had an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Power or K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of Chriſts making, conteining the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation delivered to them Miniſterially. <hi>Ergo</hi> they had the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination ſo delivered. Nothing needs proof but the Minor. And, 1.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61252:88"/>
That Chriſt and not the Biſhops made the true Paſtoral Office, or Keyes, is paſt doubt among ſober Chriſtians, 2. And that it was the ordainers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deliver them no new humane office, but that which Chriſt (by his Spirit and Apoſtles at leaſt) made, inſtituted and deſcribed, I will ſtand to the ordainers own profeſſion, 3. And if ſo, I think they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that if they did miſtake, and think that the office conteined not, what it conteined indeed, their miſtake will not diſable the ordained Miniſter; no more than the Errour of a Recorder or Steward, who thinketh when he giveth the Mayor his Oath, that his office hath leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer power than it hath: But Gods making and not mans meaning muſt determine of the power, 4. Therefore all the queſtion is whether God put the power of ordination into the Paſtoral office. Of which now I will ſay but this, that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> confeſſeth that there was no Paſtor ordained in Scripture times that had not the power of ordination: And I ſhall after prove, that no other ſhould be introduced ſince by men.</p>
               <p>2. And farther the Church of <hi>England</hi> appointeth Miniſters to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hands with the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> in ordination: Therefore they take not <hi>ordination,</hi> but only a <hi>Superiority</hi> in <hi>ordination</hi> to be proper to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; As Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> and other of them alſo openly hold and profeſs.</p>
               <p>2. The, 2d. Reaſon, that ordination is an Act of <hi>Superiority.</hi> 1. Is granted; becauſe the perſon to be ordained is yet no Miniſter of Chriſt, and therefore is Inferior to the Presbyters that ordain him, till he have received his office. 2. But that <hi>afterward</hi> the ordainer muſt be of an higher order (as well as greater antiquity in office) than him that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him, I deny: For than Biſhops could not ordain Biſhops; nor Arch-Biſhops ordain Arch-Biſhops: and who ſhall ordain the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcks, or (if you be for him) the Pope? Have they all ſuperiours to do it?</p>
               <p>3. The third Reaſon from Hiſtory I ſhall confute in due place: only here retorting it thus: In Scripture times no fixed <hi>Dioceſan</hi> ever did ordain, therefore none ſuch ſhould now ordain.</p>
               <p>2. But next let us diſtinguiſh, 1. Between ordaining to the Miniſtry in the Univerſal Church without affixing to a particular Charge, and the fixing of a Paſtor in that particular Church. And, 2. Between ordaining a Biſhop or Plenary Paſtor, and a half Paſtor called now a Presbyter.</p>
               <p>1. As Baptiſm as ſuch doth joyn a man to no particular Church, but only to the Univerſal, but yet they that have opportunity ſhould ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily by a faither act of conſent alſo joyn themſelves to the particular Church where they live, but if they live where they have no ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, they muſt do it after as ſoon as ſuch opportunity cometh: Even ſo ordination to the ſacred Miniſtry as ſuch doth fix a man to no particular Church, but make him a Miniſter of Chriſt to the world for mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61252:89"/>
and to the Univerſal Church for Chriſtians edification, as he ſhall have any particular opportunity for exerciſe (which the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſſeth by the words [<hi>when thou ſhalt be thereunto Lawfully called</hi>] meaning a call <hi>ad exercitium,</hi> to the exerciſe of the office receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But yet where there are not many unchurched Infidels to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but all profeſs Chriſtianity, it is not fit ſuch ſhall be ordained <hi>ſine titulo,</hi> as they ſpeak, leſt it occaſion irregularity and poverty in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but be at once affixed to a particular Church, which fixed Miniſters are in Scripture uſually called Biſhops, Presbyters and Paſtors, with relation to their particular <hi>flock or Church,</hi> beſides their primary relation to the <hi>World</hi> and to the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> from which the extraordinary Officers were called Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and the ordinary ones <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt in general. Though I deny not but even the unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be called Biſhops, Elders and Paſtors, as being <hi>virtually</hi> ſuch, and in an Office which wanteth nothing but a particular Call to that fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Now 1. To call a Miniſter already made ſuch to a particular Church, and ſo to make a Biſhop or Paſtor or Presbyter of him, doth not nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily require a <hi>Dioceſan:</hi> For, 1. The people that are at liberty may do it, and ordinarily have done (as <hi>Blondel</hi> hath fully proved) And in our times if a free people only chooſe a man already ordained, and take him for their Paſtor, no man taketh this for a nullity, no not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts themſelves. 2. And a Paſtor Magiſtrate or Prince may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop, as none deny. 3. And a Miniſter may frequently on juſt occaſion be removed from place to place, and needeth not a Biſhop for every change, at leaſt as to the being of his office.</p>
               <p>2. And as to the firſt ordination of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> as ſuch, if there muſt be a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> to do it, this is gathered either from the <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> or from <hi>divine inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to the <hi>nature of the thing,</hi> it ſheweth no ſuch neceſſity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradicteth it; for 1. As to <hi>Efficiency,</hi> if a Biſhop or Arch-Biſhop or Primate or Patriark may be made without the agency of any one of a higher order, then ſo may a Presbyter. For the reaſon is the ſame.</p>
               <p>2. And as to the object; 1. The firſt object of the ſacred <hi>Miniſtry</hi> as ſuch, is the Infidel world, to whom they are to Preach the Goſpel, and offer Chriſt and Salvation, and beſeech them in Chriſts ſtead to be<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19. Act. 26. 18. Mat. 28. 20.</note> reconciled to God, to call them from darkneſs to light, and the power of Satan unto God. And to think that none but Apoſtles ſhould do this, and that all the world muſt be left to the Devil when the Apoſtles were dead, is an unchriſtian thought: To thoſe that muſt do this, Chriſt promiſed his preſence to the end of the world. Now. 1. The Infidel world is no more under the power of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> than of a Presbyter: If it be, it is either. 1. As he is a Prelate. 2. Or as a <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> 1. Not as a Prelate in general. For if the <hi>world</hi> be the object of the Miniſters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it can be no more of the Prelates as ſuch. 2. Not as a <hi>Dioceſan:</hi> For
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61252:89"/>
the Infidel world, [<hi>Egypt, Tartary, Japan, China, Perſia,</hi> &amp;c.] is no part of any Biſhops Dioceſe. 2. And as to the <hi>work</hi> of a Preacher to the Infidels, it is the very fame whether it be done by a Biſhop or a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: There is nothing to do for them but preach and baptize, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe is a work proper to a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that it is not becauſe of the object or the work are prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a Biſhop, but becauſe the <hi>ſending forth</hi> a man for that work is proper to him; I anſwer, that when I have proved paſt contradiction that he fendeth a man to do as high a work as he could there do himſelf, and to the very ſame, it ſheweth that <hi>ex natura rei</hi> there needeth no <hi>higher order</hi> than the Miniſters to ſend him: No more than there needeth a higher progenitor than a man to beget a man.</p>
               <p>2. And as his office is related to the <hi>Church-Univerſal,</hi> all the ſame argumentation will hold good. For the Church-Univerſal is the object of the Miniſters office as well as of the Prelates; and no more than his own Dioceſe is the ſpecial charge of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> as ſuch; and the work to which the Miniſter is ordained in general to the whole Church can no otherwiſe be proved leſs than the Prelates, unleſs by proving a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution (which they will grant.)</p>
               <p>2. And as for a Divine inſtitution as to the ordaining power, I will ſay but this much, (which may take with cordate men) till I come to ſpeak more largely of the point. 1. That Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> (and as far as he knew, all that owned the ſame cauſe with him) doth grant that the Apoſtles (nor any other) in Scripture times did not ſo much as inſtitute the office of a Presbyter as diſtinct from a Biſhop, much leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordain any one to ſuch an office: And that in all their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> about ordination of Biſhops or elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, they have not a ſyllable about any ordination or qualification of ſuch ſubject Presbyters, but only about ordaining Biſhops. Therefore if Biſhops be the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles in ordination, they cannot do more than they did; nor ordain any other Presbyters than Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops.</p>
               <p>2. That if Biſhops were the Inſtitutors of Presbyters, as diſtinct from them by a Power of parcelling out their office to others than Biſhops, yet have power to make more ſorts of ſacred Miniſters, by ſubdiviſion of their power. They may make one office only to Preach, and another only to baptize, and another only to pray, and another only to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Lords Supper, and another to Excommunicate, and why not another to ordaine; and ſo ordination ſhall not be proper to a Biſhop. And ſo a Chancellor that hath the parcel of excommunicating and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveing, is as true a Clergy man, and of as high original as a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
               <p>3. But that which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> betaketh himſelf to at laſt (in his Anſwer to the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters) is as miſerable a ſhift as ever a poor cauſe was reduced to (that had never ſtood if it had not been more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61252:90"/>
to the Sword than to ſuch foundations) he durſt not ſay that the Presbyters office is not of Divine inſtitution: And yet it was not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in Scripture times: But it was inſtituted in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time by him a lone after the writing of his Goſpel (which according to <hi>Jerome</hi> was about a year or two before he dyed) and the Revelation (which according to <hi>Jrenaeus</hi> li. 5.) was about four or five years before he dyed. And ſo all the Biſhops power of ordaining ſubject Presbyters dependeth, 1. On one Apoſtles Inſtitution, 2. Not proved at all by Scripture, 3. But only by Church-Hiſtory, which hath not a ſyllable of ſuch a thing, as that Saint <hi>John</hi> did inſtitute the Presbyters office <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>

               <p>3. But ſuppoſe the Divine inſtitution be proved of Biſhops ordination of ſubject Presbyters, let theſe three things more be noted.</p>
               <p>1. That at leaſt we have brought it to the Ancients meaſure, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta ſola ordinatione,</hi> except only <hi>ordination,</hi> here is no work for to make a Biſhops office of, but what a Presbyter may do.</p>
               <p>2. That in this ordination they themſelves acknowledg that the Presbyters may joyn, even in impoſing hands, which is the note of Superiority (the leſſer being bleſſed by the greater), and ſo Presbyters alſo (by <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s leave) do <hi>generare patres:</hi> And Biſhops have not the <hi>ſole power</hi> of ordination, but the <hi>chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And whether a <hi>chief power</hi> in inveſting men in the Miniſterial office, do make a diſtinct order or office <hi>de nomine,</hi> let them contend that pleaſe <hi>dere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> if this wereall, we were agreed: For my part, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Biſhops had not only a <hi>chief power</hi> as moderators, But even a Negative voice in <hi>ordination,</hi> yea and in Removals and fixing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, than not: For in ſo weighty a buſineſs two Locks and Keyes to keep out bad men, are ſurer than one. And the poor ſilenced Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts have yielded to much more than this.</p>
               <p>But yet there remaineth one part of the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> work to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz,</hi> The judging of Hereſie and Schiſm, and the <hi>ſilencing, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi> and <hi>degrading</hi> of Miniſters that deſerve it. The Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not <hi>proper</hi> to the Prelates office.</p>
               <p>And here no man can wiſh us to ſwallow the terms of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whole, without diſtinguiſhing, as if they ſignifyed: but one thing.</p>
               <p>1. As judging is, 1. Either <hi>private</hi> by diſcerning ones own duty, which belongeth to every private man. 2. Or publick for the deciding of a controverſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſo in ſeveral manners and to ſeveral ends, Private men, Magiſtrates and Paſtors may judge of Hereſie <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And as for <hi>ſuſpending, ſilencing</hi> and <hi>degrading,</hi> either. 1. It ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome <hi>Correction by</hi> the <hi>Sword or force;</hi> and that undoubtedly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to the Magiſtrate, and to no private man, nor Clergy man at all, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>2. A Private man and much more a Congregation, may and muſt refuſe a notorious Intolerable Miniſter, whether <hi>Inſufficient, Heretical</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>Malignant,</hi> they muſt withdraw from him, and not take him for their guide, and Paſtor, nor truſt their Souls upon his care and conduct.

                  </hi> the Law of nature ſaith enough; as it doth warrant a man to refuſe an unskilful or malicious murdering Phyſician. And Scripture requireth every man to take heed of falſe Teachers, and deceivers, and from ſuch to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>3. To <hi>ſilence</hi> a falſe Teacher by Argument, (by word or writeing) belongeth to every man that is called to contend earneſtly for the faith, and to anſwer a fool according to his folly.</p>
               <p>4. To perſwade him by Argument to give over Preaching, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his errours. 1. A private man may do it privately; 2.

For if a Miniſter Preach or ſpeak to another Miniſter as a Miniſter himſelf, and in Chriſts name, then no doubt but he may <hi>command</hi> in Chriſts <hi>name;</hi> which is but by Miniſterial office to publiſh the Commands of Chriſt: No doubt but he may ſay to another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter [I Counſel, yea Command you in the name of Chriſt, by vertue of my office and his word, to forbear Adultery, Theft, Blaſphemy, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or elſe to forbear the Sacred Miniſtry] Yea he may ſay thus (with due reverence) to a Biſhop, ſo that for a ſilencing by Reaſon or force, or by Miniſterial authority and command as from Chriſt, there is no need of the office of a <hi>Dioceſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The queſtion therefore is whether we muſt have a Biſhop to ſilence men by <hi>bare Authority without convincing effectual argument</hi> ſatisfying his Conſcience? or elſe by a diſtinct <hi>Superior Authority,</hi> more powerful than the Miniſters?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61252:91"/>And 1. Seing the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> as ſuch hath not the Sword, it is certain that he ſilenceth no further than he prevaileth with the Conſcience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Miniſter to be ſilent, or of the people not to <hi>hear him,</hi> or of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to ſilence him by force.</p>
               <p>Now to do this, either he muſt prove to them from the word of God, by argument, that each of theſe are thus far obliged by God; or elſe that God hath made him as <hi>Dioceſan</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> and they are bound to do it, becauſe he bids them do it.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, as is ſaid, it belongeth to every Miniſter, even with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-authority to tell both Magiſtrates, Miniſter and people their duty, in the name of Chriſt: Thus [God hath commanded Adulterers, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, &amp;c. To forſake their ſins or forbear the Miniſtery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to publiſh this in his name, even to particular perſons: But thou art an Adulterer, Heretick <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or [God commandeth me to tell the people that it is their duty to avoid a Heretick, and the Magiſtrate that it is his duty to ſilence him by force: Therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this of you in his name].</p>
               <p>2. But if the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> claim a Superiour Nuntiative power, as one more to be <hi>believed</hi> than the Miniſter, this is. 1. But to the doing of the ſame work which a Miniſter may do. 2. And he muſt prove that Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our credibility. 3. But Miniſterial conviction is efficacious according to the evidence that is brought to do the work. If the hearer believe not that the Major is Gods word (that an Heretick e. g. muſt give over Preaching). Or if he deny the Minor [<hi>but thou art an Heretick</hi>] it is not a Biſhops word that will convince him, but a Miniſter that is better at proving it may do more.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>but we will command him to be ſilent. Anſ.</hi> And he will deride you and command you to be ſilent again.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Then we will convince the Magiſtrate of his duty to ſilence him by force. Anſ.</hi> 1. That was not the way for 300 years after Chriſt: And what was <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> for till then? 2. What if the Magiſtrates believe you not, will you convince him <hi>by Scripture</hi> or by your <hi>Authority</hi> over the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? It by Scripture, a wiſer Presbyter can do that better, or as well. If by authority, of that anon.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But at leaſt we will convince the people that it is their duty to forſake that Preacher. Anſ.</hi> Again I ſay, if you will do it by Scripture, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter can do it as well. And thus many Miniſters now do ſilence the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> and Conformiſts, that is, they perſwade the people not to hear them, or own them. But if by <hi>authority,</hi> it muſt come to this at laſt, that you are made by God the Judges, and this muſt be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And remember ſtill you <hi>ſilence no further than you perſwade the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to believe that God hath given you this authority.</hi> And 1. I ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ever likely that you will ſilence any Hereticks, falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Schiſmatick this way by making him take you for one authorized
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61252:91"/>
by God to forbid him to Preach. For it muſt be in one of theſe three caſes or all that you have this power. 1. Either to ſilence him as a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick that is no Heretick, or not proved ſuch. 2. Or to ſilence him as a Heretick that notoriouſly and provedly is a Heretick. 3. Or to ſilence him as a Heretick in a doubtful caſe to others, but judged Hereſie <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by you.</p>
               <p>1. In the firſt caſe neither the injured perſon, nor any that know that you injure him will or muſt obey you. Elſe a malignant Prelate might ſilence all the holieſt and worthieſt Miniſters of Chriſt, and it would be at ſuch mens mercy, whether Chriſt ſhould have Churches, or the people ſhould be Chriſtians or be ſaved. I am one of the 1800 that have been ſilenced by better authority than the Prelates alone, and yet I think I am bound in Conſcience to exerciſe the Miniſtry which I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whatever I ſuffer, to the utmoſt of my opportunity. And if the Sword ſtreightened my opportunity no more than my Conſcience of the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> Prohibition, I ſhould be but very little hindered.</p>
               <p>2. In the 2d. caſe (of notorious Hereſie) all good Chriſtians are bound by God to avoid ſuch a man, though you never ſilenced him, yea though you licenſed him; yea though you commanded them to hear him: And ſo Magiſtrates are bound to do their duty in reſtraining him. Can you deny this? Muſt the peoples Souls be poyſoned and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till the Biſhop pleaſe to take away the poyſon and to ſave them? muſt the Magiſtrate let Hereticks alone till it pleaſe the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> to judge them?</p>
               <p>2. And in this caſe, no ſober Chriſtian will deny, that a Presbyter ought to call upon people and Magiſtrates to do their duty, as well as the <hi>Dioceſans.</hi> Yea, and to command men in Chriſts name, to avoid a notorious or proved heretick.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But a Presbyter cannot examine the case and ſo get proof. Anſ.</hi> He may examine it as far as Reaſon with Miniſterial authority will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>guilty</hi> or the <hi>witneſſes</hi> to be examined. And his care of the Church and the peoples Souls obligeth him ſo to do. And a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late cannot bring men by ſorce to examination or witneſſing.</p>
               <p>3. But let his guilt be never ſo notorious to others, is it like that the perſon himſelf will be <hi>ſilent</hi> through Conſcience of obedience to a Prelate.</p>
               <p>Conſider. 1. that if he will not obey a Miniſter that ſheweth him the word of God, it is unlikely that he will obey a Prelate that ſaith I have authority to ſilence you.</p>
               <p>2. A Heretick doth not know that he is a Heretick, nor any errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon know that it is an errour which he believeth: For it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to err in judgment, and to know it to be any errour. And then 1. He knoweth that his office is <hi>durante vita,</hi> and that he is bound not to ceaſe it without cauſe. 2. He knoweth that you have no power to ſilence Orthodox Preachers as Hereticks, but thoſe that are Hereticks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61252:92"/>
3. He taketh himſelf for Orthodox and you for the Heretick. 4. And all his followers are of his mind. How then will you ſilence a Heretick without the Sword? If you convince him of his <hi>errour</hi> you ſhall not need to ſilence him; for he will leave his errour rather than his Miniſtry: But if you convince him not of his errour, you will hardly convince him, that becauſe of that errour, he muſt be ſilent; (nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his followers that they muſt not hear him).</p>
               <p>3. All the queſtion therefore that remaineth, is <hi>whether in unknown doubtful caſes, you are the Judges of Hereſie, Errour, Schiſin, and of mens unworthineſs to Preach.</hi> And here. 1. I need not tell you that by this way you can never ſilence either the <hi>Arrians,</hi> or any that deny your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Of which ſort you know are moſt that you ſilence in this age and Nation. No, nora Donatiſt, a Novatian, or any one that is for the office of Biſhops, but taketh you for no Biſhop as being unduely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Of which ſort were abundance of Chriſtians towards each others Biſhops in former ages; and ſuch are the Papiſts now towards you. So that neither Papiſt nor Proteſtant that I ever knew ſilenced by you, doth forbear upon Conſcience of this your pretended authority at all. And what a ſilencing power is that which ſcarce any man would be ever ſilenced by? You cannot chooſe but know this to be true.</p>
               <p>2. And really, ſhould Magiſtrates themſelves be ſo ſervile to you as to ſilence all Miniſters by the Sword, whom a Prelate judgeth to be ſilent, while he knoweth not whether it be deſervedly or not; God forbid that Proteſtants, like the Popes, ſheald make Kings to be their Executioners, or hangmen. A meer Executioner indeed is not bound to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know or examine, whether the ſentence was juſt or not (though in moſt caſes to forbear if it be notoriouſly unjuſt) but what a King or Magiſtrate doth, he muſt do as a publick Judge, and therefore muſt hear the cauſe himſelf, and try whether he be really guilty or not, and not only whether a Biſhop judged him ſo. Elſe Magiſtrates will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be involved in the bloody ſin of perſecution, as o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ft as a Prelate will but command them; and ſo muſt be damned and help to damn others, when Prelates pleaſe: Or elſe it is no ſin for a Magiſtrate to ſilence all the holyeſt Miniſters of Chriſt, to the damnation of thouſands of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant untaught Souls, ſo be it the Prelates do but bid him, and he keep himſelf unacquainted with the cauſe. And next they muſt obey the Counſel at <hi>Laterane ſub. Inoc.</hi> 3. And exterminate all ſubjects out of their Dominions (though it be all that are there) and muſt burn Holy-Chriſtians to aſhes, becauſe the Pope or Prelates bid them.</p>
               <p>3. I need not make alſo a particular application of this caſe to the people: When they know nothing but wiſe and ſound and holy in the Doctrine or life of their Paſtors, and God bids them <hi>know ſuch as labour among them and are over them in the Lord, and highly eſteem them in Love for their work ſake;</hi> they will hardly be ſo debauched as to violate this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61252:92"/>
command of God, as oft as a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> will but ſay [<hi>I know ſome Hereſie or Crime by your Teacher which you do not, and therefore he muſt Preach no more, and you muſt no more uſe his miniſtry.</hi>] Were I one of theſe people, I would be bold to ask the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> [Sir what is the <hi>Heresie or Crime</hi> that he is guilty of? If he refuſe to tell me I would ſlight him as a Tyrant: Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Counſels told the people of the Hereſies for which they did deſpoſe their Paſtors. If he told me what it was, I would try it by Gods word: If I were unable, I would ſeek help. If the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> ſilenced my Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ten neighbour Biſhops wiſer than he, did tell me that it was for Truth and Duty, and that the Hereſie was the Biſhops, I would hear my Teacher, and believe the other Biſhops before him, (without taking them to be of a higher order.)</p>
               <p>The objections againſt this, and what is before ſaid ſhall be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the next Chapter. You ſee when it is but opened, how the <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi> power vaniſheth into the air.</p>

               <p>IT ſtuck much in the minds of the Ancient Doctors and Chriſtians that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was neceſſary to avoid Schiſm and diſcord among the Miniſters and the people; and that it was introduced for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

That which I cannot diſprove as to a <hi>Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is a General Miniſtry over many Churches (like the Scors Viſiters at their Reformation) who as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in the durable parts of their office, were by a conjunction of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidence and Divine authority of office, to perſwade Paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ors and people to their ſeveral duties, and to have a chief hand in ordaining and removing Miniſters. 2. That which I will not contradict antiquity in, is a Biſhop in every particular Church, to be as the chief Presbyter, like the chief Juſtice on the bench or one of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> as our Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters now are in reſpect to all their Curates of the Chappels under them. 3. And I would not deny but at all Miniſterial Synods, one man may be Moderator, either <hi>pro tempore,</hi> or for continuance, as there is cauſe.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61252:93"/>
Theſe two laſt are but Prudential circumſtances, as Doctor <hi>Stiling fleet</hi> hath proved. And in all theſe I like the Diſcipline of the <hi>Waldenſes, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>emian</hi> and <hi>Polonian</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>But no Government of the Presbyters, no concord, no keeping out of Hereſie, requireth ſuch as our <hi>Dioceſans;</hi> 1. Who put down all the Biſhops of the particular Churches, under them, 2. And pretending Spiritual Power, Govern by the force of the Magiſtrates Sword: 3. And obtrude themſelves on the people and Paſtors, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and againſt their wills, being by multitudes taken for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church. 4. And viſibly before the world introducing ſo many bad Miniſters, and ſilencing ſo many faithful ones, as in this age they have done.</p>
               <p>Without them we have all theſe means of concord following. 1. We have a clear deſcription of the duty of Miniſters and people in Gods word. 2. We have Miniſters to Preach up all theſe duties by Office. 3. The people are taught by Scripture what Miniſters to chooſe. 4. We find it natural to the people to before Learned and godly Miniſters, though many of them be bad themſelves. And though it be not ſo with them all, yet the ſober part do uſually perſwade the reſt: So that in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and elſe where, thoſe Pariſhes where the people chooſe, had uſually far worthier Paſtors than the reſt, eſpecially than thoſe in the Biſhops preſentation. 5. The people are obliged by God to marke thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that cauſe diviſion and contention and avoid them. 6. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are bound to give notice to the people of falſe teachers and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and to command them to avoid them; And themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Communion with them after the firſt and ſecond admonition. 7. Theſe Miniſters may have correſpondence by Synods, to keep up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by agreement among themſelves. So we have over all a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King and Magiſtracy, who are the rightful Governours of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as well as of all other ſubjects; and may conſtrain the negligent to their duty, and reſtrain the Heretical, Schiſmatical and wicked from their ſin. And may not all this do much to keep up Concord?</p>
               <p>2. What our <hi>Dioceſans</hi> really effect in order to concord or order, they do it by the Magiſtrates power, and not by the Keys; without the Magiſtrate they would be ſo contemned a ſort of men, that inſtead of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing us by their keyes, one of us now ſilenced could do more to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them, were that according to our Judgment; I mean, it were eaſier to perſwade ten people from Hearing one of them (ſpecially of late) than for them to perſwade one from hearing us, in many places. And what the Magiſtrate doth, he can do by others if he pleaſe, as well as now he doth by them.</p>
               <p>3. The Churches that have no Biſhops have incomparably leſſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, Schiſm, Wickedneſs, and more concord then we have here. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is an eminent inſtance, which hath known but little by experience what Schiſm or Hereſies are. And ſo are the

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True Biſhops ſuch as afore deſcribed, did their parts, but when ſuch as our <hi>Dioceſans</hi> ſprang up, the Church was preſently broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces, and by odious contentions and diviſions became a ſandal and ſcorne to unbelievers. To read but the Acts of Counſels and the Hiſtory of the Church, and there find the horrid contentions of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates againſt each others, the parties which they made, their running up and down the world, to Princes and Rulers, and Synods to bear down one another, it will do as much to grieve and amaze the Soul of a Sober Chriſtan, almoſt as an Hiſtory in the world that he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe.</p>
               <p>Obj <hi>But they ſilenced Hereticks and depoſed them, and ſo kept Doctrine ſound and ſafe.

They only judged them to be caſt out of their Communion, and depoſed, which they could no way execute but by avoiding them, and perſwading the people to diſown them and avoid them: For they neither did nor could hinder them from gathering Churches and Preaching to their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And there the rejected ones did reject their Rejecters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate their excommunicaters, and in the eyes of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were the better men, and only Orthodox: So that their ſilencing was but changeing their Congregations. And ſo numerous were the ſects that followed ſuch Teachers, that they ſometimes ſeemed more than the Orthodox: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> found enow in his time to fill a large Volume. And the Donatiſts alone were ſo numerous in <hi>Africa</hi> as to pretend to be the Catholick Church, and by their numbers and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency deterred <hi>Auguſtine</hi> into a change of his opinion, and to call for that help from the Princes Sword, which before he had denyed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Church in any place, ſo many Sects and Hereſies, as ſince the times that Prelacy grew up, and in thoſe Countries, and where it wasmoſt exerciſed.

the zealous people, as drove them away from the Orthodox Churches, to the Sects and Hereticks, as the Engliſh Prelates do at this day; ſo that multitudes of the moſt ſtrict and temperate Chriſtians follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Novations,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and much worſer ſects.</p>
               <p>And when the Prelates grew up to a ſecular terrour, and twiſted with the Civil power, and were backed by the Sword, 1. They made the more ſober and mortified Chriſtians the more diſlike them, as may appear by what <hi>Euſebius, Socrates,</hi> and others write of them, and the Characters that are given of <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Theophilus, Alexander,</hi> and ſuch others: And by <hi>Martins</hi> ſeparation from <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius,</hi> and their Synods, and by the increaſe of the Priſcilianiſts by their pride and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, mentioned by <hi>Sulp.

And it was not by the Keys indeed, but by the Sword which backt them, that they did all that they did, be it good or evil, in ſilencings, and in keeping up their order. 3. And they did but teach the Hereticks to ſtrengthen themſelves by the ſame means: So that the Priſcilianiſts once got countenance from <hi>Gratians</hi> Courtiers againſt the Biſhops; And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted or endangered by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> at laſt was by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> depoſed, and many others by ſuch means: Yea till at laſt the Biſhops found that evil is more commonly befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by corrupted nature than good; and that Goodneſs is uſually low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt where wealth and honours make men higheſt, and that few Princes were the beſt of men, and therefore that if one befriended the truth, many were like to be againſt it, and till the <hi>Arrians</hi> by the help of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and <hi>Vandal</hi> and <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, had almoſt turned all the Church into <hi>Arrians,</hi> and had got the General Councels on their ſides, and had cruelly perſecuted the Orthodox Biſhops, and taught them what it was to truſt to the Sword, for the clenſing, and concord of the Churches. And when the controverſie of Images came up, one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was for them and another againſt them: By which means and by the contending of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Patriarcks and Prelates, who ſhould be the greateſt, the Churches have been torne to pieces, and ſo continue lamentably to this day (as in the Hiſtory was before declared.)</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The true Original of the warrantable <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in particular Churches, was the notorious diſparity of abilities in the Paſtors: And the original of that tyrannical Prelacy into which it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, was the <hi>worldly Spirit</hi> in the Paſtors and people, which with the world came by proſperity into the Church. Quaere, Whether the thing ceaſe not, where the reaſon of it ceaſeth?</head>
               <p>GOd doth not carry on his work upon mens Souls, by names and empty titles; but by ſuch real demonſtrating evidences of his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> as are apt to work on the Reaſon of man. And therefore he that would make his Apoſtles the Foundations or chief Pillars and Inſtruments in and of his Churches, would accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them with proportionable abilities, that in the <hi>Miracu'ous</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of <hi>Power,</hi> and the convincing demonſtrations of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and the amiable holy demonſtrations of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> they might as far excelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as they did in authority.</p>
               <p>And nature it ſelf teaceth us to difference men in our <hi>eſteem</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> as they really differ in worth and lovelineſs. And this Law of Nature is the Primary Law of God. And the holy Scriptures plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecond it, telling us oft of the diverſity of Gods gifts in his Servants, which all make for concord, but not for equality of eſteem; and that there are greater and leſſer in the Kingdom of God, and that Gods gifts in all men muſt be honoured, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 10. 11. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>And God that would have his various gifts variouſly eſteemed, did in all ages himſelf diverſifie his Servants gifts. All were not Apoſtles, nor all Prophets, nor all Evangeliſts: And after their daies all the Miniſters or Elders of the Churches were not men of Learning, nor of ſo full acquaintance with the ſacred Doctrine, nor ſo grave, prudent, ſtaied, holy, charitable, or peaceable as ſome were uſually when mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts did ceaſe, and very few Philoſophers or men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned Chriſtians. Any man may know that had not been told it by Church Hiſtory, that their Elders or Paſtors were ſuch as the better ſort of our unlearned Chriſtians are; who can pray well, and worſhip
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61252:95"/>
God ſincerely, and read the Scripture, and in a plain familiar manner, can teach the Catechiſtical points, and perſwade to duty and reprove vice: But as for Sermons in a methodical accurate way, as now uſed, and defending the truth, and oppoſing Hereſies, and ſtopping the mouths of gainſayers, they muſt needs be far below the Learned. But yet here and there a Philoſopher was converted; and of thoſe that had no ſuch Learning (then called ſecular, and the Learning of the Gentiles) ſome few were far better Learned than others in the ſacred Scriptures, and the cuſtomes and Learning of the <hi>Jews:</hi> And it was long before the Chriſtians had Schools and Academies of their own.</p>
               <p>That this was ſo, appeareth. 1. In the reaſon of the thing. For no effect can exceed the total cauſe. Therefore they that had not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations prophetical, or miraculous guiſts, nor Academies and Schools of ſecular Learning, nor ſo much as Riches and leiſure, but Poverty and perſecution and worldly trouble and labour, were not like to have more Learning than the holy Scriptures taught them.</p>
               <p>2. And this appeareth by the forecited Canons of Counſels, which forbad Paſtors, ever almoſt three hundred years after Chriſt, to read the <hi>Gentiles</hi> books. By which the former cuſtome of the Church may eaſily be perceived. And alſo by abundance of reproaches which are caſt upon ſome Hereticks in the Ancients writings, for being too much skilled in Logick and other of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Learning.</p>
               <p>3. And it appeareth by the parity of <hi>writers</hi> of the ſecond and third Centuries.</p>
               <p>4. And alſo by the paucity of famous Divines that are mentioned in the Hiſtories of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>5. And above all by the plainneſs and ſimplicity of thoſe that are deſcribed and of their writings. I ſpeak not in any contempt of them for this (perhaps we value common learning now too highly) But only to tell you the true Hiſtory of thoſe times. No doubt but many poor men among us, (divers Weavers and ſome Plowmen, of the Church which I was removed from; for inſtance) are able to pray, and teach as well as moſt of thoſe who are by <hi>Euſebius</hi> extolled as the famous Biſhops of the ſecond and third age; and to write as Methodical, pious, weighty tractates, as any that were then written by men that neither converſed with the Apoſtles, nor had been bred up in Philoſophy: That I ſay rot as <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> himſelf, or <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> yea or <hi>Cyprians,</hi> Epiſtles are. Yea, or as many of the ages following; even as holy <hi>Macarius, Epherm, Cyrus, Syniſius,</hi> (a Philoſopher) <hi>Iſidore. Pelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiota,</hi> and many more have written ſince. If this be not believed, how many Lay-men could I name who have written more accurately and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly, and as far as the writings ſhew, as piouſly as any of theſe? And that not only Learned Lay-men, but men that had neither many Languages nor Philoſophy. And if the books then written were very <hi>few,</hi> and of thoſe very few that were written by any but Biſhops or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61252:96"/>
and thoſe few ſo plaine as we ſee they are, (the beſt of them far below the writings of abundance of late Latin and Engliſh and French writers, that were but Presbyters), you may eaſily judge of what parts the reſt of the Presbyters of thoſe times were, that never wrote.</p>
               <p>And from hence you may gather the reaſons, 1. Why ſo few Volumes are left us written in the two firſt ages. 2. And why the Churches had then ſo many Presbyters. (Whatever Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſay to the contrary without any proof.) It was eaſy to find ſuch Chriſtians as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decribed, who might competently guide the reſt by Doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline and example: Though to find Learned men was hard. 3. And you may ſee why ſo many Hereticks boaſted ſo much of their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knowledge, and Platonical &amp;c. ſpeculations, as accounting the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox to be ignorant men. 4. And you may ſee why ſo few were Champions for the truth. 5. And why there were ſo many parties and diviſions, when the Elders were many and leſs judicious. 6. And you may ſee how the opinion of Eccleſiaſtick meer Ruling Elders came up; and how to expound <hi>Pauls,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Eſpecially them that labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> For it was but here and there a Learned or ſpecial gifted Chriſtian, that was able ſolemnly and ornately to Preach, decide hard caſes and controverſies, confute Hereticks, and guide the Churches in difficult caſes. And the reſt did ſit about the Biſhop as his aſſiſtants, and Preach and officiate at his direction, and overſee the people from man to man; being of the ſame order and office with the Biſhop, but not of the ſame parts, and therefore not equal in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>7. And therefore laſtly hence you may ſee, the reaſons of the firſt fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particular Church <hi>Epiſcopacy:</hi> Thoſe few that were Philoſophers or eminently qualified (being ſcarce enow to make one for every Church) did by their gifts overtop the reſt in the due eſteem of all the people: who were bound to eſteem him wiſeſt that was wiſeſt, and to yield more to his judgment than to others that knew leſs: And this inequality of gifts uſually laſted as long as life; and therefore ſo did the inequality of eſteem and reverence. And both the people and the inferiour gifted Paſtors, obeyed the Law of God in nature, and readily gave honour to whom honour was due. And when one was dead finding another ſtill to excel the reſt, they accordingly preferred him before the reſt, even as an excellent Phyſician would be by the patients, and by all the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ignorant Phyſicians, that are not carryed away with pride. And this did eaſily (as all things elſe) turne into formality under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of order, and come to ſeem a kind of <hi>Office.</hi> But when difference required it, I know not but that all this was well done, except that they foreſaw not the degenerate tyranny that would afterward hence ariſe.</p>
               <p>This preſent experience openeth to us to the day. What did ſet up <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Illyricus,</hi> but their eminent parts? What

               <p>And indeed it was ſo long before Academies made a ſufficient ſtore of men of ſufficiencie for every Presbyters place, that for four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, there were few bred up to competent Learning, except either under Heathens, or elſe in a Biſhops houſe, or here and there as an Auditor of ſome one rare Teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Which is the true cauſe that one Learned man was made an Overſeer and Guide to the reſt, who were his Curates or Aſſiſtants, gifted like our wiſer ſort of the Laity, but of the ſame Office and order with him; And this Biſhop was the uſual Preacher, and the other did learne of him to Preach, and grew up under him as Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and he that came to greateſt abilities under him, was choſen for a Biſhop to another Church that wanted, but not without his own Biſhops conſent, which made the debate in Councels ſo frequent, whether a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might remove to another Church, or be choſen for a Biſhop of another Church? And an <hi>African</hi> Council giveth it as a Reaſon why that Biſhop that had able Presbyters, ſhould not refuſe to let one go to be a Biſhop elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, becauſe where there were many fit to be Presbyters, there were but few men fit to be made Biſhops, which implieth that they took it not then for a meer place of order, where one man of equal parts was for Unity to rule the reſt, but for a neceſſary difference of exerciſing the ſame Office, becauſe of the different abilities of the Officers: Which was not only to keep an order by diſparity of places, but to educate the Presbyters to greater abilities, and to manage Gods work in each aſſembly more skillful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and guide the Church more prudently, and defend the truth more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than common unlearned Presbyters could do.</p>
               <p>Now let it be for the preſent granted that for ſuch reaſons <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in each Church was juſtly ſetled, and call it an order or a degree as you pleaſe; It will be a difficult queſtion, what ſhall be judged of thoſe that have the ſame place and Title, without the ſame Qualifications and precedencie of parts? Becauſe the Reaſon of his power faileth. If one be choſen Biſhop to keep out Heteſie, and he prove a Heretick, and the Presbyters Orthodox, whatis his power to that end? If one be choſen Biſhop to keep out Schiſin, and he prove a Schiſinatick or Sect-Maſter, and the reſt concordant, what is his power? If one be made Biſhop to teach the people better than the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytres, and to teach the Presbyters themſelves, and to defend truth and Godlineſs, and he prove more ignorant than the Presbyters, and Preach not to the thouſandth or hundredth part of his Dioceſe once in all his life, nor to any at all paſt once in many weeks or months or years, and if he do but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Miniſters that are abler and farr more pious than himſelf, what

               <p>To this already ſaid I add but two more intimations, which I deſire the ſober impartial Reader to conſider. 1. Writing is but a mode of Preaching: And of the two it is worſe to have inept Sermons in Publick Aſſemblies (and ſo Gods worke and worſhip diſhonoured) than to have inept bookes in private. And no doubt, the Paſtors overſight extends to publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Now while the meer worth of bookes without any Authority, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth them to the world, though ſometimes with ſome few, giddy Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets are accepted, yet that is but for a fit; and ordinarily the Book-ſellers ſufficiently reſtrain all that are not of worth, becauſe they cannot ſell them. But if a Biſhop muſt impoſe on all the people what bookes they muſt read, in many Kingdoms it will be for the Pope and Maſſe, in others for Exorciſm and Conſubſtantion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Is not order for the the thing ordered? <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is for the Churches benefit by the Biſhops eminent gifts and parts. But if the Biſhop be of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts, than the Paſtors (and an Envious Malignant hinderer of their work), Quere, Whether the order (being humane) ceaſe not, <hi>ubi ceſſat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti diſpoſitio &amp; relatio ad finem;</hi> when the end and the peſons capacity ceaſe.</p>
               <p>II. But how the world by the countenance of Emperours was invited to come int the Church? How worldly wealth, power and honour did indue them? How Biſhopricks were made baites for the proud and tyrannical and Covetous? How ſuch then ſought them and ſo the worldly Spirit had the rule, and altered <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> I ſhewed in the Hiſtory before.</p>

               <p>THE occaſion of our diſpute, or rather Apology, is known in <hi>England.</hi> 1. Every man that is ordained Deacon or Presbyter (or licenſed a Schoolmaſter) muſt ſubſcribe to the Books of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Liturgy and Ordination, as <hi>Ex animo that there is nothing in them contrary to the Word of God.</hi> And by the late Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity [<hi>that he doth aſſent and conſent to all things conteined in, and preſcribed by the ſaid books</hi> as ſince altered (we think for the worſe.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61252:98"/>2. In the year 1640 the Convocation formed, printed and impoſed a new Oath in theſe words (after others) [<hi>Nor will I ever give my conſent to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church, by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Arch-Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it ſtands now eſtabliſhed, and as by right it ought to ſtand.</hi>]</p>
               <p>3. After this the Parliament in the Wars impoſed a Vow and Covenant on the Miniſters and People contrary to this called the <hi>Et caetrea Oath;</hi> which Vow contained a clauſe to endeavour the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rpation of this Prelacy. In the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly before it paſſed, many Learned Divines declared that they would not take it as againſt Prelacy unexplained, leſt it ſhould ſeem to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Epiſcopacy, which was not their judgment, they being for the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Epiſcopacy. To ſatisfie theſe men (that elſe had proteſted againſt it, and the Aſſembly been divided, the <hi>Scots</hi> and ſome others being againſt all) the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Titles of Deans, Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were put in as a deſcription of the peculiar Engliſh frame of Prelacy which they all agreed againſt. Since His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Reſtoration, there are many Acts made againſt the belief of an obligation by this Vow. One is made for a change in Corporations, requiring a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by all in any place of Truſt, [<hi>that there is no obligation on me or any other perſon from the ſaid Oath, Vow or Covenant</hi> ] <hi>even abſolutely no obligation at all without exception of the clauſes that are for the Proteſtant Religion, for Repentance of our ſins, againſt Popery, Hereſie, Schiſm, Prophaneneſs,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>5. And laſt of all an Act paſt at <hi>Oxford</hi> by which we are to be baniſhed five miles from all Cities and Corporations, and all places where we have preached, and impriſoned ſix months in the Common Jail, if we come nearer any of them, except on the Road, till we have taken an Oath [<hi>that we will not at any time endeavour an alteration of the Government of the Church,</hi>] (which plainly importeth as much objectively as the <hi>Et caetera</hi> Oath of 1640; Though <hi>not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring</hi> be ſomewhat leſs than <hi>not conſenting.</hi>) And ſo black a Character is put upon the Non-conformiſts, with a [<hi>ſome of them</hi>) in the beginning of the ſaid Act, that all Reaſon, Religion and Humanity obligeth us for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Rulers, for the vindication of our ſelves, and for the juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of poſterity, plainly and truly to lay open our Caſe, even thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for which we forbear that Conformity; and by ſo doing, incurr all this, beſides the greater loſs of our Miniſterial Liberty, to labour for the ſaving of the peoples ſouls, and the edifying of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid in the beginning may ſufficiently inform the Reader, 1. That it is not every man's Cauſe that is called a Non-conformiſt, no nor a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or Independant that I here maintain. 2. That I am not writing a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Covenant, 1. As to the Act of Impoſing. 2. Or of taking it. 3. Nor as to the obligation of it to any thing unlawful. Leaving ſuch matters
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61252:98"/>
as alien to my work, 3. And that I am not ſo raſh as to aſſert that it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth any man, <hi>to endeavour</hi> (in his place and calling) <hi>any change of our Church Government,</hi> no not of a Lay-Chancellor's uſe of the Keys, whatever I think, Becauſe it is made a matter of ſo grievous penalty by an Act. All that I have to do is, to enquire whether the Dioceſane Prelacy as now ſtated, be ſo lawful that we may take all theſe Oaths and Subſcriptions to it, and ſo neceſſary that the King and Parliament have no power to change it, or make an alteration if they pleaſe, and we endeavour it by obeying them if they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us.</p>
               <p>And I go upon ſuch Principles as Doctor <hi>Burges,</hi> Maſter <hi>Gataker,</hi> and many others in the Aſſembly, that were ready to proteſt that they were not againſt the Primitive Epiſcopacy, no nor a moderate one that did not in all things reach it.</p>
               <p>I will rather be guilty of Repetition than of leaving the raſh or heedleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretext for their miſtake or calumny.</p>
               <p>My own judgment is as followeth. 1. <hi>That every particular Church,</hi> (<hi>conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of as full a number as can aſſociate for true perſonal Communion in Worſhip and holy living</hi>) ſhould be guided by as many Paſtors or Elders (of the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) as the number of ſouls, and the work requireth.</p>
               <p>2. That it is lawful, (if not uſually laudable and fit) if theſe Presbyters conſent that one among them who is wiſer and fitter than the reſt, be ſtated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Guide, Director, or Moderator, in the matters of Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Diſcipline in that Church, for order and concord, and for the peoples ſakes and their own: And eſpecially that in Ordinations they do nothing without him.</p>
               <p>3. That theſe particular Churches with their Biſhop and Presbytery are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant, ſo far that no other Biſhop or Church hath a Divine Right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, ſaving what is anon to be ſaid of General Paſtors or Viſiiters, and the power of each Miniſter in the Univerſal Church, as he is called.</p>
               <p>4. That as to the Communion of ſeveral Churches among themſelves, theſe particular Churches are not Independent, but muſt hold Concord and Correſpondency by Letters, Meſſengers or Synods as there ſhall be cauſe.</p>
               <p>5. That in theſe Synods it is lawful and orderly oftentimes to make ſome one the Moderator or Guide of their debates. And that either <hi>pro tempore,</hi> or <hi>quamdiu ſit maxime idoneus,</hi> or <hi>durante vita,</hi> as true Prudence ſhall diſcern it to be moſt conducible to the end.</p>
               <p>6. That where the Churches Good and the calling of the Infidel World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, there ſhould be itinerant Miniſters, like the old Evangeliſts, <hi>Silas, Apollo, Timothy, Titus, &amp;c.</hi> to preach the Goſpel, and gather Churches, and help their Paſtors. And if ſuch be not neceſſary in any place, yet the fixed Paſtors ſhould when there is cauſe be itinerant, and help to convert the Infidels and Hereticks, and do both the general and particular work.</p>
               <p>7. That the judgment of Antiquity moving me much, but more the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the neceſſity, [that the ſame form of Government be continued in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61252:99"/>
its ordinary parts, which Chriſt at firſt ſetled in the Apoſtles, and is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved repealed] do move me to incline to think that the Apoſtles muſt have ſuch Succeſſors, as general Planters and Overſeers of many Churches. And who ſhould (before all particular Biſhops) have a chief hand in the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of particular Biſhops and Paſtors, and removing them as the Churches good requireth (As the Seniors have in the <hi>Bohemian Waldenſes</hi> Government.) And though I am yet in doubt my ſelf, whether ſuch general Miniſters, or Arch-biſhops be <hi>jure divino,</hi> of Chriſts inſtitution, I do not deny it, or contend againſt it: And though I would not aſſert or ſwear to their right, I would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them.</p>
               <p>8. That all this Church-power is to be exerciſed only by <hi>Gods word,</hi> mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by convincing Reaſon, Love and good Example, and that no Biſhops or Arch-biſhops have any power of Corporal Coaction; Nor ſhould give Church Communion to any but Voluntary Conſenters; nor ſhould mix and corrupt the exerciſe of the Keys, with unſeaſonable interpoſitions of the Sword even in the Magiſtrates own hand.</p>
               <p>9. But yet that the King and Magiſtrates are the Rulers by the Sword over all Paſtors and their Flocks, to ſee that all men do their duties, and to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them by Laws about holy things, ſubſerviently to the Kingdom and Laws of Chriſt, and in conſiſtence with the preſervation of the Office of the Miniſtry and real liberties of the Flocks.</p>
               <p>10. And therefore, though we think Churchmen uſually very unfit for any Magiſtratical Power, yet we ſhall obey as his Miniſters any whomſoever the King ſhall commit any part of his power about Church matters to; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them due obedience as ſuch.</p>
               <p>And ſo you ſee what <hi>is not</hi> the Queſtion now to be debated.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is [<hi>Whether the preſent Church Government in</hi> England (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Kings and Magiſtrates part) <hi>be ſo good or lawful, that we ſhould ſwear or ſubſcribe our approbation of it, our obedience to it, or that we will never (in our place and calling) endeavour an alteration of it (no though the King command us) and that every man in the three Kingdoms that vowed to endeavour ſuch alteration, is ſo clearly and utterly diſobliged, as that all ſtrangers that never knew him may ſubſcribe or declare that he is diſobliged, or not obliged to it by that Vow.</hi>

               <head>ARGUMENT I.</head>
               <p>WE cannot ſubſcribe or ſwear to that form of Church Government as good or lawful, which in its nature excludeth or deſtroyeth <hi>the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecifical nature of the particular Churches which were inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſetled in the primitive times, and is it ſelf a humane from ſet up in their ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuch we take the preſent Dioceſane form to be:</hi> Ergo,</p>
               <p>The Major will be denied by very few that we have now to do with. And thoſe few that will deny it, muſt do it on this ſuppoſition, 1. That the Holy Ghoſt did inſtitute that particular Church Form which is deſtroyed but <hi>pro tempore.</hi> And Secondly, That he allowed men ſince to ſet up one or more of their own in its ſtead. But the diſproof of this ſuppoſition will fall in more fitly, when I have ſhewed what Church Form was firſt ſetled.</p>
               <p>The Minor I thus prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Species of a particular Church which the Holy Ghoſt did inſtitute, was [one Society of Chriſtians united under one or more Biſhops, for perſonal Communion in publick worſhip and holy living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>]</p>
               <p>The Dioceſane Engliſh frame is (deſtructive of or) inconſiſtent with this ſpecies of a particular Church.</p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>The Dioceſane Engliſh frame is inconſiſtent with (or deſtructive of) the Species of the Holy Ghoſts inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Major, 1. By [Biſhops] I mean, Sacred Miniſters authorized by Divine appointment, to be the ſtated Guides of the Church, by Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, under Chriſt the Teacher, Prieſt and Ruler of the Church. Whether he have a ſuperior Arch-Biſhop I determine not; Nor now whether he may ordain Paſtors for other Churches.</p>
               <p>What I mean by [<hi>Perſonal Communion</hi>] and whether it be conſiſtent with divers Aſſemblies, I have fully ſhewed before. I mean, that the ſaid Churches were no more numerous than our Engliſh Pariſhes, nor had more Aſſemblies; Or no more than could have the ſame perſonal Communion, and that there were never any Churches <hi>infimae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61252:100"/>I ſhall therefore now prove, 1. That the Churches of the Holy Ghoſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were no more numerous, or were ſuch ſingle Congregations. And that they had each ſuch Biſhops and Paſtors will be proved partly herewith, and partly afterward.</p>
               <p>2. And that ſuch Churches do <hi>tota ſpecie</hi> differ from the Dioceſane Churches, and from our preſent Pariſh Churches as they define them, and are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with them. And the firſt I ſhall prove, 1. From the Holy Scriptures. 2. From the Confeſſions of the Dioceſanes. 3. From the teſtimony of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. All proving fully that the ancient Epiſcopal Churches were but ſuch ſingle Societies or Congregations as I have deſcribed, and ſuch as our Dioceſſes of many hundred Churches are different from, and inconſiſtent with.</p>

(unleſs that mean the ſeveral meetings of the ſame Aſſembly at ſeveral times) and 16. 1, 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 18, 19, 23, 24. and 11. 8, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 14. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4, 11, 20. and 2. 7, 11, 17, 29. and 3. 6, 13, 22, 23. and 22. 16.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, how prove you that all theſe were but ſingle Congregations, I anſwer, 1. It is granted me by all that theſe plural terms [<hi>Churches</hi>] included many ſingle Congregations. 2. I ſhall prove anon that the moſt of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches named in Scripture were but ſuch Congregations. 3. And no man can give me any proof that a Society conſiſting of divers ſuch Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations is any where called [<hi>a Church</hi>] ſingularly: And therefore we are not to believe that the plural term meaneth many ſuch ſingulars, as are no where ſingularly named.</p>
               <p>2. Particular Churches are deſcribed ſo in Scripture as fully proveth my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid limitation and deſcription. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16, 18, 20, 22. <hi>When ye</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61252:100"/>
                  <hi>come together in the Church I hear that there be diviſions among you.</hi> A Church conſiſted of ſuch as came together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When ye come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> And it is the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> that are called Churches, when he ſaith [<hi>We have no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, nor the Churches of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>He that propheſieth edifieth the Church</hi>] that is, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that heareth him, and not many hundred ſuch Aſſemblies that are out of hearing.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>Except he interpret that the Church may receive edifying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>May not the whole Church be edified</hi> per partes? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, but it muſt be <hi>per plures vel diverſis vicibus.</hi> Not at once by the ſame man, if the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Church be abſent.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But is not the whole man edified (naturally or morally) by the edification of a part? Anſw.</hi> Yes, if it be a noble part: Becauſe the whole man being <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally One,</hi> by the unity of the ſoul or form, there is a natural Communion and Communication from part to part: But one Corporation in a Kingdom, may be edified or enriched without the wealth or edification of the reſt. And this Text plainly ſpeaketh of Immediate Edification of <hi>that Church that heareth,</hi> and this at once, and by one ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>So Verſ. 19. <hi>In the Church I had rather ſpeak one word with my underſtanding, that I may teach others.</hi> Here the <hi>Church</hi> is plainly taken for the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>If therefore the whole Church be come together in one place, and ſpeak with tongues,</hi>] what can be more expreſly ſpoken to ſhew that it is not only a <hi>part</hi> of the Church, but the <hi>whole</hi> which cometh together into one place.</p>
               <p>So Verſ. 24. <hi>If there be no Interpreter let him keep ſilence in the Church.</hi>]</p>
               <p>So Verſ. 34. <hi>For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Verſ. 14. <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Church, for it is a ſhame for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſpeak in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Act. 11. 26. <hi>A whole year they aſſembled themſelves with the Church, and taught much people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Act. 14. 27. <hi>When they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearſed all that God had done by them.</hi>

               <p>Act. 2. 1. <hi>They were all with one accord in one place;</hi> which it's like was all the Church with the Apoſtles.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61252:101"/>If any here ſay that ſo many thouſands could not be of one Aſſembly, I have anſwered it before. 1. I have preached (as was ſuppoſed) to ten thouſand at once. 2. Some of our Pariſhes that have but one Church, are thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, ſome forty thouſand, ſome fifty thouſand. 3. There were ſtrangers at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from all parts. 4. The next Verſe ſaith [<hi>There came alſo a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude out of the Cities round about unto</hi> Jeruſalem.] 5. The multitude were not yet perfectly embodied, and were quickly ſcattered.</p>
               <p>Col. 4. 16. <hi>When this Epiſtle is read among you, cauſe that it be read alſo in the Church of the Laodiceans,</hi> &amp;c. It is not [<hi>to the Church</hi>] for then you might have ſaid that ſo it may be if the Church conſiſted of many Aſſemblies: But it is [<hi>in the Church</hi>] which intimateth that the Church was but one Aſſembly. And ſo that of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> anſwerably.</p>
               <p>All theſe Texts and others ſuch plainly tell us whether a Church there was one Aſſembly or many hundred.</p>
               <p>3. This is made yet much more evident, by the Scriptures deſcription of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops work; even ſuch as the Apoſtles then appointed over every Church. 1. They were to be the ordinary publick preſent teachers of all the Flock which they did overſee. 1 Theſſ. 5. 12, 13. <hi>Know them which labour among you and are over you in the Lord, and eſteem them highly in love for their work ſake.</hi> Thoſe then that were over every Church, were preſent with the Church, and <hi>laboured among them</hi> (which they could not do in one of our Dioceſſes, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as a man may be ſaid to labour among a Kingdom, or the World, becauſe they labour in it.)</p>
               <p>Heb. 13. 8, 17, 24. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you, which have ſpoken to you the word of God. Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account.</hi> So that a Church was no bigger than the Biſhops could <hi>ſpeak the word of God to, and could watch for their ſouls.</hi> But I never ſaw the face of the Biſhop of the Dioceſs where I live, and know but very few men in his Dioceſs that ever did ſee him.</p>
               <p>2. And this care was to extend to the particular perſons of the Flocks. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20, 28, 31. <hi>I taught you publickly, and from houſe to houſe.

               <p>1 Pet. 1. 2. 3. <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort who am alſo an Elder, feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſaith Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> [<hi>The Biſhops of your ſeveral Churches I exhort, take care of your ſeveral Churches, and govern them, not as Secular Rulers by force, but as Paſtors do their Sheep by calling and going before them, that ſo they may follow of their own accord.</hi>] See alſo Doctor <hi>Hammond's Annot.</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13.

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61252:101"/>This made <hi>Ignatius</hi> (às after cited) ſay, that <hi>The Biſhop muſt look after or take account of each perſon as much as Servants and Maids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But there may be more in a Pariſh than a Miniſter can know. Anſw.</hi> If a Pariſh may be too large for a Biſhops work, how little reaſon have they to make a Church, and take the Paſtoral Care of many hundred Pariſhes? 2. We muſt judge by the ordinary common caſe. In a Pariſh a Miniſter may know every one, except it be ſome few ſtrangers or retired perſons, or except it be a Pariſh or Church of too great a ſwelling bigneſs: But in a Dioceſs of many hundred Churches, it is not one of a hundred that the Biſhop will ever know. 3. I know by experience what may be done, whatever ſlothful perſons ſay; I had a Pariſh of about three of four thouſand ſouls; (A Market Town with twenty Villages) and except three or four Families that refuſed to come to me, (whom yet I knew by other means) I knew not only the perſons but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all or almoſt all their underſtandings, in the Town, and my aſſiſtants in the Villages knew the reſt, by perſonal conference, each family coming to us by turns. 4. And where a Church is too large for one, there may be and muſt be aſſiſtant Miniſters, and that may be done by many, which cannot be done by one alone.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>So may a Biſhop and his Presbyters in a Dioceſs. Anſw.</hi> In a Dioceſs of many Churches, the Presbyters only know the people, and do the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office for them, except in ſome one or few Churches where the Biſhop dwells and ſometimes preacheth: But in the ſame Church, all the Miniſters preach to the ſame perſons ordinarily, (<hi>per vices</hi>) and they all know them, and all watch over them, though they aſſiſt each other in particular offices for them. There is much difference between a School-maſter and his aſſiſtants in the ſame School, and one School-maſter only with ſeveral Uſhers in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Schools. As there is between a Maſter, Miſtriſs, and Steward ruling the ſame Family, and one Maſter with Stewards ruling many hundred Families; (of which more anon.)</p>
               <p>3. Another part of the Biſhops work in thoſe times was to Baptize: For it was part of the Apoſtles work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. And how great a work that was, to try the peoples due preparations, and to ſee that they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly and ſeriouſly what they did, I deſire no other proof than the great care taken in all the ancient Churches of this buſineſs, which brought up the Cuſtom of baptizing but twice a year.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Apoſtles baptized three thouſand at once. Anſw.</hi> The Jews were ſuppoſed to be bred up in the knowledge of other parts of Religion, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only the knowledge of the true Meſſiah, and his Salvation, which might be taught them in a ſhorter time than the Gentiles could be taught the whole ſubſtance of Religion, that knew but little: Therefore as ſoon as the Jews were convinced of the true Meſſiah and the righteouſneſs of Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Covenant, they might be baptized. 2. The extraordinary effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Spirit in that time, did make a ſhorter preparation ſufficient. At leaſt Baptizing muſt be an addition to the Biſhops work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61252:102"/>4. As the Apoſtles laid hands on Believers to convey the Holy Ghoſt, ſo the Prelatiſts think that the Biſhops then <hi>Confirmed Believers</hi> with Impoſition of hands, ſaith Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>a. To teach, exhort, confirm and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hands, all which were the Biſhops office in that place.</hi>] And O what a work it is to know the perſons of many hundred Pariſhes to be capable of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo to confirm them (of which more afterward.)</p>
               <p>5. I need not prove that the Biſhops then were the Maſters of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and called them, appointing time and place, as the Rulers of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues did: which ſheweth that they were preſent with the Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>6. The Biſhops adminiſtred the Lords Supper (as all confeſs) and therefore muſt have ſome Paſtoral notice of the fitneſs of all the Church to receive it: which intimateth ſufficiently the extent of the Church.</p>
               <p>7. They went before the Aſſemblies uſually in performance of the publick worſhip: They prayed with them, and praiſed God: And Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks that in all this in Scripture times, they had not ſo much as a Presbyter to aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>8. They admoniſhed the unruly and diſorderly, and received Accuſations, and openly reproved and excommunicated the Impenitent. And O, how great a work is it to deal with one Soul aright as muſt be done, before it cometh to Excommunication! Much more with all in a Pariſh. Much more in many hundred Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>9. It is confeſſed that it was the Biſhops work to abſolve the penitent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. And then he muſt judge of their Repentance: and then he muſt try it: And for how many thouſand can a Biſhop do this, with the reſt?</p>
               <p>10. The Biſhop did diſmiſs the Congregation with a Benediction (as is maintained by thoſe that we diſpute with) and therefore muſt be preſent in it.</p>
               <p>11. They were to viſit and pray with the ſick, <hi>and all the ſick to ſend for them to that end,</hi> Jam. 4. 14. <hi>If any be ſick among you let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him</hi>] ſaith Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> [<hi>Becauſe there is no evidence whereby theſe</hi> (inferior Presbyters) <hi>may appear to have been brought into the Church ſo early, And becauſe the viſiting of the ſick is anciently mentioned as one branch of the office of Biſhops; therefore it may very reaſonably be reſolved, that the Biſhops of the Church, one in each particular Church, but many in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, are here meant.</hi>] Though I am far from believing him that the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is bid to ſend but for one, when the term is plural, or that he muſt ſend for many out of other Churches, I will take his conceſſion that this was the Biſhops work.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, They were to take care of the poor, and of the Contributions and Church ſtock, ſaith Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. 28. <hi>The ſupreme truſt and charge was reſerved to the Apoſtles and Biſhops of the Church. So in the 41ſt. Canon of the Apoſtles, the Biſhop muſt have the care of the moneys, ſo that by his power all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e diſpenſed to the poor by the Presbyters and Deacons; and we command that  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e have in his power the Church Goods.</hi> So <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>That</hi>

                  <hi>which is gathered is doepoſited by the Praefect or Biſhop, and he helpeth or relieveth the Orphans and Widows, and becometh the Curator and Guardian of all abſolutely that be in want.</hi> So <hi>Ignatius</hi> to <hi>Polycarp, After the Lord thou ſhalt be the Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Widows.</hi> And <hi>Polycarp himſelf ſpeaking of the Elders or Biſhops, They viſit and take care of all that are ſick, not neglecting the Widows, the Orphans and the Poor.</hi>] So far Doctor <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by this time it is eaſie to ſee how great the ancient Churches were; yea, and how great they were to be continued; when all this is the Biſhops Office and Work. We are willing that they have Dioceſſes as big as they can do this work in, even with a <hi>Conſeſſus</hi> of aſſiſting Presbyters. There is no one of all theſe twelve alone that a Biſhop. can do for a Dioceſs of many ſcore or hundred Churches. How much leſs all theſe ſet together? Nay, what one conſiderable Pariſh would not find a Biſhop with divers aſſiſtants work enough in all theſe kinds, if it be faithfully done?</p>
               <p>As for the doing of it <hi>per ſe aut per alium,</hi> I have ſo far confuted it before, as that I may be bold to tell them now, that they may alſo receive the reward <hi>in ſe aut in alio:</hi> And if he that will not work ſhould not eat, <hi>quaere</hi> whether they ſhould eat <hi>per alium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I add, <hi>If all this</hi> as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> maintaineth was made by the Spirit in the Apoſtles the Biſhops work, if they may make new Church-Officers to commit part of their work to, there may be twelve ſorts of Officers made by them for theſe twelve parts of their work. And then we ſhall better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them.</p>
               <p>Whatever is the work of a Biſhop as a Presbyter, every Presbyter may and muſt do, according to his ability and opportunity: But whatever belongeth to a Biſhop as a Biſhop, cannot be done by another, either Lay-man or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore let us have but Biſhops enough to do it, or elſe confeſs that it is no neceſſary work.</p>
               <p>So great a truſt as the Goſpel and mens ſouls which Chriſt hath committed to Biſhops, may not be caſt upon others without his conſent that did commit it to them. But they can ſhew no conſent of Chriſt to make new Officers to do their work by. <hi>Timothy</hi> was to commit the ſame to others which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>The things thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi> And who knoweth not that if a Tutor commit his work ſtatedly to another, he maketh that other a Tutor? And ſo if a Phyſician commit his work ſtatedly to another, or a Pilot, or the Maſter of a Family, he maketh the other a Phyſician, a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, a Maſter? And ſo if a Biſhop or Presbyter commit his work ſtatedly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, he maketh that other a Biſhop or Presbyter. And then that Biſhop or Presbyter ſo made is himſelf <hi>obliged</hi> as well as <hi>empowred,</hi> and the work that he doth is his own work, and not his that delivered him his Commiſſion. So that this doing theſe twelve parts of a Biſhops work <hi>per alium</hi> is a meer mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unleſs they ſpeak unfitly, and mean the <hi>making</hi> of all thoſe to be Biſhops as they are, or elſe by perfidious uſurpation caſting their truſt and work on others. For if they could prove that God himſelf had inſtituted the <hi>Species</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61252:103"/>
of <hi>Sub-presbyters,</hi> it would be to do <hi>their own work,</hi> and not another mans.</p>
               <p>My next proof of the limitation of Churches in Scripture times is, that Deacons and Biſhops were diſtinct Officers appointed to the ſame Churches. The Church which the Deacon was related to, was the very ſame, and of the ſame extent, with the Church which the Biſhop was related to; as is plain in all Texts where they are deſcribed; <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is moſt clear that no Deacon then had the charge of many hundred Churches, or more than one ſuch as I have deſcribed: Therefore neither had the Biſhop of that Church.</p>
               <p>They that have now extended the Office of the Deacons further, and have alienated them from their firſt works, of attending at the Sacred Tables, and taking care of the Poor, cannot deny but that this was at leaſt a great part of their work in the Scripture times and ſome Ages after (at leaſt when <hi>Jerome ad Evagr.</hi> deſcribed the Offices of the Presbyters and Deacons.) And was any man then made a Deacon to a Dioceſs? or to many hundred Churches? or to more than one? Did he attend the Tables of many Churches each Lords day at the ſame time? If you ſay that there were many Deacons, and ſome were in one Church and ſome in another, it is true: that is, They were in ſeveral Aſſemblies, which were every one a true Church, and they were oft many in one Aſſembly: But there was no one that was related to <hi>Many</hi> ſtated Church Aſſemblies; nor to a Church of a leſſer ſize or magnitude than the Biſhop was.</p>
               <p>5. And that there was no Church then without a Biſhop (one or more) is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>They ordained them Elders in every Church;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other Texts that call them Biſhops: And Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that theſe Elders were Biſhops. And indeed it was not a Church (in a proper political ſenſe) that had no Biſhops formally or eminently. No more than there can be a Kingdom without a King, a School without a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a family without a Maſter.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>They are called Churches </hi>  Act. 14. 23. <hi>before they had ordained Elders.</hi>
               </p>

If it were ſo, it is certain that the appellation was equivocal, as it is uſual to diſtinguiſh the Kingdom from the King, the School from the School-maſter, the Family from the Maſter, but not in the ſtrict political ſenſe of the words, for that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth both. 3. The truth is, they were true political Churches before. For they had temporary unfixed Biſhops, even the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, that converted them, and officiated among them. Otherwiſe they could have held no Sacred Aſſemblies for holy Communion and the Lords Supper, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to adminiſter it. The fixing of peculiar Biſhops did not make them firſt Churches, but made them ſetled Churches in ſuch an order as God would eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, The ſetling of Churches with Biſhops in <hi>every City, Tit.</hi> 1. 5. doth ſhew of what magnitude the Churches were in the Scripture times. For, 1. It is known that ſmall Towns in <hi>Judea</hi> were called Cities. 2. And that

                  <hi>Creete</hi> which was called <hi>Hecatompolis,</hi> as having an hundred Cities, muſt needs then have ſmall ones, and near together. 3. And it is a confeſſed thing that the number of Converts was not then ſo great, as to make City Churches ſo numerous near as our Pariſhes are.</p>
               <p>And if the conſideration of all this together, will not convince any, that the Churches that had Biſhops in Scripture times, conſiſted not of many ſtated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies as afore deſcribed, but of one only, and were not bigger than our Pariſhes, let ſuch enjoy their error ſtill.</p>

               <p>I do not cite all this now as to prove the ſenſe of Antiquity, but the ſenſe of <hi>Petavius,</hi> who plainly intimateth that the Churches were no larger of a long time, than that a Biſhop might preach to all the Clergy and People every Lords day; and that in Scripture times all or near all the Presbyters were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (which is it that we contend for;) and conſequently you may judge what the Churches were.</p>
               <p>And though it ſtill look much farther than Scripture times, I will ſhew you what <hi>Petavius</hi> thought of the Magnitude of City-Churches, even near four hundred years after Chriſt, in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s days, in his <hi>Animadverſ.</hi> on <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. ad Haer.</hi> 69. <hi>p.</hi> 276. [<hi>Singularem tunc temporis Alexandriae morem hunc fuiſſe, vel ſaltem paucis in Eccleſiis uſurpatum, &amp;c. i. e. That this was a ſingular cuſtom of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>or at leaſt uſed in few Churches, you may hence conjecture, becauſe he ſo expreſly mentioneth this cuſtom as peculiar to the Alexandrian Church: to wit, that in the ſame City there ſhould be many Titles, to each of which ſhould be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proper Presbyter, who ſhould there perform the Church Offices. But yet the ſame was formerly elſewhere inſtituted; that is, at</hi> Rome: <hi>where the Presbyters did every one rule his own people, being diſtributed by Titles</hi> (that is, ſetled Sub-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.) <hi>To them the Biſhops on the Lords days ſent Leaven, or hallowed Bread in token of Communion.</hi>] See what a ſhift they were at firſt put to, leſt the ſeveral Aſſemblies ſhould ſeem ſeveral Churches. For it is not to be imagined that this was done to ſignifie that common Chriſtian Communion which they had with all other Chriſtian Churches, but that neareſt Communion which belongeth to thoſe that are embodied under one Paſtor, or the ſame Paſtor in Common, that is, one particular Church Even as if theſe divers Altars or Tables were at a diſtance in the ſame Church, and the Biſhop would ſignifie the Union of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companies in the ſame Society, by ſending ſome of the Bread which he had bleſſed to them all.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Petavius</hi> proceedeth [<hi>Non dubito majoribus duntaxat in urbibus, &amp;c. I doubt not but that it was in the Greater Cities only that there were more</hi> (than one) <hi>Titles within the bounds (or Liberties) when within the ſame Walls, they would not be contained and meet together; and ſo had Presbyters put on the ſeveral Churches. But in the ſmaller and leſs frequented Cities, there was one only Church, into which they all did come together. Of which ſort were the Cities of</hi> Cyprus. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Epiphanius <hi>noteth the cuſtom of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>as a thing ſtrange to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and unuſual. Hence was the original of Pariſhes; which word was transferred from the Country Churches to the City Churches.</hi> And adding the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So that you ſee in <hi>Petavius</hi> opinion, even when <hi>Epiphanius</hi> wrote, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cities of the World had but one Aſſembly in each City and Suburbs; And only ſome extraordinary Cities (of which only <hi>Alexandria</hi> could be named by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> alſo by <hi>Petavius,</hi> and no more by any other Author) had divers ſetled Titles under their ſeveral Presbyters: And even thoſe Titles in thoſe two Cities were but Chappels, like our Pariſh Chappels, received conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Bread from the Biſhops Church, leſt they ſhould think that they were a diſtinct body of themſelves. Yea, and that the Villages that had Aſſemblies had their proper Biſhops. And ſo I diſmiſs <hi>Petavius</hi> with thanks, for his free Conceſſion.</p>

               <p>Now all this being aſſerted, 1. It is evident that they hold that in Scripture times, no Church conſiſted of more than one ordinary ſtated worſhipping Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. 2. And that every ſuch Aſſembly had a Biſhop. For if there were no Presbyters, there could be no Aſſembly but where a Biſhop was preſent: for the Lords days were then uſed for publick Worſhip; and the people could not do that without a Miniſter, for they had Communion in the Lords Supper
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61252:106"/>
every Lords day: And therefore they muſt have a Biſhop, or have no ſuch Worſhip. And Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> departeth from <hi>Petavius</hi> in holding that no Church had more Biſhops than one: So that <hi>de facto</hi> he granteth all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, 1. That the Churches were but ſo many Aſſemblies having each a Biſhop. 2. And that no Sub-Presbyters were inſtituted in Scripture times. And by what right the change was made we ſhall enquire anon.</p>

Per regiones igitur &amp; urbes verbum praedicantes, primitias eorum ſpiritu probantes, Epiſcopos &amp; Diaconos eorum qui credituri erant conſtituerunt.</hi>] Here are theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current evidences to our purpoſe. 1. In that he ſpeaketh only of Biſhops and Deacons, and neither here nor elſewhere one ſyllable of any other Presbyters but Biſhops, it is apparent that in thoſe times there were no Subject-Presbyters diſtinct from Biſhops in being: Nor could Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> any other way anſwer <hi>Blondel</hi> here, but by confeſſing and maintaining this, and ſo expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Clemens</hi> as ſpeaking of Biſhops only before other Presbyters were in the Church. And if ſo, then there could be none but Churches of ſingle Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies then, or ſuch as one man could officiate in: becauſe there was then no more to do it.</p>
               <p>2. In that <hi>Cities and Countries</hi> are made the Seats of theſe Biſhops: for though ſome would make them to be mentioned only as the places where the Apoſtles preached, the obvious plain ſenſe of the words is connexive of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſtituting Biſhops: by preaching they made believers in Cities and Countries, and over thoſe believers they placed Biſhops and Deacons; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it to be in the ſame places. And whereas ſome would ſtrain the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] to ſignifie <hi>Provinces,</hi> and not <hi>Country Villages,</hi> it muſt then, as diſtinct from Cities, have meant [<hi>many Cities</hi>] and ſo have ſtled <hi>Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops,</hi>

               <p>4. The magnitude of the Churches is plainly intimated, when he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 57. [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>5. Alſo the ſame is intimated by <hi>pag.</hi> 69. [<hi>If it be for me that Contention, Sedition and Schiſms ariſe, I will depart, I will be gone whither you will, and will do what ſhall by the people be appointed; only let the Sheep-fold of Chriſt live in peace with the Presbyters appointed over it.</hi> By which words it is evident, that it was ſuch a particular <hi>Ovile</hi> or Church, where the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a matter that bore much ſway. But who can think that this is ſpoken of many Congregations, where the peoples Will could not eaſily be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
               <p>6. And it is farther manifeſt in that it was but for <hi>the ſake of one or two</hi> that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> moved this ſedition againſt the Presbyters (called alſo Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,) <hi>pag.</hi> 62. Now how many Congregations that Church conſiſted of, where the intereſt of one or two was either ſo far concerned or ſo powerful, it is eaſie to conjecture; ſet all theſe together, and judge impartially.</p>
               <p>I add (though out of ſeaſon) that it was none of the Apoſtles meaning that thoſe whom they made Biſhops of ſuch ſingle Churches, without a ſubject Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Presbyters, ſhould make ſuch an Order of ſubject Presbyters, and make themſelves the Biſhops of a Dioceſane Church without any Biſhops under them. For <hi>pag.</hi> 57. he ſaith, [<hi>And our Apoſtles by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt knew, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention would ariſe about the name of Epiſcopacy; and for this cauſe being endued with perfect fore-knowledge, they appointed them aforeſaid, and left the Courſes (or Orders) of After-Miniſters and Offices deſcribed, that other approved men might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the place of the deceaſed, and might execute their Offices.</hi>] So that it was the ſame places and the ſame Offices which thoſe ordained by the Apoſtles had, in which others muſt ſucceed them, which therefore were <hi>deſcribed</hi> by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and not into others.</p>

               <p>Note alſo, as aforeſaid, that Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in <hi>Diſſert.</hi> granteth as to matter of fact, that <hi>Clemens</hi> ſpeaketh but of the Biſhops of ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom he alſo calleth Presbyters, there being no other in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

               <p>III.

The Unity of the Church is characteriſed by <hi>One Altar,</hi> and <hi>One Biſhop</hi> with the Presbytery and Deacons. If [<gap reason="foreign">

But remember that every Church uſed to worſhip God pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and to communicate, at leaſt every Lords day; and that there was but <hi>One Altar</hi> to each Church, and therefore but one Communicating Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I talk of nothing but <hi>matter of fact;</hi> it was the note of <hi>One Church</hi> when thoſe Epiſtles were written: whether the Author was miſtaken <hi>de jure,</hi> or whether after Ages grew wiſer, or rather had fewer Biſhops and more Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars for the ſake of Carnal Intereſt, I judge not.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author <hi>Epiſt. ad Smyrn.</hi> ſaith [<hi>Ubi utique apparet Epiſcopus, ibi &amp; multitudo ſit: quemadmodum utique ubi eſt Chriſtus Jeſus, illic Catholica Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi>] as <hi>Uſher's Lat. Tranſ.</hi> or [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So in <hi>Epiſt. ad Magneſ.</hi> he bids them [<hi>All unitedly</hi> (or as one) <hi>run together to one Temple of God, as to one Altar, to one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>] So that every Church had one <hi>Temple</hi> and one <hi>Altar</hi> to which (as a note of their Union in Chriſt) the whole Church muſt unanimouſly come.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Epiſt. ad Trull.</hi> he ſaith [<hi>Et Epiſcopus typum Dei Patris omnium gerit; Presbyteri vero ſunt conſeſſus quidam, &amp; conjunctus Apoſtolorum coetus; ſine his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Electa non eſt: Nulla ſine his Sanctorum Congregatio; nulla Sanctorum Collectio. Et poſtea, Quid vero aliud Sacerdotium eſt (vel Presbyterium) quam ſacer coetus, Conciliarii &amp; aſſeſſores Epiſcopi?

               <p>And <hi>Epiſt. ad Polycarp.</hi> [<hi>Saepe Congregationes fiant: ex nomine omnes quaere: ſervos &amp; ancillas ne deſpicias (ut Tranſ. Lat.

that had a Biſhop, Presbytery and Deacons: For the ſcattered Presbyters of many diſtant Pariſhes cannot be meant by the Presbytery which is ſuppoſed preſent with the Biſhop and Deacons.</p>
               <p>II. The next in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Copy is the Epiſtle to <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> where he ſaith to the Biſhop, <q>[Let not the Widows be neglected: Next after the Lord, be thou the Curator of them: Let nothing be done without thy Sentence: and do thou nothing without God: and what thou doſt let it be well ſtable: Let Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be often made: ſeek all by name: deſpiſe not Servants and Maids: ſpeak to my Siſters to love the Lord, and be ſubject in fleſh and ſpirit to their Husbands, and to the men to love their Wives. And the Men that marry, and the Women that are married, muſt make their union with the ſentence of the Biſhop, &amp;c.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is evident, 1. That it was a Church of which <hi>Widows</hi> were a part that is here meant: But <hi>Widows</hi> then were ſpecial parts of particular Pariſh-Churches, and not common to a Dioceſs of many ſuch.</p>
               <p>2. It was ſuch a Church where the Biſhop himſelf was to take care of all the Widows, and ſee that they were not neglected: And that could not be done to a Dioceſs of many ſcore or hundred Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>3. It was a Church where the Biſhop as preſent could ſee to all that was done.</p>
               <p>4. It was a Church that was oft to aſſemble or be congregate: which a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs never doth: For it is <hi>frequent Congregations of the ſame perſons</hi> that is here commanded or deſired.</p>
               <p>5. It was a Church ſo aſſembled that the Biſhop could by name take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count who was abſent by his own eye: Yea, even of the Servant-men and Maids.</p>
               <p>6. And ſuch as the Biſhop could himſelf marry all that were married in it, or at leaſt be their particular Counſellor therein: And exhort all Husbands and Wives to their duties.</p>
               <p>7. He after ſaith, <q>[I am of one ſoul with them that are ſubject to the Biſhop, Presbyters and Deacons.]</q> Signifying that theſe three were the preſent Officers of one and the ſame particular Church.</p>
               <p>III. The next is the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> where, 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. he willeth them <hi>to love their Biſhop, and all of them to imitate him:</hi> which ſuppoſeth that they knew him (and ſo doth not one in an hundred in moſt of our Dioceſſes, nor ever ſee his face.)</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. He tells them that <q>[They agree in the Sentence of the Biſhop, and ſo doth the worthy Presbytery agree with him, as the ſtrings of a Harp; and therefore in their conſent and conſounding love Jeſus Chriſt is ſung: and they are all made a Chore, that being conſonant in conſent, receiving in unity divine melody, they might with one voice ſing by Jeſus Chriſt to the Father that he may hear them, and know by whom they do good.]</q> Where it is moſt plainly ſignified that it was a Church which ſung to God by Chriſt in one Chore, in unity of concent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, under one Biſhop and his Presbytery and Deacons preſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61252:109"/>3. After <hi>pag.</hi> 20. he praiſeth them for being [<hi>conſonant</hi> in <hi>Unity</hi> with the Biſhop, <q>
                     <hi>For if any be not within the Altar, he is deprived of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>read of God: For if the prayer of one or two have ſo great force, how much more that which is of the Biſhop and all the Church? He therefore that cometh not to the ſame, is proud and condemneth himſelf. And by how much you ſee the Biſhop ſilent, reverence him the more: for we muſt receive every one that the Lord of the houſe ſendeth, as him that ſent him: you muſt therefore look upon the Biſhop manifeſt (or viſibly preſent) as to the Lord.</hi> Oneſimus <hi>praiſeth your Divine Order.</hi>]</q> 
               </p>
               <p>Here it is plain that it was a Church where many, yea all the Church joyned preſentially in prayer with the Biſhop, which a thouſand Pariſhes (nor two) do not.</p>
               <p>4. It was a Church where the Biſhop was ſeen by all when he was ſilent; and ſo reverenced for his ſilent preſence.</p>
               <p>5. It was a Church, which they that wilfully abſented themſelves from were ſelf-condemned: But a man can be but in one Pariſh at once.</p>
               <p>6. It was a Church where they might all ſee <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>manifeſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Perſpicuum, viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. It was a Church where all that had the Sacred Bread were [<hi>within the Altar,</hi>] that is, the one <hi>Sacrarium,</hi> or place of communicating in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>
               <p>8. And this was their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Order of their Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>After <hi>pag.</hi> 25. he ſaith <q>[Haſten therefore to aſſemble frequently, for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt (or thanksgiving) of God, and for Glory: For when you oft meet for the ſame thing, the powers of Satan are deſtroyed, and his perdition looſed in the concord of your faith.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>9. Here it is plain that it was a Church that uſed to meet together for the Euchariſt; manifeſting therein the concord of the faith of all the Church.</p>
               <p>And after <hi>pag.</hi> 29. he ſaith, <q>[Becauſe they who according to Man, do all by name meet commonly in Grace in one faith, and in Jeſus Chriſt, in your obeying the Biſhop, and Presbytery, with an undivided mind, breaking one bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>10. Here it is ſignified that the Biſhop and Presbytery were all preſent as Guides in one Aſſembly, which was that Church which they ſuperviſed.</p>
               <p>11. And that it was ſuch a Church that brake one Bread, profeſſing one faith, in preſence, with undivided minds. So plainly doth this Epiſtle decide our controverſie.</p>
               <p>IV. The next Epiſtle is <hi>Ad Magneſios.</hi> In which he ſaith, <q>Canto Eccleſias in quibus Unionem oro Carnis &amp; Spiritus. Union of Fleſh ſignifieth local Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. he ſaith, <q>[I am dignified to ſee you by <hi>Dama</hi> your Biſhop wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and the worthy Presbyters <hi>Baſſus</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and my fellow Servant <hi>Sotion</hi> the Deacon, whom I enjoy becauſe he is ſubject to the Biſhop and Presbytery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which words it is plain that this Church which had a <hi>Biſhop, Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> was a Parochial Church that had preſential Communion with them, and not as our Dioceſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61252:110"/>3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. Having mentioned the Biſhop he ſaith, <q>[Becauſe in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid perſons I behold all the multitude, in faith and love I warn you, ſtudy to do all in the concord of God, the Biſhop preſiding in the place of God, and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the ſtead of the Conſeſſion of the Apoſtles, and the Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Which ſheweth that it was a Church where Biſhop, Presbyters and Deacons ſate together in preſence.</p>
               <p>4. And after it's ſaid, <q>[Let there be nothing among you which may divide (or ſeparate) you; but be united to the Biſhop and Preſidents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Which ſheweth the ſame preſent Preſidency as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. He repeateth <q>[without the Biſhop and Presbyters do nothing]</q> which no reaſon can interpret of any Presbyters but the preſent.</p>
               <p>So 6. <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. <q>[Let nothing elſe ſeem reaſonable proper to your ſelves; but one Prayer for the ſame thing, one deprecation, one underſtanding, one hope in love and undefiled joy.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which importeth their preſent Communion in Prayer and Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>7. He addeth, <q>[All of you run (or meet) together into one Temple of God, as to one Altar.]</q> This needeth only an impartial Reader, and it's plain.</p>
               <p>8. And <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <q>[With your worthily honoured Biſhop, and the worthily Complexe Spiritual Crown of your Presbytery, and the Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> Where no Presbyters are mentioned but the Biſhops Presbytery which ſate about him in the Church, called the Complexe Corona.</p>
               <p>9. He addeth ut unio ſit carnalis &amp; ſpiritualis, that is, of preſent bodies and of minds.</p>
               <p>V. The next is the Epiſtle to the Philadelphians: where praiſing them for their union with their Biſhop as the ſtrings of a Harp, he ſaith, <q>[Study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to uſe one Euchariſt <hi>(or Thankſgiving) that is, to joyn all together in the Euchariſtical Communion:)</hi> For there is one Fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and one Cup <hi>(that is, which is there Sacramentally repreſented and given)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Union of his Blood, one Altar, and one Biſhop, with the Presbytery and the Deacons my fellow Servants; that what you do, you may do according to God.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here one Church is notified in its Unity by theſe marks.</p>
               <p>1. That they all joyn in one Aſſembly for the Euchariſt. Which ſignifieth one Body and Blood of Chriſt. 2. And that there be one Altar for this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 3. And one Biſhop. 4. And one Presbytery with his Deacons with him.</p>
               <p>But here Biſhop Gunning ſaith, It is not meant of one material Altar.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. It muſt be noted that (as Maſter Mede and others have obſerved) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed in Church Writers for the Chancel, Sacrarium, or place where the Altar ſtood, as well as for the Altar it ſelf: Into which place the Communicants only were admitted; to which form our Chancels are made.</p>
               <p>2. And to be intra Altare is uſually meant of being one admitted to that Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Communion. 3. And though as we give the Sacrament in private houſes to the ſick, and have Chappels for the weak and diſtant, ſo might ſome great Churches then, and yet have but one Chancel, Altar or place for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61252:110"/>
Communion of the whole Church; 4. The expreſs words, and the Context and ſenſe fully ſhew that it is perſonal preſent Communion that is here ſpoken of, and therefore in one place. 5. The common uſe of the word in other Writers, ſheweth it, (as being intra vel extra Altare, and ſetting up Altare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Altare, that is ſeparated Aſſemblies for ſuch Communion. (6. The moſt learned and famous Expoſitors ſo expound it; ſuch as Maſter Mede before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Arch-Biſhop Uſher and others. 7. The Contradictors can feign no other probable ſenſe. For,</p>
               <p>1. If by the Altar they ſay is meant [One Chriſt,] 2. or one Species of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, theſe are before confuted, and are palpably falſe. He that is in another part of the World may come to an Altar of the ſame ſpecies, which is nothing to the unity of a particular Church here ſpoken of. 3. If they ſay, It is called one Altar becauſe under one Biſhop, this maketh not many to be one, no more than many Temples. And if tropically it were ſo meant, it would be but a vain repetition, One Biſhop being mentioned beſides. And it is an Altar which the Biſhop with his Presbytery is ſuppoſed to be preſent at, which cannot be All in a Dioceſs called One. Partiality can give no other probable ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>One Church it is known had many Altars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Not then; no nor long after except at Rome and Alexandria: and then they were but as parts of Chappels, and not of Churches.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>It is ſaid alſo, There is one Body of Chriſt and one Cup, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant literally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. It is well called One agreeably to our preſent ſence: For, 1. It is one and the ſame Bread, though not one piece, which is there preſent, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and divided to them all; and one Cup or preſent quantity of Wine which is there diſtributed among them. 2. And it is One body and blood or ſacrificed Chriſt, which is in every Church repreſented and offered by One Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop at one Altar. This doth but confirm our Expoſition. But what can be ſo plain as to convince the prejudiced and unwilling?</p>
               <p>2. Pag. 45. he willeth [``the Church to ſend a Deacon to Antioch as other neighbour Churches ſent Biſhops, and ſome Presbyters and Deacons.] And can any man think that a Dioceſs met to chuſe a Deacon to go on a viſit, or that it was a Dioceſane Biſhop that was ſent by a Dioceſs, yea that all theſe neighbour Churches that ſent them were ſo many Dioceſſes?</p>
               <p>VI. The next is the Epiſtle ad Tralleſios. Where he ſaith of the Biſhop that came to him, [That he ſaw all the multitude in him;] that is, the Aſſembly. And as before he bids them, [Do nothing without the Biſhop, and be ſubject to the Presbytery; and that as to the Counſel of God, and Conjunction of Apoſtles] ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, [For without theſe the Church is not called:.] what can be plainer to ſhew that it was a Church that had a preſent Biſhop and Council of Presbyters conjunct, without whom the Church was not lawfully called together? So that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church had ſuch.</p>
               <p>2. And pag. 50. he ſaith again, [Not inflated, but being inſeparable from God, Jeſus Chriſt, and the Biſhop and the Orders of the Apoſtles (that is, the Confeſs of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61252:111"/>
Presbyters) He that is within the Altar is clean; and he that is without the Altar is not clean; that is, he that doth any thing (in the Church) without the Biſhop, Presbytery and Deacon, is not clean in Conſcience: which plainly ſheweth that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church-Aſſembly had a guiding Biſhop, Presbytery and miniſtring Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</p>
               <p>3. Pag. 52. he ſaith, [I ſalute you from Smyrna with the Churches of God, which are preſent with me:] He had not then the preſence of many Dioceſſes; nor were Biſhops alone uſed then to be called Churches: Therefore they were Church-Aſſemblies which he viſited, and were with him, and about him.</p>
               <p>4. Again he repeateth, [Be ſubject to the Biſhop and Presbytery, and love one another with an inſeparable heart.] Which hath the ſenſe aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>VII. In the Epiſtle to the Romans, the words of the Church preſiding in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho chori Romanorum is much ſpoken of already by many.</p>
               <p>The Epiſtles aſcribed to him have much of the like kind; as Epiſt. ad Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſes, pag. 80. Ad Antiochenos, pag. 86, 87, 88. The Epiſt. ad Heroum Diaconum calleth the Presbyters of Antioch Biſhops who baptize, ſacrifice and impoſe hands.</p>
               <p>So Epiſt. ad Philippenſes, pag. 112.</p>
               <p>If after all this evidence from Ignatius any will wrangle, let him wrangle: what words can be plain enough for ſuch? And what a blind or blinding pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is it, which too many Writers for Prelacy have uſed? to pretend Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius to be for them, who is ſo much and plain againſt them? And to toſs about the name of a Biſhop and Presbytery, as if all that was ſaid for a Parochial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbytery (that is, in a Church aſſociated for perſonal preſential Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) were ſpoken for ſuch a Dioceſane Prelacy as putteth down and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all ſuch Churches, Biſhops and Presbyteries.</p>
               <p>And what falſhood is it to perſwade the World that we are againſt Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy becauſe we would have every Church to have a Biſhop, and would not have all the Churches in England except Dioceſane, to be unchurched and turned into Chappels or Oratories? When yet we refuſe not to ſubmit to more general Overſeers of many Churches, to ſee that the Paſtors do their duty, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and exhort them to it, whether appointed hereto by the Magiſtrate, or the conſent and choice of many Churches.</p>

Thus Juſtin Apolog. 2. Where he deſcribeth the Church State and Worſhip which we deſire, as plainly as we can ſpeak our ſelves. Note here, 1. That whether the Country-men and Citizens had ſeveral Churches or met in one City Church, it ſheweth that they were but ſingle Congregations. For every Church had a preſent Biſhop: (For Doctor Hammond maintaineth that by the Praepoſitus here is meant the Biſhop, and ſo do others of them.) 2. This Biſhop performed the Offices of the day, every Lord's day, praying, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adminiſtring the Lord's Supper, &amp;c. 3. All the Alms of the Church was committed to the Biſhop at preſent, (and therefore he had not many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or any other Churches under him where Presbyters did all receive the Alms.) 4. He was the common Curator of all the Poor, Orphans, Sick, &amp;c. which could not be for more than one of our Pariſhes: (And let the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops take as big a Church as they will do all this for, and ſpare not.) 5. And the Deacons bringing the conſecrated Bread and Wine to the abſent in token of Communion with the ſame Church and Biſhop, ſheweth that there were not under him many other abſent Congregations, that had no other Biſhop of their own: Nor did the Deacon carry it to ſuch Congregations through the Dioceſs. In a word, here is a full deſcription of a Congregational Church and Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Saith Maſter Mede before cited, of theſe words, [As the Jews had their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, ſo perhaps might they have more Oratories than one; though their Altar were but one, there namely where the Biſhop was. Die ſolis omnes, &amp;c. (here he cites theſe words,) Namely as he there tells us, to celebrate and participate of the Holy Euchariſt. Why was this? but becauſe they had not many places to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate in.]</p>
               <p>V. Tertullian is as plain and full: Apol. c. 39. Corpus ſumus de conſcientia reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis, &amp; diſciplinae unitate, &amp; ſpei foedere: Coimus in Coetum, &amp; Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ut ad Deum quaſi manu facta precationibus ambiamus orantes—Cogimur ad divinarum literarum commemorationem.—Certe fidem ſanctis vocibus paſcimus: ſpem erigimus, fiduciam figimus, diſciplinam praeceptorum nihilominus inculcationibus denſamus. Ibidem etiam exhortationes, caſtigationes, &amp; cenſura divina. Nam &amp; judicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de Dei conſpectu; ſummumque futuri judicii praejudicium eſt, ſiquis ita deliquerit, ut a Communicatione orationis &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus &amp; omnis Sancti Commercii relegatur: Praeſident probati quique Seniores, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And de Corona Milit. cap. 3. Euchariſtiae Sacramentum, &amp; in tempore victus, &amp; omnibus mandatum a domino, etiam antelucanis coetibus; nec de aliorum manu quam praeſidentium ſumimus.</p>
               <p>And further, [Aquam adituri itidem, ſed &amp; aliquando prius in Eccleſia ſub antiſtitis manu conteſtamur, nos renunciare Diabolo &amp; pompae &amp; angelis ejus.]</p>
               <p>In all theſe words (and many more ſuch in Tertullian) it is evident, 1. That then a Church was a Congregation met for holy Worſhip, and not many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61252:112"/>
Congregations making one Church primae ordinis. 2. That this Church had ordinarily a Biſhop preſent (not preſent in one Congregation and many hundred without.) 3. That the Biſhop baptized, and took the Confeſſions of the Baptized, and performed the ordinary Worſhip, and adminiſtred the Lords Supper. (Doctor Hammond himſelf maintaineth that it is the Biſhop that Tertullian ſpeaketh of.) 4. That Diſcipline was exerciſed in thoſe Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and therefore the Biſhop was preſent.</p>
               <p>5. They took the Sacrament from none but the Biſhops hand (ſave that the Deacon diſtributed it as from him) which proveth that the Biſhop was preſent, when ever the Sacrament was adminiſtred. 6. They had theſe Aſſemblies eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lords day. All which ſet together plainly ſheweth that then every Church had a preſent Biſhop, (ordinarily) and was no more than one Congregation, met for ſuch Communion as is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>VI. And even in Cyprian's time the alteration was not great: Epiſt. 68.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Caſe is ſo plain in Cyprian that Pamelius himſelf is forced thus to confeſs [Non negamus veterem Electionis Epiſcoporum ritum, quo plebe praeſente, immo &amp; ſuffragiis plebis eligi ſolent.

               <p>From hence now the quantity of their Churches may eaſily be gathered. 1. The people muſt be preſent. 2. And this muſt be All the people, the whole Laity of the Church. 3. They give their teſtimony of the life of the ordained. 4. They are ſuppoſed all to know his converſation. 5. This is the common cuſtom of the Churches, in Africa and all other Countries.</p>
               <p>Now I leave it to the conſideration of ſober minds how many Churches, or Congregations could do all this? Whether it was many hundred Churches that never ſaw the perſon, nor one another, that were to meet in one Church or place, to do all this? Or rather the Inhabitants of a Vicinity, uſing to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for Communion, when even our Greater Pariſhes now are more than can thus meet and do all this?</p>
               <p>2. Note alſo that when Cyprian impoſeth it on the ſame people that chuſe their Biſhop, alſo to ſeparate from one that is wicked, and not communicate with him in the Sacrament, it is moſt evident to him that is willing to underſtand, that this Biſhop was to be the Teacher of all the people of that Church, and was to adminiſter the Sacrament to them in the Congregation, and they had ordinary communion with him: For how elſe ſhould they be called on to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from him, in the Sacrifice (as it's called.) Doth he command a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or a hundred diſtant Churches to ſeparate from the Sacrifices of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who never had local Communion with him (unleſs perhaps once in their lives as with a ſtranger.) The Impartial can hardly read theſe words, and not underſtand them.</p>
               <p>Two Objections are here made. 1. Obj. All the People is put for all preſent, which is a part.</p>
               <p>Anſw. By ſuch interpretations let God or Man ſay what they will, it will ſignifie but what the Reader pleaſe. The Context and many concurrent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſhew that (though buſineſs or ſickneſs might hinder ſome Individuals) it was the main body of the Congregation which is called Plebs Univerſa, or elſe it will be nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>2. Object. <hi>But if the ſame were the cuſtom till the days of </hi> Charles <hi>and</hi>  Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick, <hi>then it could not be all the people, for then it's known that the Dioceſes were larger: Therefore it muſt be but all that belonged to the Cathedral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61252:113"/>Anſw. 1. Even till their days Chriſtianity had not been received by the whole Cities or Pariſhes, in the greateſt part of the Empire; but (according to the liberty then given when none were forced to be Chriſtians) the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were but few in many great Countries. It was long ere they were the greater number of the Inhabitants in France and Flanders; longer in England; and longer in Germany, and Hungary, and Poland; and longer in Sweden and Denmark, &amp;c. 2. That it was no Cathedral Society diſtinct from other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under the ſame Biſhop in Cyprian's time, is moſt evident: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuch diſtinction intimated, but contrarily all the Biſhops Church or Flock is ſpoken to: And how ſhould one part of the Church come to have a right to chuſe and refuſe the Biſhop more than all the reſt? And in all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Dioceſes it was ſo long after: But it is true that at Rome, Alexandria and the greater Churches, where the cuſtom was continued, and yet the multitude of the people was ſo great that they could not half meet in one place; thoſe that were forwardeſt crowded together, and oft committed Riots and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (as at the Election of Damaſus, and others,) till by this, the cuſtom was changed to avoid ſuch tumults; and thoſe that would not be in the Crowd ſtayed at home: And the neareſt Neighbours commonly were they that met.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But do not we ſee that a whole County can meet to chuſe Parliament Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw.1. No: It is only the Freeholders who are comparatively but a ſmall part of the County. 2. It is in a Field, or Streets, and not in a Church. 3. It is commonly to judge of their Suffrages by comparing by the eye, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the diſtinct Companies when they ſeparate, or elſe by taking their Votes Man by Man in a long time, and not to do all in their hearing, and by their Counſel, as in this Caſe. 4. I have been at great Aſſemblies for ſuch Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Parliament, in the Fields; and I never ſaw more together than have heard me preach in one Aſſembly, nor half ſo many as ſome London Pariſhes do contain: much leſs as a Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal more in Cyprian to prove the thing in queſtion, Epiſt. 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 40. which would be tedious to the Reader ſhould I recite it. A primordio Epiſcopatus mei ſtatuerim nihil ſine conſilio veſtro &amp; ſine conſenſu plebis meae privata ſententia gerere—Prohibeantur offerre, acturi apud nos, &amp; apud confeſſores ipſos, &amp; apud plebem univerſam cauſam ſuam.] Haec ſingulorum tractanda ſit &amp; limanda plenius ratio, non tantum cum Collegis meis, ſed &amp; cum plebe ipſa univerſa.—Vix plebi perſuadeo, immo extorqueo, ut tales pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur admitti—Secundum veſtra divina ſuffragia, Conjurati &amp; ſcelerati de Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia ſponte ſe pellerent.—] By theſe and many ſuch paſſages it is evident that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the famous Church of Carthage, under that famous Biſhop was no greater than that all Church Affairs might be treated of in the hearing of all the Laity, and managed by their conſent, and the Quality of each Presbyter and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, and their faults fell under the Cognizance of the whole Church; not as Governors, but as intereſſed for their own welfare, as the words declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61252:113"/>VII. And here I think I may ſeaſonably cite the Conſtitutions called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical; which if not written by Clement, were certainly for the moſt part of them very ancient, as being before Athanaſius who mentioneth them. And the Learned and Sober Albaſpinaeus, Obſerv. Lib. 1. p. 38. ſaith, [De conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus iſtis nemini dubium eſſe debet, quin probus iuxta &amp; antiquus liber ſit; certo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que affirmare poſſum trecentis primis eo eccleſiam Graecam, tanquam rituali &amp; Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficali uſam eſſe; Quique eas attente legerit, eadem de illis quae de canonibus judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit, additas, viz. decurſu temporum primis novas, quemadmodum &amp; novae leges &amp; conſtitutiones in regimine Eccleſiae, novis occaſionibus enatis, factae ſunt.] that though they were not written by Clement or the Apoſtles, yet they were that Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Apoſtolical or Chriſtian Diſcipline, which the Greek Churches much uſed for the firſt three hundred years; and that Additions were made by degrees. But I cite them for nothing but the Hiſtory, wherein they are of great account to acquaint us with the ſtate of the Church in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Lib. 2. cap. 18. It is ſaid, that [Omnium Epiſcopus curam habeat, &amp; eorum qui non peccarunt, ut non peccent, &amp; eorum qui in peccatis ſunt, ut peccaſſe poeniteat: ait enim Dominus, Videte ne contemnatis unum ex puſillis iſtis. Item poenitentibus condonare oportet peccata.—Quocirca curam omnium ſuſcipe tanquam rationem de pluribus redditurus: Ac ſanos quidem conſerva, lapſos vero mone, &amp; qui in jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio premens, leva in remiſſione, &amp; eum qui luxit recipe, cuncta Eccleſia pro eo depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante, &amp;c.] And much more works he adds: Whereby it appeareth that the Biſhoprick was no greater than that he could take a perſonal care of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, over the meaneſt, ſound and unſound: And that it was one Aſſembly where all did intercede for the reſtoring of the Penitent.</p>
               <p>So cap. 20. opening the Biſhop's duty to the Laity, he repeateth, Omnes monens, omnes increpans, &amp;c. And ibid. Medice ergo Eccleſiae Domini adhibe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinam cuique aegrotantium convenientem: Omnibus modis cura, ſana, factos ſanos redde Eccleſiae; paſce gregem, non per vim, neque imperioſe, cum ludibrio &amp; deſpectu quaſi dominatum teneas, ſed tanquam bonus paſtor in ſinum ac complexum agnos congrega &amp; oves gravidas hortare.</p>
               <p>And it concerneth them to know well what they do, for cap. 2. Scitote quod qui eum, qui injuriam non fecit, ejicit, aut qui ſe convertit non recipit, fratrem ſuum occidit, &amp; ſanguinem ejus fudit, ſicut Cain ſanguinem fratris ſui fudit; cujus ſanguis, qui ad Deum clamat, requiretur.—Similiter eveniet ei qui ab Epiſcopo ſuo ſine iuſta cauſa fuerit excommunicatus: Qui tanquam peſtiferum ejicit eum qui eſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra culpam, is quidem ſaevior eſt interfectore.—Violentior eſt ipſo homicida qui corpus perimit, is qui innocentem ex eccleſia ejicit.</p>
               <p>Et cap. 25. Oportet ut qui in Eccleſia aſſidui ſunt eos Eccleſia aelat (viz. Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem, Sacerdotes, Levitas.) where the Aſſembly is the Church which maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Biſhop and Presbyters.</p>
               <p>And cap. 26. It is the Biſhop that to all the Church is, Miniſter Verbi, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae cuſtos, Mediator Dei &amp; veſtrum in iis quae ad eum colendum pertinent (that is, officiateth in Church Worſhip:) hic eſt magiſter pietatis ac religionis; hic eſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Deum pater veſter, qui vos per aquam &amp; Spiritum ſanctum regeneravit, &amp;c.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61252:114"/>
Epiſcopus igitur vobis praeſideat, ut dignitate Dei cohoneſtatus, qua clerum ſub pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſua tenet, &amp; toti populo praeeſt, Diaconus vero aſſiſtat huic, &amp;c. So that a Biſhops Church was no greater than that he could be the conſtant Teacher, Guide, Baptizer, &amp;c. of them all.</p>
               <p>And cap. 27. All the Oblations were to be brought to the Biſhop himſelf, by themſelves that offered, or by the Deacons. Immo primitias quoque &amp; deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas &amp; quae ſponte offeruntur; is enim probe novit afflictos &amp; cuique tribuit, ut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruit; ne quis eadem die aut eadem hebdom ide bis aut ſaepius accipiat, alius vero nihil penitus. So that the reaſon why all the Offerings, Tythes and Gifts in his whole Dioceſs were brought to the Biſhop himſelf was, becauſe he was well acquainted with all the Poor of his Dioceſs, and was every day to relieve them, and ſee that one did not receive twice the ſame day, or the ſame Week, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have none. How many hundred Churches think you had a Church then in the Belly of it? and how large was ſuch a Dioceſs?</p>
               <p>And cap. 28. In their Love-Feaſts the Biſhop was to have always his ſpecial part of the Feaſt, even ſent him if he were abſent. Sure if his Dioceſs had ſix hundred or a thouſand Pariſhes and as many Feaſts, and ſome of them as far off as I am from the Cathedral Church (about fourſcore Miles) it will coſt more the Carriage of the Biſhop's Supper than it is worth, and it will be cold, and it is well if it ſtink not by the way. And the Presbyters that were all to have a double portion alſo of the Feaſt, are called tanquam Conſiliarii Epiſcopi &amp; Eccleſiae Corona, ſunt enim Conſilium &amp; Senatus Eccleſiae. So that it was but one City Congregation yet that had Biſhops and Presbyters and Deacons, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in cap. 30. and many Chapters there is mentioned often the Biſhops doing all without any help ſave the Deacons, which would make one think that de facto Doctor Hammond was in the right, and that ſome of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions were written when in moſt Churches there was no Presbyters with the Biſhop but Deacons only.</p>
               <p>Cap. 32. If the Deacon knew any to be poor, he muſt tell the Biſhop, and do nothing without him. How large was this Dioceſs? cap. 34. This Biſhop muſt be loved as a Father, feared as a King, honoured as a God, offering him our Fruits and the works of our hands for his Bleſſing; giving him as God's Prieſt our Firſt-fruits, Tythes, First-fruits of Corn, Wine, Oyl, Apples, Wool, and all that God ſhall give us.] Was all this carried him from many hundred Pariſhes, many ſcore Miles?</p>
               <p>And cap. 36. The Biſhop's Church was no farther off than that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were to come to it in the morning before they went to any work, and at Evening when they had done. How big was this Dioceſs?</p>
               <p>Cap. 44. The Deacon is to be the Biſhop's Eye, and Ear, and Mouth, and to help him, that he may not be overwhelmed with his work: If he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſubject Presbyters, one Deacon's help only would not have been named.</p>
               <p>Cap. 56. The Biſhop is to ſee that this Deacon ſpeak Peace to every one that entreth into the Church to worſhip. Which implyeth that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Church.</p>
               <p>Cap. 57. The deſcription of a Church Order is, that the Biſhop's Seat be in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61252:114"/>
the midſt, and that the Presbyters ſit on each ſide of him, and ſo for the reſt. And the Order of Officiating was, [that (the Deacons ſeeing all orderly keep their Seats) the Reader firſt read the old Scriptures, and the Deacon or Presbyters the Goſpels; then that the Presbyters exhort the people, not all at once, but one by one, and laſt of all the Biſhop, &amp;c.] Theſe were then the Churches; where every Altar had a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>So cap. 50. Cum doces Epiſcope, jube &amp; mone populum frequent are quotidie Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam mane &amp; veſpere, ut omnino abeſſe nolit, immo aſſidue conveniat, neque Ullus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducendo ſe Eccleſiam mutilam faciat, &amp; a corpore Chriſti unum membrum decerpat: Neque enim de ſolis Sacerdotibus dictum eſt, ſed potius quiſque Laicus, &amp;c. So that a Biſhop's Dioceſs or Church was ſo great, as that no one Lay Member ſhould be abſent Morning or Evening.</p>
               <p>Lib. 4. cap. The Biſhop had the particular care of all the Pupils, Widows, Labourers, Weak, Naked, Sick, Virgins, &amp;c. And cap. 5. He is to know well who they be that offer all the Oblations; and is to reject the Oblations of all the Wicked: For cap. 7. Let the Poor have never ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed, it's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter periſh by Famine, than receive anything from the Enemies of God, which may be contumelious to his Friends.]</p>
               <p>Lib 8. cap. 4. The Ordering of a Biſhop muſt be (de quo nulla eſt querela; &amp; qui ſit a cuncto populo ex optimis quibuſque electus, quo nominato &amp; placente popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in unum congregatus, una cum Presbyteris &amp; Epiſcopis praeſentibus, die Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico, conſentiat. Qui vero inter reliquos princeps Epiſcopus, percontetur Epiſcopos &amp; populum, an ipſe ſit quem praeeſſe petunt? &amp;c. So that all the people of the Church came together to chuſe and conſent to the Biſhop: no greater at that time was a Dioceſane Church.</p>
               <p>Cap. 12. His peractis dextram &amp; laevam ejus ut diſcipuli Magiſtro aſſiſtant.—This is part of the Common Rubrick (of the beſt and eldeſt Liturgy that I know of recorded by Church Hiſtory) for the celebrating the Sacrament. So that it ſuppoſeth a Biſhop to be then preſent in all Churches that had an Altar and Sacrament. The reſt of the Liturgy, lib. 8. ſuppoſeth ſtill the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Biſhop. Cap. 35. Congregabis Epiſcope Eccleſiam ad veſperam, &amp;c. It would be too long to recite all the Biſhops part in the ordinary Offices of the Aſſembly. It is hence plain that in thoſe Ages (unleſs it were very few; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only Rome and Alexandria) no Biſhops had more ſtated Aſſemblies or Churches that had Altars, or communicated, than one.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Canons called the Apoſtles run juſt in the ſame ſtrain with the Conſtitutions: And though by ſome of them it is apparent that (at leaſt) all of them are not ſo old as many think, (As that which intimateth that Rulers ſet up Clergy-men, &amp;c.) yet they were elder than our Compound Dioceſane Churches. For Can. 5. It is ſaid. [Omnium aliorum primitiae Epiſcopo &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris domum mittuntur; non ſuper altare: Manifeſtum eſt autem quod Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus &amp; Presbyteri inter Diaconos &amp; reliquos Clericos eas dividunt.] By which and many ſuch paſſages it is evident that there was then but one Altar and one Biſhop with his Presbytery and Deacons in a Church, as in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61252:115"/>
Ignatius's time: and that they all lived on the ſame Altar, together with the reſt of the Gifts of the Church, Vid. &amp; Can. 58.</p>
               <p>The Can. 32. ſaith, [Siquis Presbyter contemnens Epiſcopum ſuum, ſeorſim col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legerit &amp; altare aliud erexerit, nihil habens quo reprehendat Epiſcopum in cauſa pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, aut juſtitiae, deponatur, quaſi principatus amator exiſtens.—Haec autem poſt unam &amp; ſecundam &amp; tertiam Epiſcopi obſecrationem fieri conveniat.] The ſame is in the Can. 5. Concil. Antioch. And to ſet up aliud Altare, &amp; Altare contra Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare is the Phraſe uſed then by many Writers, and Councils, to ſignifie a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and ſeparating from the Church, and ſetting up an Antichurch; All which ſheweth that then a Biſhops Church had but one Altar.</p>
               <p>IX. Dionyſius (whoever or whenever he wrote) doth ſo deſcribe the Biſhops work as ſheweth that he had but one Church and Presbytery to aſſiſt him. Cap. 4. de Eccleſ. Hier. he tells us that [The Prefect did baptize thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,] and the Presbyters and Deacons did but aſſiſt him: And it is a very long manner of baptizing which he there deſcribeth, and all the Church were called together to it, and joyned in it. And this was in times when the Infidels were to be brought in, and converted, and baptized at Age, where Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Profeſſions and Circumſtances made it ſo long a work, as this alone would have proved his Church to be no greater than aforeſaid: much more with the reſt of the work which he deſcribeth.</p>
               <p>X. But Councils give the ſureſt teſtimonies to ſuch matter of fact: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Agath. Can. 4. Siquis etiam extra Parochias, &amp; ubi legitimus eſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque conventus, Oratorium habere voluerit, reliquis feſtivitatibus ut ibi miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam audiat, propter fatigationem familiae, juſta ordinatione permittimus. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha vero, Natali Domini, Epiphania, Aſcenſione Domini, Pentecoſte, &amp; natali Sancti Johannis Baptiſtae, &amp; ſiqui maxime dies, in feſtivitatibus habentur, non niſi in civitatibus, aut Parochiis audiant. This being decreed ſo late, when Chriſtians were increaſed in the Countries, alloweth them, to avoid wearineſs in travelling with their Families too far, to have Chappels or Oratories in the remote parts of the Country (but ſo that they come all to the City or Pariſh Church on all the greateſt Feſtivals.) Which ſheweth that then the Church was but one Aſſembly which all could joyn in to hear the word.</p>
               <p>And that each of theſe City and Pariſh Churches had a Biſhop of their own, is apparent in what followeth, [Can. 30. Benedictionem ſuper plebem in Eccleſia fundere aut poenitentem in Eccleſia benedicere, Presbytero penitus non licebit; that is, [It ſhall not at all be lawful for a Presbyter to pronounce the Bleſſing on the people in the Church, or to bleſs a Penitent in the Church.] Now theſe being (or one at leaſt) performed in every Church Aſſembly, when a Presbyter is forbidden to do them, it is implied that a Biſhop was preſent to do it himſelf: and ſo that every communicating Aſſembly had a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And it's ſaid, Can. 31. Miſſas die Dominico ſecularibus totas audire ſpeciali ordine praecipimus; ita ut ante benedictionem ſacerdotis egredi populus non praeſumat, quod ſi fecerit, ab Epiſcopo publice confundatur. So that there muſt be a daily pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61252:115"/>
of the Bleſſing each Lords day, and that not by the Presbyters but the Biſhop, who muſt rebuke them that go out before it; which ſheweth that each Church had a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And after, [Qui ſolemnitatum, id eſt Paſchae &amp; natalis domini vel Pentecoſtes feſtivitatibus, cum Epiſcopis intereſſe neglexerint, quum in civitatibus communionis vel benedictionis accipiendae cauſa poſitos ſe noſſe debeant, triennio communione priventur Eccleſiae.] By which it appeareth that in a City there were no more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Church-members, than could congregate with the Biſhop on the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals for Communion; when all the neglecters were to be deprived of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for three years.</p>
               <p>XI. The Council at Eliberis Baetic. An. 305. had nineteen Biſhops, twenty ſix Presbyters, and the Deacons, &amp; omnis Plebs ſtood by: which intimateth that theſe twenty ſix Presbyters and the Deacons were the main body of the Clergy under the nineteen Biſhops; which was not two Presbyters to a Biſhop: why elſe ſhould the Deacons and all the Laity be there, if not all the Presbyters? And ſuppoſing that Plebs omnis here ſignifie not ſtrictly all the Laity, yet it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth that the Churches were no greater than that ſo great a part of their Laity was there, as that Phraſe might be well uſed of; which cannot be of our Compound Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>XII. Concil. Gangrenſ. cap. 7. No one was to receive the Oblations of Fruits, and the Firſt-fruits, due to the Church, out of the Church. And cap. 8. None was to receive them but the Biſhop, or he whom the Biſhop appointed. This ſheweth the quantity of the Dioceſs, and that every Church had one Altar and one Biſhop.</p>
               <p>XIII. In a Roman Council ſub Silveſt. it's ſaid, [Ab omni Eccleſia eliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur conſecrandus Epiſcopus, nullo de membris Eccleſiae intercedente, &amp; omni Eccleſia conveniente: &amp; nulli Epiſcopo liceat ſine cuncta Eccleſia a noviſſimo gradu uſque ad primum ordinare Neophytum Silveſter Papa dixit, A nobis incipientes moderamine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis judicare, commonemus ut nulli Epiſcopo liceat quemlibet gradum Clerici ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare aut conſecrare, niſi cum omni adunata Eccleſia, ſi placet: &amp; dixerunt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi, placet. What can be more fully ſaid, [Let the Biſhop to be ordained be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by all the Church, no one of the Members of the Church being wanting, and all the Church meeting together. Let it be lawful for no Biſhop without the whole Church to ordain.—Not to ordain or conſecrate any degree of Clergy-Man, but with the whole Church together in one. And how great then were the Churches, when even at Rome and all about it, The whole Church united, and every member could meet together at every Ordination and Conſecration? I ſcarce know how a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can be plainer.</p>
               <p>XIV. The Concil. Sardic. which firſt began to befriend the Grandeur of the Roman Biſhop, was it that firſt forbad Biſhops to be ordained in ſmall Villages: yet note that even there it was not abſolutely forbidden to all Villages; but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61252:116"/>
only to ſuch Villages and ſmall Cities where one Presbyter was enough: But they allowed a Biſhop to the Cities. [Quae Epiſcopos habuerunt, &amp; ſiqua tam populoſa eſt Civitas vel Locus (mark Locus as diſtinct from Civitas) qui mereatur habere Epiſcopum.] So that if there were but people enough for more than one Presbyter, they allowed them a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And Can. 14. It is decreed that, [As no Lay-man muſt be above three Weeks from Church, ſo no Biſhop from his own Church at another place.] Whereas if a Biſhop have many Churches, or many hundred, or a thouſand, he could be but at one in a Year, or two, or three, or more, if he did nothing but travel from pariſh to Pariſh. Only in the next Canon, thoſe that have Farms or Lands in the Country are diſpenſed with for three Weeks to be abſent from their own Churches, ſo they go to another.</p>
               <p>XV. In the Epiſtle of the 1. Concil. Nic. ad Eccleſ. Aegypt. (in Crab. pag. 262. T. 1.) Presbyters were to be made, [Solummodo ſivideantur digni, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus eos elegerit, condecernente ſimul &amp; deſignante maxime Alexandriae Civitatis Epiſcopo.] Still the people that had the choice were no more than could meet to chuſe.</p>
               <p>And even in the Arabick Canons aſcribed to this Council by ſome of late it's ſaid, Can. 72. Sic Epiſcopi &amp; Sacerdotes ſi Civitates ſuas &amp; Altaria propter alia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora relinquerent, male facerent; which ſhews that each City even then had but one Altar or Meeting for Sacramental Communion: though when theſe were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there were other Churches in Villages that had Altars.</p>
               <p>And in Piſan. Can. 57. Archi-presbyter in abſentia Epiſcopi honoretur tanquam Epiſcopus, quia eſt loco ejus, &amp; ſit caput Sacerdotum qui ſub poteſtate ejus ſunt in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia. The Biſhop then was but ſuch a Head of Prieſts in the ſame Church, as an Arch-Presbyter might be in his abſence.</p>
               <p>And Cap. 9. The Vote of the whole Dioceſs without the Arch-biſhop ſhall not ſerve to chuſe a Biſhop, though all gathered together.</p>
               <p>XVI. The Concil. Vaſenſe granted leave for Presbyters to preach and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to read Homilies in Country Pariſhes, which ſheweth both that Biſhops were the ordinary Preachers to their whole Flocks before, and that theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes were yet but new, and perhaps but Chappels that yet had not Altars and the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p>XVII. Binnius in Concil. Epheſ. 1. To. 2. cap. 20. ſaith, [Dalmatius told the Emperor that there were ſix thouſand Biſhops under the Metropolitan ſent to the Council that were againſt Neſtorius;] And there was a great number on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide with Johan. Antiochen. who caſt out Cyril and Memnon. How great think you were theſe Biſhops Dioceſes?</p>
               <p>XVIII. Concil. Carth. 3. cap. 39. &amp; 40. (in Crab) ſome would have had many (twelve) Biſhops at each Biſhop's Ordination; but Aurelius deſired it might be but three, becauſe [Crebro &amp; pene per diem Dominicum ordinationes habemus,] they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61252:116"/>
had Ordinations almoſt every Lord's day, and Tripoli had but five Biſhops. How big were theſe Dioceſes where the Biſhops could meet almoſt every Lord's day for Ordinations; and five under Tripoly was an exceeding ſmall number.</p>
               <p>And cap. 40. If a Biſhop were accuſed at his Ordination, the Cauſe was to be tried, In eadem plebe cui ordinandus eſt; And ſurely it was not to be in many hundred Congregations at once or per vices.</p>
               <p>XIX. Concil. Antioch. (before this) Can. 5. (pag. 321. in Crab) Siquis Presbyter aut Diaconus Epiſcopum proprium contemnens, ſe ab Eccleſia ſegregaverit &amp; ſeorſum colligens Altare conſtituit (vel in ſecunda edit. &amp; privatim apud ſe collectis populis Altare erigere auſus fuerit, &amp;c.) This ſheweth, 1. That the Presbyters then joyned with the Biſhop in the ſame Church. 2. And that then each Church had but one Altar, and to erect another Altar elſewhere, was to ſet up another Church.</p>
               <p>Can. 8. Presbyteri qui ſunt in agris Canonicas Epiſtolas dare non poſſunt—Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi autem—dare poſſunt—This ſheweth that then the Country Villages had Chorepiſcopos with Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Can. 10 Qui in vicis vel poſſiſſionibus Chorepiſcopi nominantur quamvis manus impoſitionem Epiſcoporum perceperint, &amp; ut Epiſcopi conſecrati ſint, tamen Sanctae Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodo placuit, ut modum proprium recognoſcant, ut gubernent ſibi ſubjectas Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as earumque moderamine curaque contenti ſint. This ſheweth that then the Churches in Villages had their Biſhops, though under the City Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Can. 16. A Biſhop that put himſelf into a vacant Church without the conſent of a perfect Council, where muſt be the Metropolitane, muſt be caſt out, et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi cunctus populus quem diripuit eum habere delegerit: which ſheweth that the whole people were no more than could meet to chuſe him.</p>
               <p>Can. 17, 18, 21. imply the ſame; Epiſcopus ab alia Parochia non migret ad aliam, nec ſponte ſua inſiliens, nec vi coactus a populo, nec ab Epiſcopis neceſſitate compulſus: Maneat autem in Eccleſia quam primitus adeo ſortitus eſt. A Church and a Pariſh are here the ſame; and no greater than that the people could be the compellers, which implieth their concurrence, which could not be in a Dioceſs of many hundred Churches; but in one only.</p>
               <p>Can. 23. The Goods of the Church are faithfully to be kept: which alſo are to be diſpenſed by the Judgment and Power of the Biſhop, to whom is committed the people, and the ſouls that are congregated in the Church: and it's manifeſt what things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church, with the knowledge of the Presbyters and Deacons that are about him, who cannot but know what are the Church Goods, &amp;c. Here 1. The Church contained only the ſouls that were congregated in it, and not many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 2. All the Church Goods were known to the Presbyters and Deacons, ſo that the Biſhop did diſpoſe of them while he lived, but could alienate none at his death: which ſheweth that it was but one Church or Congregation, where the Biſhop and Presbyters joyned in the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61252:117"/>Cap. 25. hath the ſame Evidence: The Biſhop diſpenſeth all the Goods and Lands of the Church, to all that need, but muſt not appropriate them to his Kindred, &amp;c. but uſe them by the conſent of his Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
               <p>XX. Concil. Carthag. 4. cap. 14. The Biſhop's dwelling was to be near the Church. (But if he had many Churches, they would have told which.) Can. 17. The Biſhop was to exerciſe the care of Government of Widows, Orphans, and Strangers by his Arch-Presbyter and Arch-Deacon (which ſheweth that they had not many Churches; where each appropriate Presbyter and Deacons did it.)</p>
               <p>Can. 22. The Peoples conſent and teſtimony was neceſſary to every Clerk ordained: (which ſheweth how large the Churches or People were.)</p>
               <p>Can. 35. The Biſhop is ordered to ſit above the Presbyters in the Church, and in their Conſeſs; but at home to know himſelf to be their Colleague: which ſheweth that they were all belonging to one Church, and not to many far from each other.</p>
               <p>XXI. Concil. Laodic. Presbyters muſt not go into the Church (or Sacrarium as the other Ed.) before the Biſhop, nor ſit in the Seats, but muſt go in with the Biſhop, or ſit in lower Seats (till he comes.) Which ſheweth that they were all in one Church. And if there had been many Churches diſtant where there were no Biſhops but Presbyters only, it's like that Caſe would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as well as is the Caſe of the Biſhop's [Sickneſs and Peregrination.] See Binnius three Verſions, To. 1. pag. 292. and Crab's two Vol. 1. pag. 310.</p>
               <p>Can. 28. Forbidding the Agapae, or Church Feaſts to be made in the Church, implieth that other Houſes could contain the Church Members. And Can. 58. Forbidding Oblationes fieri vel celebrari in domibus ab Epiſcopis vel Presbyteris, doth ſhew that till they built Chappels there was but one Congregation in a City, which was where the Biſhop was.</p>
               <p>XXII. Decretum Innocent. 1. P. Rom. (in Crab, Vol. 1. pag. 453.) Dicit, De conſignandis infantibus manifeſtum eſt non ab alio, quam ab Epiſcopis fieri licere: Nam Presbyteri licet ſint Sacerdotes, Pontificatus tamen apicem non habent, &amp;c. And for how many one Biſhop can do this with all his other work alſo, you may judge.</p>
               <p>XXIII. (To look back,) Concil. Carthag. 2. Can 3. decreeth, [Chriſmatis confectio, &amp; puellarum conſecratio a Presbyteris non fiant: Vel reconciliare quenquam in publica miſſa, Presbytero non licere.] (Crab. pag. 424.) But this being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary publick work, this ſuppoſeth the Biſhop ſtill preſent in every Church to do it, and to have a Church no more numerous than he could do it for: whereas if Diſcipline were but moderately exerciſed according to the ancient Canons, there could not be fewer than many hundreds in a day for the Biſhop either to excommunicate or abſolve in this Dioceſs where I live, Leg. Albaſpin. Not. pag. 268. And the fourth Can. fortifieth this by this exception, Si quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61252:117"/>
in periculo fuerit conſtitutus &amp; ſe reconciliari divinis altaribus petierit, ſi Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopus abſens fuerit, debet utique Presbyter conſulere Epiſcopum, &amp; ſic periclitantem cum praecepto reconciliare. Where note that reconciliari altaribus is the Phraſe for being reconciled to the Churches: And that no Presbyter might do it but in caſe of the perſons danger, the Biſhops abſence, and with the Biſhops Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Which ſtill ſheweth that the Biſhop was uſually preſent. And as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſpineus noteth, a Presbyter might not do it for a dying Man, till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Biſhop, and told him all the caſe, and had his Command: Which ſuppoſeth him near (for the man may be dead before our Miniſters can ride to the Biſhop and have his Commiſſion) and ſuppoſeth the Church to be but ſmall.</p>
               <p>XXIV. To make ſhort, and leave no place for doubting, I will joyn ſeveral Canons which decree that [No Man ſhall be a Clerk to two Churches, nor an Abbot to two Monaſteries, nor a Biſhop to two Cities or Churches.]</p>
               <p>So Concil. Oecumen. Nic. 2. Can. 15. (in Bin. pag. 394.) Clericus ab hoc deinceps tempore, in duabus Eccleſiis non collocetur. Ab ipſa enim domini voce audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus, non poſſe quenquam duobus dominis ſervire.</p>
               <p>And Concil. Chalcedon. Can. 10. juxta Dionyſ. Non licet Clericum conſcribi in duabus ſimul Eccleſiis. And though then the Can. 17. ſheweth that there were Singularum Eccleſiarum Ruſticae Parochiae vel poſſeſſiones, yet theſe were but like our Chappels, and not called Churches, but only the Biſhop's Church. And if the Secular Power made any place a City, it was thereupon to follow the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Order. So of Abbots, Concil. Venet. Can. 8. (in Crab, pag. 948.) no one was to have two Monaſteries; Vid. Concil. Agath. Can. 38.</p>
               <p>And Photius &amp; Balſamon Nomocan. Tit. 1. cap. 20. pag. 21. Ne in una Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincia duo Metropolitani, aut in una Civitate duo Epiſcopi, aut in duabus Civitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus unus Clericus—Neque in duabus Civitatibus quis poteſt eſſe Epiſcopus.] Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only (even then) Epiſcopum Tomenſem: Ille enim reliquarum Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Scythiae curam gerit, (Becauſe the Chriſtians were few, and from under the Roman Power.) [Et Leontopolis Iſauriae ſub Epiſcopo Iſauropolis eſt] He addeth, [Porro 35 Conſt. tit. 3. l. 1. Cod. c. 3. &amp;c. ait, [Eum qui quamcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que veterem aut recens conditam civitatem, proprii Epiſcopatus jure, aliove privilegio privat, tametſi Principis permiſſu id faciat, infamia notat, mulctatque bonis conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio; ac ſimul inceptum irritum facit.] So that no City new or old might be deprived of its Privilege of having a Biſhop. Now ſeeing Corporations and Market Towns are in the old ſenſe Cities, and ſeeing Pariſh Churches ſuch as ours are true Churches (as Communities) how many Cities, and how many hundred Churches have many Biſhops now?

               <p>1. The Roman Clergy called a Council at Rome, Bin. pag. 158. &amp;c. ſaith, that in the Interregnum they had the charge of the Univerſal Church: and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian wrote to them as the Governors of the Church of Rome, when they had been a year or two without a Biſhop. And their Actions were not null.</p>

               <p>3. How came the Carthage Councils to have ſo many hundreds in ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a room or ſpace of Land, but that every <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Corporation or big Town had a Biſhop? Anno 308. at a Carthage Council the very Donatiſts had two hundred and ſeventy Biſhops. And at Arles two hundred Biſhops heard the Donatiſts Cauſe.</p>
               <p>4. The Laodicean Council decreed, Can. 46. that the Baptized ſhould learn the Creed, and on Friday repeat it to the Biſhops or Presbyters:] which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth that a Biſhop was preſent with every Church.</p>
               <p>And Cap. 57. It is ordained that thenceforth [Biſhops ſhould not be ordained in ſmall Villages and Hamlets, but Viſiters ſhould be appointed them: But ſuch (Biſhops) as had heretofore been there ordained ſhould do nothing without the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the City Biſhop.] Which implieth, 1. That every big Town had a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. 2. And Villages before.</p>
               <p>5. Epiphanius, Haer. 68. pag. 717. &amp;c. ſaith, That Peter ſeparated from Meletius in the ſame room, and as Meletius went to the Mines, he made new Biſhops, and gathered new Churches; ſo that in ſeveral Cities there were two (Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Churches:) Which implieth that they were Congregations for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Communion.</p>
               <p>6. The Nicene Council, cap. 8. alloweth Rural Biſhops then in uſe, (whom Petavius proveth to have been true Biſhops.)</p>
               <p>7. Greg. Nazianz. pag. 528. &amp;c. ſheweth how Churches were enlarged and changed when the ſtrife began between Mea &amp; Tua, Antiqua &amp; Nova, Nobilior &amp; Ignobilior, Multitudine Opulentior aut Tenuior.</p>
               <p>8. After Lucifer Calaritanus ordained Paulinus, Antioch had long two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, half being his Flock, and half cleaving to Meletius.</p>
               <p>9. Nazianzen had in the great City of Conſtantinople but one of the ſmall Churches. (the Arians having the greater) till Theodoſius gave him the greater: And thoſe Hearers he was Biſhop over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61252:118"/>10. A Council at Capua ordered that both the Biſhops Flocks in Antioch (under Evagrius and Flavian) ſhould live together in Love and Peace.</p>
               <p>11. Many Cities tolerated Novatian Biſhops and Churches among them, and oft many other Diſſenters. Which ſheweth that but part of the City were one Church.</p>
               <p>12. The Council at Carthage (called the laſt by Binius) decreed that [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of Penitents (as well as Chriſme and conſecrating Virgins) is to be done only by the Biſhops, except in great neceſſity: (For how many Pariſhes can a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop do all this and all the reſt of his Office?) And when Chriſtians were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied they that deſired a Biſhop where was none before, might have one. But elſe aliud Altare is again forbidden to be ſet up.</p>
               <p>13. Another Carthage Council decreeth, Can. 15. That the Biſhop have but vile or cheap Houſhold-ſtuff and a poor Table and Diet, and ſeek Authority or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by his Faith and deſert of Life. Can. 19. That he contend not for tranſitory things though provoked. Can. 23. That he hear no Cauſe but in the preſence of his Presbyters: elſe it ſhall be void that is ſentenced without them, unleſs confirmed by their preſence. (Note, this being a conſtant work required a conſtant preſence: and it is not a ſelected Chapter of Presbyters that is named: And muſt thoſe of many hundred Pariſhes dwell in the City, or travel thither for daily Cauſes of Offenders? &amp;c.) Can. 28, &amp; 30. Biſhops unjuſt Sentence void: and Judgment againſt the abſent.</p>
               <p>14. A Council at Agathum, Can. 3. ſaith, [If Biſhops wrongfully excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate one, any other Biſhop ſhall receive him:] Which implieth that the wronged perſon lived within reach of a Neighbour Biſhop's Pariſh: For it doth not bind him to remove his Dwelling: And leave to go daily twenty or forty Miles to Church is a ſmall kindneſs.</p>
               <p>And I have already cited, Can. 63. If any Citizens on the great Solemnities, Eaſter, the Lord's Nativity or Whitſuntide, ſhall neglect to meet where the Biſhops are (ſeeing they are ſet in the Cities for Benediction and Communion) let them for three Years be deprived of the Communion of the Church.] So that even when Churches were enlarged, yet you ſee how great a part of them met in one place.</p>
               <p>15. Divers Canons give the Biſhop a third or fourth part of all the Church Profits; And if thoſe Churches had been as big as our Dioceſes, it would have been too much of all Conſcience.</p>
               <p>16. A Synod at Carpentoracte decreed, that the Biſhop of the City ſhall not take all the Country Pariſh Maintenance to himſelf: Which implieth as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that his Country Pariſh was ſmall.</p>
               <p>17. A Council at Orleance, Anno 540. decree, Can. 3. about ordaining a Biſhop, that [Qui praeponendus eſt omnibus, ab omnibus eligatur.] The Dioceſes yet were not ſo large, but that All met to chuſe.</p>
               <p>18. So Concil. Byzazen. ſaith, it muſt be [By the Election of all.]</p>
               <p>19. Another at Orleance, Anno 545. ſaith, [No Citizen muſt celebrate Eaſter out of the City, becauſe they muſt keep the principal Feſtivities in the preſence of the Biſhop, where the holy Aſſembly muſt be kept. But if any have a neceſſity to go
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61252:119"/>
abroad, let him ask leave of the Biſhop.] Here is but one City Aſſembly, and Individuals muſt be known to the Biſhop, and ask his leave to go abroad.</p>
               <p>And Can. 5. ſaith, [A Biſhop muſt be ordained in his own Church which he is to overſee.] Which implieth that he had but one Church and Country Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</p>
               <p>20. Another Orleance Council hath the like, depoſing all Biſhops that come not in by common conſent: And requiring them both in their Cities and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories to relieve the Poor from the Church-Houſe.] Let us have ſuch Dioceſes as the Biſhop can do this for, and we conſent.</p>
               <p>21. A Synod at Paris, Can. 8. ſays, [Let no Man be ordained a Biſhop againſt the Will of the Citizens, nor any but whom the Election of the People and Clerks ſhall ſeek with plenary Will: None ſhall be put in by the Command of the Prince.] &amp;c.</p>
               <p>22. King Clodoveus called a Synod at Cabilone, which Can. 10. decreeth, [That all Ordination of Biſhops be null that was otherwiſe made than by the Election of the Comprovincials, the Clerks, and the Citizens.]</p>
               <p>23. The Conſt. Trul. Can. 38. ſheweth how the unhappy changes were made, decreeing, [That whatever alteration the Imperial Power ſhall make on any City, the Eccleſiaſtical Order ſhall follow it.] And ſo if the King will make every Market Town a City, it ſhall have a Biſhop: And if he will make but one or two cities in a Kingdom, there ſhall be but one or two Biſhops: And if he will make one City Regent to others, that Biſhop ſhall be ſo. Thus Rome, Conſtantinople, &amp;c. came by their Superiority. But Hierome telleth us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; that the Biſhop of Tanais, or any ſmall City (like our leaſt Corporations) was of equal Church-Dignity with Rome (or the greateſt.)</p>
               <p>24. The ſame Council, Can. 78. repeateth that, [All the Illuminate (that is, Baptized) muſt learn the Creed, and every Friday ſay it to the Biſhop and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.] I hope they did not go every Friday ſuch a Journey as Lincoln, York, or Norwich Dioceſs, (no nor the leaſt in England) would have put them to; nor that the Biſhop heard as many thouſands every Friday, as ſome of ours by that Canon ſhould have heard.</p>
               <p>25. Anno 693. at a Toletane Council, King Egica writeth a Sermon for them, and therein tells them, that [Every Pariſh that hath twelve Families muſt have their proper Governor (not a Curate that is no Governor.) But if it be leſs, it muſt be part of another's Charge.]</p>
               <p>26. Anno 756. Pipin called a Council in France, whoſe Can. 1. is, that [Every City muſt have a Biſhop.] And (as is beforeſaid) every Corporate Town was a City.</p>
               <p>27. In the Epitome of the old Canons ſent by Pope Adrian to Carolus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, publiſhed by Caniſius, the eighth Antioch Canon is, [Country Presbyters may not give Canonical Epiſtles, but the Chorepiſcopi.] By which it appeareth that the Chorepiſcopi were Biſhops, as Petavius proveth (in Epiphan. Arrius.)</p>
               <p>And Can. 14, 15. That [No Biſhop be above three Weeks in another City, nor above two Weeks from his own Church.] Which intimateth that he had one ſingle Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61252:119"/>And Can. 19. That when a place wants a Biſhop, he that held them muſt not proudly hold them to himſelf, and hinder them from one; elſe he muſt loſe that which he hath.</p>
               <p>28. The ſame Canons ſay (Can. 94.) If a Biſhop, ſix Months after Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Biſhops, neglect to make Catholicks of the people belonging to his Seat, any other ſhall obtain them that ſhall deliver them from their Hereſie.] So that, 1. The Churches were not ſo big but that there might be divers in one Town. 2. And converting the People is a better Title, than Pariſh Bounds.</p>
               <p>29. It is there alſo decreed, [That no Biſhop ordain or judge in another's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: elſe it ſhall be void:] And they forbid [Foreign Judgments, becauſe it is unmeet that he ſhould be judged by Strangers, who ought to have Judges of the ſame Province choſen by himſelf.] But our Dioceſanes are Strangers to almoſt all the People, and are not choſen by them. See the reſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo another is, that every Election of Biſhops made by Magiſtrates be void: yea, all that uſe the Secular Magiſtrate to get a Church muſt be depoſed, and ſeparated, and all that joyn with him: Alſo if any exact Money; or for affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own, drive any from the Miniſtry, or ſegregate any of his Clergy, or ſhut the Temple.</p>
               <p>30. A Council at Chalone under Carol. Magn. the Can. 15. condemneth Arch-Deacons that exerciſe Domination over Pariſh-Presbyters, and take Fees of them: as matter of Tyranny, and not of Order and Rectitude. And Can. 13. ſaith, [It is reported of ſome Brethren (Biſhops) that they force them whom they are about to ordain to ſwear that they are worthy, and will not do contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and will be obedient to the Biſhop that ordaineth them, and to the Church in which they are ordained: Which Oath, becauſe it is very dangerous we all agree ſhall be forbidden.] By which it appeareth that, 1. The Dioceſes were not yet ſo large as to need ſuch ſubordinate Governors as ours have: Nor 2. Were Oaths of Canonical Obedience to the Biſhop and Church yet thought lawful, but forbidden as dangerous.</p>
               <p>31. A Council at Aquiſgrane, under Ludov. Pius, wrote an excellent Treatiſe gathered out of the Fathers, to teach Biſhops the true nature of their Office, which hath much to my preſent uſe, but too long to be recited.</p>
               <p>32. Upon Ebbos Flight that depoſed Lud. Pius, the Arch-Biſhoprick of Rhemes was void ten Years, and ruled by two Presbyters, Fulk and Hotho: who were not then uncapable of governing the Flock: but it is not like that they governed Neighbour Biſhops.</p>
               <p>33. Caniſius tells us of a Concilium Regiaticinum, and Can. 6. is, [That the Arch-Presbyter examine every Maſter of a Family perſonally, and take account of their Families and Lives, and receive their Confeſſions: And Can. 7. That a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter in the abſence of the Biſhop may reconcile a Penitent by his Command, &amp;c.] Which ſhew that yet Dioceſes were not at the largeſt.</p>
               <p>34. A Council at Papia, Anno 855. order yet, [That the Clergy and People chuſe the Biſhops: and yet that the Laity on pretence of their electing power trample not on the Arch-Presbyter, and that Great Men's Chappels empty not Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61252:120"/>35. Yea, Pope Nicholas, Tit. 8. c. 1. decreeth that no Biſhops be ordained but by the Election or Conſent of the Clergy and People.] When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came uncapable of the ancient Order, yet they kept up the words of the old Canons.</p>
               <p>36. This is intimated in the old Canons repeated at a Roman Council, Anno 868. [That if Biſhops excommunicate any wrongfully, or for light Cauſes, and not reſtore them, the Neighbour Biſhops ſhall take ſuch to their Communion till the next Synod:] Which was the Biſhop of the next Pariſh or Corporation, and not one that dwelt in another County out of reach.</p>
               <p>And Can. 72. Becauſe the Biſhops hindred by other buſineſs, cannot go to all the Sick, the Presbyters (or any Chriſtians) may anoint them. How big was the Dioceſs when this Canon was firſt made? Who would give his buſineſs, rather than Diſtance, and Numbers, and Impoſſibility, as the reaſon why the Biſhop of London, Lincoln, Norwich, &amp;c. viſit not all the Sick in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes?</p>
               <p>37. Anno 869, till 879. was held a Council called General at Conſtantinople. The Can. 8. is, [Whereas it is reported that not only the Heretical and Uſurpers, but ſome Orthodox Patriarchs alſo, for their own ſecurity have made men ſubſcribe, (that is, to be true to them) the Synod judgeth that it ſhall be ſo no more; ſave only, that Men when they are made Biſhops be required as uſual to declare the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Faith: He that violateth this Sanction, let him be deprived of his Honour.]</p>
               <p>But theſe later inſtances only ſhew the Relicts of Primitive Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, more evidently proved in the three firſt Centuries.</p>
               <p>38. And he that will read the ancient Records of the Cuſtoms of Burying, will thence perceive the extent of Churches: Doctor Tilleſly (after cited) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth (pag. 179. againſt Selden) that The Right of Burial place did firſt belong to the Cathedral Churches:] And Pariſh Churches began ſo lately (as now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, having no Biſhops, and diſtinct from Cathedrals) that they could not be there buried, before they were built and in Being; which ſaith Selden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in England ſeven hundred years after Chriſt; here one and there one, as a Patron erected it: Selden of Tythes, pag. 267. Yea, in ſeven hundred he findeth but one of Earl Puch in Beda; and in Anno 800. divers appropriate to Crowland; and ſo after. And it was the Character of a Pariſh Church to have Baptiſterium &amp; Sepulturam, (pag. 262.) So that before a Biſhop's Church however called, had but one place that had Baptiſterium &amp; Sepulturam: Yea, long after that Pariſhes, had very few Members in moſt places, ſo long was it e'er the People were brought to Chriſtianity: And they were then, as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops make them now, not proper Churches, but Chappels of Eaſe. Selden, (ibid. pag. 267.) tells you that Ralph Nevil Biſhop of Chicheſter and Chancellor of England requeſted of the King that the Church of Saint Peter in Chicheſter might be pulled down, and laid to another Pariſh, becauſe it was poor, having but two Pariſhioners. Sure it was never built for two Perſons: But it's like many were Heathens: Or if not ſo then, in the Years 700 and 800 they were ſo, (Though Maſter Thomas Jones hath well proved that the Brittiſh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61252:120"/>
Churches were far extended before Gregory ſent Auſtine, and that our Biſhops and Religion are derived from them:) Even at Tours in France in the days of Saint Martin, notwithſtanding all his Miracles, the Chriſtians were not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Heathens, at leaſt till one publick Miracle towards his later time convinced ſome.</p>

               <p>I. EUſebius Demonſtrat. Evangel. pag. 138. ſaith, [When he conſidered the Power of Chriſt's Word, how it perſwaded innumerable Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, and by thoſe Ignoble and Ruſtick Diſciples of Jeſus, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>—in Villages and Countries or Regions and all ſorts of Nations.] By this it appeareth that Villages had Churches then.</p>
               <p>II. Though of later date, conſider the Hiſtory of Patrick's Plantation of Churches in Ireland: who is ſaid himſelf in his own time to have three hundred ſixty five Churches, and as many Biſhops, and three thouſand Presbyters; as Ninius reporteth. Not only Thorndike taketh notice of this, but a better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Uſher de Eccleſ. Brit. Primord. pa. 950. And Selden in his Comment on Eutychius Origines Alex. pag. 86. from Antoninus and Vincentius, thus mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, [Certe tantum in orbe terrarum tunc temporis Epiſcoporum ſegetem mirari forſan deſinet, quiſquis crediderit, quod de B. Patricio Hibernenſi Antoninus &amp; Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius tradunt; Eum ſcilicet ſolum Eccleſias fundaſſe 365. totidemque Epiſcopos ordinaſſe, praeter Presbyterorum 3000. Qua de re conſulas plura apud praeſtantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum virum Jacobum Uſſerium, &amp;c.] So that here was to every Church a Biſhop and near ten Presbyters. (No Man will doubt but the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were taken out of the better ſort of the Laity, and the Presbyters of the ſecond ſort; and all below many private Chriſtians now among us.) And were there three hundred ſixty five Cities think you in Ireland? Yea, or Corporations either? It's eaſie to conjecture what Churches theſe were.</p>
               <p>III. All Hiſtory, Fathers, and Councils conſent, that every City was to have a Biſhop and Presbytery to govern and teach the Chriſtians of that City and the Country people near it; which is but a Pariſh or Presbyterian Church. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> ſignified. Therefore even by this Rule we ſhould have a Biſhop to every ſuch Town.</p>
               <p>1. Crete was called Hecatompolis, as having an hundred Cities, as Homer ſaith it had. And what kind of Cities were thoſe? Which were to have an hundred Churches and Biſhops (in a ſmall Iſland?)</p>
               <p>2. Theocritus Idyl. 13. de laudibus Ptolem. verſ. 82. ſaith, that he had under his Government thirty three thouſand three hundred and thirty <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>IV. Sozomen, lib. 5. cap. 3. tells us, that Majuma which was Navale Gazae, being as part of its Suburbs, or the adjoyning part but twenty Stadia diſtant, was, becauſe it had many Chriſtians, honoured by Conſtantine with the name of a City, and had a Biſhop of their own. And Julian in malice took from them the honour of being a City, but they kept their Biſhop for all that. It had the ſame Magiſtrate with Gaza, and the ſame Military Governors, and the ſame Republick; but was diverſified only by their Church-State. For, ſaith he, each had their own Biſhop, and their own Clergy, and the Altars belonging to each Biſhoprick were diſtinct: And therefore afterward the Biſhop of Gaza laboured to ſubject the Clergy of Majuma to himſelf, ſaying, that it was unmeet that one City ſhould have two Biſhops: But a Council called for that purpoſe, did confirm the Church-Right of Majuma.</p>
               <p>V. Gregory Neocaeſarienſis called Thaumaturgus, was by force made Biſhop of that City, where all the Chriſtians were but ſeventeen at his Ordination: ſuch was the Biſhop's Church. And when he had preached and done Miracles there till his Perſecution, there is no mention of any Presbyter he had with him; but of his Deacon Muſonius that fled with him. (Though when he died he left but ſeventeen unconverted.)</p>
               <p>And when he had converted ſome at Comana, a ſmall Town near him,<note place="margin">A Village, ſaith Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. l. 5. c. 16. Vid.

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61252:121"/>VI. Concil. Nic. Oecum. 1. Can. 13. decreeth that every one that before death deſireth the Sacrament, was to have it from the Biſhop: One Ed. in Crab ſaith, Generaliter omni cuilibet in exitu poſito, &amp; poſcenti ſibi Communionis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam tribui, Epiſcopus probabiliter ex oblatione dare debebit. The other Ed. ſaith, [Et cura &amp; probatio ſit Epiſcopi.] We are content that the Dioceſs be as great as the Biſhop will perform this for, to examine all ſuch dying men, and give them the Sacrament, or ſend it them after his diſtinct Examination.</p>
               <p>VII. Gregor. Nazianz. Epiſt. 22. pag. 786. To. 1. perſwading the Church of Caeſarea to chuſe Baſil for their Biſhop, ſendeth his Letters to the Presbyters, the Monks, the Magiſtrates, and the whole Laity.] And though I doubt not but by that time there were Country Congregations, by this the magnitude of the City Church may be gathered, where the whole Laity could be conſulted, and could chuſe.</p>
               <p>And Baſil made this Gregory his chief friend Biſhop of Saſimis, a ſmall poor dirty Town: And yet Gregory himſelf it ſeems had in ſome near Village a Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repiſcopus with Presbyters and Deacons; as in Glycerius his Caſe appeareth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Greg. 205. pag. 900, 901.</p>
               <p>And Nazianzum where he plaid the Biſhop under his Father (two Biſhops at once, one in Title, the other in Practice without Title) was but a ſmall Town.</p>
               <p>VIII. Baſil an Arch-Biſhop was ſo much againſt enlarging Dioceſes, and taking in many Churches to one Biſhop, that he taketh the advantage of the difference between him and Anthymius to make many Biſhops more in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs over ſmall places: yea, it ſeemeth ſome places were ſo ſmall as that they never before had any Paſtors at all: as appeareth by Gregory Nazianzene, Epiſt. 28.</p>
               <p>IX. Theodoret tells us, lib. 4. cap. 20. Hiſt. Eccleſ. that even in the great Alexandria the Presbyters and Deacons were all but nineteen when Lucius came to baniſh them to Heliopolis, a City of Phoenicia; which City had not one Chriſtian in it. By which it appeareth, that even then under Chriſtian Emperors, Chriſtianity was not received by the multitude, when ſome Cities had not a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>X. Theodor. ib. l. 4. c. 16. ſaith, that when Eulogius and Protogenes, the Presbyters of Edeſſa, were baniſhed to Antionone in Thebais, they found the moſt of the people Heathens, and but few of the Church; yet had that little number a Biſhop of their own.</p>
               <p>XI. Id. l. 4. c. 20. In Peter Biſhop of Alexandria's Epiſtle (wherein he ſheweth ſuch actions then done by the Soldiers in ſcorn of the Godly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Turpitude not to be named under the name of ſcornful Preaching, as

               <p>XV. Euſeb. Eccleſ.

               <p>XVII. When Conſtans the Emperor affrighted Conſtantius to reſtore Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Conſtantius craved of Athanaſius that the Arrians in Alexandria might have one Church to themſelves: Athanaſius told him, It was in his power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and execute; but craved alſo a requeſt of him, which was that in all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there might alſo be one Church granted for them that communicated not with the Arrians: But the Eaſtern Arrian Biſhops hearing that, put off the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of both the Requeſts.] By which a willing perſon may conjecture at the quantity of the Epiſcopal Churches in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Even in Ambroſe's days the great Church of Milan was no greater than could meet in one Temple to chuſe a Biſhop: And Ambroſe was choſen by them. Socrat. l. 4. c. 25.</p>
               <p>And Baronius, in Vita Ambroſii ex Paulino, ſaith, (pag. 9.) [Quod ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus erat circa Baptizandos ſolus implere, quinque poſtea Epiſcopi tempore quo deceſſit vix implerent.] What then was all the reſt of his work? and how many Churches could he thus overſee?</p>
               <p>And the Arrians, for whom the Emperor made all that ſtir with Ambroſe, were ſo few in Milan, that when the Emperor would have had one Church for them, and could not get it by fair means or force, Ambroſe thus jeſteth at the Empreſs and the Arrian Gothes; Quibus ut olim plauſtrum ſedes erat, it a nunc plauſtrum Eccleſia eſt; Quocunque foemina illa proceſſerit, ſecum ſuos omnes coetus vehit.] Her Coach is their Church; and which way ſoever ſhe goeth, ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth all her Congregations with her.</p>
               <p>Ambroſ. de Offic. To. 4. c. 1. ſheweth that teaching his Church is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Office: And de initiandis, c. 2. p. 163. To. 4. he ſaith to the baptized perſon, [Vidiſti illic (in Sacrario) Levitam, vidiſti Sacerdotem, vidiſti ſummum Sacerdotem] In which he intimateth that the Biſhop (as the Chief Prieſt) was preſent in the Church with his Presbyters at Baptizings. Which ſheweth that they had not a multitude of Churches without Biſhops. And de Sacram. l. 1. c. 1. how the Biſhop himſelf muſt touch with Oyl the Noſtrils of all that were baptized, with other Ceremonies after mentioned, ſheweth that he was uſually preſent at every Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And de Sacram. l. 3. c. 1. he giveth the reaſon why he did waſh the Feet of all that were baptized, and the Church of Rome did not, Vide ne forte propter multitudinem declinarit.] [Perhaps they decline it becauſe of the multitude.] But all the Dioceſs of Milan (as a Biſhoprick, not as an Arch-Biſhoprick) had no ſuch multitudes, but that beſides all his other work, Ambroſe could have time to waſh the feet of every one that was baptized.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61252:123"/>And cap. 3. Eccleſiae contuitu &amp; conſideratione te ipſe commenda—The Church was preſent then. And to ſhew by his work what his Church was, he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Sacrament daily: Accipe quotidie quod quotidie tibi proſit: ſic vive ut quotidie merearis accipere: Qui non meretur quotidie accipere, non meretur poſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num accipere.</p>
               <p>And how he diſcharged all this you may perceive, de Dignit. Sacerdot. cap. 3. Epiſcopus non aliud niſi Epiſcopalia opera deſignat, ut ex bono opere magis quam profeſſione noſcatur, plus meritis eſſe Epiſcopum quam quod nomine vocitetur. Quia ſicut nihil eſſe diximus Epiſcopo excellentius, ſic nihil eſt miſerabilius ſi de ſancta vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Epiſcopus periclitetur; ſi Sacerdos in crimine teneatur. (He thought not as too many now do, that the Name and Seat of Biſhop or Prieſt can do more to hallow Perſecutions, Worldlineſs and other Crimes, than the Crimes can do to unhallow the Biſhop or Prieſt.)</p>
               <p>And lib. 5. To. 4. pag. 180. having mentioned [The Husband of one Wife,] he addeth, [Si vero ad altiorem ſenſum conſcendimus, inhibet, duas uſurpare Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſias.] A Biſhop muſt no more have two Churches than a Husband have two Wives. But ſome Biſhops imitate Solomon's Luſt rather than his Wiſdom, and will have above a thouſand Churches, as Wives or Concubines.</p>
               <p>Adding, Qui ſtipendiis tantum contentus Eccleſiae ſuae, penitus non ambiat quae novit eſſe ſuperflua. Covetouſneſs hath enlarged Dioceſes.</p>
               <p>And cap. 5. Cum dominatur populis, &amp; anima ſervit Daemoni. When he Lords it over the people, his own Soul is a Slave to the Devil.</p>
               <p>And cap. 6. pag. 18. Nam quid aliud interpretatur Epiſcopus niſi ſuperinſpector? Maxime cum ſolio editiore in Eccleſia reſideat ut ita cunctos reſpiciat, ut &amp; cuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum oculi in ipſum reſpiciant.] So that it is from the overſight of one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation where he ſits among and above the Presbyters, that he is called a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and not from Churches which he overſeeth indeed, but ſeeth not, and might well be ſaid to be an Overſeer in our vulgar ſenſe, as it ſignifies one that overlooketh or obſerveth not, were he, as many now.</p>
               <p>And of ſo ſmall a place as Forum Cornelii, inſtead of committing it to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Presbyter, he ſaith, (Epiſt. 63. p. 111. ad Conſtant.

               <p>And pag. 117. Ad Eccleſ.

               <p>Tom. 3. p. 89. He ſo far acknowledgeth the People to have elected him, that he calleth them on that account his Parents, who in other reſpects were his Children, (in Luk. 18.) Vos mihi eſtis Parentes, qui Sacerdotium tuliſtis: Vos inquam Filii, vel Parentes: Filii ſinguli, Univerſi Parentes. (Like Hooker's Singulis Major, Univerſis Minor.) Where you ſee, that the whole Church (and not a thouſandth part) did chuſe him Biſhop.</p>
               <p>And To. 3. p. 180. in 1 Cor. 14. Verum eſt, quia in Eccleſia (that is in every Church) Unus eſt Epiſcopus (not in hundreds of Churches.) For he ſaith, ibid. in 1 Cor. 12.

               <p>When I cite all this of the ſtate of that famous Church of Milan; where the Emperor himſelf did oft reſide, and which preſumed to differ in Cuſtoms from Rome, I leave you to gather how it was before Chriſtian Emperors, and in all the ordinary Churches.</p>
               <p>XIX. Auguſtine was choſen by the people, and brought to the Biſhop to be ordained. Vit. cap. 4. And cap. 5. Valerius the Biſhop gave him power to preach before him contrary to the uſe of the African Churches, but according to the cuſtom of the Eaſtern Churches.] Which ſheweth that Auguſtine while Presbyter (and ſo other Presbyters ordinarily) was in the ſame Congregation with the Biſhop, and not in another. And upon this other Churches took up the ſame cuſtom.</p>
               <p>And cap. 21. it's ſaid, [In Ordinandis Sacerdotibus &amp; Clericis Conſenſum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorem Chriſtianorum, &amp; conſuetudinem Eccleſiae ſequendam eſſe arbitrabatur:—And cap. 25. Cum ipſo ſemper Clerici una etiam domo &amp; menſa, ſumptibuſque communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus alebantur, &amp; veſtiebantur. Yea, he ordered juſt how many Cups in a day his Clergy-men with him ſhould drink; and if any ſware an Oath he loſt one of his Cups. (Through God's Mercy ſober Godly Miniſters now need no ſuch Law.) By this it evidently appeareth that the Church which he and his Presbyters ruled, was not many hundred, but one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Congregation, or City-Church: There being no mention of any Country Presbyters that he had elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as far as I remember.</p>
               <p>And when Auguſtine was dying, the People with one conſent, accepted of his choice of Eradius to be his Succeſſor; Epiſt. 110. pag. 195. To recite all that is in Auſtin's Works intimating theſe Church-limits, would be tedious.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61252:124"/>XX Epiphanius's Teſtimony I have before mentioned, as produced by Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, that there were few Cities, if any beſides Alexandria in thoſe Countries that had more than one Congregation; and particularly none of his own.

               <p>XXI. Socrates, l. 5. c. 21. ſaith, [The Church of Antioch in Syria is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate contrary to other Churches: for the Altar ſtands not to the Eaſt, but to the Weſt.] Which Speech implieth that (beſides Chappels if any) there was but one Church that was notable in Antioch; while he calleth it [The Church at Antioch,] without diſtinction from any other there.</p>
               <p>XXII. Socrates, l. 7. c. 3. tells us a notable ſtory of Theodoſius Biſhop of Synada, who went to Conſtantinople for Power to perſecute Agapetus the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian Biſhop in that City. But while he was abſent Agapetus turned Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and his Church and the Orthodox Church joyned together, and made Agapetus Biſhop, and excluded Theodoſius: who made his Complaint of it to Atticus the Patriarch of Conſtantinople (a wiſe and peaceable Man) who deſired Theodoſius to live quietly in private, becauſe it was for the Churches good.] (May ſuch cauſes oft have ſuch deciſions, and Lordly troubleſome Prelates ſuch ſucceſs.) By which ſtory you may gueſs how many Congregations both Parties made in Synada.</p>
               <p>XXIII. Socrates, l. 7. c. 26. tells us that Siſinnius was choſen Biſhop of Conſtantinople by the Laity againſt the Clergy. And cap. 28. Siſinnius ſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus to be Biſhop of Cyzi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>XXIV. Sozomen's Teſtimony (even ſo late) is very obſervable; lib. 7. cap. 15. who mentioning the differences of the Eaſt and Weſt about Eaſter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring that the Churches ſhould not break Communion for ſuch Cuſtoms, ſaith, [Frivolum enim &amp; merito quidem judicarunt, conſuetudinis gratia a ſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ſegregari eos qui in praecipuis Religionis capitibus conſentirent: Neque enim eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem traditiones per omnia ſimiles in omnibus Eccleſiis quamvis inter ſe conſentientes, reperire poſſes.] And he inſtanceth in this, [Etenim per Scythiam cum ſint Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates multae, unum d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Villages had Biſhops. To theſe he addeth the Novatians and the Phrygian Montaniſts. And let none think their inſtances inconſiderable. For the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts were for high Prelacy, even for Patriarchs, as in Tertullian appeareth. And the Novatians were for Biſhops, and had many very Godly Biſhops, and were tolerated by the Emperors even in Conſtantinople, as good People and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in the Faith: And Novatus was martyred in Valerian's Perſecution, as Socrates, l. 4. c. 23. ſaith.</p>
               <p>XXV.

Audire (Epiſcopum) attentius oportet &amp; ab ipſo ſuſcipere doctrinam fidei; Monita autem vitae a Presbyteris inquire, a Diaconis vero ordinem Diſciplinae: By which Partition of Offices it is evident, that the Biſhop only and not the Presbyters then uſed to preach to the Church, and that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters (though ejuſdem ordinis, and not Lay-Elders) uſed to inſtruct the People perſonally, and give them Monita vitae: and that they were all in one Church together, and not in ſeveral diſtant Churches.</p>

               <p>XXVII. Gennadius de viris illuſtr. l. 1. c. 10. ſaith, that Aſclepius was Vici non grandis Epiſcopus, Biſhop of a Village not great.</p>

               <p>XXX. Theoph. Alexand. Epiſt. Paſch. 3. in Bibl. Pat. To. 3. concludeth thus, [Pro defunctis Epiſcopis in locis ſingulorum conſtituti. In urbe Nichio pro Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pempto

And the nearneſs and ſmallneſs of ſome of theſe ſheweth the Dioceſes ſmall.</p>
               <p>The ſame Theoph. Alex. ſaith, Epiſt. Canon. Can. 6. [De iis qui ordinandi ſunt haec erit forma, ut quicquid eſt Sacerdotalis ordinis conſentiat &amp; eligat, &amp; tunc Epiſcopus examinet, vel ei etiam aſſentiente Sacerdotali ordine in media Eccleſia ordinet praeſente populo, &amp; Epiſcopo alloquente, an etiam poſſet ei populus ferre teſtimonium: Ordinatio autem non fiat clanculum: Eccleſia enim pacem habente decet praeſentibus ſanctis ordinationes fieri in Eccleſia.] Undoubtedly, as Balſamon, noteth by [Saints] is meant fideles, the People. Here then you ſee that the Churches then were ſuch where all the Clergy were preſent with the Biſhop, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters to a ſingle Church where all the people could be preſent to be conſulted.</p>

One Plebs was one Congregation; and had its proper Cathedram.</p>
               <p>XXXII. Sozomen (after Socrates) mentioning the diverſity of Church Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms (as aforeſaid) l. 7. c. 19. ſaith, that at Alexandria the Arch-Deacon only readeth the Holy Scriptures, in other places only the Deacons, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches only the Prieſts, and on ſolemn days the Biſhops.] By which words it appeareth that then every Church was ſuppoſed to have a Biſhop, Prieſts and Deacons preſent in their publick Worſhip. For the Biſhop on his ſolemn days could not be reading in many Churches (much leſs many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) at once.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. Hiſtor. Tripartit. l. 1. c. 19. (out of Sozomen, l. 1. c. 14. Edit. Lat. Baſil. p. 1587.) telleth us, how Arius ſeeketh (as from the Bithynian Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod) to Paulinus of Tyre, Euſeb. Caeſar. &amp; Patroph. Scythopol. ut una cum ſuis juberetur cum populo qui cum eo erat, ſolennia Sacramenta Eccleſiae celebrare,—Eſſe dicens conſuetudinem in Alexandria (ſicut etiam nunc) ut uno exiſtente ſuper omnes Epiſcopo, Presbyteri ſcorſim Eccleſias obtinerent, &amp; populus in eis C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

And yet note that here is even at Alexandria no mention of many Churches in the Countries at a diſtance, much
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61252:125"/>
leſs hundreds, thus gathered, but only of ſome few in that great City. And if even in a great City, and in Epiphan. and in Sozomen's days a Presbyter's Church was an Alexandrian Rarity, what need we more Hiſtorical Evidence of the Caſe of the Churches in thoſe times?</p>
               <p>XXXIV. Ferrandus Diaconus, in Epiſt. de 5. Quaeſt. ſaith to Fulgentius, [Sanctos Presbyteros, Diaconos, beatamque Congregationem (which was his Church) ſaluto.]</p>
               <p>And that you may again ſee what Congregation or Church that was, In vita Fulgentii, cap. 17. pag. 8. it is ſaid, that the Plebs ſought and choſe him (and that in deſpight of Foelix the ambitious Deacon, who ſought the place, and ſought the life of Fulgentius.) Populus ſuper ſuam Cathedram eum collocavit: Celebrata ſunt eodem die Divina ſolenniter Sacramenta, &amp; de manibus Fulgentii Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans omnis populus laetus diſceſſit.] And if in the noble City of Ruſpe, ſo late as the days of Fulgentius, the Biſhop's Church-members were no more than could chuſe him, ſet him on his ſeat, and all communicate that day at his hands, it is eaſie by this to judge of moſt other Churches.</p>

And were this Canon obeyed, all the people muſt ſeparate from all the Biſhops of England, as here all are commanded to do from all thoſe Biſhops that do but receive one that is put in by the King, and not by the free choice of all the Clergy and People of his Church.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61252:126"/>
not have little Congregations to have a Biſhop, to whom one Presbyter is enough; and no wonder at that time, that this great Biſhop of Rome, (the firſt that notably contended for their undue Supremacy in the Empire) was of that mind; who alſo Epiſt. 88. ſaith of the Chorepiſcopi, (Qui juxta Can. Neocaeſar. ſive ſecundum aliorum decreta patrum iidem ſunt qui &amp; Presbyteri.) The falſehood of which being too plain, Petavius in Epiphan. ad Haereſ. 74. p. 278. judgeth that theſe words being in a Parentheſis are irreptitious.) And ibid. Epiſt. 88. he ſaith that by the Can. all theſe things following are forbidden the Chorepiſc. and Presbyter, [Presbyterorum, Diaconorum, aut Virginum conſecratio, ſicut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio Altaris, ac benedictio vel unctio: Siquidem nec erigere eis Altaria, nec Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias vel Altaria conſecrare licet, nec per impoſitiones manuum fidelibus baptizandis vel converſis ex haereſi Paracletum Spiritum Sanctum tradere, nec Chriſma conficere, nec Chriſmate Baptizatorum frontes ſignare, nec publice quidem in Miſſa quemquam poenitentem reconciliare, nec form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it's worth the noting what kind of works they be that the Biſhop's Office is maintained for.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. From the great Church of Rome (at its firſt Tide time) let us look to the great Church of Conſtantinople; even in the days of a better Biſhop, Chryſoſtom: Beſides that they had long but one Temple, (of which anon) Chryſoſtom ſaith in 1 Theſ. 5. 12.

Sacerdos in hoc ſuum contulit negotium: Nulla eſt ei alia vita quam ut verſetur in Eccleſia—Qui Chriſtum diligit, cujuſmodicunque ſit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos eum diliget, quod per eum ſit veneranda aſſecutus Sacramenta; (And Doctor Hammond ſaith, this Text ſpeaketh only of Biſhops, 1 Theſ. 5. 12.) Et ibid. [Pro te precatur, &amp; dono quod per Baptiſmum datur tibi inſervit, viſitat, hortatur &amp; monet, &amp; media nocte ſi vocaveris venit.] And how many Pariſhes can a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop thus ſerve? And how many ſcore miles will they ſend and he go to viſit the Sick at midnight?</p>
               <p>And Chryſoſt. in 1 Cor. 14. p. 653. ſaith, Conveniebant olim, omnes pſallebant communiter.

Tunc etiam domus erant Eccleſiae (though called Conventicles:) Nunc autem Eccleſia eſt domus, vel potius quavis domo deterior. When Churches grew to be Dioceſes they grew worſe than when they were in houſes: But he that here is ſaid prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe Eccleſiae is he alſo that pronounceth Peace to them.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. Gregory Nyſſen. ſpeaking of the gathering of true Churches by preaching, ſaith (in Eccleſiaſt. Hom. 1. p. (mihi) 93.) [He is the true Preacher,

               <p>XXXIX. He that readeth impartially Beda's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ſhall find that in England between ſix and ſeven hundred years after Chriſt they were but ſingle Churches that had Biſhops: For indeed the famouſeſt and holieſt of them in the Kingdom of Northumberland, were but Scots Presbyters, and ſuch as were ſent by them without any Epiſcopal Ordination; (Aidan, Finan, &amp;c.) And though they did Apoſtolically preach in many places to convert the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Inhabitants, yet their Churches of Chriſtians were ſmall: yet preſently the Roman Grandeur and Ceremoniouſneſs here prevailed, and ſo by degrees did their Church-form. Yet ſaith Cambden, Brit. ed. Frank. p. 100. When the Biſhops at Rome had aſſigned ſeveral particular Churches to ſeveral Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and had divided Pariſhes to them, Honorius Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury about the Year 636. firſt begun to diſtribute England into Pariſhes, as is read in the Canterbury Hiſtory.] But it's plain in Beda, if he did then begin it, he went but a little way with that diviſion.</p>
               <p>The ſame Cambden alſo tells us, that the Biſhoprick of York devoured ſeven Biſhopricks, and the Biſhoprick of Lincoln more, &amp;c. Some Seats were but removed, but many Biſhopricks were diſſolved and turned into one, which yet were erected when Chriſtians were fewer, ſaith Iſaackſon Chronolog. There was one at Wilton, the See at Ramesbury, one at Crediton, one at St. Patrick's at Bodmin in Cornwall, and after at St. Germains, one at Selſey Iſland, one at Dunwich, one at Helmham, and after at Thetford, one at Sidnaceſter or Lindis, one at Oſney, one at Hexham, &amp;c. And at this day Landaff, St. Aſaph's, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, St. David's are no Cities, where we have Biſhops Seats, as notices of the old way.</p>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61252:127"/>XLI. I conclude this with the words of Euſebius with the Collection of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirius Maſſonus, a Writer of the Popes Lives. [Fabianus ab iis electus eſt ad Epiſcopatum urbis: Ac forte evenit ut in locum ubi convenerant Columba, e ſublimi volans capiti ejus inſideret, Id pro foelici ſigno accipientes magno conſenſu &amp; alacritate animorum ipſum elegerunt: Haec Euſebius, Hiſt. l. 6.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> More Proofs of the aforeſaid Limits of Churches.</head>
               <p>THe thing that we are proving is that every Biſhop ſhould have but one Church (ſuppoſing him to be no Arch-Biſhop) and that this Church ſhould be ſuch and ſo great only as that there may be perſonal Communion in publick Worſhip and holy Converſation between the Members: and not ſo great as that the Members have only a Heart-Communion, and by Delegates or Synods of Officers.</p>
               <p>As to our Hiſtorical Evidence of the matter of fact, it runs thus: 1. That in the firſt ſtate of the Churches, it cannot be proved that any one Church in all the World conſiſted of more ſtated Communicating Aſſemblies than one, or of more Chriſtians than our Pariſhes. But though through Perſecution they might be forced (as an Independant Church now may do) to meet by parcels in ſeveral Houſes ſometimes in a danger, yet their ordinary Meetings when they were free was all together in one place: And Unum Altare was the note of their Individuation, with Unus Epiſcopus, when Biſhops grew in faſhion in the eminent ſenſe.</p>
               <p>2. That the firſt that broke this Order and had divers Aſſemblies and Altars under one Biſhop were Alexandria and Rome, and no other Church can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have done ſo, for about three hundred Years after Chriſt or near; nor moſt Churches till four hundred, yea five hundred Years after.</p>
               <p>3. That when they departed from this Church temperament, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe degrees. 1. They ſet up ſome Oratories, or Chappels (as are in our Pariſhes) which had only Prayers and Teachings without an Altar, Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Sacraments in the City, Suburbs or Country Villages near, the People coming for Sacramental Communion to the Biſhop's Church. 2. Afterward
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61252:127"/>
theſe Chappels were turned into Communicating Churches: But ſo as that at firſt the Biſhop's Presbyters (who lived ſometimes in the ſame Houſe with him, and always near him in the ſame City, and were his Colleagues) did preach and officiate to them indifferently, that is, he whom the Biſhop ſent; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a particular Presbyter was aſſigned to teach a particular Congregation; yet ſo, as that more of the Biſhop's Presbyters commonly had no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, but the moſt of them ſtill attended the Biſhop in his Church, and ſate with him on each hand in a high raiſed Seat, and whilſt he did uſually preach and adminiſter the Sacrament, they did but attend him and do nothing, or but ſome by aſſiſting Acts: as Lay-Elders do in the Presbyterian Churches; principally employed in perſonal overſight, and in joyning in Government with the Biſhop. And thoſe ſame Presbyters who had Congregations, joyned with the reſt in their Weekly Work, and made up the Conſeſſus or College of Presbyters. 3. And next that (and in ſome places at the ſame time) Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Congregations were gathered in the Country Villages, ſo far off the City, as that it was found meet to leave a Presbyter Reſident among them; but under the Government of the City Biſhop and Presbytery, of whom he was one when he came among them. And all this while the Churches were but like our greater Pariſhes which have divers Chappels, where there is liberty of Communicating. 4. After this when the Countries were more converted, there were more Country Pariſh-Congregations ſet up; till they attained the form of a Presbyterian Church, differing only in the Biſhop; that is, a certain number of the Neighbour Country Pariſhes in one Conſiſtory (but with a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) did govern all theſe Pariſhes as one Church; that is, It was many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Churches (as ſis, eight, or ten, or twelve,) joyning to make up one governed Church. But at the ſame time many Paſtors and People being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Church-form which they had before been under, and of their own neceſſity and privileges, did require the ſame Order among themſelves as was in City Churches, and ſo had their proper Biſhops, who were called Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repiſcopi, or Country Biſhops. But theſe Country-Biſhops living among the poorer and ſmaller number of Chriſtians, had not ſo many Presbyters to attend them as the City-Biſhops had: So that ſome Country Congregations had Biſhops and ſome had none. And the Churches being chiefly governed by the Synods, who met for obliging Concord, to avoid Diviſions, theſe Synods being made up of the City-Biſhops at firſt, they there carried it by Vote to make all the Country-Biſhops under them, and reſponſible to them: Which they the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the eaſilier conſented to, becauſe many obſcure and unworthy Fellows did inſinuate into the eſteem of the Country-Chriſtians, who had no Biſhops near them to adviſe them better; and ſo became the Corrupters of Doctrine, and the Maſters of Sects and Hereſies.</p>
               <p>By this time one part of the Country Churches had Biſhops of their own, and the other had none, but only Presbyters under the City-Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. But yet it was but few Neighbour-Pariſhes, like our Market-Towns and the Villages between them that were thus under the City-Biſhop. For every ſuch Town was then called a City in the larger ſenſe as it ſignifieth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61252:128"/>
Oppidum, and moſt ſuch Towns had City-privileges too, which was no more than to be Corporations, and not to have a Nominal Eminency, as now ſome ſmall places have above greater (as Bath rather than Plimouth, Ipſwich, Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>Next to this, the Emperors being Chriſtians, and deſiring without force to draw all the People from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, they thought it the beſt way to advance the Chriſtians in worldly reſpects, which ever win on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon minds. And ſo they endued the Churches and Biſhops with ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Powers heretofore deſcribed as were like to the Honour and Power of the Civil Governors in their kind. And the Biſhops being thus lifted up, did firſt enlarge their own Dioceſes as far as they could, and advance their Power; and the World came unchanged into the Church, both in Cities and Villages, (where the Chriſtians were before ſo few, that many think the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were called Pagani in diſtinction from the Citizens, who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.) And then the Biſhops put down the Chorepiſcopi, as preſuming too much to imitate their Power: And next to that, leſt every Corporation or Market-Town having a Biſhop, their Dioceſes ſhould not be great enough, and ne vileſceret nomen Epiſcopi, leſt a Biſhop's Name ſhould not be honoured enough, but become cheap by reaſon of the number, and of the ſmallneſs of his Church, they firſt ordered that no ſuch ſmall Cities or other places as had People enough for but one Presbyter, ſhould have a Biſhop; and afterward by degrees put down many ſmaller Biſhops Churches, and joyned them to their own: And ſo proceeded, by the advantage of Civil Alterations on Cities Names and Privileges, to bring themſelves to the ſtate that they are in, wherein one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop infimi ordinis (that is no Arch-Biſhop) hath many hundred or above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Churches and multitudes of Cities, called now but Corporations, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs or Market-Towns.</p>
               <p>I have repeated ſo much of the Hiſtory, leſt the Reader forget what it is that I am proving; and that he may note, that if I prove now that in later Ages they kept but the Veſtigia, or Reliques of the former to prove how it was before their times, and if I prove but a Church of Presbyterian Magnitude to have ſo long continued, it ſufficeth againſt that which we now call a Dioceſs: And that we do not play with Names, nor by a Dioceſane Church, mean the ſame thing with a Parochial or Presbyterian; but we mean ſuch as our Dioceſes now are, where a Biſhop alone with a Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Court, or with ſome ſmall help of an Arch-Deacon, Surrogate, or Dean and Chapter, without all the Pariſh-Miniſters beſides, doth rule a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of diſtant Congregations, who have no proper Biſhop under him. And now I proceed.</p>
               <p>I. The Chorepiſcopi which were at firſt placed in Country Churches where were many Chriſtians, do ſhew what extent the Churches were then of: That theſe were really Biſhops at firſt (whatever the aforeſaid Parentheſis in Leo or Damaſus ſay) moſt Writers for Epiſcopacy, Papiſts and Proteſtants do now grant; and therefore I may ſpare the labour of proving it: And whereas it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61252:128"/>
ſaid that they were but the Biſhop's Deputies: I anſwer, even as Biſhops are<note place="margin">Vid. Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, <hi>in Epip. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. 69. p. 276, 277, 278, &amp;c.</hi> The chief Champion of Prelacy ſtrongly proveth that the <hi>Chorepiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi</hi> were true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> the Arch-Biſhops Deputies; that is, they were under them, but were really Biſhops themſelves: For if a Biſhop may depute one that is no Biſhop to be his Deputy, either a Presbyter alſo may depute one that is no Presbyter to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, or not. If yea, then Lay-men ſhall come in and all be levelled, (For a Deacon alſo may depute his Office.) If not, then either a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop cannot do it, or elſe the Presbyter's Office is much holier than the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's.</p>
               <p>And that theſe Chorepiſcopi Country-Biſhops were not ſuch Rarities as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate my Proof, but very common, beſides what is before ſaid, is evident by the Subſcriptions of many Councils, where great ſtore of Chorepiſcopi are found. And beſides the names in our common Collections of the Councils, how it was in the Egyptian and Neighbour Churches at leaſt (if not how it was at Nice) you may ſee in the Arabick Subſcriptions publiſhed by Selden in his Comment on Eutych. Orig. Alex. pag. 93, 94, 95, &amp;c. Num. 29, 31, 55, 64, 68, 119, 122, 128, 131, 179, 193, 215, 237, 241, 278. There are ſeventeen named. And the Canons made to curb and ſuppreſs them, ſhew that they were ordinary before; as, Concil. Laodic. Can. 57. But they ſhould rather have increaſed them, that Biſhops might have multiplied as Churches or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians increaſed, which was decreed here in England in the cap. 9. of the Council at Hertford, per Theodor. Cantuar. referente Beda, lib. 4. Hiſt. Eccleſ. cap. 5.</p>
               <p>II. The very name Eccleſia which was firſt uſed before Parochi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or Dioeceſis, and ſtill continued to this day, doth ſhew what the form of a Church then was, eſpecially if you withal conſider, that the name was communicated to the Temples or ſacred Meeting-Places, which are alſo ordinarily called Eccleſiae; which no Man doubteth was in a ſecondary ſenſe, as derived from the People, who were the Eccleſia in the primary ſenſe. And ſo even in our Tongue, the word Church is uſed for both to this day, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is in many other Languages. Now it is certain that a part, eſpecially a ſmall part, (a hundredth or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part) of the Church is not the Church (unleſs equivocally.) Why then ſhould the Temple be ſo called from the Church, when no Church at all, but a Particle only of a Church doth meet there? (For that the word Church] in our Queſtion is not taken for any Community or Company of Chriſtians, but for a governed Society conſiſting of the governing and governed part, I have before ſhewed.) But, 1. A Church in its firſt and proper Notion being Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Evecatus, An Aſſembly, or Convention or Congregation; (as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Univerſal Church, which is ſo called becauſe it is called out of the World to Chriſt the Head, and with him ſhall make one glorious Society,) how are thoſe twenty or an hundred Miles off, any more a part of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly where I live, than thoſe at the Antipodes may be? If you fly to one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, I anſwer; 1. So the Pope claimeth a Government at the Antipodes. 2. A Governor of many Aſſemblies may make them one Society, as to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but not one Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61252:129"/>2. And certainly when Temples were firſt named Churches, it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe met there that were no Churches, but only Members of Churches: Nor is this Pariſh Church called a Church becauſe ſome meet here that belong to the Church at Boſton, Lincoln or Grantham; But to this day we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe our ſelves from ſaying, the Church of Barnet, the Church of St. Albans, of Hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Euſeb. lib. 8. cap. 1. ſaith, in every City they built ſpacious and ample Churches. And Theophil. Antiochen. Autol. ſaith, [Sic Deus dedit mundo, qui peccatorum tempeſtatibus &amp; naufragiis jactatur, Synagogas, quas Eccleſias ſanctas nominamus, in quibus veritatis doctrina fervet, ad quas confugiunt veritatis ſtudioſi, quotquot ſalvari, Deique judicium &amp; iram evitare volunt.]</p>
               <p>So Tertullian, de Idololat. cap. 7. pag. 171. Tota die ad hanc partem zelus fidei ingenuum Chriſtianum ab Idolis in Eccleſiam venire, de adverſaria Officina in domum Dei venire, &amp;c.

For it ſignifieth a Vicinity, and Parochus Vicinus, a Cohabitant or Neighbour, as well as inquilinus, and is uſed in all the ancient Church-Writers as noting both a Sojourner (as Chriſtians are in the World) and a Neighbour, ſo conſtantly in this later ſenſe, not excluding the former.

                  </gap>. And though the cuſtom of calling a Church by the name <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> continued when the Church was altered in magnitude to a large Dioceſs, yet that is ſo far from proving that this was the firſt and old ſignification, as that the word rather plainly leadeth us up to the thing and ſenſe which firſt it ſignified. And therefore to this day, Etymology teacheth us more wit than in Engliſh to call a Dioceſs a Pariſh, but only a Vicinity of Chriſtians: And when the a Vicinity is the Engliſh of the Word, why ſhould Strangers that we ſhall never ſee or have to do with, any more than thoſe in the uttermoſt part of the Land, be called our Pariſhioners or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?</p>
               <p>IV. Another clear Evidence of the truth in queſtion is the Paucity of Churches (or conſecrated Meeting-Places) for many hundred Years after Chriſt: both before they were called Temples and after. Not that occaſional Meeting-places were few (Houſes, Fields, &amp;c.) but appropriated conſecrated
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61252:129"/>
places called Churches, where there were Altars, or ordinary Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Lord's Supper. (Or rather it is doubtful whether the name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars with the form were introduced till two hundred Years after Chriſt, which maketh ſome the more queſtion the Antiquity of Ignatius and Clem. Conſt. and Can. Apoſt.) I yield to Baronius (ad An. 57.) that the Chriſtians had Churches, that is, places conſecrated for Church-Aſſemblies, under thoſe peaceable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors that went before Diocleſian: For Euſebius (beſides others) expreſly tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us ſo: Spacioſas &amp; amplas conſtruxerunt Eccleſias: But I deſire the Reader to mark his words. <bibl>Lib. 8. cap. 1. </bibl>
                  <q>[A man might then have ſeen the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of all Churches in great reverence and favour among all ſorts of Men, and with all Magiſtrates: Who can worthily deſcribe thoſe innumerable heaps and flocking multitudes through all Cities and famous Aſſemblies frequenting the places dedicated to Prayer? Becauſe of which Circumſtances, they not contented with the old and ancient Buildings, which could not receive them, have through all Cities builded them from the Foundation wide and ample Churches.]</q> Here note, 1. That here is no mention of any more Churches than one in each City: Cities and Aſſemblies are numbered together. 2. That theſe Buildings are called Churches. 3. That theſe Churches were built greater than the old ones anew from the Foundation, becauſe the old ones were too narrow to contain the People: But not ſuperadded to the old ones. 4. That the Biſhops are called The Biſhops of all Churches in relation to the ſame kind of Churches as are here deſcribed. So that then a Biſhop's Church met in one enlarged place.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe were no Temples; but ſuch as the ſilenced Miniſters have of late built in ſome parts of London; for the Chriſtians were in continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the demoliſhing of them: which fell out in Diocleſian's time. But till this Calm which Euſebius here deſcribeth, for about two hundred and fifty Years after Chriſt, the Chriſtians oft met in Vaults and ſecret places, where they might be hid, and not in open Churches, unleſs now and then in a Calm between.</p>
               <p>Platina in vit. Xiſti, tells us, that even at Rome it ſelf about the Year 120. there were few found that durſt profeſs the Name of Chriſt. And ſee what he ſaith, In Vita Clement. 1. &amp; Anaclet. &amp; Mantuan. lib. 1. faſtor. de Clem. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacl. Evariſt. Alex. Xiſt. Caliſt. Urban. &amp;c. In whoſe times, Killing, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Perſecuting cauſed Scatterings, hidings, and as Pliny tells us many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſies. See what Gerſ. Bucer ſaith, pag. 221, 222, 223. of all the Ages now in queſtion about this matter: As Tertullian ſaith, Apol. c. 3. adeo in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus innocuis, nomen innocuum erat odio: Did the Rabble but ſee or hear the Chriſtians, they were raged againſt them, and cried to the Judges, Tollite impios.</p>
               <p>Saith Polydor. Virgil. de invent. rer. l. 5. c. 6. Romae non reperio quod ſciam aliud antiquius templum aedificatum aut dicatum, vel ad uſum Sacrorum fuiſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſum, quam Thermas Novati in vico patricio, quas Pius Pontifex Praxidis eximiae ſanctitatis foeminae rogatu, divae Pudentianae ejus Sorori conſecravit; qui fuit annus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer 150. But the name Templum here is not uſed by Polydore as by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61252:130"/>
for a large and comely Fabrick. For, ſaith Tertullian, after that, Apol. c. 37. Chriſtians leave Temples to the Heathens. And ſaith Pope Nicholas, in Epiſt de depoſitione Zachariae &amp; Rodoaldi Epiſc. (recited in his Life by Papir. Maſſonus, Fol. 132. Col. 2.) [Deinde propter frigidiorem locum in Eccleſia Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris, quae ab Authore vocatur Conſtantiniana, &amp; quae prima in toto terrarum orbe conſtructa eſt.] You ſee that by this Pope's own Teſtimony, there was no Church in the whole World built before this one at Rome by Conſtantine. The meaning is, no large ſumptuous place called a Temple, but only commodious meaner Rooms or Buildings.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Pap. Maſſon. in Vita Bonifacii, fol. 55. noteth that Hierom even in his time (ſo late) Baſilicas Chriſtianorum tres tantum commemoraſſe.</p>
               <p>When upon the great increaſe of Chriſtians, but one odd Idol Temple even in Alexandria, was begged of the Emperor for the Chriſtians, Ruffin. lib. 2. cap. 22. and divers others tell us what tumult and ſtir it cauſed. And when Euſeb. de Vita Conſtant. lib. 3. c. 49, 50. tells us of his building of Churches except Conſtantinople, it is but one in a City, even the great Cities, Nicomedia in Bythinia, and Antioch. And Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 12. ſaith that even in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople (which he made ſo great and beautiful that it was no whit inferior to Rome, and by a Law engraven on a Pillar, commanded that it be called Second Rome,) he built from the Foundation (but) two Churches, Pacis &amp; Apoſtolorum.</p>
               <p>I could find in my heart, were it not tedious, here to tranſlate all Iſidor. Peluſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ota's Epiſt. 246. lib. 2. in which he openeth the difference between Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum and Eccleſia, and inveigheth againſt that Biſhop as no Biſhop, who cried up the Temple as the Church, while he perſecuted and vexed the Godly who are the Church indeed; and againſt them that are for ſumptuous Temples and unholy ſcandalous Churches; and tells us he had rather have been in the times when Temples were leſs adorned, and the Churches more adorned with Heavenly Graces, than in thoſe unhappy times when Temples were too much adorned, and Churches naked and empty of Spiritual Graces.</p>
               <p>So that when there was but one Temple in a City, (except two or three) and when that was called the Church, becauſe it contained the Church, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent what the Churches then were.</p>
               <p>V. The ancient Agapae ſhew how great the Churches then were, when as all the Church did feaſt together: and theſe continued in Tertullian's time, in ſome places at leaſt: And ſeveral Church-Canons mention them after that. And Chryſoſt. ſaith (Homil. de Oportet haereſ. eſſe p. (mihi) 20, 21. that in the Primitive times, there was a cuſtom that after Sermon and Sacrament, they all feaſted together in the Church, which he highly praiſeth. (But it was not many hundred Churches that feaſted in one Room.) And after he ſaith, [The Church is like Noah's Ark, but Men come in Wolves, and go out Lambs, &amp;c.] ſhewing that by the Church he meant the Aſſembly. And after, [All have the ſame Honour, and the ſame Acceſs, till all have communicated and partaked of the ſame Spiritual Meat. The Prieſts ſtanding expect them all, even the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61252:130"/>
pooreſt Man of all.] (By this he ſheweth what Church he meant, and how<note place="margin">I know the learned <hi>Albaſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prove that the <hi>Agapae</hi> were not at the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and in that place: But he thinketh that they were meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the whole fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and its like no houſe was much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſo that this makes no difference.</note> great the Church was.) Et Serm. 21. pag. 313. Redundat injuria in locum il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; Eccleſiam enim totam contemnis: Propterea enim Eccleſia dicitur, quia commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter omnes accipit. This doth not only ſhew what Church he meaneth, but fully confirmeth what I ſaid before: that [The whole Church was in that place: and that the place is therefore called the Church, becauſe it commonly receiveth all.] But note that this was not preach'd at Conſtantinople, but yet at the great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Church of Antioch.</p>
               <p>And I may add as to the former Evidences, To. 5. Serm. 52. pag. 705. when he had ſhewed that in the Church there muſt be no diviſion, he expoundeth it by [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] [Qui ſeipſum ab hoc con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu ſejunxerit.] So that the Aſſembly was the Church, and not a thouſandth part of the Church only.</p>
               <p>See more of the Churches feaſting together in Baronius ad an. 57. pag. (ed. Plant.) 543. to ſpare me more labour about this.</p>
               <p>VI. Another Evidence of the Limits of the ancient Churches is (that which I oft mentioned in the particular Teſtimonies) that every where all the People either choſe, or expreſly conſented to their Biſhops, and they were ordained over them in their ſight. And this no more could do than could meet in one place; and one part of a Church hath no more right to it than all the reſt. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is evident: And for them that ſay, that it was only the Pariſhioners of the Cathedral Church that voted; I anſwer, Now Cathedrals have no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and heretofore the Cathedral Pariſh was the whole Church. The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies fully prove that it was All the Church or People that were the Biſhop's Flock: And for ſome hundreds of Years there were no Pariſhes in his Dioceſs but one, and therefore no ſuch diſtinction. Pamelius's heap of Teſtimonies, and many more, for the matter of fact I have already cited: And however ſome talk now to juſtifie the contrary courſe of our times, it is ſo clear and full in Antiquity that the People choſe their Biſhops, at firſt principally, and after ſecondarily after the Clergy, having a Negative Voice with them, and their Conſent and Teſtimony ever neceſſary, even for eight hundred Years at leaſt, that it would be a needleſs thing to cite any more Teſtimonies of it to any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Ancients. Papiſts and Proteſtants are agreed de facto that ſo it was. See Cyprian, lib. 4. Epiſt. 2. of Cornelius; lib. 1. Epiſt. 2. of Sabinus; and lib. 1. Epiſt. 4. Euſeb. Hiſt. lib. 6. cap. 29. tells us that Fabian by the People was choſen to ſucceed Anterus. And Cyprian ſaith it was Traditione Apoſtolica, vid. &amp; Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 14. &amp; lib. 2. cap. 6. &amp; lib. 7. cap. 35. &amp; Sozomen. lib. 6. cap. 24. &amp; lib. 8. cap. 2. of Chryſoſtom; &amp; lib. 6. cap. 13. vid. &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin. Epiſt. 110. &amp; Theodoret, Hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 9. in Epiſt. Concil. Nicaeni ad Alexandr. The Bloodſhed at the Choice of Damaſus was one of the firſt occaſions of laying by that cuſtom at Rome. And yet though they met not ſo tumultuouſly, they muſt conſent. Leo's Teſtimony I gave you before with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. Theodor. lib. 5. cap. 9. of Nectarius ſheweth that Biſhops were then choſen, Plebe praeſente &amp; univerſa fraternitate, as Cyprian ſpeaketh of Sabinus.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61252:131"/>
So the Concil. Pariſien. even an. 559. But for more plentiful proof of this ſee M. A. Spalatenſ. de Rep. Eccleſ. lib. 1. cap. 22. n. 10. &amp; lib 6. cap. 7. &amp; lib. 3. cap. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> n. 12. &amp;c. &amp; Blondel de Jure plebis, more copiouſly, and de Epiſ. &amp; Presbyt. &amp; Bilſon perpet. Govern. cap. 15. &amp; lib. of Chriſtian Subjection oft.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted that when the People's Confuſion had made them ſeem uncapable any longer to chuſe: 1. This was long of the Prelates themſelves, who by that time had ſo far enlarged their Churches, that the People were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capable of doing their ancient Work and Duty, nor yet of being ruled by the Clergy aright. 2. And when the People were reſtrained from the Choice by Meetings and Vote, the Magiſtrates in their ſtead did undertake the Power. 3. And when it fell out of the People's hands into Great Mens, the Proud and Covetous who could beſt ſeek and make Friends did get the Biſhopricks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Churches were preſently changed, corrupted and undone. 4. And the ſenſe of this moved the few good Biſhops that were left to make Canons againſt this Power and Choice of Princes and great Men, decreeing that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops obtruded by them on the Churches ſhould be as none, but be avoided, and all avoided that did not avoid them. And the Roman and Patriarchal party cunningly joyned with theſe honeſt Reformers to get the Choice out of the Magiſtrate's hands that they might get it into their own; and ſo Chriſt's Church was abuſed among ambitious Uſurpers. The Decrees againſt Magiſtrates Choice of Biſhops you may ſee, Can. Apoſt. 31. &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. 17. q. 7. c. ſiquis Epiſc. Sept. Synod. c. 3. Decret. 16. q. 7. Oct. Synod. c. 12. &amp; Act. 1. &amp;c. 22. Decret. 16. q. 7. Nicol. 1. Epiſt. 10. &amp; Epiſt. 64. with more which you may find cited by Spalatenſ. lib. 6. cap. 7. pag. 675, 676, 677.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted that (though ſtill the Clergy had a Negative or firſt Choice, yet) when they procured Charles the Great (who was to riſe by the Papal help) to reſign and renounce the Magiſtrates Election, he reſtored the Church to its Ancient Liberties, as far as enlarged Dioceſes and ambitious Clergy-men would permit it. His words are theſe, [Sacrorum Canonum non ignari ut in Dei nomine Sancta Eccleſia ſuo liberius potiretur honore, aſſenſum ordini Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtico praebuimus, ut ſcilicet Epiſcopi per Electionem CLERI &amp; POPULI ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum ſtatuta Canonum de PROPRIA DIOECESI, remota perſonarum &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum acceptione, ob vitae meritum &amp; ſapientiae donum, eligantur, ut exemplo &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſibi ſubjectis uſquequaque prodeſſe valeant.] Vid. Baron. To. 11. n. 26. Decret. Diſt. 63. c Sacrorum. Where note that, 1. he includeth the People of the whole Dioceſs. 2. And doth this as according to the ſacred Canons. So that for Men to dream that only the Pariſhioners of a Cathedral Church (which had no proper Pariſh) or the Citizens only, were to chuſe, is to feign that which is contrary to notorious Evidence of Law and Fact, as well as of the reaſon of the thing. For where all are the Biſhops Flock, and chuſe as his Flock, there all the Flock muſt chuſe, and a parcel can claim no privilege above all the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61252:131"/>VII. The next Evidence is this: In the firſt Age, it is very fairly proved by Doctor Hammond, that there were by the Apoſtles more Biſhops and Churches than one in many Cities themſelves: And if one City had more than one Church and Biſhop, then much more many diſtant places, in Towns and Countries. That one City had more than one he ſheweth by the diſtinction of Jews and Gentiles Churches: As Peter was appointed chiefly for the Jews, and Paul chiefly for the Gentiles, ſo he ſheweth it very probable, that at Rome, Antioch, and other places they had ſeveral Churches. And thus he reconcileth the great differences about Linus, Clemens and Cletus or Anacletus. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on this reaſon, that they had not the ſame Language. And indeed when in great Cities there are Chriſtians of divers Languages, it is neceſſary that they be of divers Congregations, unleſs you will have them Hear, as the Papiſts will have them Pray, they know not what. And though ſome might ſay, that though they be of divers Aſſemblies, yet they might have onely One Biſhop to Rule them: I anſwer, 1. Dr. Hammond is more ingenuous, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the diverſities of congregations and languages inferred a diverſity of Churches and Biſhops with their diſtinct Clergy. 2. And all Antiquity made Preaching or Teaching his flock as eſſential to the Biſhops office as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them (of which next:) But he could not teach ſeveral Churches whoſe language he underſtood not.</p>
               <p>VIII. Antiquity made the three parts of the Biſhops office Teaching, Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Governing, to be of the ſame extent as to the ſubject ſociety under him. It was one and the ſame Church which he was ordinarily to Teach, to guide in worſhip (prayers, praiſe, ſacrament) and to Rule by diſcipline (ſuppoſing ſtill that we ſpeak of a meer Biſhop and not an Archbiſhop) I ſhould weary the Reader to cite numerous teſtimonies for ſo notorious a thing. But it is known that the ſaid Biſhop neither is nor can be the Ordinary Teacher, and Guide in worſhip to a Dioceſe of a multitude of Churches, but to one or few at moſt. And he that peruſeth ancient writers, ſhall find that the Biſhop was not only to be a ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e or extraordinary Teacher of his whole flock, but the Ordinary one: not only to ſend others, but to do it himſelf; till the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dioceſes changed the cuſtome.</p>
               <p>IX. Another evidence is this: In the firſt two Centuries, Deacons and Biſhops were ever officers in the ſame Church: But Deacons were never then officers in more Churches (or ſtated aſſemblies that had Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) than one: therefore Biſhops were not officers in more. No proof can be given of any Deacons that had the care (in their places) of many Churches, Pariſhes, or Societies of Chriſtians. And when Dioceſes were enlarged, it is notable that the Presbyter that was the oculus Epiſcopi in the Dioceſe is called the Archdeacon: Becauſe originally he was but indeed a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, the chief Deacon who was with the Biſhop in one and the ſame Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It being then inauditum for a Deacon to belong to many.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61252:132"/>X. Another evidence is, The Great number of Biſhops who out of a narrow ſpace of ground, did uſually aſſemble in the ancient Synods. I told you before out of Crab of Sylveſters number at Rome. Binius alſo hath the like words [Sylveſter collegit in gremio ſedis ſuae 284 Epiſcopos] and that 139 of them were ex urbe Roma vel non longe ab illa. A hundred thirty nine Biſhops in Rome and not far from it, had not ſuch Dioceſes as now.</p>
               <p>Cyprian ſaith, lib. 1. Ep. 3. that Privatus was condemned in Synodo Lambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitana by 90 Biſhops which was before Chriſtianity was countenanced by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and were under perſecution, yea, long before Cyprian wrote that Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>For the examining of every ordinary cauſe of an accuſed Presbyter, ſex Epiſcopi ex vicinis locis, ſix Biſhops from the neighbour places, (not from 40 or fourſcore miles diſtance) were to hear and determine, and three Biſhops for the cauſe of every Deacon, Concil. Afric. Can. 20. ſo that no doubt but their Biſhops were as near as our Market Towns at leaſt, even when ſo few of the people were Chriſtians as that all that ſpace afforded but one great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>The ſixth provincial Council at Carthage had 217 Biſhops (whereas the General Council at Trent had long but 40.)</p>
               <p>A Council of Donatiſts (Hereticks not ſo numerous ſure as the Catholicks) at Carthage, mentioned by Auguſtine, Epiſt. 68. (about an. 308) had 270 Biſhops. And when there were ſo great a number of Heretick Biſhops, how many were there of the Catholicks and Donatiſts and all other ſects ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? This one hereſie had enow to become perſecutours of the Catholicks, (beating them with clubs, putting out the peoples eyes by caſting vineger mixt with lime into them, dragging them in the dirt) And yet they were the ſmaller number, and complained of perſecution; and ſome Circumcellions killed themſelves to make the Catholicks odious as perſecutors (Occiſos aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt luci, vivis auferunt lucem—Quod nobis faciunt ſibi non imputant: &amp; quod ſibi faciunt nobis imputantinquiunt, Clerici Hippon. ib. ad Januarium.) Certainly here were Churches no bigger then, than our ſmaller Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>And Auguſtine cont. Gaudentium ſaith, there were innumerable Biſhops in Africa that were Orthodox. (And it was but a corner of Africa that were Chriſtians, and in the Roman Empire here meant.)</p>
               <p>Victor Uticenſis in perſecut. Vandal. ſheweth that in that part of Africa 660 Biſhops fled; beſides the great number murdered, impriſoned, and many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated. The like may be ſaid of Patricks Iriſh Biſhops before mentioned, and many others, who plainly were Parochial Biſhops.</p>
               <p>XI. Another evidence is, The way of Strangers communicating then by way of Communicatory Letters, or Certificates from the Church whence they came, which were to be ſhewed to the Biſhop of the Church where they deſired to communicate: But was it many hundred Churches that they muſt thus ſatisfie? or muſt they travail to the Biſhop with their Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, before they muſt communicate in any one Church within 20. 30. 40.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61252:132"/>
or 50. miles of him? Doubtleſs an impartial Reader will think, that it was but a Biſhop of the ſame City-Church which he deſired Communion with, to whom the Certificate was to be ſhewn. See what Albaſpinaeus ſaith of theſe Letters, ex Concil. Laodic. c. 41. Concil. Antioch. c. 1. Concil. Agath. can. 52. Concil. Eliber. c. 58. in his obſervat. p. 254, 255.</p>
               <p>XII. Another evidence is the ancient phraſe deſcribing a Schiſm by Altare aliud erigere, to ſet up another Altar, or to ſet up Altar againſt Altar. And to ſeparate from that Altar was to ſeparate from that Church: which implyeth, that there was but one Altar in a Church; and multiplying Altars was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Churches.</p>
               <p>XIII. Another evidence was the late diviſion of Pariſhes: The idle ſtory of<note place="margin">So Sr. <hi>Hen. Spelman Concil. p. 152. ſaith,</hi> in Theodor. time about <hi>An 672.</hi> Pariſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions here began. <hi>Seld.</hi> of Tythes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in <hi>England</hi> began but about 700 years after Chriſt. And Dr. <hi>Tilleſtly</hi> doth not deny the time, but thinketh that though Patrons (as <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith) might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this, yet Biſhops alſo had a hand in it.</note> Evariſtus dividing Pariſhes at Rome, Gerſ. Bucer hath fully confuted. It is moſt certain that except at Alexandria and Rome, it was long before they were divided. Sir Rog. Twiſden Hiſtor. Vindicat. c. 3. p. 9, 10. ſaith that it was under Theodore A. B. C. that Parochial Churches began (mark Began) to be erected here in England, and the Biſhop of Rome greatly reverenced in this nation &amp;c. out of a MS. in Trinity Hall Cambridge. And it was 668 as Beda tells us before Theodore was Ordained Biſhop. The evidence in hiſtory of the Lateneſs of Pariſh diviſions is paſt doubt.</p>
               <p>And whereas the uſual anſwer is, that there may be Dioceſes without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; I anſwer, It is not the Name [Dioceſe] that is the thing in queſtion, but the Church-ſtate. While there was but one Altar, there was but one place of ordinary Church Communion in the Lords Supper. And when there were more places with Altars erected, they could not be, nor were long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their proper affixed Presbyters (as Arius his Caſe ſheweth and as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) And when that was done, they were Pariſhes in out ſenſe: And till that was done, ſome one Presbyter was ſent from the Biſhop as he pleaſed; and then all the Pariſhes in the Dioceſe muſt needs be under one Presbytery as well as one Biſhop. There were no ſetled Congregations for ordinary Church Communion, beſides the Biſhops Church-meeting, till Pariſhes were divided, if not by ſpace of ground, yet by the diſtinction of Temples and People, which is the thing intended. There could be no ſuch thing as a Dioceſane Church in the ſenſe that we oppoſe it in, that is, One Church with a Biſhop infimi ordinis (having none under him) made up of a multitude of Communicating Churches with their Subpresbyters, yea ſuch as are no part of the Biſhops Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſus or Presbytery for the Government of that Church.]</p>
               <p>XIV. The next evidence is, the ancient cuſtom of All his Presbyters ſitting in one ſeat with the Biſhop in a ſemi-circle in loco eminentiore on each hand of him and the Deacons ſtanding under or below them: which is ſo ordained by Councils (as Carth. 4. Can. 35. &amp;c.) And the thing is commonly reported in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. And this being put uſually as of his Presbyters in common, who were his aſſiſtants and colleagues, and with whom he Governed the Churches,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61252:133"/>
without mentioning any excepted Presbyters belonging to diſtant Pariſhes, It is apparent that the Biſhop then had ordinarily but one aſſembly. The ſame I may ſay of the many Canons, that ſhew what the Presbyters are to do in the Church, which imply his preſence: But I have mentioned many of them before.</p>
               <p>XV. Another evidence is, the cuſtom of the Presbyters dwelling in the ſame houſe with the Biſhop (ſingle) as in a Colledge; which not only in Hippo, but in very many other places was then uſed: and they dwelt near the Church, where that was not uſed (As when they had wives, or the Biſhop had his Epiſcopam as the Concil. Turon. 2. calleth her, and alloweth it.)</p>
               <p>Tolet himſelf, de Sacerdotio lib. 5. cap. 4. n. 15. pag. 722. confeſſeth this ſaying, [In Eccleſia Primitiva uſque ad tempora Auguſtini &amp; Hieron. Epiſcopum &amp; Clerum ſolitos vivere in communi: unde bona quae vel ex decimis, vel ex fidelium devotione offerebantur, erant indiviſa, &amp; ſubdebantur diſtributioni Epiſcopi, quae partim ipſi, partim Clero, partim fabricae, partim pauperibus obveniebant. Poſtea vero quando quiſque per ſe vixit, talia bona diviſa ſunt in quatuor partes, prima Epiſcopo ſervata, ſecunda Clero, tertia fabricae, quarta pauperibus.] And ſure that Church then was no bigger than that Colledge did officiateto.</p>
               <p>XVI. And that which theſe words of Tolet recite, is the next evidence, viz. The way of maintenance in thoſe times. 1. They lived on Oblations moſtly: And theſe oblations are ever mentioned as offered but upon One Altar.<note place="margin">Of this ſee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tract of Church Benefices, by <hi>Pad. Paul Sarpi,</hi> tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</note> 2. Theſe Oblations were all brought to the Biſhops hands, and diſtributed by him or his appointment. 3. The Firſt-fruits, and Tythe that came next were alſo in his hands. 4. And ſo were all the Gifts, and all the Praedia or Church glebe. 5. All theſe are mentioned as given to One Church only, and not many. 6. The diſtribution was as aforeſaid, ſome fourfold, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time three-fold; of which Spalatenſis reciteth the decrees ſo fully, that I will not tire the reader with reciting them. 7. And it was the Fabrica of One Church only that the Biſhop was to give the fourth part to maintain (And were many hundred fabricks more forgotten?) 8. And it was a preſent Clergie, and not men ſetled along way off, that he was to make diſtribution to. 9. And when he was to have the firſt fourth part himſelf, who can think that this is meant that men muſt carry the fourth part of the Hay, and Corn, and Wood, and Pigs, &amp;c. from all the Pariſhes through ſuch Dioceſes as ours, and the fourth part of all the Glebe rents; This would make the Biſhoprick indeed ſeem to worldly minded men to be worth the venturing of their ſouls for; And they muſt have ſo many ſcore or hundred barns full, as might tempt them to ſay, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>XVII. Another evidence is this: That when firſt new Communicating Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies were erected even in the ſame Cities with the Biſhops, the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

hallowed by themſelves; And this was firſt to comfort (as they ſaid) the Presbyters and new Congregation, leſt they ſhould think themſelves cut off from their Biſhops Church and Communion. 2. To hold their intereſt in the people by this handle of their own making. Of theſe Eulogiae the Can. Concil. Laodic. 14. ſpeaks, as Petavius and others think: Petav. in Epiphan. ad haereſ. 69. pag. 276. ſaith, [Romae, ubi per titulos diſtributi presbyteri ſuos quique populos regebant: Ad eos Epiſcopi Dominicis diebus fermentum ſive benedictum panem in Communionis ſymbolum mittere conſueverant.] And the paſſage which he citeth out of Innocent ad Decentium cap. 5. is very full, [De fermento vero quod die Dominico per Titulos mittimus, ſuperflue nos conſulere voluiſti: cum omnes Eccleſiae noſtrae intra civitatem ſint conſtitutae: Quarum Presbyteri quia die iſto propter plebem ſibi commiſſam nobiſcum convenire non poſſunt, ideo fermentum a nobis confectum per acolythos accipiunt, ut ſe a noſtra communione, maxima illa die non judicent ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.] That Melchiades ordained this, Damaſus his pontifical book ſaith; which was about An. 313. But Baronius ad An. 313. largely openeth all the buſineſs, and ſheweth that this fermentum was hallowed levened bread, which was not the Euchariſt, but a deviſed ſacrament (as Innocent calleth it) of Union and Communion: confirming this which I have ſaid: And ex Can. 14. Concil. Laod. &amp;c. he ſheweth that it was uſed alſo in the Eaſt: And to this notable paſſage of Innocent [Omnes eccleſiae noſtrae infra civitatem ſuntconſtitutae] all the Popes Churches were within the city, he ſaith, (p. 97.) [Detitulis tantum intelligit, ad quos fermentum mitti ſoleret, non quidem quod non eſſent in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbiis aliae complures eccleſiae atque ſanctorum memoriae, ſed nulla prorſus Titularis, in quam populus colligi conſueverit. Cujus rei cauſa ait ſe non mittere fermentum ad Presbyteros per diverſa coemeteria conſtitutos, quod illi plebem ſibi ſubditam quam colligerent, non haberent.]</p>
               <p>Here you ſee, 1. That there were more Temples than Congregations, or Pariſhes, being erected as Monuments in honour of the Martyrs. 2. That there were no Congregations or Pariſhes, but within the City. 3. That this device of holy bread came upon the diviſion of Pariſhes; and therefore as one was new then, ſo the other could not be old.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Another evidence is the ſtate of Cathedral Churches, which as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">And it is a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proof which Dr. <hi>Tilleſley</hi> againſt <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith (p. 179 [The right of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Vol. 1. p. 135. Col. 1.</bibl> 
                  <q>[Thoſe Churches are called Cathedral, becauſe the Biſhops dwell

near them. At firſt there was but ONE CHURCH in every JURIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICTION, whereinto no man entered to pray, but with ſome oblation towards the maintenance of the Paſtor—And for this occaſion they were built very huge and great: for otherwiſe they were not capable of ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes as came daily to them, to hear the word and receive the ſacraments: But as the number of Chriſtians increaſed, ſo firſt Monaſteries, then finally Pariſh Churches were builded, in every juriſdiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which I take our Deanry Churches to have their original, now called Mother Churches, and their Incumbents Archprieſts; And the reſt being added ſince the Conqueſt, either by the Lords of every Town, or zealous men loth to travail far, and willing to have ſome eaſe, building them near hand unto theſe Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Churches, all the Clergie in old time of the ſame Deanry were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repair at ſundry ſeaſons, there to receive wholſome ordinances, and to conſult of the neceſſary affairs of the whole juriſdiction, if neceſſity ſo required: And ſome image thereof is yet to be ſeen in the North parts. But as the number of Churches increaſed, ſo the repair of the faithful to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, did diminiſh, whereby they are now become, eſpecially in their nether parts, rather Markets and ſhops for merchandize, than ſolemn places of prayer, whereunto they were firſt erected.]</q> I need to ſay no more of this.</p>
               <p>XIX. The next evidence is, That when Churches firſt became Dioceſane (in the ſenſe oppoſed) they were fitted to the form of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And Dioceſes and Metropolitanes, and Patriarchs, came in at the ſame door: The very name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was long unknown in a ſacred ſenſe, and was after borrowed from the Civil diviſions, when the Church was formed according to them. And as Altare Damaſc. p. 290. ſaith, Vox <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ut refertur ad Epiſcopum, ignota fuit Euſebio &amp; ſuperioribus ſeculis: And the word Pariſh was alſo before uſed in our narrower ſenſe, for a vicinity of Chriſtians. And as Grynaeus ſaith in Euſeb. p. 1. not. 3. Euſeb. promiſcue uſurpat haec duo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabula <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>And that a Dioceſane as ſuch (thus formed to the Romane Civil form) and a Metropolitane and Patriarch, yea, and the Pope as the Prime Patriarch in the Empire, are all of Humane inſtitution, and all of the ſame original and right, there are few Proteſtants that do deny. 1. The reaſon of the thing plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. 2. Their beginning at once ſheweth it. 3. And that they were never any of them ſetled out of the Roman Empire, where that form obtained, except that they ſetled here and there one on the verge of the Empire to have ſome care of the neighbour countreys, till after that the Roman name and power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited ſmall countreys adjoyning to them to imitation. And Biſhop Bilſon of Chr. Subject. often tells us that Metropolitans and Patriarchs are of Humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>Godwin a Biſhop, in the Lives of the Engliſh Biſhops, de Converſ. Brit. c. 3. p. 30. ſaith, Quis tam imperitus eſt ut non intelligat, poſt mortem Tiberii fluxiſſe multos annos, ne dicam ſeculum unum aut alterum priuſquam Cardinalis, Patriarchae,

Bucer pag. 231, 232, 233, 234, 235.</note> aut Dioceſani, for they were built by the ſame hand on the ſame foundation. I do not mean that an Apoſtolical General Miniſtry was ſo new, but a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane of many Churches, as Epiſcopus infimi gradus. Multitudes of Papiſts and Proteſtants atteſt the novelties of theſe foreſaid ranks. Two teſtimonies of the Papiſts are ſo notable, as that I will not paſs them by.</p>
               <p>Cardinal Cuſanus (that Learned Prelate, and proud enough) li. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. l. 2. c. 13. ſaith, [Omnes gradus Majoritatis &amp; Minoritatis in eccleſia ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris poſitivi eſſe.] And therefore concluded that the Papacy is removeable from Rome.</p>
               <p>Nay the very Canon Law it ſelf, ſaith, Decret. Par. 1. diſ. 22. c. 1. c. omnes, [Omnes ſive Patriarchii cujuſlibet apices, ſive Metropole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is from P. Nicolaus his decretal. And though a man might ſuſpect that he meant only of the perſonal Inſtitution of the particular Patriarchs, Metropolitans, &amp;c. yet the context ſheweth the contrary, and that it is the ſpecies, office or place that he ſpeaketh of; Becauſe the oppoſite aſſertion is, that the Roman Churches dignity was founded by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And the next Cap. 2. is that, not the Apoſtles, but the Lord himſelf gave the Roman Church its primacy.</p>
               <p>XX. The next evidence is, That we rarely read of any Biſhops preaching in any Church but One, unleſs he was driven out of it by perſecution, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were in another Biſhops Church. If I ſhould except only the great Patriarchal Churches out of all the world, and that only as late as 400 or 500 years after Chriſt, when Emperours had helpt to increaſe the Churches, no impartial man would take that for any debilitation of my proof. And yet I ſhall not eaſily yield to that exception. In Antioch and Jeruſalem I think it will hardly be affirmed, that the Biſhop uſed to preach to any Congregation but One: In Great Conſtantinople (equalled to Rome) when find you Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome any where but in one Church, except when violence hindred him, and then the ſame Congregation followed him? Indeed the Novatians had a Church there, and perhaps there was ſome bye Congregation or two of Chriſtians, who all communicated in the Biſhops Church, and therefore were but as Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels. But go into all the reſt of the world, and the caſe will be plainer, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Rome and Alexandria.) Even Baſil an Archbiſhop is not found a Teacher ordinarily any where but to his Church at Caeſarca; nor Gregory but at Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum (when he went from Conſtantinople and from Saſimis;) and ſo of the reſt, no not Ambroſe in the great city of Milan: And let it move none that Milan and ſome other Cities had more Temples than one, for as Baronius before cited tells us, there were then many Temples built as Monuments in honour of the Martyrs, that were not Tituli, nor had any Pariſh or Congregation belonging to them. When find you Auguſtine teaching in any Church but one (in Hippo) as part of his charge? Of Epiphanius I need not ſpeak, ſeeing it is confeſt that in Cyprus no City had two Churches in his days, and that it was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61252:135"/>
their cuſtome to place Biſhops in villages, (as Socrates, Sozomen, and Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus agree.) So that the matter of fact is certain: except four or five Churches (if ſo many) in all the world 400 years after Chriſt, and except but two or three hundred years after Chriſt, you will find no Biſhop in any Church but one, as part of his own Charge.</p>
               <p>But the conſequence inferred hence will be denied, becauſe the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes might be taught by Subpresbyters without him. Anſw. But I would ask, 1. Whether all the reſt of the Pariſhes were not the Biſhops Charge? yea part of his Church, yea equally with the other part? As to what Onuphrius and others ſay of the ſtations, and the Biſhops going from Church to Church, 1. It was ſcarce any where but in Rome: 2. It was of later times: 3. It was only in the City: 4. It was commonly the ſame auditors that followed him to ſeveral Churches.</p>
               <p>And it's true that other Biſhops went to the memorials of the Martyrs oft, and had as monuments more Churches than aſſemblies. And it's true that of later times, certain Canons bind the Biſhops to viſit all their Pariſhes: And the eldeſt oblige him to viſit all the people: which ſheweth that yet his Doceſe was not great.</p>
               <p>If he be the Biſhop of the Church, and the office of a Biſhop be to guide the Church, in Worſhip, and by Diſcipline, then he is bound to do this to all the Church: indeed if you make but a meer Presbyter of him, then as many may divide the work between them, ſo each might know his proper part, (as things ſtood when Pariſhes or Chappels were divided) But if a Biſhop, as ſuch, be the uniting head as the King of a Kingdom, he muſt be equally related to the whole.</p>
               <p>But if it were not equally, who can believe that there was ſo great a difference in the parts of the ſame Church, as that one parcel of them only ſhould have right to their Biſhops preſence, teaching, worſhipping, and perſonal guidance, and ten, twenty, an hundred, a thouſand other parcels have no right at all? What! a Biſhop of a whole Church, not at all obliged to Teach, or Guide in perſonal worſhipping, any part of that Church but one? Some great change was made in Churches before men could arrive at ſuch a conceit? Even now among us, a Biſhop taketh himſelf (by the conſtraining Law of man, which is his Rule) to viſit his Dioceſe once in three years: (I do not mean one Church of fourty or an hundred in his Dioceſe, much leſs to preach himſelf uſually in thoſe few Towns he comes to; but to call his Curate Prieſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to ſet one of them to preach his Viſitation Sermon.) But where find you this done by three Biſhops in the world for 300 years after Chriſt, unleſs that Archbiſhops viſited the Biſhops Churches under them? Now they ſay there have been Biſhops in England who have once in three years confirmed ſome children abroad throughout their Dioceſe (I do not mean one of two hundred) but where find you that then the Biſhop went out of his City to do this?</p>
               <p>2. My next queſtion therefore is, Whether the Biſhops of thoſe times were not at leaſt as conſcionable and careful and laborious in their offices, as any now
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61252:135"/>
are, if not much more? What! not a Gregory, a Baſil, a Chryſoſtome, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, a Fulgentius, a Hillary, &amp;c. What! not they that preached almoſt daily? They that write ſo ſtrictly of the labours of the Miniſtery? They that lived ſo auſterely, and favoured not the fleſh; that ſpeak ſo tenderly of the worth of ſouls? And would all theſe, think you, undertake to be Biſhops of a whole Church, and yet ſo leave the whole work upon others, as never to come among them and teach them, and examine them, nor give them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Pariſhes of the Dioceſe ſave one? This is not credible.</p>
               <p>If you ſay that in Alexandria it was certainly ſo, that diſtinct congregations were committed to the Presbyters, I anſwer, 1. Yet ſo as that they might any part of them (as living in the ſame city) come and hear the Biſhop when they would: 2. They might communicate with him per vices if they would: 3. They were all bound to do ſo at the great feſtivals of the year: 4. They were all perſonally governed by the diſcipline of the Biſhop and Presbyters conjunct in Council: But of this next.</p>
               <p>XXI. Another evidence is that the whole Plebs or people of the Biſhops charge (till Churches were ſetled under Presbyters far off in the countreys) were bound by the Canons to come to the Cathedral Church, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Biſhop at Eaſter, Whitſuntide, and ſome other ſuch feſtivals, even after they were diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral Auditories and Communicating Aſſemblies under Presbyters; which I have before proved from the particular Canons: which certainly proveth that the Dioceſes were no more than could aſſemble in one place.</p>
               <p>XXII. Another evidence is that Presbyters did but rarely preach in the two or three firſt ages (except in Alexandria, or in ſome few Churches which had got ſome extraordinary men; Chryſoſtome's preaching at Antioch, Auguſtin's at Hippo, while they were but Presbyters, are noted as unuſual things. And it is ſaid of Auguſtine (as forecited) that it being not uſual in other Churches, for the Presbyters to preach in the Biſhops preſence, the example of that Church (by the humility of the honeſt Biſhop who preferred his abler Presbyter before himſelf) did lead many other Churches into the ſame practice. Spalatenſis<note place="margin">I may add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo as anther evidence that in the beginning for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, Confirmation was cloſely joyned to Baptiſm, and therefore ordinarily none were Baptized but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmer, or in his preſence: And the Biſhops ſay, that only Biſhops did confirm: And if ſo, then let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, to how large a Dioceſe a Biſhop could be preſent at every Baptiſm: Yea if Confirmation had been at a greater diſtance, ſeeing all that were baptized were confirmed, it is eaſy to know for how many one Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps in ſome Dioceſes not one of 1000 for we rarely hear of any at all.</note> and many others have given large proofs, that the Biſhops and not the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were the ordinary preachers in their Church. * Fileſacus ſaith, De Epiſcop. authorit. cap. 15.

               <p>And if any be ſtumbled at the name Presbyteri Parochiani uſual in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Fathers, as if they were Countrey Presbyters, who preached then in other Churches? I have before cited a Canon which gave leave to Presbyters to preach in the countrey villages, intimating it was rare heretofore. 2. Fileſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſaith, ibid. p. 562, 563. [Sed ut quod res eſt libere eloquar, &amp; illo aevo &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriore, cum Parochiae vox vulgo etiam pro Dioeceſi uſurpatur (that is for all the Biſhops Charge) credo Presbyteros Parochianos dictos fuiſſe, non aliter ac ſiquis Dioeceſanos pronunciaret, hoc eſt, In hac Parochia ſeu Dioeceſi ordinatos &amp; titulatos.]</p>
               <p>But ſurely whilſt Presbyters rarely preached, there were either Churches that had no preaching (which cannot be proved) or elſe few Aſſemblies that had not Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But then you make Lay Elders of the Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. They were the abler ſort of Chriſtians ordained to the ſame Miniſterial or Sacerdotal Office as all true Miniſters are: But few of them being Learned men, and able to make long Sermons, were imployed only as the Biſhops aſſiſtants, as elders are among the Presbyterians: who if they would but ordain thoſe Elders, and let them have power over the word and Sacraments, though only to exerciſe it under the Biſhops or chief Paſtors guidance, when there was cauſe, they would come neareſt to the ancient uſe.</p>
               <p>XXIII. And it ſeemeth to me an evidence that the Churches then were (uſually) but as narrow as I aſſert, that the Presbyters were to abide with the Biſhop, and attend him in his City Church. For if you ſuppoſe them able to Teach or guide a flock themſelves, (as ſome were ſuch, as Auguſtine, Macarius, Ephrem Syrus, Tertullian, &amp;c.) it is ſcarce credible to me that the Biſhop would ſuffer ſuch worthy perſons to ſit among his Auditors, when there were many countrey congregations that needed their help. For that the Church was ſo ſupplied with Preachers as that beſides all theſe Presbyters in the Biſhops Church, there were enow for all the reſt of the countrey Pariſhes as now, is contrary to all the intimations of Church-Hiſtory. And therefore when we read of ſo many Presbyters with the Biſhop, before we read of many or ſcarce any elſewhere, ſurely there were no people that needed them.</p>
               <p>XXIV. And yet (though great Cities had many with the Biſhop) I may add that the <note n="*" place="margin">In the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61252:136"/>
been in doubt whether thoſe Biſhops that had but one or two Presbyters, ſhould have one taken from them to make a Biſhop of, which was yet affirmatively decreed, becauſe there may be more found fit to make Presbyters of, where it's hard to find any fit to be Biſhops.</p>
               <p>I will ſpeak it in the words of the learned Biſhop Bilſons <bibl>Perpet. Govern. c. 13. p. 256.</bibl> 
                  <q>[In greater Churches they had great numbers of Presbyters: In ſmaller they had often two, ſomewhere one, and ſometimes none. And yet for all this defect of Presbyters, the Biſhops then did not refrain to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hands without them. The number of Presbyters in many places were two in a Church, as Ambroſe writeth on 1 Tim. 3. ſometimes but one. In the third Council Carthag. when it was agreed that the Primate of that City might take the Presbyters of every Dioceſe and Ordain them Biſhops for ſuch places as deſired them, though the Biſhop under whom the Presbyter before lived were unwilling to ſpare him, Poſthumianus a Biſhop demanded, [what if a Biſhop have but one only Presbyter, muſt that one be taken from him?] Aurelius the Biſhop of Carthage anſwered, One Biſhop may Ordain many Presbyters, but a Presbyter fit for a Biſhoprick is not eaſily found: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man have but one only Presbyter, and fit for the room of a Biſhop, he ought to yield that one to be Ordained. Poſthumianus replied, Then if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop have a number of Clerks, that others ſtore ſhould relieve him. Aurelius anſwered, Surely as you helped another Church, ſo he that hath many Clerks <note n="*" place="margin">not many Churches.</note> ſhall be driven to ſpare you one of them, to be ordained by you]</q> A Dioceſe ſuch as is intimated here, we do not ſtrive againſt.</p>
               <p>XXIV. Another evidence is that when ever we read of perſecution turning the Chriſtians out of their Churches, you ever find them gathered into one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, when they could have leiſure and place to meet in, and uſually a Biſhop with them; unleſs he were baniſhed, impriſoned, or martyred, and then ſome Presbyter ſupplied the place: or unleſs they were ſcattered into many little parcels. And you find no talk of the perſecution of multitudes of Countrey Presbyters afar off, but of the Biſhop with his City Presbyters and Church. To which add that it was One Church ſtill, which rejected, obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Biſhops, and refuſed to obey the Emperour who impoſed them. All this is manifeſt in Gregory Neocaeſar. his flight with Muſonius, and the ſtate of his Church: In the Caſe of Baſil; and of Lucius the obtruded Biſhop at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, and in the Caſe of Antioch before deſcribed, and of Rome it ſelf. It's tedious to cite numerous teſtimonies in a well known caſe. If Alexandria was in ſuch a caſe, or near it, I hope you will doubt of no other Churches. And that with this you may ſee what Conventicles the Chriſtians kept when the Emperours forbad them, and how reſolutely the Biſhops preached when the Emperours ſilenced them, I will recite the words of Baronius himſelf, and in him of Dionyſius Alexandr. apud Euſeb. lib. 7. c. 10. &amp;c. 17. and Cyprian ep. 5. &amp;c. in Baron. ad an. 57. p. 542. that thoſe who cry out againſt Preaching and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, when they are but ſtrong enough to drive others out of the Temples, may better underſtand themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61252:137"/>
                  <q>[Siquando, &amp;c. If at any time ſo vehement a perſecution did ariſe, that the Chriſtians by the Emperours edicts, were utterly excluded from the Churches and aſſemblies, notwithſtanding, little regarding ſuch things, they forbore not to come together in One, in holy aſſemblies, whitherſoever there was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. This Dionyſ. Alexand. Biſhop witneſſeth writing to Germanus when he mentioneth the Edicts of Valerian forbidding the Aſſemblies. [But we by Gods aſſiſtance, have not abſtained from our accuſtomed Aſſemblies celebrated among our ſelves. Yea, I my ſelf did drive on certain brethren to keep the aſſemblies diligently, as if I had converſt among them.] And he writeth the ſame alſo to Hierax when he was baniſhed [When we were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by all and put to death we celebrated the Feaſt with joyful minds; and any place appointed us for ſeveral ſorts of ſufferings, (as the woods, the deſert ſolitudes, the toſſed ſhips, the common Innes, the horrid priſon) did ſeem fit to us in which we might keep our ſolemn Aſſemblies with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy.] That they held their Aſſemblies and offered ſacrifice uſually (when it was permitted them) in the priſons, Cyprian witneſſeth: But the Acts of the holy Martyrs do fullier ſignifie it; eſpecially thoſe moſt faithful ones called Pro-Conſular, which were taken by the publick Notaries. Certainly the Gravel-pits afforded them advantage for the celebrating of their publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, in the time of perſecution, eſpecially at Rome, where in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged gravel there remain many ſubterraneous ample receſſes: Though when the perſecution was vehement, they were thence alſo excluded; as the letters P. Cornelii ad Lupic. Epiſc. Vien. teſtifie, ſaying, [Chriſtians may not miſſas agere, keep their meetings for Church worſhip publickly, no not in the vaults, (or pits) So much of the Churches and publick aſſemblies of the Chriſtians &amp;c.</q> ſaith Baronius.</p>
               <p>Which Polyd. Virgil ſecondeth c. 6. yea the Biſhops durſt ſcarce be ſeen in the ſtreets ſo hot were the perſecutions, as Euſeb. lib. 6. cap. 31. Therefore, as I before noted, they had yet no capacious Temples, as Illyricus well gathereth, Catalog. Teſti. verit. p. 112. But they began to have days of peace and liberty under Alexand. Severus, Gordian. Philip, Galienus, Flavius, Claudius, Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Probus, and then they did enlarge their too ſmall rooms, to that deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Euſeb. lib. 8. c. 1.</p>
               <p>XXVI. Another evidence is, that Monaſteries were built before Chappels and Countrey Pariſh Churches, and far more numerous, ſo that we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read of Monaſteries under a Biſhop with their Abbot, or Presbyter, when we read little or nothing of Pariſh Churches in the Countries under him. And if theſe had been as common, why are they not as much mentioned in the ancient records of the Church? The Egyptian Monks, and thoſe in Judaea, and thoſe in Britain, in Beda, and the life of Hierome, Fulgentius, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſuch witneſs this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61252:137"/>XXVII. Another evidence is the Canons, that none but a Biſhop muſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly<note place="margin">See Leo 1.

Of which before in particular Canons.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. Another evidence is that Presbyters or Biſhops were not to remove from the Places they were Ordained in: But thoſe places of old were ſingle Churches; (uſually in Cities with the ſuburbs that could come to the ſame Church, as Dr. Field ſaith.) Concil. Arelat. 1. cited by Spelman, pag. 40.<note place="margin">Concil.

               <p>XXX. A Separatiſt or Schiſmatick was then known by his withdrawing from his proper Church; and ſo was an Apoſtate or deſerter: And he that ſtayed away certain days was to be excommunicate; And they that fall into ſins and never preſent themſelves to the Church, to ſhew their penitence, even when they fall ſick and deſire Communion, ſhall not have it till they ſhew fruits worthy of repentance, faith Concil. Arelat. 1. Can. 22. But 1. in our way, when the Church that I am of is an hundred miles long and hath above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pariſhes, who can tell when a man is at the Church, and when he is not, unleſs you make half a years work to examine the matter in a thouſand Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? 2. And a man may wander, and never be in the ſame Aſſembly once in three years, and yet be ſtill in his own Church becauſe the Doceſe is the Church: 3. Unleſs the Biſhops preſence as well as remote relation be neceſſary; And then no man cometh to Church, but he that cometh where the Biſhop is, for ubi Epiſcopus ibi Eccleſia: And the Pariſh Church is with them no Church, unleſs equivocally as a Community. For as Learned Dr. Field ſaith, (and they muſt all ſay) [None are to be ordained, but to ſerve in ſome Church: and none have Churches but Biſhops; all other being but aſſiſtants to them in their Churches.] Lib. 5. c. 27. p. 139. Therefore they call the Pariſh Prieſts the Biſhops Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; and Dr. Field maketh the Biſhops Church or Dioceſe and a particular Church all one. If then one Pariſh prieſt of a thouſand be an Arrian, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian, Socinian, Papiſt, Seeker, &amp;c. he that ſeparateth not from that one Prieſt and Pariſh meeting, ſeparateth not from his Biſhops Church, nor any particular Church: For his Church is a countrey, which while he is in, he is no Separatiſt, if he joyn with any part of it.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61252:138"/>XXXI. But my greateſt evidence which I truſt to above all the reſt is, The greatneſs of the Biſhops work, which no mortal man can truly and faithfully diſcharge and do for a Dioceſe in the oppoſed ſence, nor for more than one of our greater Pariſhes. I have recited ſome of the particulars before, and I ſhall again have occaſion to do it more at large: I now only name theſe parts.</p>
               <p>1. To be the ordinary Baptizer, or ſtill preſent with all that are Baptized, (to anoint their noſtrils, &amp;c. as aforeſaid.) 2. To be the Confirmer of all the baptized in all the Dioceſe. 3. To be the ordinary preacher to his flock, and to expound the Scriptures to them. 4. To be the only publick reconciler or abſolver of all penitents. 5. To be the publick Prieſt, to be the Guide of the people in publick worſhip, and to adminiſter the Lords Supper. 6. To take particular account and care of all the peoples ſouls, and admoniſh, teach, and exhort them as there is ſpecial need. 7. To be the Excommunicator of the impenitent (or ever one and the chief.) 8. To Ordain all Miniſters and Subminiſters. 9. To overſee and rule the Clergy. 10. To receive all Oblations, Tithes, Gifts, and Glebes, and be the diſtributer of them. 11. To viſit the ſick in all his flock. 12. To take a particular care of all the poor, the ſick, the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the impriſoned, &amp;c. as their Curator. 13. To keep almoſt daily, but conſtantly weekly Aſſemblies for all the publick offices. 14. To keep Synods among his Colleagues, Biſhops, and Presbyters. 15. To try and hear Cauſes with the Biſhops, and Synods, and with his Presbyters at home, about all ſcandals, &amp;c. that come before him, (of which one Town may find him work enough, the convincing and gentle reproof and exhortation will take up ſo much time.) 16. The looking after and convincing or confuting Hereticks. 17. The reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling diſagreeing neighbours. 18. The confecting of oyl and holy bread, &amp;c. to furniſh all his Presbyters with. 19. The Benediction of Marriages, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing of Funerals; with a multitude of other Ceremonies. 20. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the right government of his own houſe (And if he had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the education of them) 21. The overſight of all the Schools and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating young men for the Miniſtery (there being then no Univerſities to do it.) (That the Schools were under his care, you may ſee proved in Fileſacus) 22. The Conſecrating of devoted Virgins (to ſay nothing of Altars and other utenſils) 23. The overſight of the Monaſteries. 24. The writing of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Epiſtles (as they called them) to Great men, to other Churches, &amp;c. 25. The granting of Communicatory Letters. I have named all that come ſuddenly to my memory, but it's like not all. And how many Pariſhes, how many hundred thouſand ſouls can one man do all this for, think you?</p>
               <p>I will not tire you with citing out of Iſidore, Gregory, Ambroſe, Chryſoſt. &amp;c. the ſtrict Charges terribly laid on Biſhops, but only now recite the Preachers words whoſe Oration Euſebius giveth us, at the dedication of a new Church, Hiſtor. Eccl. l. 10. c. 4. It is Paulinus Biſhop of Tyre. In which he tells them that it is the work of Biſhops [Intimae animarum veſtrarum theoriae videre &amp; introſpicere, ubi experientia &amp; temporis prolixitate unumquemque veſtrum exacte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſivit, ſtudioque &amp; cura cunctos vos honeſtate &amp; doctrina quae ſecundum pietatem
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61252:138"/>
eſt, inſtruit.] It was then thought a Biſhops duty to be intimately acquainted with the minds of his flock, and exactly enquire after every one of them, even menſervants and maidſervants by name, ſaith Ignatius, as cited before.</p>
               <p>All this was then the Biſhops work: Almoſt all this (except the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) Dr. Hammond proveth induſtriouſly belonged to the Biſhop. Let him faithfully do it all, and let his Dioceſe then be as big as he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I might have added Concil. Arelat. 1. c. 16. that people are to be abſolved in the ſame place where they were Excommunicated, which intimateth it muſt be only in the Biſhops Church. And in Synod. Hybernic. Patricii (in Spelman p. 52.) All that was more than neceſſary to a poor man that had a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be laid on the Biſhops Altar,] which implyeth that each Church had one Biſhop and one Altar. And c. 21. [&amp; non in Eccleſiam ut ibi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminetur cauſa] And c. 25, 26, 27. no Clergy-man but the Biſhop to diſpoſe<note place="margin">c. 4, 5.</note> of Church offerings; &amp; Clericus Epiſcopi in Plebe novus ingreſſor, baptizare &amp; offerre non licet, &amp;c. with much more which intimateth what Churches were of old.</p>
               <p>But ſo much ſhall ſuffice for proof of the Minor of the firſt Argument, that our Dioceſane Form, 1. taketh down the Church Form of Gods Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the primitive Churches poſſeſſion: 2. And ſetteth up a humane form in its ſtead, yea one only Church inſtead of a thouſand or many hundred.</p>
               <p>And therefore I add</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That the Dioceſans cauſe the errour of the Separatiſts, who avoid our Churches as falſe in their Conſtitution; and would utterly diſable us to confute them.</head>
               <p>WHen the Browniſts ſay that our Churches are no true Churches, they do not mean that they are not Societies of mens deviſing; but that they are not Societies of Gods Inſtituting. And this they prove upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Dioceſans thus: If your Churches be of Gods Inſtitution (de ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) it is either the Pariſh Churches, or the Dioceſane Churches that are ſo: But neither the Pariſh-Churches, nor the Dioceſane: Ergo.</p>
               <p>1. That the Pariſh Churches are not ſuch, they prove becauſe by the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans own confeſſion, they are no Churches at all, except equivocally ſo called: It is one of their own principles, (and we grant it) that Epiſcopus &amp; Plebs Conſtitute a Church, as a King and Subjects conſtitute a Kingdom, and as a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61252:139"/>
Schoolmaſter and Scholars make a School: and as a Maſter and houſhold make a Family. And that ubi eſt Epiſcopus (as Cyprian ſaith) ibi eſt Eccleſia; which is nothing but Plebs paſtori adunata. And that a people without a Biſhop (truly ſo called) are but a Church equivocally, as Scholars without a Maſter are a School, or as a company of Chriſtians in a ſhip or houſe accidentally met, and praying together are a Church, &amp;c. And as Dr. Field before cited, ſaith, None but a Biſhop hath a Church: all others are but his aſſiſtants, or as commonly called his Curates. Therefore when a Prelatiſt pleadeth that our Pariſh Churches are true Churches (either of Gods or mans inſtitution) they do forſake the principles of their party (as now maintained) or they contradict themſelves, or they play with equivocations and ambiguities.</p>
               <p>II. And that a Dioceſane Church, which is one compoſed of the carcaſes of multitude of mortified Churches, is not jure divino, having ſaid ſo much to prove my ſelf, I will not ſtay to tell you how eaſily the Separatiſts may prove it. So that for my part as much as I have written and done againſt them, I profeſs I am not able to confute them on the Dioceſane grounds, but would be one of them if I had no better.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ans. Thus or not at all by me. A Presbyters office is not to be judged of by the Biſhops will or deſcription, but by God's the inſtitutor. As if the King deſcribe the Lord Mayors office in his Charter; If the Recorder or whoever giveth him his oath, and inſtalleth him, ſhall miſdeſcribe the office, and limit it, and ſay falſly you have no power to do this or that; This will not at all diminiſh his power, as long as it is the Charter that they profeſs to go by. He ſhall have the power which the King giveth, and not which the inveſting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter deſcribeth. If a Parſon preſented to a Benefice, ſhall be told by the Biſhop at his inſtitution, the Tithes or Glebe are but half yours, this ſhall not diminiſh his Title to the whole. So when God hath deſcribed the Miniſters office, it ſhall be what God ſaith it is, and not what the Ordainer ſaith it is. And God maketh the Paſtors of each particular body of fixed Communicants, united as aforeſaid, to be really a Biſhop (or at leaſt the chief of these Paſtors, or the ſole Paſtor:) And therefore the Church to be truly and univocally a Church of Divine inſtitution: Though it were never ſo much granted that Archbiſhops were over them, as the Apoſtles were overthoſe Acts 14. 23.</p>
               <p>And then when the Pariſh Churches are once proved true Churches, whether the Dioceſane be ſo or not, is nothing to our controverſie with the Separatiſts. But for my part I cannot confute the lawfulneſs of a Dioceſe as conſiſting of many particular Churches with their Biſhops, as I can a Dioceſe which hath put them all down.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The ſecond Argument: from the Depoſition of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpecies of Biſhops, and the erecting of a humane inconſiſtent ſpecies in their ſtead: A ſpecifick diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proved.</head>
               <head>ARGUMENT II.</head>
               <p>A Humane inconſiſtent ſpecies of Biſhops erected inſtead of the Divinely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtituted ſpecies thereby depoſed, is unlawful. But ſuch is the Dioceſan ſpecies now oppoſed—Ergo.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto charged it with the changing of the Church Form: Now of the form or ſpecies of Biſhops. And here I need not add much to the former, becauſe they are coincident, and in proving the one I have already proved the other.</p>
               <p>A Biſhop of one Church united for Individuals Communion, and a Biſhop of one Church united only for Communion in ſpecie actionum, are not the ſame. But becauſe I hear many ſay that Magis &amp; Minus non variant ſpeciem, And that a Greater and a Leſſer Dioceſe make neither the Church, nor Biſhop to be of a different ſpecies, I am here to prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>And firſt let it be remembred in what predicament the things in queſtion are, a Church and a Biſhop: That is, They are relations. Then let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what goeth to the eſſence and definition of a Relation, that is, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the Correlate, the Subject, the Fundamentum (or as ſome ſpeak the Ratio fundandi alſo) and the Terminus. Now where theſe are not the ſame, or any of theſe, then the Relation is not the ſame: becauſe where an eſſential ingredient is wanting, the eſſence is wanting.</p>
               <p>Again it muſt be remembred that many Natural Relations are ſo founded in an act paſt, that the Relation reſulteth from it without depending on any thing future. As God is Creator quia jam creavit, Pater eſt qui genuit. But there are other Relations which are founded in meer Undertaking, Mandate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and obligation to future actions: As he is a Tutor, a Schoolmaſter, a Judge, a Chancellor, a Pilot, a Biſhop, a Husband, &amp;c. who by mandate and undertaking is authorized and obliged to ſuch and ſuch works, implyed in the names. And in theſe caſes, there is nothing more ſpecifieth the offices than the work of the office, which is, its neareſt End. And theſe neareſt ends are ever eſſential to ſuch Relations; whether you will call them the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmini or End, or by what other name, we contend not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61252:140"/>And therefore Aquinas and all, 1. 2. q. 18. art. 2. and others commonly agree, that the Object and the End do ſpecifie humane acts.</p>
               <p>But remote ends may be the ſame in Acts, (and ſo in Offices) of the ſame ſpecies; It proving but a Generical agreement (which yet may be in ſpecie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterna.) All humane Acts ſhould have the ſame ultimate end, that is, The pleaſing of God in the reſplendency of his Glory, and the felicity of man. Yet this maketh them not all of the ſame infimae ſpeciei. All Government intendeth the common good; and yet there are different ſpecies of Government. All Church Government is for the good of the Church, and for the killing of ſin, and the promoting of faith and holineſs: And yet there are different ſpecies of Church Governours.</p>
               <p>But beſides the Object and End, (which all agree to) there are by Schoolmen and Caſuiſts, ſaid to be circumſtances, which may alſo ſpecifie Moral acts. The<note place="margin">Aqu. 1. 2. q. 18. art. 3. 5. &amp; 10. &amp; q. 72. art. 9. &amp; Cajet. &amp; Medin. ib.</note> ſeven named by Cicero in Rhetor. are, Quis, Quid, Ubi, Quibus auxiliis, Cur, Quomodo, Quando: And Aquinas and others tell us that theſe circumſtances communicate ſpecial Goodneſs or evil to actions. Vid. P. Soto in relect. 5. in fine de bonit. &amp; mal. act. Greg. de Valent. tom. 2. qu. 13. puncto 4. Joſ. Angles in Florib. 2. ſent. d. 37. q. 3. a. 5. p. 2.</p>
               <p>Greg Sayrus in Clav. Regia Lib. 2. Cap. 3. pag. 54. giveth us theſe two notes to know when circumſtances ſpecifie actions.</p>
               <p>1. Quando Circumſtantia novam conformitatem, aut deformitatem actui tribuit; ita ut peculiariter conveniat vel repugnet rectae rationi, novam ſpeciem conſtituit: Rat. Quia in hoc caſu circumſtantia tranſit in rationem objecti—2. Quotieſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que circumſtantia non reſpicit ſpecialem ordinem rationis in bono vel malo niſi praeſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita alia circumſtantia a qua actus moralis habet ſpeciem boni vel mali quam ſolam intra eandem ſpeciem auget, vel diminuit, reddendo actum illum meliorem aut pejo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, toties circumſtantia illa aggravans vel diminuens, non autem ſpeciem mutans, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenda eſt: ut quantitas v. g. magna vel parva in furto.</p>
               <p>Note alſo that though Relatio in forma relationis, non recipit magis &amp; minus; e. g. Titius non eſt magis Pater quam Sempronius; Yet quoad ſubjectum, &amp; aliquando quoad fundamentum &amp; correlatum, it may recipere magis &amp; minus, ſo that magis vel minus ſhall change the ſpecies. This is in ſuch caſes, wherein the alteration of Quantity altereth the Capacity of the ſubject quoad finem eſſentialem. For as in Phyſicks, beſides the Matter, the Diſpoſitio materiae (which Ariſtotle calls Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) is neceſſary ad formam recipiendam (which is comonly called A third Principle; but I would call it, the Conditio neceſſaria of the Material Principle;) ſo in Relations there muſt be the Diſpoſitio neceſſaria ſubjecti, or elſe there can no relation reſult. E. g. to the being of a houſe, ſome quantity is neceſſary to the End, that is, habitation; And therefore it is no houſe, except equivocally which is no bigger than an egg-ſhell: So to the being of a Ship, of a Church, &amp;c. that which is no bigger than a nutſhel is no Ship or Church, though you call it ſo or Conſecrate it, &amp;c. And on the other ſide, It is not a ſpoon, a diſh, a ladle, a pen, which is as big as a Church, a Ship, a Houſe. Yea a Ship and a Boat do differ in ſpecie, though both have the ſame End, (ſafe paſſage over the waters by portage) by the circumſtantial differences of the End and Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61252:140"/>So alſo in Societies; the whole world, or a Kingdom is too big to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: And a Family is too little to be a Kingdom. Pagus, Vicus, Civitas, Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num differ principally in their Ends, and next in their Quantity of the ſubject matter, becauſe every quantity is not capable of the ſame Eſſential End.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, for the uſe of ſuch ignorant Lads only as know them not, who may poſſibly ſtudy the controverſie, I proceed to my proofs.</p>
               <p>I. And I will begin (though it be weakeſt in it ſelf) with an Argument ad hominem; For with the men that I now deal with, I ſhall take that to be the moſt effectual argument, which is fetcht from their intereſt, and fitted to their wills. I remember that once when an Army was reſolved for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for all that profeſſed the fundamentals of faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Parliament appointed ſome of us to draw up a Catalogue of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, (which I thought was beſt done by giving them the Sacramental Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue) a good man, (with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his mind) would needs have many more fundamentals, than I was for, and among others, (That to allow our ſelves or others in known ſin, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſalvation (or is damnable) I told him that I would not diſpute againſt it, but undertake to make him caſt it by without diſpute: And when they would not believe me, but went on, I did all that I promiſed preſently with telling them, You know that the Parliament take Independency to be a ſin; and they will ſay, If we allow or tolerate them, they here pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of damnation on us under their own hands] Dictum factum; we had no more of that fundamental.</p>
               <p>I have greater confidence of prevailing with Dioceſans by ſuch an argument: In taking the Covenant, in the Weſtminſter Aſſembly, it would not paſs till the parentheſis deſcribing the Engliſh ſpecies of Prelacy was inſerted; becauſe many declared that they were not againſt all Epiſcopacy, but only the preſent Engliſh ſpecies. Accordingly thoſe that took the Covenant in that ſenſe, take not themſelves bound to endeavour the extirpation of all Epiſcopacy but only of that ſpecies: And they that would have conformed on the terms of the Kings Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, went on this ſuppoſition that the ſpecies of Prelacy was altered by it. Now I put theſe queſtions to the Dioceſans. Queſt. 1. If a Uſurper by power ſhould take down all the Dioceſans (and their lands, Lordſhips, and Courts) and turn them into Pariſh Biſhops, and ſay, I alter not the ſpecies but the degree, would they believe him? Queſt. 2. If one that thinketh himſelf obliged by the Vow or Covenant againſt this ſpecies only, ſhould think that he anſwereth his obligation, if he procure no other alteration than is made in the Kings forenamed Declaration, would they tell him, You alter not the ſpecies unleſs you totally extirpate Epiſcopacy: (ſuppoſing that he had power to do it.) Queſt. 3. Seeing moſt that we ſpeak with who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and who take or plead for the Oxford Oath [Never to endeavour any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Church Government] do tell us that the meaning is only that we will not endeavour to alter the preſent ſpecies, which is Epiſcopacy, and not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, as Chancellors, &amp;c. I ask, If it ſhould pleaſe the King to take
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61252:141"/>
down all Dioceſanes, and to ſet up only a Biſhop in every Pariſh or Independent Church, &amp; ſay, I change not the ſpecies; or if I believed that this were a Change of the Engliſh ſpecies of Church Government I would not do it: what anſwer would they give to this? Queſt. 4. If a Conformiſt or one that hath taken that Oath, ſhall ſay, I did ſubſcribe and ſwear only not to endeavour an alteration of the ſpecies, but not of the degree: Therefore I will do all that I can to take down Dioceſans, and to ſet up Congregational or Parochial Biſhops in their ſtead, will you tell this man that indeed by ſo doing he endeavoureth not to change the ſpecies? Queſt. 5. Seeing many of the greateſt oppoſers of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, do conſent to a Congregational or Parochial Biſhop, will you grant that theſe are not at all your adverſaries as to the ſpecies of Church Government, but only as to the degree or extent of Dioceſes? Theſe caſes are practical: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed how you reſolve them, left you do that which you are unwilling of. Queſt. 6. And I may ask, Why is it that many deny that it was a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Epiſcopal men, that raiſed the Army againſt the King, only becauſe in the Propoſition ſent to Nottingham they would have had Epiſcopacy reduced to what is there intimated, and would have had their power ſhortned? Come, come, deny not the plain truth, If magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem, Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament men, yea, and the Learnedeſt part of that Synod who took down Biſhops, were Epiſcopal men, yea, Prelatiſts as you are, for they were but for a Gradual alteration at the beginning of their war, till they were carried fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by neceſſity and intereſt. Queſt. 7. And I ask you alſo, why, and with what front do you call us all Presbyterians, who offered Biſhop Uſhers Model to the King and you in 1660. as the terms of Concord? Is it againſt your Conſciences meerly to make us odious with you know whom? what can it be better, if you grant that we are not only for Epiſcopacy in genere, but even for the ſame ſpecies with your ſelves? Yea, thoſe that are againſt Biſhop Uſhers Model, and are only for Congregational or Pariſh Biſhops, are it ſeemeth even for your ſpecies: And are they not then Epiſcopal as well as you? So much ad hominem; now ad rem.</p>
               <p>II. Where the ſpecifying Ends differ, there the Species of Relations differ. But in the Churches and the Biſhops in queſtion the ſpecifying Ends differ: Ergo &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I will firſt manifeſt the truth of the Minor (for the Major is unqueſtionable) of Churches, and next of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>1. The ends of a particular Church as deſcribed by us are theſe: 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſenſible and external; 2. And that local or preſential; 3. And that perſonal by all the body of the Church; 4. And that in the ſame Individual acts of Gods publick worſhip. 5. In watching over, or helping each other towards Heaven, by provoking each other to love and to good works, and if a brother offend to tell him of his fault; to comfort each other, and to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in holineſs, love and peace. 6. To be related to the ſame Paſtors, as thoſe that are their Ordinary Teachers, Governours and Guides in publick worſhip, as labouring amongſt them and being enſamples to the flock. 7. To hold a diſtant Communion with the neighbour aſſociated concordant Churches,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61252:141"/>
and particularly with thoſe neareſt them of the firſt order of Compoſition; of which aſſociation this particular Church is a part, for Communion of Churches as they are themſelves a Society for Communion of Individual Chriſtians in a ſingle Church.</p>
               <p>2. Now the ends of our Dioceſane Churches are not one of all theſe. For 1. Their Communion is internal in Faith and Love; ſuch as we have with the Abaſſines. 2. It is diſtant only, and not preſential at all: For as Dioceſane we never ſee each other it's like in our whole lives. 3. It is not perſonal (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſenſible) but only by the intervention of Delegates, Meſſengers, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or Synods of ſuch. 4. It is only in eadem ſpecie of publick worſhip and ſacred actions that we have Communion, but not in the ſame Individual acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of worſhip: And ſo we may have Communion with the Antipodes, while we believe the ſame Scriptures and Creed, and uſe the ſame Sacraments, &amp;c. in ſpecie. 5. We have no converſe with one another at all as Dioceſane: (though as Parochial we may)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we never meet together, pray together, hear together, exhort or watch over or help each other: If a Brother treſpaſs we tell him not of his fault, &amp;c. for we never know one of five hundred in the Dioceſe, no more than men of another Countrey. 6. We hear not the ſame Teachers; we have not the ſame Guides to reſolve our doubts, and to inſtruct us as we need; We have not the ſame Prieſts to joyn with in Gods publick worſhip: But he that Teacheth and officiateth in one Church, hath no power in another: Only we have the ſame Biſhop to call (not the people before him to teach and warn and comfort them, but) the Parſon and Churchwardens; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame Lay-Chancellor and his Court, and the ſame Canons (for ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Miniſters, Excommunicating many conſcionable Nonconformiſts, &amp;c.) which not only all the Dioceſe hath, but all the Land. Not one of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Dioceſe ever ſeeth the Biſhop in all his life. 7. A Dioceſe is it ſelf a compound of particular Churches aſſociated (Though mortified quantum in Dioceſanis;) And therefore cannot be a conſtitutive part of ſuch a firſt order of Aſſociation, as a particular Church may be or is. Theſe are the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Ends.</p>
               <p>Now lay all theſe together, and try, whether the differences in ſo many parts of the Ends of the Society, make not a Specifick difference in Societies. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther [a company of Chriſtians aſſociated with the ſame preſent Paſtors, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential perſonal Communion in Gods publick worſhip, Sacraments, Teaching, and Guidance, and for mutual aſſiſtance in holy converſe and living, &amp;c. and cohabiting in a vicinity capable of this converſe and Communion] be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the ſame ſpecies with [A company of Congregations aſſociated (or rather never aſſociated) to hold a diſtant Communion in the ſame ſpecies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, Prayer, Sacraments, &amp;c. under ſeveral appropriate Paſtors, not living (ut Parochiani<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in any ſuch vicinity as may render them capable of any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid preſent aſſiſtances or Communion: (unleſs in travail men accidentally come together as, we may do with men of other lands.)] It is notorious that theſe Eſſentiating Ends of the two ſorts of Societies are diſtinct; and therefore the Societies are eſſentially diſtinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61252:142"/>Even as a City, Burrough, or Corporation, are part of a Kingdom, and are ſpecifically diſtinct ſocieties from the Kingdom. (For the Parts may have a proper ſubordinate ſpecification, which all ſet together may conſtitute one more comprehenſive ſpecies: As a Clock, and the ſeveral wheels and parts of that Clock may differ in ſpecie, though not as coordinate ſpecies) A Kingdom may poſſibly be no bigger than a City: But yet the form of a Kingdom and of a City do differ in the Ends of the Societies. So a Family in ſpecie differeth from a City, which is compact of many Families: ſo a Troop differeth in ſpecie from a Regiment, and a Regiment from an Army, a Colledge from an Univerſity, a bed-chamber which is part of an houſe from an houſe, though yet it's poſſible that a houſe may be but one room, and an Univerſity but one Colledge, and an Army but one Regiment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now let us enquire whether de jure divino there ought to be ſuch a Society as I have deſcribed, aſſociating for perſonal preſent Communion and aſſiſtance as aforeſaid. And this I have fully proved before Chap. 3. Acts 14. 23. They ordained them Elders in every Church. 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. Know them that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among and are over you in the Lord, and highly eſteem them in love for their works ſake: and be at peace among your ſelves. Heb. 13. 7. 17. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the word of God. Act. 20. 28. Take heed to your ſelves and to all the flock, &amp;c. v. 31. I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears. 20. publickly and houſe by houſe. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. The Elders that are among you, &amp;c. feed the flock (not a particle of the flock) Mat. 18. 15. If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, tell him his fault between thee and him; If he hear thee not, take two—If he hear not them, tell the Church—If with Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, de Synedr. and the Eraſtians by the Church were meant the Sanhedrim, it would tend to the confirmation of what we plead for; conſidering how thin both Council (and Synagogues) were, and in how ſmall places. But againſt that ſence, ſee Galaſpies Aarons Rod, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Heb. 10. 22. &amp;c. Forſake not the aſſembling of your ſelves together, But exhort one another—1 Cor. 11. When ye come together in the Church, 1 Cor. 14, &amp;c. See the Text as forecited Chap. 3.</p>
               <p>It is then manifeſt that Churches aſſociated for ſuch preſent Communion of Chriſtians, is of Gods appointment, which Thorndike in a ſet Treatiſe proveth to be the ground of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>2. Next I will ſhew that the Biſhops of ſuch a particular Church and of a compound Dioceſe are offices ſpecifically different (a finibus.)</p>
               <p>1. The Biſhop of a particular Church is related to another Correlate, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically diſtinct from the ſaid Dioceſane: Therefore his office is ſpecifically diſtinct. The Antecedent is before proved, and the Conſequence no ſober man will queſtion.</p>
               <p>2. And their works are ſpecifically diſtinct.</p>
               <p>1. The work of the one is, 1. To be the ordinary publick Teacher of the Church; 2. To Congregate the Church; 3. To be their Guide in preſent worſhip; 4. To give them the Lords Supper; 5. To watch over and guide them perſonally in their converſation; and ſo of the reſt forenamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61252:142"/>2. The work of the other is, 1. To ſend Curates to be the ordinary Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Guides, and Prieſts to the people; even to each Pariſh one. 2. To have a Lay Chancellors Court to trouble them in a ſecular mode, and to judge men to excommunication and abſolution. 3. To viſit ſome Towns in his Dioceſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there to call together the Clergy and Churchwardens, once in three years, (or a year if he pleaſe.) 4. To have an Archdeacon to keep ſome kind of Courts under him in certain places, by himſelf or his official. 5. To grant Licences to Marry: 6. And to preach: 7. And to eat fleſh in Lent. 8. To ſuſpend or ſilence Preachers. 9. To lay his hands on Children or others, for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Confirmation; perhaps on the thouſandth or five hundredth part of his Dioceſe, (though dejure he ſhould do it to every one) 10. To preach as oft as he pleaſe in his Cathedral, or where he will.</p>
               <p>But as for the aforeſaid work of a Biſhop of a particular Church, he is not to do it, nor any one part of it, that I know of. For whereas the true office of ſuch a Biſhop is (as Dr. Hammond in his Annotat. well deſcribeth it) by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial participation to ſubſerve Chriſt to his whole flock in the threefold work of a teacher, a Prieſt, and a Ruler, he doth no one part of all. 1. Inſtead of Teaching his flock, he (if he be one of the extraordinary beſt) doth only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly preach once or twice a week to the thouſandth or five hundredth or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of his flock: (But ſo do very few of them, but ſome it may be once in a month or a year) And as to the perſonal care of their Souls, he hath not one Pariſh that he taketh the care of, to teach them perſonally. 2. He ſeldom doth officiate in publick Prayer, Praiſe, and Sacrament to any part of his flock: And when he doth, it is but to a particle of the foreſaid proportion: But when others do it, he ſaith, He doth it by them. 3. He doth not at all govern his flock with that which is the true Paſtoral Government; which is in perſon among them to guide them, and reſolve their doubts, and admit thoſe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that are fit, and refuſe the unfit; To admoniſh all the ſcandalous and unruly, as perſonally known to him, to watch over them and confirm the weak, and refel ſeducers when they come among them. But inſtead of this, he never ſeeth them, (as to the main body of his flock) nor knoweth them, but ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth their Teachers and Church-wardens, (and ſuch as others that dwell among them, or his Apparitors will accuſe to him) to come before his Lay-Chancellours Court, as aforeſaid, and in his Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itation to meet him: ſo that here is none of the ſame work no nor Government it ſelf, but another kind of Government.</p>
               <p>And here note, 1. That the foreſaid three parts of the office (Teaching, Worſhipping, and Ruling) are all Eſſential to the office; ſo that if he wanted but any One of them, he were not an Officer of the ſame ſpecies with thoſe that have them all, much more if he have but One, yea, not One of all.</p>
               <p>2. That the flock or Church is not to be denominated from a ſmall or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of it, but from the main Body. Therefore he that is the Teacher but of one Congregation of a thouſand, or many hundreds, or ſcores, is not to be therefore called, the Teacher of that Church or Flock, which conſiſteth of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61252:143"/>
ſo many Congregations: And ſo alſo for Worſhip and perſonal conduct, He is not a Prieſt to that flock, &amp;c. Much leſs when he undertaketh not one Pariſh.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>So you may ſay of one of the old City Churches, ſuch as </hi> Alexandria <hi>where the Biſhop preached but to one Congregation; or of our Pariſhes that have Chappels, where the Curate teacheth in the Chappels; or wherever there are many Presbyters to a Congregation: All do not preach, at leaſt to all the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. I doubt not but Alexandria and all ſuch places, ſhould have had many Churches and Biſhops, as the Chriſtians grew too many to be in and under one.</p>
               <p>2. But yet when they had ſeveral Churches and Presbyters, the people were not at all tyed to their own Pariſhes, but might come to hear and joyn with the Biſhop as oft as they pleaſed: which though they could not do all at once, they might do by turns, ſome one day and ſome another: And ſo they did. So that ſtill they had perſonal Communion with him, though not every day. 3. And they lived in Vicinity, where they were capable of Converſe, and perſonal notice, and private help from one another. 4. And the Presbyters all joyned in perſonal overſight or Government of the whole flock, and were each one capable of perſonal admonition and exhortation to any member. 5. And thoſe that attended the Biſhop and did not frequently officiate in the chief acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet were preſent with the Church, and aſſiſted him in officiating, and were ready to do the reſt when ever he appointed them or there was need: ſo that though quoad exercitium they did not the chief parts of the work every day, or uſually, yet, 1. it was all the three parts of the Paſtoral office which they did, and undertook to do, in ſeaſon: 2. And that to the ſame Church in perſon by themſelves. So that though Churches that ſwell to a diſordered bulk, are not in that perfect order as more capable Societies may be; yet whileſt their Communion is perſonal, preſent, as aforeſaid, the Church ſpecies is not altered as in our Dioceſes it is.</p>
               <p>III. A divers fundamentum vel ratio fundandi, proveth a diverſity of Relations: But a true Pariſh Biſhop and our Dioceſanes have fundamenta that are in ſpecie divers; And ſo have a particular Church and a Dioceſane Church: Ergo, a Pariſh Church and Biſhop, and a Dioceſane Church and Biſhop are ſpecie divers.</p>
               <p>The Major is undeniable. The Minor I prove by ſhewing the diverſity.</p>
               <p>1. The Fundamentum of the Relation of a Particular Church, is either 1. Of the Relation of the Church to God: 2. Or their relation as fellow members one to another: 3. Or of their joynt relation to their Paſtors or Biſhops: 4. Or of their Biſhops or Paſtors relation to them. For certainly a Church is not only compounded of various Materials, but its form is a compounded of theſe Four Relations ſet together, and every one is Eſſential to it (And he that cannot diſtinguiſh cannot underſtand.) Now everyone of all theſe compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relations, is founded in a mutual conſent.</p>
               <p>1. The Relation of the Members, Paſtors, and the whole Church to God is founded in Gods conſent and theirs: Gods is ſignified 1. By his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Inſtitution and Command: 2. By his qualifying and diſpoſing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 3. By his providential giving them opportunity: 4. And ad ordinem
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61252:143"/>
where it can be had, by the Ordainers (as to the Paſtors relation) who are Gods miniſters to inveſt them in the office, 5. And by his moving the hearts of the People to conſent (which belongeth to the giving of opportunity.)</p>
               <p>The Relation of all theſe to God, is ſecondarily founded in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (that it may be a Contract:) The Paſtors expreſs theirs, in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in general, and in their Induction or fixing in that particular Church, to the Ordainers, and to the people. The members expreſs their conſent, either plainly in a Contract, or impliedly by actual convention and ſubmiſſion, and performing of their duties.</p>
               <p>2. The Relation of the members to each other, is founded in their ſaid Explicite or Implicite conſent among themſelves, joyned to their foreſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to God.</p>
               <p>3. The Relation of the Members to their Paſtors, is founded Remotely in the ſaid ſignification of Gods will, by his Word and Providence, and by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers, (for they are but Miniſters, and operate but by ſignifying Gods will.) And nextly, by the mutual conſent of the People and the Paſtors.</p>
               <p>4. The Relation of the Paſtors to the flock is accordingly founded, 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely in the ſaid ſignification of Gods will by his Word, Gifts, Diſpoſition, Opportunity, and by the Miniſtery of the Ordainers: 2. And nextly by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Paſtors and People. Thus is a particular Church-relation founded, and all theſe parts are neceſſary thereunto.</p>
               <p>But as for our Dioceſane Churches, which have no particular Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, nor Biſhops, but only Congregations with ſeveral Curates, being not politically and properly Churches, (For I meddle not with ſuch A. Biſhops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes as conſiſt of many true Churches with their proper Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) let us ſee from what foundation they reſult.</p>
               <p>1. As to their Relation to God, he never expreſſed his Conſent, nor owneth them (that ever I could hear proved) And therefore the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is wanting. Thoſe that go Dr. Stillingfleet's and Biſhop Reynold's way, and ſay, No Form of Government is of Gods appointment, do grant that the Dioceſane form is not: But that the Congregational form is, I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore they have not the ſame Foundation.</p>
               <p>2. And as to the Relation of the Members of a Dioceſe to one another, there is no mutual conſent truly nor ſeemingly ſignified by them: what ever ſome few may do, who are not the Dioceſe, it is certain that the Dioceſe as ſuch do neither Explicitely nor Impliedly by word or deed expreſs any ſuch Church conſent, but rather the clean contrary. For 1. Their Dwelling in the Dioceſe is no more a profeſſion of conſent, than the Chriſtians dwelling in Conſtantinople ſheweth them to be Mahometans: For their Anceſtors there lived, and they have no other dwelling.</p>
               <p>2. Their chooſing a Parliament who conſent is no proof of their conſent. 1. Becauſe it is not paſt a ſixth or tenth or twentieth part of the Members that chooſe Parliament men. 2. Becauſe they never intend to chooſe them for any ſuch uſe as to be the chooſers of their Religion, or Church, and to diſpoſe of their Souls: But only to regulate Church matters according to Gods word, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61252:144"/>
when they go againſt, they go beyond, and againſt the peoples conſent. As in chooſing Parliament men, we do not truſt them to chooſe husbands and wives and Maſters and ſervants for all the people: Nor can we commit that truſt (for the choice of our Religion or Church) to others ſtatedly, which Gods Word and Nature have bound us to uſe our ſelves. Or if ſuch miſchooſe for us, they diſoblige us from accepting their choice. I am ſure the Papiſts think not that they chooſe Parliament men to chooſe a Church for them: Nor would the Prelatiſts think ſo, if the Parliament ſhould prove Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptiſts, or Papiſts.</p>
               <p>3. The Dioceſe doth not ſignifie Conſent to a Church relation, by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens or accuſed perſons coming to the Chancellors or Biſhops Courts. For 1. It is but a ſmall number comparatively that do ſo. 2. They are compelled, and are well known to come full ſorely againſt their wills: They are undone if they refuſe: And ſubmiſſion and patience, are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection nor conſent. 3. They moſt commonly profeſs to come to theſe Courts in obedience to the King, and as they are empowered by him, and ſtrengthened by his ſword: And not at all as Church-Paſtors empowered by Chriſt: For who taketh the Chancellor to be ſuch?</p>
               <p>4. The appearance of the Clergy at the Biſhops Viſitation, and their Conformity, is no proof of the peoples conſent. For the Miniſters are diſtinct perſons, and have a diſtinct intereſt, and are no way empowered to ſignifie the peoples conſent.</p>
               <p>5. Yea, they ſhew their diſſent, 1. By being ſo backward to be made Church-wardens: 2. So backward to take their Oaths: 3. So backward to preſent: 4. So backward to appear at their Courts. 5. Doing it on a civil account as obeying the Kings Officers. 6. So few of them ever coming to a Biſhop to be inſtructed, reſolved, yea or for the ceremony of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>So that the people can never be proved to conſent to a Dioceſane Church State.</p>
               <p>And if they had, that is not the ſame as a conſent to a Congregational or Pariſh Church State.</p>
               <p>3. The ſame I need not ſay over again as to the Dioceſane Biſhop, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and Archdeacon: They conſent to the Pariſh Miniſters where they are tolerable, by word or daily attendance in Gods worſhip: But I know England ſo well as that I know that as they never chooſe their Biſhops, or Chancellors, (but the King chooſeth them, and a Dean and a few Prebends pro forma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) ſo they are never called to expreſs their conſent, nor do any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the Dioceſe uſually conſent indeed; ſome never mind ſuch matters: others ſay, the King may put in whom he will; it is no act of theirs: others had rather have a good one than a bad one, but had rather yet have none at all, eſpecially of late ſince ſo many hundred Miniſters are ſilenced. And ſome would have Biſhops to ſilence the Miniſters, and ſome are for them on a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But it's no conſiderable part of the Dioceſe that ſignifieth Conſent. And as for the formal demand to the ſtanders by at the Conſecration, whether
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61252:144"/>
any of them have any thing againſt the Biſhop, it's a ceremony fitter for a ſtage, than to come here into an Argument.</p>
               <p>4. And as for the Biſhops and Chancellors relation to the People, when it wants the word of God, and his conſent, and the peoples conſent, and hath but the Kings collation, the Deans and Chapters formal conſent, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Conformiſt Miniſters conſent, I may well conclude that here is not the ſame Fundamentum as is of the Parochial and Paſtors Church relation.</p>
               <p>IV. And where there is not the ſame Relate and Correlate, there is not the ſame Relation. But a Parochial Church and Paſtor, and a Dioceſane Church and Paſtor, are not the ſame Relate and Correlate. Ergo.</p>
               <p>If they be, let them become Parochial Biſhops and be ſtill the ſame. But what I have ſaid of the difference of Ends and Foundations proveth this; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Chriſtians into one Church primi ordinis for perſonal Communion, is not the ſame with a Combination of Congregations for Communion mental or by delegates only. And ſo of the Biſhops of theſe ſeveral Churches.</p>
               <p>V. If a Congregational Church or Paſtor be of the ſame ſpecies with our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſane Churches and Prelates, then a Church that extendeth through all the Kingdom, yea to many Kingdoms, yea to the Eaſt and Weſt Indies or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes may be of the ſame ſpecies alſo (and ſo its Paſtor.) And ſo the Pope and his Church may be of the ſame, (as to the magnitude) But the conſequent is falſe: Ergo, ſo is the antecedent.</p>
               <p>The conſequence in the Major is evident, becauſe there is eadem ratio; For their reaſon of denominating a Church One is becauſe it hath One Biſhop; and by their Principles there may be one Biſhop to a Province, to a Kingdom, to an Empire, to the World.</p>
               <p>When all the ſubordinate Biſhopricks were taken down to make up this Dioceſane Church of Lincoln which I live in, the Church was One, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was many. And if all the Biſhops were taken down except the two Archbiſhops, the two remaining Churches I confeſs would be of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with a Dioceſe. Yea, if there were but One Church and Biſhop in the Land. And why might not all Europe on theſe terms make one particular Church? If you ſay, Becauſe they are not under one King, I anſwer, 1. That's no reaſon: A King is a Civil extrinſick Accidental head of a Church as a Church; and not a Conſtitutive Head: But a Biſhop is an Intrinſecal, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Conſtitutive head, without whom it is no Church (unleſs equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.) 2. Ten Kings may agree to give way to One Biſhop in all their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms (as they have done to the Papcy.) 3. The Roman Empire was bigger than Europe: Why then might not that have been one only Church of the ſame Species with a Dioceſe?</p>
               <p>If they ſay that it is becauſe one man is not capable of doing the work of a Biſhop for ſo many Countreys. I Anſwer, Per ſe, he cannot do it for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of a Dioceſe: Per alios he may do it for all Europe: It is but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſome who ſhall appoint others, who ſhall appoint others, (and ſo to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61252:145"/>
the end of the chapter) to do it. There is but one Abuna in Abaſſia to Ordain, (though numerous Biſhops, who have not the Generative faculty; which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius makes to be the difference between a Biſhop and a Presbyter, that the one begets Fathers and the other but Sons: Their Countrey was converted by an Eunuch.) It would be a notable diſpute whether all the reſt be true Biſhops or not (I think Yea; the Prelatiſts muſt think Nay.) And yet Brierwood ſaith that Abaſſia (after all its great diminutions) is as big as Italy, France, Spain, and Germany. And doth not the Pope govern per alios yet far more, and pretend to govern the whole Chriſtian World? while he ſendeth one to Goa, another to Mexico, (and Oviedo to Abaſſia, would they but have received him.)</p>
               <p>Obj. But he hath other Biſhops under him, therefore he is not ejuſdem ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciei as a Dioceſe. Anſw. But the Abuna hath no Ordainers under him. And the Biſhop hath Chancellors, Deans, Arch-deacons, Surrogates, Officials, and ſometimes in the days of old had Suffragans too, under him. (Queſt. Was a Dioceſe then, One Church, or two?) And what if a Patriarch or Pope put down all Biſhops under him, and exerciſe his power only by other ſorts of officers? (They that can demiſe, grant, let, what parts they pleaſe of their own office, may deviſe enow.)</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it would not alter the ſpecies, what if it ſhould pleaſe the King and Parliament to put down all the Biſhops of England ſave One? I hope the Biſhops would not take that to be againſt the Canon of 1640. nor againſt the Oxford Oath [of never endeavouring to Conſent or Alter the Church Covernment] (if it could have been paſt to be taken by the Parliament) Becauſe the ſpecies is not altered: And they tell us Nonconformiſts to draw us to Swear, that they mean but the ſpecies. I make no doubt but at the rates of our preſent Ordinations, One Biſhop or Abuna with Chaplains enow, may Ordain Prieſts enow, (and too many of all conſcience) for all the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and may ſilence preachers enow, and may ſet up Chancellors, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates, and Arch-deacons enow to do the preſent work. And it's pity that the land ſhould be troubled with ſo many when one would ſerve. I confeſs I would either have more or fewer had I my wiſh.</p>
               <p>And as for my Minor propoſition, let him that thinketh it wanteth proof, when he hath conſidered what is beforeſaid, and how perſonal preſent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all Gods Church-worſhip, differeth from the Communion of aſſociated Congregations by meſſengers, &amp;c. think ſo ſtill, if he be able ſo egregiouſly to err.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not ſo leave our Prelatiſts. I know that it is the common trick of Sophiſters, when they cannot make good an ill cauſe, to carry it into the dark, or ſtart a new controverſie, and then they are ſafe. A Papiſt will wheel about into the wilderneſs or thickets of Church hiſtory, and ask you what names you can give of your Religion in all Ages, that one propoſition of your Syllogiſm may contain much of a Horſe load or a Cart load of Books, and then I trow he hath done his work, if women be the judges. And others uſe to carry the queſtion a rebus ad verba: And ſo it is in the caſe in hand. But it is not the name of a SPECIES that ſhall ſerve your turn. We know how hard
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61252:145"/>
it is in Phyſicks, to determine what it is that ſpecifieth; and much more in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Politicks and other Relatives. But Let the Logical notion of a ſpecies lie at your mercy: It ſhall ſuffice us, that you may not make ſo great a change of the Church-orders and Government of Gods inſtitution, as to turn a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or hundred Churches into one; and to deprive all Pariſhes or Churches Conſociate for preſential Communion, of the priviledge of having a Biſhop of their own to Teach, Worſhip, and Govern them preſentially and per ſe. As if all the Arch-biſhops in the Ronan Empire had put down all the Biſhops, and called themſelves the Biſhops of the Churches. Of which more anon.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>BUt Doctor </hi> Stillingfleet <hi>hath invincibly proved that God hath made no one form of Church Government neceſſary, but left the choice to humane prudence.</hi>

               <p>Anſw. I. If ſo, Why ſhould we all ſwear to this one form, that we will never endeavour to alter it? or (as the &amp; caetera Oath) never conſent to the alteration of it, when we know not but the King may alter it, or command us to endeavour it? Muſt there be ſuch ſwearing to the perpetuating an alterable unneceſſary thing?</p>
               <p>II. The word [Form] ſignifieth either the eſſentials of Church policy, or the Integrals, or accidents which Chriſt himſelf hath ſetled: Or elſe it ſignifieth only ſome mutable accidents or modes, which God hath left to humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

               <p>1. It is undeniably of Divine inſtitution that there be ordinary publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for Gods ſolemn worſhip, and the peoples edification. 2. And that Miniſters of that office which Chriſt hath inſtituted, be the officiating Guides in theſe Aſſemblies. 3. And that Cohabiting Chriſtians be the ordinary ſtated bodies of theſe aſſemblies, and not live looſely to go every day as they pleaſe from Church to Church, but ordinarily when they can, be ſetled members of ſome one Church (To which cohabitation or vicinity, is one diſpoſitio materiae) 4.

Mat. 18. 15 Tit. 3. 10.</note> and watch over them perſonally, and know them, and be known of them in doctrine and enſample, as to the main body of the flock. 6. That theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Communion be by mutual conſent of the Paſtors and the body of the flock. 7. That theſe mutual Relations of Gods appointment and their own conſent do conſtitute them a ſpiritual ſociety of Divine inſtitution. 8. That this Communion muſt be (as our Creed calleth it) a Communion of Saints: that is, of men profeſſing Chriſtianity and Holineſs, and ſeeming ſuch: And muſt extend to a free Communication to each other, for the ſupply of corporal neceſſities; And to a mutual aſſiſtance of each other in holy living. 9 That therefore there muſt be ſome to diſcern and judge whether the perſons that would enter this Society and Communion, be Profeſſed ſeeming Chriſtians and Saints or not? And whether they revolt by Hereſie or wicked lives from their profeſſion? And whether they be impenitent in theſe revoltings? And therefore having opportunity by preſence or nearneſs to know them and the witneſſes, muſt judge of the credibility or reports or accuſations? And muſt admoniſh the offenders, and ſeek by all poſſible conviction and exhortation, with patience to draw them to Repentance: And if no perſwaſion will prevail, to refuſe to admit them to the Communion of the Church, and to deliver them the Sacrament of Communion, and to tell them openly of their ſin and danger, and pronounce them lyable to Gods wrath till they do repent, and to charge the Church to avoid Communion with them. 10. It is the particular Paſtors of thoſe Churches, to whoſe office all this belongeth. 11. If that Church have more Paſtors than one, they muſt do all this work in concord, and not divide nor thwart each other. So that as many Phyſicians undertake one Patient, as each one ſingly of the ſame office, and yet muſt do all by agreement, unleſs ſome one ſee that the reſt would kill the patient; ſo it is in this caſe. 12. All theſe particular Churches muſt in their vicinities and capacities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> live in Concord, and hold ſuch a correſpondency, and Communion of Churches for mutual ſtrength and edification, as tendeth to the common good of all: The means of which are Meſſengers, Letters, and Synods as there is occaſion. All theſe twelve particulars I doubt not but ſo judicious and worthy a man as Dr. Stillingfleet will eaſily concede. And indeed the ſumme of them is granted in his book. And then whether you will call this a Form of Government or not, how little care I for the meer name? 13. I may add this much more, that All theſe Congregations are under the extrinſick Government of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as Phyſicians are: And he only can rule them by the ſword and force.</p>
               <p>But then we will agree with Dr. Stillingfleet or any man, that God hath left all theſe things following without a particular determination to be determined according to his General Laws. 1. Whether this Parochial or Congregational Church ſhall always meet in one and the ſame place; or in caſe of perſecution or want of room, or by reaſon of the Age, Weakneſs, and diſtance of ſome Members, may have ſeveral houſes or Chappels of eaſe, where ſome parcels may ſometimes meet, who yet (at leaſt per vices) may have perſonal preſent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61252:146"/>
Communion with the reſt. 2. Whether a Church ſhall be great or ſmall, that is, of what number it ſhall conſiſt, ſuppoſing that it be not ſo great or ſo ſmall as to be inconſiſtent with the end. 3. How many Paſtors each Church ſhall have. 4. Whether among many One ſhall be a Chief, and upon ſuppoſition of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in Parts, Grace, Age, and Experience, ſhall voluntarily be ſo far ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by the reſt, as may give him a Negative voice. 5. Whether ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of many Churches, ſhall conſociate ſo as to joyn in Claſſes or Synods ſtated for number, time and place. And whether their meetings ſhall be conſtant, or occaſional pro re nata. 6. Whether One in theſe meetings ſhall be a ſtated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, or only pro tempore, and ſhall have a Negative voice or not, in the circumſtantials of their Synodical work. 7. Whether certain Agreements called Canons, ſhall be made voluntarily to bind up the ſeveral Members of the Synods to one and the ſame way in undetermined circumſtances of their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or as an agreement and ſecondary obligation to their certain duties. 8. Whether theſe Aſſociations or Synods ſhall by their Delegates conſtitute other provincial or larger aſſociations for the ſame Ends: Who thoſe Delegates ſhall be. Whether one in thoſe larger Synods alſo ſhall have ſuch a Negative as aforeſaid. All theſe and ſuch like we grant to be undetermined: And if they will call only ſuch Humane modes and circumſtances by the name of Forms of Government, we quarrel not de nomine, but de re do grant that ſuch kind of Forms or Formalities are not particularly determined of in Gods word.</p>
               <p>9. And beſides all theſe, whether ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles in the ordinary part of their work, as A. Biſhops or General Miniſters having the care of many inferiour Biſhops and Churches, be not Lawful, yea, of Divine right, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be unlawful is a queſtion which all Nonconformiſts are not agreed on among themſelves, ſo great is the difficulty of it. But for my own part, being unſatisfied in it, I never preſumed to meddle in any Ordinations, leſt it ſhould belong to Apoſtolical A. Biſhops only; and I reſolved to ſubmit herein to the order of the Church wherever I ſhould live.</p>
               <p>III. But if you hold that Dr. Stillingfleet, Biſhop Reynolds, and all thoſe Conformiſts who ſay that no Church Form is jure divino neceſſario, do extend this (as expreſly they do) to the Dioceſane Form, Let it be obſerved, 1. That we plead for no more than we have proved, (and they will confeſs I think) to be jure divino. 2. And that we plead againſt ſwearing and ſubſcribing to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they themſelves ſay is not of Gods inſtitution. 3. That the proper Prelatiſts affirm it to be of Divine Inſtitution, or elſe they will renounce it. 4. That the preface of the book of Ordination to which we muſt ſubſcribe or declare Aſſent and Conſent, doth make this Epiſcopacy to be a diſtinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Presbyters, as a thing certain by Gods word. This therefore I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they can ſubſcribe to, who ſay no Form is jure divino: I am ſure they perſwade us not to ſubſcribe it, while they diſprove it.</p>
               <p>And I would have leave to debate the Caſe of the Church of England a little with theſe Humaniſts, and to ask them, If no Church Form be of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, 1. Why may not the King and Parliament put it down as aforeſaid?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61252:147"/>
2. But ſpecially who made the Form of the Church of England which we muſt ſwear to—If another Church, then that other was not of the ſame Form; otherwiſe that Form was made before, which is a contradiction. If it was of another Form, I ask, what it was? and who made the Form of that other Church which made this Church Form? and ſo to the Original? If Biſhops or Synods made it, ſtill they were parts of a Church, or of no Church. If of no Church, what Biſhops were thoſe, and by what power did they make new Church Forms that were of none themſelves? If an Emperor or King firſt made them, either he was himſelf a member of a Church, or of no Church. If of a Church, what form had that Church? And why ſhould not that firſt form ſtand? And who made that form? and ſo ad originem. If he was of no Church, how came he by power to make Church forms, that was of none himſelf? Nemo dat quod non habet. It's no honour to Prelacy to be ſo made. And were they Chriſtians or no Chriſtians that made the Dioceſane Form? If Chriſtians, were they orderly Chriſtians, or rebellious? If orderly, how happened it that they were of no Church themſelves, when the Apoſtles ſetled ſo much of Church Form and Order, as I have before named? If rebellious, they were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable original of Dioceſanes.</p>
               <p>And if the Church Form be not of Divine inſtitution, then the Church it ſelf is not. For forma dat nomen &amp; eſſe. And ſo the cauſe is given up to the Browniſts by theſe Learned moderate men, ſo far as that there is no Church in England of Divine inſtitution. Were it not that when in general they have ſaid that no Church Form of Government is ſo Divine, they again ſo far unſay it, as to confeſs the Parith Churches or Congregations with their Paſtors to be of Divine inſtitution and of continued neceſſity.</p>
               <p>All that is to be ſaid by and for them is this, That the Apoſtles were the makers of the Engliſh or Dioceſane Form, but not of that only, but of the Presbyterian (and Independent) alſo; and ſo made no one neceſſary but left all indifferent: Or that they made one of theſe Forms as mutable, allowing men to change it.</p>
               <p>Anſw. But 1. I have proved what they made; Let them prove that they made any other, of a different ſort, not ſubordinate or ſupraordinate, if they can. 2. And let them prove the mutability of that which they made, and their power to change it, which they aſſert. Till one of theſe is proved, we are or ſhould be in poſſeſſion of that which was certainly firſt made.</p>
               <p>I am bold to conclude this argument with the ſpeech of a bold but a wiſe and holy man, Joh. Chryſoſtome de Sacerdotio lib. 3. pag. (mihi) 48. cap. 15. [And when ſome (Biſhops) have obtained that prefecture of a Province not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and others of one FAR GREATER THAN THEIR OWN proper STRENGTH CAN BEAR, THEY CERTAINLY BRING TO PASS, THAT THE CHURCH OF GOD SEEMETH NOTHING TO DIFFER FROM AN EURIPUS (or a confuſed tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent changeling thing)——&amp; pag. 49.

THE FIRE OF HELL? NOT THAT hell WHICH THE HOLY SCRIPTURES THREATEN TO US; BUT EVEN OF ONE THAT IS FAR MORE GRIEVOUS.] Forgive the words, my Lords; They are not mine but Chryſoſtome's: or if you will not forgive the citing of them, I will bear it as he did the like. Only I will abate you in my prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or ſentence, that far ſorer hell fire than the Scripture threameth, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this will be ſharp enough, even for the moſt diſperſing, ſilencing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Prelate; and imputing thoſe words to honeſt Chryſoſtome's vehement Oratory. And I'le tell you what went next before theſe words, [And they do not only take in the unworthy (into the Prieſthood) but they caſt out the worthy: For as if they had agreed both ways to ſpoil the Church of God, and the firſt cauſe were not enough to kindle the wrath of God, they add the ſecond, or worſe, to the former. For I judge it equally peſtilent to drive out the Profitable, and to take in the unprofitable: which certainly they do, that the flock of Chriſt may from no part either find conſolation, or be able to take breath] O what would this man have ſaid had he lived now in England!</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Argument 3. From the deſtruction of the order of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of Divine Inſtitution, and the Invention of a new order of Sub-half-Presbyters in their ſtead.</head>
               <head>ARGUMENT III.</head>
               <p>THe office of Presbyters inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt containeth an Obligation and Authority to Guide by Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline the flocks committed to their care: But the office of a Dioceſane, being one only Biſhop over many ſcore or hundred Congregations, is deſtructive of that office of Presbyters, which containeth an obligation and authority to Guide by Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, (or the exerciſe of the Church keys) the flocks committed to their care. Therefore the office of ſuch a Dioceſane is deſtructive of the office of Presbyters inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Major is thus proved by the Enumeration of the Acts which contain the general office, and by the proof of the General power extending to thoſe Acts: viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61252:148"/>1. They that had the Authority and Obligation to exerciſe the Church keys in the Scripture ſence, had the authority and obligation to Guide their flocks by Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. But the Presbyters of the Holy Ghoſts inſtitution had the authority and obligation to exerciſe the Church keys, in the Scripture ſence: Ergo they had authority and obligation to Guide their flocks by Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>2. Again: The office which contained an Authority and Obligation to Teach, Exhort, Rebuke, publickly and privately, to judge of perſons baptizable and to baptize them, to Pray, Praiſe God, and adminiſter the Lords Supper to the Church, and to judge of them that are to receive it, to watch over them privately, and publickly to Excommunicate the obſtinately impenitent, and abſolve the penitent, doth contain authority and obligation to Guide that flock by Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. But ſuch is the Office of Presbyters as inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt.—Ergo—&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here note 1. That I am not now medling with the Queſtions, Whether ſuch Presbyters hold this power in ſubordination to any ſuperiour Biſhops; nor whether there lie any appeal from them to a higher power in the Church? 2. Nor am I now queſtioning, Whether in Scripture ſence Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are all one in Name or thing.</p>
               <p>3. But that which I maintain is, 1. That there is no proof in Scripture that God ever inſtituted any order of Presbyters which had not the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned power of the keys. 2. And that God did inſtitute ſuch an Order of Presbyters as had that power, de nomine &amp; de re. And 3. That the Dioceſane Office deſtroyeth ſuch, and ſetteth up others in their ſtead. What God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted I will prove 1. Out of the Scripture records, 2. Out of the Hiſtory of the Church which long retained them, in ſome degree.</p>

               <p>THat God inſtituted ſuch Presbyters and no other, I ſhall prove by the enumeration and peruſal of all the Texts of Scripture which mention them, (viz. as inſtituted in the New Teſtament, and now in force.)</p>

               <p>Acts 20. 17, 28.

And the Scripture mentioneth no other that I can find.</p>
               <p>And of this I have Dr. Hammonds full confeſſion, Annotat. in Act. 11. &amp; diſſert. before cited: with all thoſe whom he mentioneth of his party and mind. And as for them of the contrary opinion, they tell us that in Scripture times the Names Presbyter &amp; Biſhop were common: And that the word [Biſhops] ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignified all the Presbyters (the Biſhops as Presbyters and the Subpresby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) as in Phil. 1. 1, 2. And that the word [Presbyters] ſometimes ſignifieth the Biſhops only, and ſometime both conjunctly: But they are none of them able to give us any one inſtance with proof, of a Text which ſpeaketh of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Presbyters? (I mean ſubject in Order or degree to Biſhops of the ſingle Churches, and not ſubject to the Apoſtles and General officers.) And while we prove that God appointed ſuch entire Presbyters as are here deſcribed, and they cannot prove againſt (Dr. Hammond or us) that any one text ſpeaketh of a lower order or rank, I think we need no other Scripture evidence.</p>

               <p>I. I know that ſomewhat may be ſaid againſt what I ſhall firſt cite, but I think not of ſufficient force. I begin with it, though not firſt in time, becauſe firſt in Authority. The 1. Concil. Nicaen. in their Epiſtle to the Church of Alexand. and all the Churches of Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, thus decree concerning thoſe that were Ordained by Meletius, (as Socrat. lib. 1. c. 6. tranſlated by Grynaeus) Hi autem qui Dei gratia &amp; veſtris precibus adjuti ad nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61252:149"/>
ſchiſma deflexiſſe comperti ſunt, ſed intra Catholicae &amp; Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae fines ab erroris labe vacuos ſe continuerint, authoritatem habeant tum Miniſtros ordinandi, tum eos qui clero digni fuerint nominandi, tum denique omnia ex lege &amp; inſtituto Eccleſiaſtico libere exequendi] Now ordaining Miniſters and nominating men for the Clergy, are acts which, if any, ſhew Presbyters to be Rulers in the Church.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Perhaps it is Biſhops ordained by </hi> Meletius <hi>that are here ſpoken of: or Biſhops with the Presbyters reſpectively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. There is no more in the Text but this, [They decreed further touching ſuch as were entred into holy Orders by his laying on of hands, that they, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation with more myſtical laying on of hands ſhould be admitted into the fellowſhip of the Church, with this condition that they ſhould enjoy their dignity and degree of Miniſtry, yet that they be inferiour to all the Paſtors throughout every province and Church—Moreover that they have no authority to elect the Miniſters approved by their cenſures, no not ſo much as to nominate them which are to execute the Eccleſiaſtical functions, nor to intermeddle with any thing touching them that are within Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders juriſdiction, without the conſent of the Biſhop of the Catholick Church.] And then they add as afore, that thoſe that fell not into Schiſm (as they did)<note place="margin">Yet I doubt not that they were not to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without the Biſhop.</note> ſhall have authority to Conſecrate Miniſters, and nominate ſuch as ſhall be thought worthy of the Clergy. Now that it is Presbyters and not Biſhops that are here ſpoken of appeareth 1. In that it is without any note of eminency ſaid to be [ſuch as were entred into Holy Orders.] 2. In that it is ſuch as ſo entred by the Laying on of Meletius's hands: Wherereas a Biſhop muſt be ordained by the hands of three Biſhops. And the Schiſm of one of the three, would not have fruſtrated the Ordination, if the other two ſtood firm in the Catholick Union. 3. Becauſe it is the priviledge of Presbyters that is denyed them: Though they be not degraded, they are to be below all other Paſtors in every Church: which cannot be, that they ſhall be Biſhops below all Presbyters. 4. Becauſe the conſent of the Biſhop of the Catholick Church (where they ſhall come) is neceſſary to their officiating. But if it could have been proved that Biſhops had been here included, yet while Presbyters alſo are included, it will not invalidate the teſtimony. But indeed here is no ſuch proof. I confeſs that Nicephorus (a leſs credible Author) ſeemeth to apply it to Biſhops Ordained by Meletius: But no ſuch thing can be gathered out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen, either Tripart. lib. 1. c. 18. where he deſcribeth Meletius and his party, or Tripart lib. 2. c. 12. where he reciteth the ſame Epiſtle that Socrates doth. But I would pretend to no more certainty than is evident.</p>

If any will ſay that Biſhops are here included, I will not deny it; But if they will ſay that when he nameth the Seniors and Presbyters without diſtinction, that he excludeth all ſave the Biſhop alone, I ſhall not believe that Tertullian ſpeaketh ſo un-intelligibly.

Epiſt. 36. (edit. Goulart.) He ſheweth that it is the Clergies duty, to take care of the widows, the ſick, the poor, the ſtrangers: (he the Biſhop was then abſent.) So alſo Ep. 37. And Epiſt. 10. he reprehendeth the Presbyters for reconciling and abſolving the Lapſed overhaſtily and with neglect and contempt of the Biſhop; but not as if the work were not their office work to do: Nay he giveth us this full plain teſtimony, that even in this publick Abſolution in foro exteriore, the true cuſtom of the Church was for the Biſhop and his Presbyters together to impoſe hands on the penitent and ſo abſolve them, receive them, and give them the Sacrament. Pag. 30. ſaith he, Nam cum in minoribus peccatis<note place="margin">The next Epiſ. 7. is worthy to be read of all that ſuffer for the truth to keep them from pride, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. and ſo is the 8.</note> agant peccatores poenitentiam juſto tempore, &amp; ſecundum diſciplinae ordinem, ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omologeſin veniant, &amp; per impoſitionem manus Epiſcopi &amp; Cleri jus Communionis accipiant; Nunc crudo tempore, perſecutione adhuc perſeverante, nondum reſtituta Eccleſiae ipſius pace, ad Communicationem admittuntur, &amp; offertur nomen eorum, &amp; nondum poenitentia acta, nondum exomologeſi facta, nondum manu e. s ab Epiſcopo &amp; Clero impoſita, Euchariſtia illis datur.]</p>
               <p>Epiſt. 5. p. 15. He writeth to the Clergy in his abſence to do the work of Diſcipline, even their own part and his, and (as no man doubteth but they did the whole work in the publick aſſembly when he was abſent ſo long time, ſo (that you may ſee what kind of Chappel meetings they had) it being the cuſtome for encouragement of ſufferers, to go to the Confeſſors

and viſit them and there celebrate the Sacrament,) he perſwadeth them that the people may not go crowding by great companies at once, leſt it ſtir up envy, and they be denied entrance (it's like they were in Priſon) and loſe all while they are inſatiable to get more: But that one Presbyter and one Deacon go one day, and another another day by turns, becauſe the Change of perſons, and viciſſitude of meeters would break the envy: and all ſhould be done in meekneſs and humility.</p>
               <p>But the words I inſiſt on are, [Peto vos pro fide &amp; religione veſtra, fungami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni illic &amp; Veſtris partibus &amp; meis, ut nihil vel ad diſciplinam vel ad diligentiam deſit.] And if the whole work of Diſcipline be ſuch as is partly their own part, and partly what they may do in the Biſhops abſence in his ſtead, it is within the power of their function: For a Lay-man or a Deacon cannot do all the Presbyters work in his abſence.</p>
               <p>And Epiſt. 6. p. 17. Having exhorted the ſufferers or confeſſors not to grow proud by it, and lamented that ſome after ſufferings grew inſolent and were a ſhame to the Church, he addeth (Nec a Diaconis aut Presbyteris regi poſſe,] Shewing that even the Government of the Confeſſors belonged to them both in their places: And of himſelf he ſaith to his Presbyters, Solus reſcribere nihil potui, quando a primordio Epiſcopatus mei ſtatuerim nihil ſine conſilio veſtro, &amp; ſive Conſenſu Plebis meae, privata ſententia gerere—ſed cum venero—in Commune tractabimus—As to them that ſay, This was only Cyprians arbitrary condeſcenſion, I anſwer, 1.

Cyprian pleadeth ſo much for the Biſhops prerogative, that we have little reaſon to think him both ſo ſubmiſſive and imprudent, as to bring up ill cuſtomes, and teach the Miniſters and people to expect that as their part which belonged not to them, and ſo to corrupt the Church.</p>
               <p>And in the Ep. 11. p. 32. again he ſaith [Ante exomologeſin graviſſimi &amp; extremi delicti factam, ante manum ab Epiſcopo &amp; Clero in poenitentem impoſitam, offerre lapſis pacem &amp; Euchariſtiam dare, id eſt ſanctum Domini corpus profanare audeant—</p>
               <p>The ſame he hath again Ep. 12. p. 37. (with an examinabuntur ſingula praeſentibus &amp; judicantibus vobis (that is, the people, to ſhew how great the Church was.)</p>
               <p>Afterward Ep. 14. he directeth the Presbyters to abſolve thoſe by Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands themſelves without him that are infirm and in danger, but that the reſt muſt be publickly reconciled in the Church praeſente &amp; ſtantium plebe. To recite all of this nature in Cyprian, would be too long.</p>
               <p>VI. I will add next a General Teſtimony viz. the conſtant cuſtome of all Churches, even Rome it ſelf, where the Presbyters have Governed without a Biſhop in the intervals, when after one Biſhops death another was not choſen. As before the choice of Fabian's ſucceſſor you may ſee by the Epiſtles of the Roman Clergy to Cyprian. Marcion was expelled by the Roman Presbytes

ſede vacante, Epiphan. Haereſ. 42. And if they had the power over one another, more over the flock.</p>
               <p>And I need bring no particular proofs of this: For when Biſhops have been<note place="margin">See Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Blondel. §. 3. p. 183, 184.</note> baniſhed, impriſoned, dead, and the ſeat vacant a year, yea, divers years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as it hath been at Rome) was the Church no Church all that time? Had it no Government? Was there no power of the Keys? Was the Church laid common to all? This inſtance is ſo full as nothing can be ſaid againſt it, but that it was in Caſe of Neceſſity. But that only proveth that it is the Presbyters office work, though out of a caſe of neceſſity they muſt do it with the Biſhop, and not without him. But a Lay-man may not do a Presbyters proper work on ſuch a pretence. However the Church by this practice hath declared it's judgment in the caſe.</p>
               <p>VII. Concil. Carthag. 4. Can. 23. is [Ut Epiſcopus nullius cauſam audiat abſque praeſentia Clericorum ſuorum; Alioquin irrita erit ſententia Epiſcopi, niſi Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorum praeſentia confirmetur. If it be ſaid that here is no mention of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but of their Preſence only, I anſwer, It is a preſence neceſſary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Biſhops ſentence: and the preſence of Diſſenters would rather infirm the ſentence (more than their abſence) than confirm it. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Canons ſhew that it is Conſent that is meant. For,</p>
               <p>Can. 32. it's ſaid [Irrita erit donatio Epiſcoporum, vel venditio, vel commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio rei Eccleſiaſticae, abſque conniventia &amp; ſubſcriptione Clericorum: where ſuch a Connivence is meant as is joyned with ſubſcription. And if ſubſcription of the Presbyters was neceſſary in theſe caſes, no leſs than Conſent is meant in the other.</p>
               <p>Which is yet more apparent by thoſe following Canons, which forbid the Biſhop to Ordain without his Clergy, or to accuſe any of them but by proof in a Synod, or to ſuffer a Presbyter to ſtand while he ſitteth. And the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons that place the Biſhop in conſeſſu Presbyterorum, and ſet him in the midſt of them in the ſame ſeat in the Church, and call him their Colleague: The Canons which make the Presbyters Governours of the Rural Churches, and make the Deacons ſervants to them, of which the number is too great to be now recited—</p>
               <p>Even here Can. 22. it's ſaid [Epiſcopus ſine Concilio Clerioorum ſuorum Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos<note place="margin">Note it is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio but concilio.</note> non ordinet: Ita ut Civium aſſenſum &amp; conniventiam &amp; teſtimonium quaerat.] And if not ſine concilio * then not contra conſilium. And if the conſent of the Laity be neceſſary, ſure the Clergies is ſo too.</p>
               <p>Can. 29. Epiſcopus ſi Clerico vel Laico crimen impoſuerit, deducatur ad proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem in Synodum. Can. 30. Caveant Judices Eccleſiae ne abſente eo cujus cauſa ventilatur ſententiam proferant; quia irrita erit, imo &amp; cauſam in Synodo profacto dabunt. And if a Biſhop muſt not ſo much as accuſe but in a Synod on proof, much lefs might he be judge alone.</p>
               <p>Can. 33. appointeth that Biſhops or Presbyters ſhall be invited to preach, and conſecrate the Oblation, when they come into ſtrange Churches] So for there was no difference.</p>
               <p>

               <p>35. Ut Epiſcopus in Eccleſia &amp; in conſeſſu Presbyterorum ſublimior ſedeat. Intra domum vero Collegam Presbyterorum ſe eſſe cognoſcat.</p>

               <p>Yea even in Ordination it is ſaid, Can. 2. Presbyterquum Ordinatur, Epiſcopo eum benedicente, &amp; manum ſuper ejus tenente, etiam omnes Presbyteri qui praeſentes ſunt manus ſuas juxta manum Epiſcopi, ſuper Caput illius teneant. Et Can. 3. Diaconus quum ordinatur ſolus Epiſcopus, qui eum benedicit, manus ſuper caput illius ponat: quia non ad Sacerdotium ſed ad miniſterium conſecratur] So that Prieſthood was to be conferred by the hands of Prieſts, and the Biſhop's alone was not enough; But Deacons might be Ordained by a Biſhop without Presbyters.]</p>
               <p>What need I tire the Reader with other Councils teſtimonies? when this, though called Provincial having 214 Biſhops, and among them Aurelius, Auguſtine, &amp;c. is no leſs valuable than any General Council in the volumes of the Councils.</p>
               <p>VIII. In the Arabick Canons of the Concil. Nic. 1. (which I cite not for their juſtification, but as teſtifying the matter of fact in the times of which they were written whenſoever it was) it's ſaid, Can. 47. After one Biſhop is forbid to abſolve him that another hath Excommunicated [Eadem Lex erit de Sacerdote, id eſt, Ut nullus Sacerdos ſolvat aut liget quem alius Sacerdos ſolverit aut ligaverit, quamdiu ille qui ſolvit aut ligavit vixerit: Poſt mortem vero ſucceſſor ejus ſolvet quem mortuus ligavit: ſed debet Epiſcopus praeeſſe huic negotio—Neque convenit ut Epiſcopus aut Archiepiſcopus ſolvat aut liget eum, qui digne a Sacerdote ſolutus aut ligatus fuit, quamdiu ille qui ſolvit aut ligavit vixerit.] Here you ſee the Prieſt may bind and looſe, and that in foro Eccleſiaſtico: yea ſo faſt that no Biſhop or Archbiſhop may looſe or bind contrarily during his life. Then Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters had the Keys.</p>
               <p>And Can 57. (according to other Canons cited before) they ſay, [The Arch-Presbyter in the Biſhops abſence ſhall be honoured as the Biſhop, becauſe he is in his place; and let him be the Head of the Prieſts, who are under his power in the Church, with all that the Archdeacon is over.] And if one Presbyter may Rule the reſt as a Biſhop, the Government of the flock is not above their Order or place. If it be ſaid that he doth it as the Biſhops Deputy, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered oft enough before. Spiritual Power (or Paſtoral) is deputable to none but ſuch as are of the ſame Order: which is not properly a deputation.</p>
               <p>IX. Presbyters had power to Baptize and to celebrate the Lords Supper, Therefore they had power to judge who were Baptizable, and who were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Lords Supper: For 1. Elſe they would not do it as Chriſts Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but as the executioners of anothers judgment. And if ſo, they may give both Sacraments to Turks and Infidels if they be bid. And then indeed the Prieſt is not the Baptizer or Conſecrater Morally, but the Biſhop doth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61252:152"/>
it by the Prieſt: All which are falſe. And a Presbyter may preach and Baptize in any Infidel Kingdom, where no Biſhop hath any Dioceſe, and this as an ordinary caſe (in Turky, Tartary, China, Japan, &amp;c.) And what Biſhop ſhall there tell him whom to Baptize where there is no Biſhop? And the power of Baptizing is the firſt and greateſt Key of the Church, even the Key of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>And they that do among us deny a Presbyter the power of judging whom to Baptize and give the Lords Supper to, do not give it to the Biſhop (who knoweth not of the perſons) But the Directive part they commit to a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Biſhops and Presbyters; and the Judicial partly to the Prieſt, and partly to a Lay-Chancellor.</p>
               <p>X. Epiphanius Haereſ. 75. ſaith, [The Apoſtles did not ſet all in full order at once: And at firſt there was need of Presbyters and Deacons; by whom both Eccleſiaſtical affairs may be adminiſtred: Therefore where no man was found worthy of Epiſcopacy, in that place no Biſhop was ſet] By which it appeareth that he thought that for ſome time ſome Churches were Governed without Biſhops: And if ſo, it there belonged to the Presbyters office to govern.</p>
               <p>Whereto we may add the opinion of many Epiſcopal men, who think that during the Apoſtles times, they were the only Biſhops in moſt Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And if ſo, Then in their long and frequent abſence the Presbyters muſt be the governours.</p>
               <p>XI. That many Councils have had Presbyters, yea many of them is paſt doubt: Look but in the Councils ſubſcriptions and you will ſee it. A Synod of ſome Biſhops and more Presbyters and Deacons gathered at Rome, decreed the Excommunication of Novatianus and his adherents, Euſeb. lib. 6. c. 43.</p>
               <p>Noetus was convented, judged, expelled by the Seſſion of Presbyters, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. Haereſ. 47. c. 1.</p>
               <p>See a great number of inſtances of Councils held by Biſhops with their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in Blondel, de Epiſc. ſect. 3. p. 202. Yea one was held at Rome praeſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus cum Joanne 12 Presbyteris, An. 964. vid. Blond. p. 203, 206, 207.</p>
               <p>Yea they had places and votes in General Councils: Not only ut aliorum procuratores, as Victor and Vincentius in Nic. 1. but as the Paſtors of their Churches, and in their proper right. I need not urge Selden's Arabick Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue in Eutych. Alex. where there were two perſons for divers particular places: or Zonaras who ſaith, There were Prieſts, Deacons and Monks; nor Athanaſius a Deacon's preſence: Evenof late the Council of Baſil is a ſufficient proof.</p>
               <p>XII. The foreſaid Canons of Carthage which are ſo full, are inſerted into the body of the Canon Law, and in the Canons of Egbert Archbiſhop of York, as Biſhop Uſher and others have obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61252:152"/>XXIII. Hierom's [Communi Presbyterorum Concilio Eccleſiae gubernabantur,] ſeconded by Chryſoſtome and other Fathers, is a trite, but evident teſtimony.</p>

               <p>XV. Baſil's, Anaphora Bibl. Pat. Tom. 6. p. 22. maketh every Church to have Archpresbyters, Presbyters, and Deacons, making the Biſhop to be but the Archpresbyter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> The Confeſſions of the greateſt and Learnedeſt Prelatiſts.</head>
               <p>1. THe Church of England doth publickly notifie her judgment, that Church Government, Discipline, and the power of the Keys is not a thing aliene from or above the Order of the Presbyters, but belongeth to their office. 1. In that they allow Presbyters to be members of Convocations (and that as choſen by the Presbyters.) And whereas it is ſaid, that the Lower houſe of Convocation are but Adviſers to the Upper, I anſwer, All together have but an adviſing power to the King and Parliament; But in that ſort of power, the lower houſe hath its part, as experience ſheweth.</p>
               <p>2. There are many exempt Juriſdictions in England, (as the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, The Deanry of Windſor, and Wolverhampton, Bridgenorth, (where ſix Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes are governed by a Court held by a Presbyter) and many more, which ſhew that it is conſiſtent with the Presbyters office.</p>
               <p>3. The Archdeacons who are no Biſhops exerciſe ſome Government; And ſo do their Officials under them. The Objection from Deputation is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>4. The Surrogates of the Biſhops, whether Vicar General, Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or Commiſſaries, are allowed a certain part of government.</p>
               <p>5. They that give Lay-Chancellors the power of Judicial Excommunication and Abſolution, cannot think a Presbyter uncapable of it.</p>
               <p>6. A Presbyter proforma oft paſſeth the ſentence of Excommunication and Abſolution in the Chancellors Court when he hath judged it.</p>
               <p>7. A Presbyter in the Church muſt publiſh that Excommunication and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>8. By allowing Presbyters to baptize, and to deliver the Lords Supper, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61252:153"/>
to keep ſome back for that time, and to admit them again if they openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to repent and amend their naughty lives, and to abſolve the ſick, they intimate that the Power of the Keys belongeth to them, though they contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves otherwiſe by denying it them.</p>
               <p>9. And in Ordination the Presbyter is required to exerciſe diſcipline: And the words of Act. 20. 28. were formerly uſed to them [Take heed to your ſelves and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers (or Biſhops) to feed (or Rule) the Church of God: Whence Biſhop Uſher gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Churches ſence was that the Presbyters had a joynt power with the Biſhop in Church Government. And though lately Anno 1662. this be altered, and thoſe words left out, yet it is not any ſuch new change that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this to have been the meaning of them that made the book of Ordination, and that uſed it.</p>
               <p>II. Archbiſhop Cranmer with the reſt of the Commiſſioners appointed by King Edward the Sixth for the Reformation of Eccleſiaſtical Laws, decreed the adminiſtring Diſcipline in every Pariſh by the Miniſter and certain Elders; Labouring and intending by all means to bring in the ancient diſcipline. Vid. Reform. Leg. Eccleſ. tit. de Divinis Officiis cap. 10. And our Liturgy wiſheth this Godly Diſcipline reſtored, and ſubſtituteth the Curſes till it can be done. And the ſame Cranmer was the firſt of 46 who in the time of King Henry the Eighth affirmed (in a book called The Biſhops Book, to be ſeen in Fox's Martyrology,) that the difference of Biſhops was a device of the ancient Fathers, and not mentioned in Scripture. And of the opinion of Cranmer with others in this point, his own papers publiſhed by Dr. Stillingfleet Irenic. p. 390, 391, &amp;c. are ſo full a proof, that no more is needful.</p>
               <p>III. Dr. Richard Coſins in his Tables ſheweth how Church Diſcipline is partly exerciſed by Presbyters, and by the Kings Commiſſion may be much more. And it is not aliene to their office.</p>
               <p>IV. Hooker Eccleſ. Pol. lib. 5. pleadeth againſt the Divine ſettlement of one form of Government: And lib. 7. Sect. 7. p. 17, 18. he ſheweth at large that the Biſhops with their Presbyters as a Conſeſs governed the Churches: And that in this reſpect, [It is moſt certain truth, that the Churches Cathedral and the Biſhops of them are as glaſſes wherein the face and very countenance of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical antiquity remaineth yet to be ſeen, notwithſtanding the alterations which tract of time and courſe of the world hath brought. And much he hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which granteth that the Presbyters are Church governours, though not in equality with the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>V. Dr. Field, lib. 5. c. 27. ſhewing how the Apoſtles firſt limiting and fixing of Paſtors to particular Churches, was a giving them Juriſdiction, ſaith, [this aſſigning to men having the power of order, the perſons to whom they were to miniſter holy things, and of whom they were to take the care, and the ſubjecting
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61252:153"/>
of ſuch perſons to them, gave them the power of Juriſdiction which they had not before.]</p>
               <p>And [As another of my Rank cannot have that Juriſdiction within my Church as I have, but if he will have any thing to do there, he muſt be inferiour in degree to me; ſo we read in the Revelation, of the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, &amp;c.] So that with him a Biſhop is but one of the Presbyters, of the ſame Rank, having the firſt charge of the Church, (as every Incumbent in reſpect to his Curates) and ſo above his Curates in Degree.]</p>
               <p>And [As the Presbyters may do nothing without the Biſhop, ſo he may do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in matters of greateſt moment without their preſence and advice. Conc. Carthag. 4. c. 23.—It is therefore moſt falſe that Bellarmine ſaith, that Presbyters have no power of Juriſdiction—For it is moſt clear and evident, that in all Provincial Synods Presbyters did ſit, give voices, and ſubſcribe as well as Biſhops:—And the Biſhops that were preſent (in General Councils) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſolution and conſent of the provincial Synods of thoſe Churches from whence they came, in which Synods Presbyters had their voices, they had a kind of conſent to the decrees of General Councils alſo: and nothing was paſſed in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their concurrence.</p>
               <p>And Chap. 49. [The Papiſts think that this is the peculiar right of Biſhops:<note place="margin">And c. 30. he ſheweth inſtances of Concil. Antiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. c. 7. Tarrac. c. 13. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Tolet. 1. &amp; ex Gregor. l. 4. ep. 88. Synod. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liber. &amp;c.</note> But they are clearly refuted by the univerſal practice of the whole Church, from the beginning: For in all Provincial and National Synods, Presbyters did ever give voice and ſubſcribe in the very ſame ſort that Biſhops did; whether they were aſſembled to make Canons of Diſcipline, to hear Cauſes, or to define doubtful points of doctrine: And that they did not anciently ſit and give deciſive voices in General Councils, the reaſon was, not becauſe they have no intereſt in ſuch deliberations and reſolutions, but becauſe ſeeing all cannot meet in Councils that have intereſt in ſuch buſineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>but ſome muſt be deputed for and authorized by the reſt, it was thought fit that the Biſhops—] So here are Biſhops authorized by Presbyters as their Deputies in the greateſt affairs in General Councils.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth to prove this by inſtances, Concil. Later. ſub Innoc. 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VI. Even Archbiſhop Whitgift maintaineth (as Doctor Stillingfleet hath collected, Iren. pag. 394.) that [No kind of Government is expreſſed in the word, or can neceſſarily be concluded thence:—No form of Church Government is by the Scriptures commanded to the Church of God (or preſcribed.)] And Doctor Stillingfleet there citeth <note n="*" place="margin">King James, Dr. Low, Ep.

               <p>VII. Biſhop Bilſon Perpet. Govern. p. 16. c. 391. ſaith, [The Synod of Antioch which depoſed Paulus Samoſat. as Euſebius ſheweth lib. 7. c. 38. &amp; in Concil Eliber. about the time of the firſt Nicene Council ſate Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, even 36.

And in the firſt ſub Symmach. where after 72 Biſhops ſubſcribed 67 Presbyters: So in the third, fifth, and ſixth, under the ſame Symmachus, Felix had a council of 43 Biſhops and 74 Presbyters.

Even Gropperus the Papiſt pleadeth in the Council of Trent for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of Synods of Presbyters inſtead of Officials, (the thing ſo much deteſted in England, as that all we undergo muſt rather be endured) yet ſaith Groppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [Reſtore the Synodals which are not ſubject to ſo great corruption, removing

thoſe Officers by whom the world is ſo much ſcandalized, becauſe it is not poſſible that Germany ſhould endure them.] The Spaniards and Dutch men willingly heard this, but not the reſt. Hiſt. p. 334. lib. 4.</p>
               <p>XIII. The opinion of Paulus himſelf, the author of that Hiſtory, is ſo fully and excellently laid down, of the Original of the Biſhops grandeur, and of the manner of introducing the Eccleſiaſtical Courts by the occaſion of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Arbitrations, and Conſtantines Edict, as that I intreat the Reader to turn to and peruſe p. 330, 331, 332, 333.</p>
               <p>XIV. Fileſacus (a Learned Papiſt) copiouſly proveth from Councils that Presbyters were called the Rectors of the Churches, pag. 560. And more than ſo, that they were called Hierarchici and Prelates, and had place in Councils, eſpecially Provincial, p. 576, 577, 578. Pag. 574. he citeth Concil. Aquiſgr. ſaying, Presbyteri qui praeſunt Eccleſiis, de omnibus hominibus qui ad eorum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam pertinent, per omnia curam gerant. Pag. 576. he proveth they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prelates abundantly. Pag. 577. Epiſcoporum inſtar ſuam habebant plebem regendam.</p>
               <p>XV. Mr. H. Thorndike is ſo large in defending the Presbyters Governing power, and that as grounded on the power of Congregating, in his Form of Primit. Gov. and Right of Church, &amp;c. that it would be tedious to recite his words. Pag. 98. he ſaith, [The power of the Keys belongeth to the Presbyters and is convertible with the power of celebrating the Euchariſt, and that's the Reaſon why it belongeth to them (Nothing could be ſpoken plainer to our uſe.)</p>
               <p>And p. 128. The power of the Keys, that is, The whole power of the Church, whereof that power is the root and ſource, is common to Biſhops and Presbyters.]</p>
               <p>And Right of Ch. p. 126, 129, 130, 131. he ſaith much more to confirm this by teſtimonies and inſtances of antiquity.</p>
               <p>XVI. The great Jo. Gerſon is cited to your hand by the ſame Fileſacus as ſhewing that Curates were Hierarchical, Quia eadem opera Hierarchica eis incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt quae &amp; Epiſcopis: And more out of Gerſon, de Concil.

               <p>XVII. I will end all in the fulleſt teſtimony for theſe times, His Majeſties Declaration concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, before the paſſing of which it was examined by his Majeſty and the Lord Chancellor, before Dukes, Lords, Biſhops, Doctors of their party, and many of us alſo that are now ſilenced, and after all two great Biſhops with Biſhop Reynolds and Mr. Calamy appointed by the King to joyn with two Lords to ſee that it were worded according to the Kings expreſſed ſenſe. And it ſaith p. 11, &amp;c. [Becauſe the Dioceſes, eſpecially ſome of them are thought to be of too large extent, we will appoint ſuch a number of Suffragan Biſhops in every Dioceſe as ſhall be ſufficient for the due performance of their work <note n="*" place="margin">But no one in all the land was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this day.</note>. 3.

appertaineth to the cenſures of the Church without the advice and aſſiſtance of the Presbyters: And no Chancellors, Commiſſaries or Officials as ſuch, ſhall exerciſe any act of Spiritual Juriſdiction, in theſe caſes, viz. Excommunication, Abſolution, &amp;c.—[As to Excommunication our will and pleaſure is, that no Chancellor, Commiſſary, or Official Decree any Sentence of Excommunication or Abſolution—Nor ſhall the Archdeacon exerciſe any Juriſdiction without the advice and aſſiſtance of ſix Miniſters of his Archdeaconry, whereof three to be nominated by the Biſhop, and three by the election of the major part of the Presbyters within the Archdeaconry. 4. To the end the Dean and Chapters may the better be fitted to afford counſel and aſſiſtance to the Biſhops both in Ordination and other offices mentioned before, &amp;c.—Moreover an equal number to thoſe of the Chapter of the moſt learned, pious, and diſcreet Presbyters of the ſame Dioceſe annually choſen by the major Vote of all the Presbyters of that Dioceſe preſent at the Election, ſhall be always adviſing and aſſiſting together with thoſe of the Chapter in all Ordinations and every part of Juriſdiction which appertains to the cenſure of the Church, and at all other ſolemn and important actions in the exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction wherein any of the Miniſtery are concerned.—And our Will is that the great work of Ordination be conſtantly and ſolemnly performed by the Biſhop and his aforeſaid Presbytery—5. We will take care that confirmation be rightly and ſolemnly performed by the information and with the conſent of the Miniſter of the place: Who ſhall admit none to the Lords Supper till they have made a credible profeſſion of their faith, and promiſed obedience, &amp;c.—Beſides the Suffragans and their Presbytery, every Rural Dean—together with three or four Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that Deanry choſen by the major part of all the Miniſters within the ſame, ſhall meet once in every month, to receive ſuch complaints as ſhall be preſented to them by the Miniſters and Church-wardens of the reſpective pariſhes, and alſo to compoſe all ſuch differences between party and party, as ſhall be referred to them by way of Arbitration, and to convince offenders, and reform all ſuch things as they find amiſs, by their Paſtoral Reproofs and Admonitions, if they may be ſo reformed. And ſuch matters as they cannot by this Paſtoral and perſwaſive way compoſe and reform, are by them to be prepared for and preſented to the Biſhop; At which meeting any other Miniſters of the Deanry may if they pleaſe be preſent and aſſiſt. Moreover the Rural Dean and his Aſſiſtants are in their reſpective di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to ſee that the children and younger ſort be carefully inſtructed by the reſpective Miniſters, &amp;c.] See the reſt.</p>
               <p>This was the judgment of his Majeſty, &amp;c. 1660. And on theſe terms we were ready to have Conformed and United with the Prelatiſts ſo far as to go in the peaceable performance of our Offices. But that very Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who gave his Majeſty thanks for this his Declaration, did lay it by, ſo that it was never done, but other Laws eſtabliſhed which we feel.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You do but obtrude on us your own opinions: For when you had drawn up moſt of thoſe words, his Majeſty was fain to ſeem for the preſent to grant them you, for the quieting of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61252:155"/>Anſw. 1. If we did offer ſuch things, let the world judge what we ſought by them. 2. There is moſt of that about Rural Deanries put in (I ſuppoſe by the Biſhops conſent who were to word it) after it went from us, and after the King had done with it, on October 22. 1660. 3. Whoever motioned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it, by this it appeareth that his Majeſty and thoſe that counſelled him, did not then think the work of Juriſdiction, Excommunication, Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no nor Ordination, to be aliene to or above the office of the Presbyter. And if that be no part of his Paſtoral work, they would not have appointed it him.</p>
               <p>Yet finally let the Reader note, that though my proofs have reached as high as the power of Canon-making, Juriſdiction, Court-excommunications and Ordination; Yet it is no more than the power of Paſtoral Guidance of our particular Pariſh Churches, and not to be forced to adminiſter all holy things (Sacraments, Abſolutions, &amp;c.) contrary to our conſciences, at other mens will who know not our people, and not to thoſe that we know to be utterly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Infidels, Scandalous, and Impenitent, that I am here pleading for.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore boldly after all this proof, that the Presbyters office which was inſtituted by God, and uſed by the ancient Churches, contained an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and Authority not only to Teach and Worſhip, but alſo the reſt of the Power of the Keys, to Rule the Churches committed to their care, (not by the ſword or force, but) by a paſtoral perſwaſive power, judging who is to be taken in and put out, and what perſons are fit objects for the reſpective exerciſes of their, own Miniſterial acts: (which was the thing I was engaged to make good.)</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe laſt ſhift that ſome Prelatiſts have, is to diſtinguiſh between the forum internum Conſcientiae, poenitentiale, and the forum externum Eccleſiaſticum, and to tell us that indeed Presbyters have the Power of the Keys in private or in the firſt ſenſe, but not in Publick or in the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Note that the queſtion is not whether they have the ſole power, or the chief power, or with what limitations it is fit for them to exerciſe it, nor what appeals there ſhould be from them; But whether the power of the Keys be part of their office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61252:156"/>2. That the queſtion is not of the power of Governing the Church by the ſword, which belongeth to the King, and is Extrinſick to the Paſtoral office, and to the being of the Church (As protecting the Church, puniſhing Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenders corporally, &amp;c.) For this is proper to the Magiſtrate, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neither to Biſhops nor Presbyters as ſuch. We claim no part with the Prelates in any ſuch ſecular Government as their Courts uſe, except when they come to Excommunication and Abſolution: At leaſt no coercive power at all.</p>
               <p>3. All the queſtion is of the power of the Keys of Admiſſion, Conduct and Excluſion; of judging who ſhall have Sacraments, and Church-Communion with our aſſemblies? that is, Who ſhall be pronounced fit or unfit for it, by our ſelves?</p>
               <p>And that this belongeth to Presbyters in foro publico Eccleſiae, I prove,</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe they are Publick officers, or Paſtors over that Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their power of the Keys is a publick Church power, elſe they had none of the Keys as Paſtors of that Church at all: For the Keys are to Let in and put out; They are the Church Keys: and he that hath power only to ſpeak ſecretly to a ſingle perſon, doth not thereby take in to the Church or put any out, nor Guide them publickly. A man that is a Miniſter (at leaſt) may convince, ſatisfie, comfort any mans conſcience in ſecret, of what Church ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, even as he is a member of the Univerſal Church. But he that is a publick Officer and Governour of the Church may publickly Govern the Church. But a Presbyter is a publick officer and Governour: Ergo.</p>
               <p>2. The reſt of his office may be publickly performed, Coram Eccleſia, and not in ſecret only: He may Preach to the Church, Pray with the Church, Praiſe God with them, Give them the Sacrament: Therefore by parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he may publickly exerciſe diſcipline, unleſs any by-accident pro tempore forbid it.</p>
               <p>3. Elſe he muſt be made a meer Inſtrument of another and not a rational free Agent and Miniſter of Chriſt: Yea perhaps more like to an Aſſe who may carry Bread and Wine to the Church, or like a Parrot that may ſay what he is bid, than a man who hath a diſcerning judgment what he is to do. I muſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly baptize, and publickly preach and pray, and publickly give the Lords Body and Bloud: And if I muſt be no Judge my ſelf to whom I muſt do this, then, 1. Either I may and muſt do it to any one (without offending God) to whom the Biſhop bids me do it: And if ſo, I may Excommunicate the faithful and curſe Gods children, and abſolve the moſt notoriouſly wicked, if the Biſhop bid me. And how come they to have more power than King Balak had over Balaam? or than a Chriſtian Emperour had over Chryſoſtom? He that ſaith to the wicked, Thou art righteous, Nations ſhall curſe him, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall abhor him, Prov. 24. 24. Wo to them that call evil good and good evil! But what if the Biſhop bid them? If I may not preach lies or hereſies if the Biſhop bid me, then I may not lyingly curſe the faithful nor bleſs the wicked if he bid me. If I may not forbear preaching the Goſpel meerly for the will of man, when God calleth me to it, much leſs may I ſpeak ſlanders, yea
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61252:156"/>
and lie in the name of God, when men bid me. The French Prieſt did wiſelier than ſo, that being bid from the Pope to Curſe and Excommunicate the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſaid, I know not who it is that is in the right, and who is in the wrong, but I do Excommunicate him that is in the wrong whoever he be.</p>
               <p>2. Or elſe, it will follow that I am bound to ſin and damn my ſoul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whenever the Biſhop will command me: which is a contradiction.</p>
               <p>3. Or elſe it will follow that I am a beaſt, that am not to judge or know what I do, and therefore my acts are neither ſin nor duty.</p>
               <p>4. If he have not the Keys to uſe publickly in foro Eccleſiae he hath no power of Excommunication and Reſtitution at all: For to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cater is publickly to notifie to the Church, that this perſon is none of them, nor to be communicated with, and to charge them to avoid his company.</p>
               <p>5. The Biſhops themſelves put the Presbyters to proclaim or read the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: and if this be any Miniſterial or Paſtoral act, certainly it is in foro Eccleſiae.</p>
               <p>6. Moſt of the Acts before named as their conceſſions, as to be in the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c. are acts in foro publico.</p>
               <p>7. The full proofs before brought from Antiquity, of Presbyters ſitting in Councils, Judging, Excommunicating, &amp;c. are of publick, not private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Keys.</p>
               <p>8. They are the ſame Keys or Office power which Chriſt hath committed to the Paſtors, even the Guidance of his Church, to feed his lambs: And ubi Lex non diſtinguit non eſt diſtinguendum. Where doth Chriſt or Scripture ſay, You ſhall uſe the Keys of Church-power privately, but not in the Church, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly?</p>
               <p>9. All this ſtriving againſt Power in the Miniſters of Chriſt, is but ſtriving againſt their duty, work, and the ends and benefits of it: He that hath no Power for publick diſcipline, hath no obligation to uſe it; and ſo he is to neglect it: And this is it that the Devil would have, to keep a thouſand or many hundred Paſtors in a Dioceſe from doing the publick work of Diſcipline: And as if he could confine Preaching to Dioceſans only (And I verily believe they are better of the two at Preaching, than at Diſcipline) he knoweth that it is but few ſouls of many thouſands that would be taught: Even ſo when he can confine Church diſcipline to the Dioceſanes, he knoweth how little of it will be done. And who will uſe his wit, learning and zeal, to plead his cauſe, and his parts and office thus to ſerve his deſigns and gratifie him, who conſidereth what it is to be a Biſhop, a Chriſtian, or a man?</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> That the Engliſh Dioceſane Government doth change this office of a Presbyter of Gods inſtitution into another (<hi>quantum in ſe</hi>) of humane invention.</head>
               <p>I Come now to prove the Minor propoſition of my Argument; That the Dioceſane Government depoſeth the Office of Presbyters which God hath inſtituted (as much as in them lieth) By which limitation I mean, that if we would judge of the Power and Obligation of Presbyters, as the Prelatical conſtitution de facto doth deſcribe it, and not as God deſcribeth it contrarily, we muſt take it for another thing.</p>
               <p>For the proof of this it muſt 1. be conſidered what is Eſſential to the office, and 2. How ſomewhat Eſſential is taken from them.</p>
               <p>I. And 1. we grant (as before) that no Action whatſoever, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the preſent, or for ſome excepted ſeaſon, is Eſſential to the Paſtoral office: A man ceaſeth not to be a Preacher or Paſtor, as ſoon as the Sermon is done and he is out of the Church. When a man is aſleep or in a journey, he endeth not his office: Nor yet when he is interrupted by buſineſs, ſickneſs, or perſecution. Yea, if he were ſo ſick, as to be ſure never to exerciſe his office more, he keepeth the Title with reſpect to what he hath already done.</p>
               <p>2. Yet Exerciſe as Intended and as the Relative end or Terminus of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and Authority, is Eſſential to the Office: For when it is a Relation which we queſtion, and that conſiſteth in Obligation and Authority, there is no doubt but it is ad aliquid, and is ſpecified by the Action or Exerciſe to which men are Obliged and Authorized. (As a Judge, a Souldier, a Phyſician, are) And it being a Calling which we ſpeak of, and that durante vita &amp; capacitate, it muſt be ſuch Action as is intended to be Ordinary, and Conſtant. He that Conſenteth not to do the work of a Miniſter, and that for more than a trial or a preſent occaſion, and is not Obliged and Authorized to that work, at leaſt ſtatedly as his intended ordinary courſe of life, is no Miniſter of Chriſt: which Paul well expreſſeth by that phraſe Rom. 1. 1. Separated to the Goſpel of God.</p>
               <p>3. As God in creating man made him in his own Image, ſo did Chriſt in making Church Paſtors: Therefore he ſaith, As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you: And he that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61252:157"/>
me, and—him that ſent me, Luke 10. 16. And they are Embaſſadours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech men in his name and ſtead to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. And Chriſt himſelf is called the Angel of the Covenant, and the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our Profeſſion, and the Great Prophet, and the Biſhop of our Souls, and the good Shepherd, and the great Shepherd or Paſtor of the flock, and the Miniſter of the Circumciſion: And he was a Preacher of the ſame word of life as we are: And he adminiſtred the ſame Sacrament of Communion as we do.</p>
               <p>Now as the Office of Chriſt had theſe three Eſſential parts, viz. to be the Teacher, the High Prieſt, and the Ruler of the Church; ſo hath (not only the Apoſtles, but) every true Paſtor in his place (as is proved) this threefold ſubſerviency to Chriſt. 1. They will confeſs themſelves, that He is no true Paſtor who hath not Authority and Obligation (which ſet together are called a Commiſſion) to be a Teacher of the Church. For though ſome men may be ſo weak as that they can Teach but by Reading, Catechizing, Conference, or very ſhort defective immethodical Sermons: And though where a Church hath Many, the Ableſt may be the uſual publick Preachers, and the reſt be but his aſſiſtants: Yet I never found any proof of Elders that were not Teachers by office as well as Rulers, and had not Commiſſion to Teach the flock ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their abilities, and might not Preach as the need of the Church required it, however the weaker may give place to the abler in the exerciſe of his office. Becauſe his office is an Obligation and Authority to exerciſe his Gifts as they are, for the Churches greateſt edification.</p>
               <p>2. And it will be confeſſed that he is no Miniſter or Paſtor who is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by Chriſt to be the Churches Guide in publick Worſhip, in Prayer, praiſe, and Sacrament of Communion: However where there are many, all cannot officiate at once.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore all the doubt remaineth whether the power of the Keys for Church Covernment, ſuch as belongeth to Paſtors, be not as Eſſential as the reſt; I ſay the Commiſſion, the Authority, and the Obligation, (though violence may much hinder the exerciſe) And this I have proved before and muſt not ſtay to repeat it. Only 1. God doth not diſtinguiſh, when he giveth them the Keys and office. Therefore we muſt not diſtinguiſh. 2. The very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words [Keys, Paſtor, Presbyter, Overſeer, Steward, &amp;c.] do not only import this Guiding, Ruling power, but notably ſignifie it, as moſt think more notably than the Worſhipping part of their office. 3. Dr. Hammond and all of his mind confeſs that in Scripture theſe words are applyed to no one perſon or office, that had not the Governing as well as the Teaching and Worſhipping power. 4. The truth is, the Teaching, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Worſhipping power, are inſeparably twiſted together. Ruling is done (not by the ſword here, but) in a Teaching way by the Word: As a Phyſician may 1. read a Lecture of health to his Patients, 2. and give every one particular directions for his own cure; and this laſt is called Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them: So when the ſame Paſtor who Teacheth all generally by Sermons, doth make his applications to mens perſons and caſes particularly,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61252:158"/>
it is Governing the Church: as when a man is impenitent, he doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him only by teaching him and the Church, that ſuch perſons as are ſo impenitent are under the wrath of God, and uncapable of Church Communion, and therefore requiring the Church as from Chriſt, to avoid that perſon, and declaring him to be under the wrath of God till he repent, and requiring him to forbear Communion with the Church. And ſo in other acts of Government. And as in Worſhipping, the Paſtor delivereth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Communion, ſo it muſt belong to him to Give it or Deny it. 5. And indeed the ancient Churches had uſually more Paſtors than Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, by which means every Presbyter could not daily preach and officiate. But yet they were ſo conſtant Aſſiſtants in the Government, as hath occaſioned ſo many to think that it was mere Ruling Elders who joyned with the Biſhops in thoſe times. And Paul himſelf ſaying 1 Tim. 5. 17. The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour in the word and doctrine, doth plainly imply that there were fewer who were thus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the word and doctrine than that Ruled well. For indeed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practices of the Churches expoundeth this Text, when the Churches ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving few Learned or able Speakers, he that could ſpeak or preach beſt, did preach ordinarily, and was made Chief or Biſhop, and the reſt helped him in Government, and other offices, and taught the people more privately, and preached ſeldomer when the Biſhop bid them and there was need: (Being yet of the ſame office.)</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Why then may they not now be forbidden publick Government</hi> in foro Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae exteriore?</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Our queſtion is not chiefly what part of the exerciſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office may be reſtrained on juſt occaſion; But what it is which truly belongeth to their office. 2. It is one thing to forbid it them pro tempore; and another ſtatedly (for this changeth the Office.) 3. It is one thing to forbid a man Preaching, Praying, or Exerciſe of Diſcipline in a Church where there are many, and all cannot ſpeak at once, and his reſtraint is for the better doing of the work, and the avoiding of confuſion: And another thing to forbid a ſingle Paſtor of a Pariſh Church, with all his Curates, to do it, when there is no other there, nor near the place, that knoweth the people, to do it; but it muſt be undone. 4. And indeed the caſe of Diſcipline in this differeth from Preaching and officiating in Worſhip: Two men cannot do the later at once in the ſame Congregation, without confuſion and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of Edification: But ten men or twenty may conſult and conſent to the acts of Diſcipline. So that by Reaſon, Scripture, and Antiquity it is clear, that if any one part were more eſſential to the Presbyters office than the reſt, it would be the Authority and Obligation to Rule the flock by the word of God, and exerciſe the Church Keys of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>II. Now that this power is here taken from them (notwithſtanding all the forecited Conceſſions or Confeſſions that it is due to them) I prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61252:158"/>I. I might premiſe, that Ubi non eſt idem fundamentum, non eſt eadem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio: At, &amp;c. There is not the ſame foundation, therefore not the ſame Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For 1. Here is not the ſame Election, no nor Conſent. I opened this before. Though all Antiquity gave the Church the Election of her own Paſtors, yet we make not that neceſſary to the being of the office, or relation to them: So there be but Conſent. But we take Conſent of the Church to be neceſſary to any mans Paſtoral Relation to that Church (though not to the Miniſtery in general as unfixed.) For ſeeing it is not poſſible to Exerciſe the office without the peoples Conſent, it cannot be aſſumed as over them without their Conſent: Becauſe that which cannot be Exerciſed ſhould not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be exerciſed. But with us, commonly, the Patron chooſeth, and the Biſhop approveth, inſtituteth, and giveth him induction, and ſo he is fully ſetled in title and poſſeſſion in their way, without any of the peoples knowledge or conſent.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You chooſe Parliament men who make theſe laws, and your Anceſtours conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Patrons power: Therefore you conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. This ſeemeth a jeſt, but that the buſineſs and execution make it a ſerious matter to us. 1. It cannot be proved that all the Churches or people gave the Patrons that power. 2. We never intended to conſent that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſhould do what they liſt, and diſpoſe of our Souls, or of that which is neceſſary to the ſaving of our Souls. 3. Elſe you may as well ſay that we conſent to be Baptized and to receive the Sacraments, becauſe the Parliament whom we choſe conſenteth to it: And ſo we may baptize Infidels becauſe their great grandfathers conſented that all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhould be Chriſtians: And you need no diſcipline to keep men from the Sacrament, if Noah conſented that all his poſterity ſhould fear God and ſerve him and ſo be ſaved. Many men are jeſted out of their ſaith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but none are thus jeſted into it. Sin is a mockery, but ſo is not piety. 4. Our forefathers had no power to repreſent us by ſuch conſenting. If they could oblige us to Duty by their Authority, they cannot be our ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for the performance of duty, any more than for the poſſeſſion of the reward. 5. What God himſelf hath laid upon the Perſon or exiſtent Church, they cannot commit to another if they would themſelves, becauſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was perſonal, and they have not Gods conſent for the tranſmutation. We cannot ſerve God by proxy, nor be happy by proxy.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But how unfit are the common people to chooſe their Paſtors: They are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and partial, and tumultuous. Do the children beget their own father, or the ſheep chooſe their own ſhepherd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. No: but wives chooſe their own husbands, and Patients chooſe their own Phyſicians, and Clients their own Advocates, and ſervants their own maſters, &amp;c. Similitudes run not on four feet. If all the Church of Chriſt beſides the Prelates and their Curates, be as brutiſh as ſheep and as ſilly as infants (in compariſon of them) then they have talkt reaſon in their ſimilitude. Elſe—2. Is it not notorious in England that no Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61252:159"/>
have had more Learned and holy Paſtors, than where the People have had their choice? I deſire London but to conſider it (nay they know it by great experience) what men hath Aldermanbury had, Mr. Calamy, Dr. Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Dr. Taylor, and ſo before? What men hath Blackfryers had, Mr. Gibbons, Dr. Gouge, and many formerly? So alſo Antholins, Lincolns-Inn, Greys-Inn, the Temple, &amp;c. But the truth is, that is an excellent perſon to us, who is an odious or contemptible perſon to the high Prelatiſts. If he will preach as Heylin writeth, and make the people believe that Presbyterians are Rebels, and Diſciplinarians are ſeditious brainſick fellows, and ſtrict living is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and praying without book and much preaching is Fanaticiſm, and that none are worthy to preach the Goſpel who will not ſwear to be true to this Prelatical intereſt: that drunkenneſs in a Conformable man is a tolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and their ignoranteſt nonſence is fitter to ſave ſouls or Edifie the Church, than the labours of a Learned Holy Nonconformiſt; that Calvin was a Rogue, and Cartwright, Ameſius and all ſuch as they, diſcontented factious Schiſmaticks, unworthy to preach or to be endured; This is a ſon of the Church, and an excellent perſon with the men in queſtion. But it is the man that Learnedly and Judiciouſly openeth the word of life, that cloſely and skilfully and ſeriouſly applyeth it, that is an example of Holineſs, Sobriety, Love, Meekneſs, Humility, and Patience to the flock, who ſpareth no labour or coſt or ſuffering for the ſaving of mens ſouls, who is for the wiſdom which is firſt pure and then peaceable, &amp;c. This is the Paſtor that is excellent in our eyes. And of ſuch I have oft wondred that the common people ſhould uſually chooſe far better than the Prelates do. But the truth is, Wiſdom and Goodneſs have their witneſſes even in the conſciences of natural men, which Faction, Pride, and Fleſhly intereſt doth bribe or ſilence, and cannot endure.</p>
               <p>3. But what's all this to us? We plead not now for the neceſſity of the peoples Elections, but only for their conſent: If the Patrons as now, or the Clergy as formerly be the Nominators, or Electors, yet ſhould the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be acknowledged neceſſary in the ſecond place.</p>
               <p>4. For who is fitter to chooſe, or refuſe, or conſent at leaſt, than he whoſe everlaſting intereſt lieth at the ſtake? It is their own ſoul that muſt be ſaved or damned? And in good ſadneſs do theſe Dioceſans love the ſouls of all the people better than they love their own? Do you make them believe this, by not ſeeing one of a thouſand or many hundred of your flock once in all the time of your lives? Doth the ſilencing of ſo many Miniſters ſhew it? Chriſt will have all men at age in Covenanting, Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, to be Chuſers or Refuſers for themſelves, becauſe (as Clem. Alexandr. Strom. 1. ſaith,) they have free will, and it is themſelves that muſt have the gain or loſs, that muſt be in heaven or hell for ever. What if a Prelate, a Parliament, a Patron, or a forefather, chuſe Maſsprieſts or Hereticks for us, muſt we accept the choice? Is this our bewaring of falſe prophets, and of the leaven of the Phariſees, and our trying all things, and letting no man deceive us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. But how unfit is this objection for a Prelates mouth or pen? Are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61252:159"/>
you the Church Governours? Is all this contention that you may have the Keys alone, without the pariſh Miniſters? And is this the fruit of all your Government, that the common Church members are ſo mad, ſo bad, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, that they are not fit to be free Conſenters to them that are to Teach and Guide them to ſalvation? Who then is this Church Ruine and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion long of but your ſelves, who have and only will have the Keys? Have you not fine Churches and members, that are not fit to chooſe no nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their own Guides? Why do you not take care that the Churches by diſcipline may be better conſtituted? As none ſhould be Paſtors who are not fit for the duty of Paſtors, ſo none ſhould be members who are not fit for the duty of members. It's excellent Government inded to keep ſuch in the Church as are unfit to be there, and then fetch an argument from their unfitneſs for their neglect of their duty, and your depriving them of their power? As if you ſhould chooſe none but ideots (or moſt ſuch) to be Jury men, and then argue thence, that they are unfit for ſo great a truſt, and ſo the people muſt loſe their liberties.</p>
               <p>6. There are among the ignoranter ſort of the people, uſually divers ſober and good men, and the reſt uſe much to hearken to them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But what if the people will not conſent to any but a Heretick or intolerable perſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. The former anſwers ſerve to this: You do fairly to keep ſuch people in the Church? But as the Foreigner wondered in Henry the Eighth's days, to ſee at once ſome hanged for being Papiſts, and ſome burnt for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants, and cried out Dii boni quomodo gentes hic vivunt! So it is ſuch another caſe to ſee at once the ſame Prelates forcing the unwilling into the Church and to the Sacrament, as if this would or could ſave them (if their Church be ſalvation) in deſpight of them, even on pain of undoing, and perpetual impriſonment; And yet Excommunicating and caſting out thoſe that are willing to ſtay in; As if Conſent were a mark of an aliene and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and unwillingneſs the mark of worthineſs.</p>
               <p>2. Such as you here deſcribe are not fit to be members of a Church. If they will not Conſent to Church priviledges and duties, they ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doors. And you may force them to hear Teaching whether they are willing or not; But you cannot make them Godly nor bring them to heaven, nor give them right to Church Communion and Sacraments whether they will or not. So much of Election and Conſent.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover the Ordination differeth from that of Gods inſtitution. For Presbyters are now Ordained commonly neither by Archbiſhops, Biſhops or Presbyters of Chriſts inſtitution (in their way.)</p>
               <p>1. The Biſhops themſelves profeſs that they Ordain not as Presbyters. For they ſay ſuch have no power of Ordination. 2. They are not Biſhops of Chriſts inſtitution as is before proved; but of another ſpecies, which half themſelves confeſs to be but humane. 3. They are not Archbiſhops, becauſe they have no Biſhops under them. And ſo having not their power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Officers of Gods making, they have no power from him to Ordain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61252:160"/>Obj. <hi>By theſe two laſt differences you ſeem to give up the Cauſe to the Separatiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. The Prelatiſts do ſo; but ſo do not we: 1. Becauſe whether the Prelates will or not, the people ex poſt facto do Conſent to every worthy Paſtor. 2. Becauſe we judge of Pariſh Miniſters as God deſcribeth them, and therefore as true Biſhops: and conſequently take the Prelates for a kind of Archbiſhops whatever they call themſelves. 3. And there is no honeſt Miniſter but hath the Conſent of ſome neighbour Miniſters and of the People: And though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands be a laudable Ceremony, yet it is not that, but mutual Conſent of themſelves and the Paſtors and People in which their external call conſiſteth, as is before ſaid.</p>
               <p>II. The different Correlates and Termini make different Relations. The Churches which the ancient Presbyters were related to, were true entire Churches, (however their work might be parcelled among the members.) But according to the Prelates platform, each Presbyter hath his charge over no Church of Chriſt at all, but only over a hundredth, ſix hundredth or thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of a Church, having no more to do with all the reſt than if they were of another Dioceſe.</p>
               <p>III. But I come to the point intended: That they take from the Presbyter his eſſential Obligation and Authority appeareth,</p>
               <p>1. In general, they commonly affirm, that the Governing power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to them; and that they are but the Biſhops Curates: By which they mean not only that the Biſhops rule them: but they ſay that the Biſhop doth Teach all his Dioceſe per alios, even by theſe his Curates. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they have lately blotted out of their Litany [Biſhops, Paſtors, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church] and have ſubſtituted [Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons] leſt the Prieſts ſhould be ſuppoſed Paſtors. But they altered not the Collect for all Biſhops and Curates. And they have put out of the Office for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Prieſts, Act. 20. 28. Now what a Presbyter doth in the perſon of the Biſhop and as his inſtrument, that he doth not in the diſtinct perſon of a Presbyter: He that payeth money or delivereth poſſeſſion in his Maſters name, doth it not in his own. So that if really they mean as they ſay, that quoad perſonam legalem quamvis non naturalem, it be the Biſhop that doth Teach and Officiate per alios, then no Presbyter is indeed endued with any power of Teaching, Officiating, or Ruling in the perſon of a Presbyter, but only to be the Servant and Inſtrument of the Dioceſane.</p>
               <p>2. No Presbyter hath power to judge whom he ſhall Baptize, or whom to refuſe; but is to Baptize all without any exception that have Godfathers and Godmothers, who will but ſay the words in the book. The Canon 78. is [No Miniſter ſhall refuſe or delay to Chriſten any Child according to the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, that is brought to the Church to him upon Sundays or Holidays to be Chriſtened—Elſe ſuſpended three months from his Miniſtry. (Yea, that is it that pays for all.) So Can. 79. he is bound to do in houſes in caſe of danger.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61252:160"/>
Yet Can. 29. No Parent ſhall be urged to be PRESENT nor be admitted to anſwer as Godfather for his own child. Now the Liturgy requireth not any Godfather to Adopt the Child, and take it for his own: Nor doth it allow us to refuſe the Children of Turks, Jews, or Heathens; And if theſe God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers be known Atheiſts, Turks, Jews or Heathens, or the filthieſt Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers or wicked perſons, if they did ever in their lives receive the Sacrament, and will ſay as the Book bids them, the Prieſt cannot refuſe the Child. But if the godlieſt Parent can get none to be ſuch Godfathers or Godmothers, his Child muſt not be Baptized. I told the Biſhops my ſelf that I had a notorious Infidel boaſted that he would bring his Child to be baptized, and ſay the words of the book, and ſee who durſt refuſe it; And I was anſwered that if the Child had Godfathers, there was no ſcruple but I ſhould Baptize him: But, when I ask, what if theſe Infidels (profeſſedly ſuch) be the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſay before-hand [I will ſay thoſe words and refuſe me if you dare] they have nothing to ſay, that common reaſon ſhould regard. Now he that is but ſent to Baptize thoſe (even all whomſoever) that others bid him baptize, and hath no more diſcerning or judging power of the perſons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, than a Lay-man hath, is in this no Presbyter, but a Prelates meſſenger or ſervant.</p>
               <p>3. They have no power to inſtruct, admoniſh, or reprove in ſecret or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or in their own houſes, any one Ignorant Heretical Infidel, Atheiſtical or ſcandalous wicked man, that will but refuſe to ſpeak with them or to hear them. And yet he muſt give this perſon the Sacrament, at leaſt till he prove that by him which his refuſal to ſpeak to him maketh impoſſible to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proved. If I have great reaſon by ſome private occaſional ſpeech or report to believe, that many of the Pariſh know no more of Chriſt than Pagans do; or that they among their own companions (who will not accuſe them) profeſs Atheiſm, Infidelity, or Hereſie; or if after ſcandalous fames I would admoniſh them to repent; If they refuſe to ſpeak with me, or ſuffer me not to come and ſpeak to them, I have no remedy; but muſt ſtill continue them in the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You would not have ſuch men forced your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. But I would not be forced then my ſelf, to give him the Sacrament of Communion as his Paſtor, who refuſeth to ſpeak with me or to hear me as his Paſtor; but would have power to refuſe that Paſtoral adminiſtration to him that refuſeth the reſt.</p>
               <p>4. They have no power to judge of the fitneſs of any one for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, in point of knowledge, faith, or Covenanting with God, nor whether he underſtand what the Sacrament is, any more than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel or ideot; ſo be it the Biſhop do but confirm him (in his childhood) or he will ſay that he is ready to be confirmed. Indeed all are required to ſend their children to be Catechiſed; But 1. few Miniſters uſe it: 2. few perſons in a pariſh come. 3. If they refuſe, we cannot prevent their further communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating. 4. It is but to ſay over the words of that Catechiſm which they are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61252:161"/>
called to; which experience tells us children will do like Parrots, without underſtanding what they ſay: And we muſt not ask them any other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It is true alſo that they who are confirmed by the Biſhop ſhould bring a Certificate from the Miniſter that they can ſay the Creed, Lords prayer, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, &amp;c. But they may chooſe, and not one of many doth it. I went my ſelf at thirteen years of age or fourteen, to the worthy Biſhop Morton with the reſt of the School-boyes without any Certificate, and without any exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he haſtily ſaid as he paſſed on three or four lines of a prayer over us, when I knew not what he ſaid: And after this, no Miniſter can refuſe any one at age the Sacrament. The Rubrick ſaith, They ſhould openly own their Baptiſm, &amp;c. But few do it, and none can be refuſed for not doing it. And ſo the tranſition from the number of Infant members into the number of the adult, is made without the Miniſters Conſent (Though the Kings Declaration once yielded to the contrary) And Communicants croud upon him in utter ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, becauſe they were Baptized in Infancy: Nay few in a Pariſh (not one of many hundred of my acquaintance) is ever confirmed by the Biſhop at all, ſo much as ceremoniouſly, or regard it.</p>
               <p>5. They have no power to chooſe what Chapter they will read to the Church in publick (though a word before the Homilies lib. 2. ſeemed once to allow it them) But every day in the year even week-days and Holidays they are tyed up to the Chapters impoſed on them, though Bell and the Dragon, Judith, Suſanna, Tobit, and other Apocryphal writings be appointed for Leſſons, even about 106 Chapters of the Apocrypha in two months: And though any ſcandal or other occaſion in his Church would direct him, to chooſe ſome other ſubject for the peoples good.</p>
               <p>6. He hath no power to chooſe what words to uſe in his publick prayers to God: no not to uſe any that are not written for him to read out of the book. And though cuſtom hath ſo uſed Miniſters to pray without book in the pulpit, yet this is but connived at becauſe it cannot eaſily be remedied: One of them wrote a book againſt it, as anſwering that part of our Savoy Reply 1660: Dr. Heylin hath largely laboured to prove that it is contrary to the Canon, which indeed doth ſeem expreſs againſt it: And that's not all; However their Conſciences digeſt it, all the Conformiſts in England do ſubſcribe as ex animo a covenant or promiſe [that they will uſe the form in the ſaid book preſcribed in publick prayer and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and no other.] Canon. 36. Mark, No other: And the Biſhops that endure this are forced to ſay, that theſe Pulpit prayers are not the Churches prayers but our own: But yet they are [Publick prayers] and therefore I doubt a breach of the Canon-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>7. A Presbyter as ſuch hath no power to preach the Goſpel. The words of his Ordination do but give him power to preach when he ſhall be lawfully called: yea his Preſentation, Inſtitution, Induction and poſſeſſion of a Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charge, do not all make up this Lawful call, nor may he preach one
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61252:161"/>
Sermon after all this, till he have a particular Licenſing Inſtrument from the Biſhop. So that he preacheth not meerly as a Presbyter nor as a poſſeſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, but as Licenſed by the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>8. When he viſiteth the ſick, he hath no Power left him to judge, Whether<note place="margin">In the new Rubrick is added <hi>[If he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and heartily deſire it]</hi> But if he will but ſay ſo, the Prieſt muſt not judge.</note> the perſon be penitent and fit to be Abſolved or not? But if the wickedeſt liver will but ſay or ſwear that he repenteth of Swearing, of Adultery, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, though ſuch expreſſions or circumſtances be ſuch as plainly tell a preſent Miniſter, that he hath nothing like to a ſerious repentance, yet muſt this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be forced even in Abſolute words to Abſolve him from all his ſins: When a Popiſh Confeſſor would require more. I do not in all this lay the fault that this Miniſter hath not power to keep away any of theſe perſons, from Baptiſm, Confirmation, the Lords Table, Abſolution, &amp;c. but only that he hath no Power to forbear his own action and application, and leave them to others that are ſatisfied to do it: Nor not ſo much as to delay till he give a reaſon of his doubt to his Lord Biſhop.</p>
               <p>9. When he buryeth the dead, he hath no power to judge ſo far as to the performing or reſtraining of his own act, whether the deceaſed perſon muſt needs be declared and pronounced bleſſed. Three ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he muſt deny Chriſtian burial to. 1. Thoſe that die unbaptized, (though they be the Children of the holieſt Parents) 2. Thoſe that kill themſelves (though they be the faithfulleſt perſons of godly and blameleſs lives, who do it in melancholy, deliration, a phrenzy, feaver, or diſtraction.) 3. All that are Excommunicate, (though by a Lay Chancellor,) for not paying their fees, or though it be becauſe they durſt not take the Sacrament from the hands of an ignorant, ungodly, drunken Prieſt, to whoſe miniſtery neither they nor other of the Pariſh did ever conſent; or that it be the Learnedeſt Godly Divine that is excommunicate for diſſenting from the Prelatiſts.</p>
               <p>But all others without any exception that are brought to Church, they muſt bury with a publick Declaration that they are ſaints, viz. [That God in mercy hath taken to himſelf the ſoul of this our dear brother] (And without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.) (So great difference in Holineſs there is between the Holy Church of Rome and ours, that they Canonize one Saint in an age by the Pope, and we as many as are buryed by the Prieſt.) Though it was the moſt notorious Thief or Murderer, or the moſt notorious Atheiſt, or Infidel, or Heretick, who either writeth, or preacheth or diſputeth that there is no God or no life to come, or uſeth in his ordinary talk to mock at Chriſt as a deceiver, and to ſcorn the Scriptures as nonſence and contradiction, or though it be a Jew who profeſſeth enmity to Chriſt? Much more if it be a common blaſphemer, perjured perſon, adulterer, drunkard, a ſcorner at a godly life, &amp;c. who never profeſſed repentance, but deſpiſed the Miniſter and his counſel to the laſt breath, yet if he be brought to the Church for buryal, the Prieſt muſt pronounce him ſaved in the aforeſaid words, ſo be it he be not Excommunicate (of which ſort of late there are too great numbers riſen up, in ſo much that the ſober Prelatiſts themſelves cry out of the growth and peril
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61252:162"/>
of Atheiſm, Infidelity, and moſt horrid filthineſs, and profaneneſs.) The words of the Canon are (Can 68.) [No Miniſter ſhall refuſe or delay to bury any corps that is brought to the Church or Churchyard (convenient warning being given thereof before) in ſuch manner and form as is preſcribed in the book of Common Prayer. And if he ſhall refuſe—except the party deceaſed were denounced Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Excommunicatione majori for ſome grievous and notorious crime, (and no man able to teſtifie of his repentance) he ſhall be ſuſpended by the Biſhop of the Dioceſe from his Miniſtry by the ſpace of three months] But the New Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick in the Liturgy ſaith, [The office enſuing is not to be uſed for any that die unbaptized, or Excommunicate, or have laid violent hands on themſelves.] The Office ſaith, [Foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himſelf the Soul of our dear brother here departed, &amp;c.] And [We give thee hearty thanks that it hath pleaſed thee to deliver this our brother out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this ſinful world.]</p>
               <p>And yet as ſelf-contradicters and condemners, if any man do but ſay of one that hath been openly againſt the Prelates or Conformity, that he was a godly honeſt man, (much more one that was againſt the King, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a downright Traitor who ſo lived and died impenitently) they take it for a heinous crime, (as in the latter caſe they well may do) And yet (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe whoſe quarters they ſet up upon the gates, or deny Chriſtian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to by the Magiſtrate,) the poor Prieſt muſt pronounce them all at the Grave to be the Biſhops dear brethren and ſaved as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>10. They have no Power to give the Sacrament of Communion with Chriſt and his Church, to any the moſt Learned holy Chriſtian, who dare not receive the Sacrament kneeling, (for fear of bread-worſhip in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c.) which (though I think is unwarrantably ſcrupled, yet) hath ſo much of Univerſality and Antiquity as maketh it ill beſeeming thoſe ſame men who cry up the Church Councils, Cuſtomes, and Antiquity, to caſt out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion thoſe that conform to all theſe, for ſo doing. For who knoweth not by Can. 20. of Concil. Nic. 1. and the conſent of Antiquity, that they took it for a cuſtome? and tradition and Canon of the Univerſal Church, that none ſhould at all adore God kneeling on any Lords day in the year, nor on any week-day between Eaſter and Whitſunday.</p>
               <p>11. They have no power to forbear denying the Sacrament of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any how faithful and holy ſoever, who is againſt the Dioceſanes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and is unwilling that thoſe whom he taketh to be no true Biſhops ſhould uſe that which he taketh (as uſed by them) to be no true Ordinance of God, but a taking of his name in vain; or if on any other account he be unwilling of it: For the new Rubrick is, [There ſhall none be admitted to the holy Communion, until ſuch time as he be Confirmed, or be ready and deſirous to be Confirmed.] So that it is not actual confirmation which they think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But [a Deſire of Confirmation] by the impoſition of the Dioceſanes hands, is made a thing neceſſary to Chriſtian Church Communion.</p>
               <p>12. As it is before ſaid that he hath no power to judge who ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61252:162"/>
and admitted into the Rank of Communicating members, ſo he hath no power at all effectually to keep away the groſſeſt offenders, or to forbear his own actual putting the Sacrament into their hands. For though the Canon ſeem to favour his power, and the Rubrick ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the ſame way, yet it is to be noted, 1. That whereas the Rubrick alloweth him to advertiſe the ſcandalous not to come to the Sacrament, yet it is only the contentious that have injured others and are not reconciled, whom he is plainly enabled to refuſe. 2. Among thoſe that he may advertiſe not to come, the groſly ignorant (who know not what Chriſt or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is) the Atheiſt, Infidel and Heretick are not numbred at all; but [an open and notorious evil liver, or that hath done wrong to his neighbours] 3. And if he be never ſo wicked, yet unleſs alſo [The Congregation be thereby offended] the Curate cannot hinder him, or ſo much as advertiſe him not to come. And ſo if only a few Godly perſons be offended, they are not the Congregation; or if the Minor part be offended, they are not the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: And how ſhall the Miniſter know whether the Major part be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: For he hath no power to ask them, much leſs to put it to the Vote: And the Major part will never come to him nor be accuſers? And if the Major part (which is no wonder) be themſelves ſo Ignorant, Heretical, or ungodly as not to be offended, but rather to take the Sinners part, then the Curate muſt give them all the Sacrament, and hath no remedy. 4. And he that muſt not live in Taverns, Alehouſes, Play-houſes, or other places of wickedneſs (ſpecially if he live as Chryſoſtome did, who never did ſo much as eat with any one in his own houſe) may have moſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to be abominable and flagitious, before it will be Notorious to him: for (as is ſaid) He hath no power to call any to witneſs any thing, that are unwilling. And few will be willing to enrage their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, when they foreknow that it will do more hurt than good. 5. And if he do refuſe any one, he is bound to become an Informer, and to give an account of the ſame to the Ordinary within fouteen days at the fartheſt.] Whenas, 1. Perhaps he may dwell many ſcore miles off; 2. And have his ſtudies and all other buſineſs on his hands: 3. And muſt then bring his proofs, when he is not enabled to examine any witneſs nor take proof of that which to all others is notorious. 4. It is a great doubt whether the Sinner have not his remedy at Law againſt him to his undoing, if he lay not by all his other buſineſs to proſecute the proof to the utmoſt. And if he do lay by the reſt of his work that while, the Biſhop may undoe him or ſuſpend him. 5. By this means he ſhall more exaſperate the Sinners (by proſecuting them to ſuch a Court as the Prelates) and harden them againſt all profiting by his Miniſtry, than if by his Paſtoral office he had himſelf firſt lovingly convinced them, and ſuſpended them only till they repent. 6. When he hath all done, if the ſinner pay his fees and ſay, He repenteth, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor is to Abſolve him: And ſo the Curate doth only to his own vexation and the Sinners hurt, deny him the Sacrament but once. And if the wrath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61252:163"/>
or ſcorns of the Sinner ſhew that he was far from true Repentance, the Curate cannot deny him the Sacrament the next day, nor ever after, till he not only again commit the ſame ſin (Adultery, Perjury, Drunkenneſs, &amp;c.) but till it be again notorious, and he will be again at the ſame trouble in the proſecution. 7. And there are few great Pariſhes in England where there are no Swearers, Drunkards, Railers, Fighters, Fornicators, Adulterers, and ſuch like enow, to hold a Curate work through the whole year to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, though he lay by almoſt all his other work: ſo that by this way, if he keep ſuch from the Sacrament, he muſt keep all away by ceaſing his Miniſterial work. 8. The Curate cannot refuſe him till he hath called and advertiſed him; whereas the perſon may refuſe to come to him, at leaſt by pretending buſineſs and other excuſes. All theſe things make this which ſeemeth his moſt conſiderable power, to be in effect but next to none.</p>
               <p>13. The Curate hath no power when any perſon is obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the moſt notorious ſcandal or hereſie, or endeavoureth to pervert others, to admoniſh him before all, that others may beware, nor to call him openly to Repentance.</p>
               <p>14. Nor hath he any power to judge who ſhall be Excommunicated as impenitent, be the crime never ſo heinous or notorious: no not ſo much as to concur in this power with any Biſhop, Chancellor or Presbyters; any more than any Lay-man hath. He can but Accuſe them, and ſo may an Apparitor or Church-warden: or Read the Biſhops or Chancellors Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, as he doth the Kings Proclamations, or as the Clerk doth other writings.</p>
               <p>15. He hath no power to abſolve publickly any perſon Excommunicated, no more than a Lay man; but as aforeſaid to read the Abſolution.</p>
               <p>16. He hath no power to forbear his own act of Reading an Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication againſt the faithfulleſt and moſt religious perſons in his Pariſh, whom it ſhall pleaſe the Biſhop or Chancellor to Excommunicate, (that is, uſually, a Nonconformiſt, or a Churchwarden who dare not ſwear to their large books of Articles, to perſecute the Nonconformiſts, &amp;c. or one that appeareth not at their Courts, or a poor man that doth not pay their fees, &amp;c.) The poor Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate muſt read the Curſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>17. He hath no power himſelf to forbear the open Reading of an Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt impenitent wicked man, whom it ſhall pleaſe the Chancellor to abſolve. And how eaſily that is procured for any man, that is but Rich and Conformable, is well known.</p>
               <p>18. The Curate hath no power ſo much as to Baptize the holieſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or the Child of ſuch, as do but fear leſt it be a Sin to uſe the Tranſient Image of the Croſs, as a humane ſymbol of Chriſtianity, and an engaging dedicating ſign, that he [will not be aſhamed to profeſs the faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner againſt the Devil, the world and the fleſh, and to continue Chriſts faithful ſervant and ſouldier to his lifes end.] If the perſon to be baptized were a Turk, or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61252:163"/>
a Jew, who both hate Idolatry, and ſhould be ſo ſcandalized at this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Image and humane Symbol, as that they would rather never be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or be Baptized, than receive it; yet muſt the poor Prieſt let them go without Chriſtianity, rather than Baptize them without this Image of a Croſs, unleſs he will be ſuſpended from preaching Chriſts Goſpel to the ignorant that they may be ſaved. But if he will bear that, he may do what he will; that ſo poor ſouls may be the loſers.</p>
               <p>19. If the commoneſt whore or wicked woman come to be Churched, as they call it, after child-bearing, the Prieſt muſt uſe all the Office of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, without firſt expecting her repentance, as if ſhe were the chaſteſt perſon: And muſt give her the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>20. To conclude, no Prieſt as ſuch (till Licenſed) hath power [to take upon them to expound in his own Cure, or elſewhere (and therefore not to his family, or any one of his ignorant neighbours) any Scripture, or matter, or Doctrine; But ſhall only ſtudy to Read plainly and aptly, without gloſſing or adding the Homilies, &amp;c.] Are theſe Authorized Prieſts, that may not ſo much as tell a Child the meaning of his Catechiſm, or any Article of the Faith? No though an ignorant perſon ask him? The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and the Law ſhould be enquired of at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts. But an Engliſh Prieſt may not expound any Matter, Scripture, or Doctrine but barely Read, till the Biſhop Licenſe him.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If they be not able, it will do more harm than good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Will the righteous God be always mocked? and ſuffer men to make merchandice of Souls, and to vilifie them and ſet them at cheaper rates than they would do a gooſe, a pig, or a dog? Is this a fit anſwer for thoſe that are their Ordainers? under whoſe examination and hands all men enter into the Miniſtery? Will they ſay that they can get no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? What, not when they have made ſo many Canonical Engines to keep out better? What, not when ſuch as Cartwright, Hilderſham, Ameſius, Parker, Dod, Ball, &amp;c. are caſt out as unworthy? When ſo many hundred were ſilenced in Queen Elizabeth and King James's days; and Eighteen Hundred of us now? When the Biſhops have got ſo many Laws to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from Preaching in publick and private, and to baniſh us five miles from all Cities, Corporations, and places where we have preached? When none but their ſworn Curates, Subſcribers, Declarers, &amp;c. may preach, yet can they get no better? Will they keep up a Miniſtry whom they will themſelves ſo ignominiouſly ſtigmatize, as to tell the world, that none of them all, as Presbyters, may be endured to expound any Scripture, Doctrine, or Matter, but barely to Read? Yea as if they would diſſwade them from all Learning of Humanity or Divinity as needleſs or hurtful things, they ſay [he ſhall only ſtudy to Read plainly and aptly.] So that he that ſtudieth for any more than to Read, doth break the Canons of the Prelatical Church.</p>

All theſe ſhew their Prieſtly power.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. That is but ludicrous pro forma. 2. Or elſe it is but their ſelf-condemnations while they allow one Presbyter of a thouſand, to do that which all the reſt are forbidden. The ſame I ſay of Arch-deacons, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Ordinaries.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>They make Canons in Convocations, and chooſe Convocation Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. It is but two Prieſts of many hundred that are in a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And what's that to all the reſt. 2. Chooſing is not a Governing act. Where the people chooſe Kings and Parliament men, it proveth not that they have any Government themſelves. The Laity ever formerly choſe their Biſhops, and yet were no Biſhops nor Church Rulers. 3. It is in the Biſhops power to fruſtrate their choice. For when they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen four, he may put by two of them. In this great Convocation which hath new moulded our Liturgy, which hath formed the Engines that have done what is done, the great and famous City of London had not one choſen Clerk in the Convocation. (No wonder then if they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not, as not being bound by their own Conſent) For when they choſe Mr. Calamy and my ſelf, the Biſhop refuſed us both (which I am ſo far from mentioning in diſcontent, that I take it to have been a greater Mercy than I can well expreſs) 4. I take not Canon-making to be any conſiderable part of the Paſtoral Office. If two of many hundred, have power to pleaſe the Plural Number of Prelates, Deans, and other Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries (whom they cannot over-vote) by ſerving them againſt the Church and their Brethren, doth that prove that Presbyters as ſuch have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of their flocks?</p>
               <p>I am not ſtriving for a power of Ruling one another, much leſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating Kings and Magiſtrates, nor a power of making Laws, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61252:164"/>
Ruling Neighbour Churches: But only a power of Guiding their own flocks, and judging of their own actions. Yea, and that not as Ungoverned or without Appeals: But as Ruled by Magiſtrates, conſociated for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with other Paſtors, and Ruling Volunteers. And if Archbiſhops alſo Rule them by Gods Laws, we ſhall ſubmit.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> That the great change of Government hitherto deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed (the making of new <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Churches, a new Epiſcopacy, and a new ſort of half-ſub-presbyters, with the Depoſition of the old,) was ſinfully done, and not according to the intent of the Apoſtles.</head>
               <p>THere are two pretences (and no more that I know of) made to juſtifie all this foredeſcribed change. The firſt is by Dr. Hammond when he was hard put to it at laſt, in anſwer to the London Miniſters, which is, That Subpresbyters were Ordained in Saint John's time, and therefore by him. The ſecond is ordinary, that though de facto the Apoſtles ſetled but ſingle Paſtors (without Sub-presbyters at leaſt) over ſingle Churches or Aſſemblies, yet this was not done with an Obligatory purpoſe, for the ſo fixing of it; But only de facto, pro tempore, as a State of immaturity, with a purpoſe and intent, that it ſhould grow up to the change of this at maturity.</p>
               <p>I. To the firſt Pretence I anſwer. 1. What probability is there that one Apoſtle when all the reſt were dead ſhould make ſo great a change in their Church Orders? Either it was part of the Apoſtolical Commiſſion and work to ſettle Church Offices and orders for Government, or not. (as to the ſpecies, if Chriſt had not before done it; or to ſettle it by revealing what Chriſt did command them; either from Chriſt's mouth, or the Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tle the Catholick Church, as Moſes did the Jewiſh.) If it were none of their Commiſſioned Office work, then it was none of John's: And then it is done ſo as may be yet undone. But if it were John's work it was Theirs; And if theirs, why did they not perform it? Even while they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61252:165"/>
had that promiſe, Matth. 15. 20, 21. Where two or three are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name, &amp;c. And, If two of you agree of a thing, &amp;c. If you ſay that there was no need till they were all dead, I anſwer, It is a Fiction. The greateſt numerous Church at Jeruſalem, had more need of more than One to officiate among them, (and ſo had Epheſus, Antioch, Coritnb, &amp;c.) than moſt Churches elſe had in St. John's days. And were all the Apoſtles ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and forgetful?</p>
               <p>2. What proof is there that St. John did make this change? It is either by Scripture that it is proved, or by Hiſtory. 1. Not by Scripture: For 1. No Scripture mentioneth S. John's doing it. 2. Dr. Hammond and his followers confeſs that it was not done (as can be proved) in Scripture times. And Chronologers ſuppoſe that there was but a year or two, between his death, and the end of Scripture times, that is, the writing of his Apocalypſe. And is it probable that he began ſo great a Change the laſt year of his life?</p>
               <p>2. And Hiſtory maketh no mention of it at all. (For I am aſhamed to anſwer their nonconcluding reaſon, from St. John's bringing a young pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal to a Presbyter to be educated, or his Ordaining Presbyters, when it is no more than is ſaid of the other Apoſtles.) Let them give us, if they can, any Satisfactory proof, that S. John alone, a year or two ere he died, made this new ſpecies of Presbyters and Churches, that we may believe it to be of God. But blind preſumptions we dare not truſt.</p>
               <p>3. None of the Ancient Churches, Councils or Doctors (that ever I could find) did ever hold that Subpresbyters were inſtituted by St. John alone, and theſe changes made by him: How then ſhall we think that men of yeſterday can tell us without them, and better than they, and contrary to them, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe times?</p>
               <p>4. By as good a courſe as this, what humane corruption may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and Scripture ſuppoſed inſufficient to notifie Gods Church-inſtitutions to us? When there is nothing ſaid in Scripture for them, the Papiſts or others may ſay that S. John made this or that Change when all the reſt were dead: But why muſt we believe them?</p>
               <p>5. And the Church hath rejected this plea already long ago. When Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias pleaded that he had the Millenary Doctrine from St. John himſelf, and when the Eaſtern Churches pretended his Authority for their time of Eaſters obſervation; here was incomparably a fairer ſhew of St. John's Authority than is produced by Dr. H. in the preſent caſe: And yet both were over-ruled by the Conſent of the Churches.</p>
               <p>II. And that it cannot be proved to be the Apoſtles intentions that their eſtabliſhment herein ſhould be but temporary, and left to the will of man to change, I have largely proved in my Diſput. 1. of Church Government long ago. I now only ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:61252:165"/>1. That which the Apoſtles did in execution of a Commiſſion of Chriſt, for which he promiſed and gave them his infallible Spirit, was the work of Chriſt himſelf and the Spirit, and not to be changed but by an Authority equal to that which did it. But ſuch was the ſetling of the ſpecies of Churches and Elders. Ergo—&amp;c. The Commiſſion is before recited from Scripture, and ſo is the promiſe and gift of the Spirit to perform it.</p>
               <p>2. Where there is full proof of a Divine Inſtitution by the Apoſtles, and no proof of a purpoſe that men ſhould afterward change it, or that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould be but for a time, and then ceaſe; there that Inſtitution is to be ſuppoſed to ſtand in force, and the repeal, ceſſation, or allowed muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to befeigned. But there is full proof of a Divine inſtitution by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that Preesbyters with the power of Government were placed over ſingle Churches (and no other ſaith Dr. H.) And there is no proof brought us at all, of either Repeal, Ceſſation, or Allowance for mutation—Ergo &amp;c.—They confeſs de facto all that we deſire, viz. 1. That there was then none but ſingle Churches or Congregations under one Biſhop. 2. That there were no Subpresbyters. Let them now prove the Allowance of a Change.</p>
               <p>3. That ſuppoſition is not to be granted which leaveth nothing ſure in the Chriſtian Churches and Religion: But ſuch is the ſuppoſition of a change of the Apoſtles Orders in theſe points. Ergo.</p>
               <p>If the after times may change theſe Orders, who can prove that they may not change all things elſe of ſupernatural inſtitution? As the Lords day, Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, the Bible, the Miniſtry yet remaining, &amp;c. And if ſo, nothing is ſure,</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt himſelf inſtituted theſe, and therefore they may not be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. It was not Chriſt himſelf that wrote the Scripture, but his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by his Spirit. 2. Chriſt himſelf did that mediately which his Apoſtles did by his Mandate and Spirit. Matth. 28. 20. The Spirit was given them to bring all things to their remembrance which he had ſpoken to them. And to cauſe them to Teach the Churches all things which Chriſt had commanded them. And as Chriſt made the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt to be greater than that which was but directly againſt his humanity, and as he promiſed his Diſciples that by that Spirit they ſhould do greater works than his, ſo that which his Spirit in them did eſtabliſh, was of no leſs authority, than if Chriſt had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally eſtabliſhed it.</p>
               <p>4. By this rule the Prelates themſelves may be yet taken down by as good authority as the Apoſtles other ſettlement was changed: For if it was done by Humane Authority, there is yet as great Humane power to make that further change: Wherever they place it, in Kings, Biſhops, or Councils, they may yet put down Biſhops, by as good authority as they put down what the Apoſtles ſet up; and may ſet up more new orders ſtill, by as good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61252:166"/>
as they ſet up theſe half-presbyters: And ſo the Church ſhall change as the Moon.</p>
               <p>5. That which is accounted a reproach to all Governours is not without proof to be imputed to God, and his inſpired Apoſtles. But to make oft and ſudden changes of Government, is accounted a reproach to all Governours: Ergo—</p>
               <p>For it is ſuppoſed that they wanted either foreſight and wiſdom to know what was to be done, or Power to maintain it. To make Laws and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> up Churches, Officers, and Orders, this year, and to take them down, and ſet up new ones a few years after, ſeemeth levity and mutability in man: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not without cauſe and proof be aſcribed to God. And the rather becauſe that Moſes Laws had ſtood ſo long, and the taking down of them was a ſcandal very hardly born: And if the Apoſtles that did it, ſhould ſet up by the Spirit others in their ſtead, to continue but till they died, this would be more ſtrange and increaſe the offence.</p>
               <p>6. There was no ſufficient change of the Reaſon of the thing, Therefore there was no ſufficient reaſon to change the thing it ſelf (if Prelates had had Authority to do it.) If you ſay, That in Scripture times there were not worthy men enow, to make Subpresbyters and Biſhops both of: I anſwer, It is notoriouſly falſe, by what Scripture ſpeaketh, 1. Of the large pourings out of the Spirit in thoſe times: 2. Of the many Prophets, Teachers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, and other inſpired ſpeakers which were then in one Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Act. 13. 1, 2. And 1 Cor. 14. Inſomuch that at Corinth Paul was put to limit them in the number of ſpeakers, and the exerciſe of their gifts. 2. And it's known by hiſtory and the great paucity of Writers in the next age, that when thoſe miraculous gifts abated, there was a greater paucity of fit Teachers, proportionably to the number of Churches, than before. 3. And who can prove that if there had been more men, the Apoſtles would have made a new Order of Presbyters, and not only more of the ſame Order?</p>
               <p>2. Obj. <hi>But the Churches grew greater after than before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Where was there three Churches in the whole world for 300 years ſo numerous as the Church at Jeruſalem is ſaid to have been in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? 2. If the Churches were more numerous, why might they not have been diſtributed into more particular Churches? 3. Or how prove you that Presbyters ſhould not rather have been increaſed in the number of the ſame Order, than a new Order invented? 4. This contradicts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer objection: For if that Churches were ſo ſmall and few before, it's like there might have been the more gifted perſons ſpared to have made two Orders in a Church. 5. And what if in Conſtantine's days the Churches grew yet greater, than they did in the ſecond, or third age compared to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? will it follow that ſtill more new Orders may be deviſed, as Subprieſts were?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61252:166"/>7. There are worſer reaſons of the change too viſible: And therefore it is not to be imputed to a ſecret unproved mental intention of the Apoſtles. In Chriſts own time, even the Apoſtles themſelves ſtrove, who ſhould be the greateſt. Falſe Apoſtles afterward troubled Paul by ſtriving for a ſuperiority of reputation. Diotrephes loved to have the preeminence. Sect-maſters roſe up in the Apoſtles days: Acts 20. 30. Of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. Some cauſed Diviſions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which they had learned, Rom. 16. 17. In Clem. Rom. time the Church of Corinth was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about Epiſcopacy and ſuperiority, even Lay-men aſpiring to the chair. Peter ſeemeth to foreſee what Paſtors would do, when he forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not to Lord it over Gods heritage, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. Victor quickly practiſed the contrary when he Excommunicated the Aſian Biſhops. See Grotius his complaint of the early and ancient pride, contention, and tyranny of the Biſhops, De Imper. ſum. Pot. p. 360, 361. Novatian with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus quickly ſhewed this ſpirit (if they be not wronged) at Rome and Carthage; and ſo did Feliciſſimus and his partners againſt Cyprian. What ſtirrs were there for many ages between the Cecilians and the Donatiſts? What horrid work was there at the Concil. Epheſ. 1. And Concil Chalcedon. &amp; Concil. Eph. 2. between the contending Biſhops on each ſide? The reading of the Acts would make a Chriſtians face to bluſh. What ſtrife between An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius and Baſil for a larger Dioceſe? What work againſt Nazianzen to caſt him out of Conſtantinople? What ſad exclamations maketh he againſt Synods, and againſt theſe Names and Titles of preeminence and higher ſeats, wiſhing the Church had never known them? And yet he was angry with his friend Baſil for placing him in ſo ſmall a Biſhoprick as Soſunis. What abundance of Epiſtles doth Iſidore Peluſiota write to Euſebius the Biſhop and Soſimus and the other wicked Prieſts, detecting and reproving their malignity, drunkenneſs, and horrid wickedneſs? And how ſharply doth he lament that a faithful Miniſtry is degenerate into carnal formal Tyranny, and that the Biſhops adorned the Temples under the name of the Church, while they maligned and perſecuted the Godly who are the Church indeed? How la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a deſcription doth Sulpit. Severus give of the whole Synods of Biſhops that followed Ithacius and Idacius? And in particular of Ithacius himſelf, as a fellow that made no conſcience of what he ſaid: And what did Martin think of them who avoided all their Communions to the death, and would never come to any of their Synods? Eſpecially becauſe by ſtirring up the Magiſtrate againſt the Priſcillianiſts, they had taught the vulgar fury to abuſe and reproach any man that did but read, and pray, and faſt, and live ſtrictly, as if he were to be ſuſpected of Priſcillianiſm (which Hooker himſelf complaineth of, Pref.) And Ambroſe alſo did avoid them. What bloody work did Cyril and his party make at Alexandria? What a man was Theophilus after him? What work made he againſt Chryſoſtom? What a Character doth Socrates give of him? What inſolence and furious zeal did Epiphanius ſhew in the ſame
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61252:167"/>
cauſe, in thruſting himſelf into the Church of Chryſoſtom to ſtir up his hearers to forſake him? Hierom had a finger in the ſame cauſe: His quarrels with Johan Hieroſol. with Ruffinus, his abuſive bitterneſs againſt Vigilantius, &amp;c. are well known. The multitudes of Canons for preſerving the grandeur of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and Metropolitanes, and Prelates, on one ſide, and for keeping ſmall Cities without Biſhops, ne vileſcat nomen Epiſcopi, and for reſtraining Pride, ſelf-exaltation, enlargement of Dioceſe, encroachment on each other, on the other ſide, do all ſhew the diſeaſes that needed ſuch a Cure, or that had ſuch a vent. In a word the Biſhops never ceaſed contending, partly for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral opinions and errours; and partly for preeminence and rule, till they had brought it to that paſs as we ſee it at this day, between Rome and Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and the moſt of the Chriſtian world. From all which it is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that Pride and Contention were cured but in part in the Paſtors of the Churches: And that the remaining part was ſo ſtrong and operative, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it too credible that there were ill cauſes enow for enlarging of Dioceſes and getting many Churches into one mans power, and ſetting up a new Order of half-ſubpresbyters; And that the event of ſuch a change is no proof that it was the Intent of the Apoſtles, that this change ſhould be made when they were dead; no more than you can prove that all this turbulent pride and ſtrife was intended by them.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, that it is not probable that ſo ſoon after the Apoſtles all the Churches would conſpire in ſuch an error: I anſwer, If all theſe things before mentioned were not done, or if matter of known fact may be denied as improbable, then that objection hath ſome ſence. To which I add,</p>
               <p>8. I have proved that this change was not made at once, but by ſlow degrees: No nor made ſo ſoon as is pretended, nor ſo univerſally, but in long time, except at Alexandria and Rome; It was long before the Churches knew it.</p>
               <p>9. And I think none will deny but other things were taken up as the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles, and all the Churches cuſtomes, which yet are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as no ſuch thing. To ſay no more of Eaſter and the Millennium, there were five ceremonies which were accounted the Churches univerſal cuſtomes, and traditions, and none was to omit, viz. not kneeling in adoration on the Lords days, Adoring towards the Eaſt, the White Garment, the Milk and Honey and the Chriſm to the Baptized: But were theſe ſuch? Socrates, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen, and Nicephorus tell us great Reaſons to believe that (whatever ſome ſay) the time of Eaſter, the Faſt of Lent, and many other obſervances, and among others the largeneſs or ſmallneſs of Dioceſes, were no Laws of God or the Apoſtles, but uſages voluntarily and diverſly taken up, in ſeveral places, in which no Chriſtians ſhould condemn each other, but allow a liberty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and difference, without breach of Charity or peace.</p>
               <p>10. Moreover it is a clear proof that the Apoſtles intended no ſuch change, in that they left no Rule, Inſtructions or Directions for it, nor for the calling of the new ſort of Presbyters, nor for their performance of their places. They
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61252:167"/>
left full directions for the Ordination and Regulation of Biſhops, called Pesbyters, and for Deacons, not leaving out ſo much as Deaconeſſes; And would they have wholly omitted all inſtructions for the new order of Presbyters, and Prelates, &amp;c. if they had intended them?</p>
               <p>11. To put all out of controverſie, God hath told us that his ſetled orders are for continuance. Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13. Such Offices as Chriſt hath given to the Church, are for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come to the unity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, &amp;c. If God do give ſome to lay the foundation, and ſome to build thereon, yet he leaveth not men to make new Officers beſides all theſe, to do his appointed work. Timothy had charge to propagate the ſame Doctrine, and the ſame Church orders, even to the coming of Chriſt, 1 Tim. 6. 13, 14. 2 Tim. 2. 2. and 1 Tim. 3. Tit. 1. 5. Heb. 10. 23, 24, 25. But of this I deſire the Reader to ſee full proofs in my 2. ſheet for the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>12. Laſtly, the holy Scripture is a perfect ſtanding Rule for all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, and Divine Faith and duty, and to Church worſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. If not, what is? And where ſhall we find it? And what ſtop ſhall we make of our additions, if there be no Law or Rule to govern the univerſal Church? And who are they that have power to Rule the Church univerſal? See my Key for Catholicks, againſt the claim of Pope and General Councils. But if it be, then the adding and altering is preſumption, except in circumſtantials which God hath left to mans determination: And then why muſt we ſwear never to alter unneceſſary circumſtances, were they ſuch?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That Form of Prelacy is not lawful and to be ſworn to, which maketh the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Office impoſſible to be performed, and certainly deſtroyeth and nullifieth true par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church Government wherever it obtaineth.</hi> But ſuch is the oppoſed frame.</p>
                  <p>None will deny the Major but the Eraſtians, who think that the Magiſtrate only is the Church Governour (which as to forcing Government is true) And they that ſo think, muſt needs be againſt Biſhops otherwiſe than as they are Preachers or Magiſtrates. Therefore I may let them paſs.</p>
                  <p>The Minor I am to prove by parts.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be remembred, that I have ſhewed how great the Dioceſes are, and that no work proper to the Office of a Biſhop can be done by a Lay-man, or any but a Biſhop. And have prevented the pretence of doing it per alios. And now I muſt ſhew more fully than in the former breviate, what the work of a Biſhop is; And then you ſhall ſee whether it be not impoſſible. And leſt you think I preciſely feign more work than God hath put upon them, I will take it out of Scripture and Dr. Hammonds Annotations.</p>
                  <p>I. The Teaching of the Flock. II. The Prieſtly worſhipping of God with them. III. The Government of them by Diſcipline, are the three parts of the Biſhops Office, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61252:168"/>I. The Teaching of the Flock is, 1. Publick Teaching them in their Sacred Aſſemblies, by expounding and applying the word of God. 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, &amp;c. ſaith Dr. Hammond, [The Biſhops of your ſeveral Churches, I exhort—take care of your ſeveral Churches and govern them, &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>Heb. 13. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the word of God. Dr. H. [Set before your eyes the Biſhops and Governours that have been in your Church and preached the Goſpel to you—] Acts 20. 7. Upon the firſt day of the week when the Diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them—] Matth. 24. 45, 46. Who then is a faithful and wiſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his houſhold to give them meat in due ſeaſon.]</p>
                  <p>1 Theſ. 5. 12. We beſeech you brethren to know them that labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake.] D. H. [Pay (your Biſhops) as great a reſpect as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the pains they have taken among you.]</p>
                  <p>1 Tim. 5. 17. The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour in the word and doctrine.] D. H. [Let the Biſhops that have diſcharged that function well, receive for their Reward twice as much as others have, eſpecially thoſe that preach the Goſpel to whom it was news, and alſo continue to inſtruct congregations of Chriſtians in ſetled Churches.] 1 Tim. 3. 2. A Biſhop muſt be—apt to teach.] D. H. [One that is able and ready to communicate to others the knowledge that himſelf hath.]</p>
                  <p>2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom, preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine.] See Dr. H. Annot.</p>
                  <p>And can one Biſhop be the publick Teacher of a thouſand, a hundred, or many Churches: Can he feed them, and give them their meat in due ſeaſon? where one of a thouſand never heard his voice nor ſaw his face? Is the flock with them or among them? Can you ſay to his Dioceſe, I beſeech you know the Biſhop that laboureth among you and admoniſheth you, and eſteem him highly in love for his works ſake? Will they not ſay you mock them, and that they cannot know him whom they never ſaw; nor love him for his work and admonition among them, that never was among them, that never workt with them, that never admoniſht them; but only that one of many hundred ſaw him, and heard a Viſitation Sermon in one City or market Town once in three years, or a year at moſt. Muſt many hundred Congregations that never heard him, give him double honour that preacheth ſometime to one Congregation a hundred or twenty miles from them, and this as their Inſtructing Elder? Judge of the poſſibility of this.</p>
                  <p>2. The Biſhops are alſo bound to private helps, inſtruction, counſel, and to watch over all the flock, and every particular member of them; as a Father
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61252:169"/>
muſt look to every Child, and a ſhepherd to every ſheep, and a Phyſician to every Patient.</p>
                  <p>Acts 20. 20, 28, 31. I taught you publickly and from houſe to houſe—Take heed therefore to your ſelves and to all the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud—Therefore watch, and remember that by the ſpace of three years, I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears] D. H. [Inſtructing both in the Synagogues, and in private Schools, and in your ſeveral houſes whither I alſo came—Wherefore ye that are Biſhops or Governours of the ſeveral Churches,—look to your ſelves and the Churches committed to your truſt, to rule and order all the faithful Chriſtians under you.]</p>
                  <p>Col. 1. 28. Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.] Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have the rule over you and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls as thoſe that muſt give account.] D. H. [Obey thoſe that are ſet to Rule over your ſeveral Churches, the Biſhops, whoſe whole care is ſpent among you, as being to give an account of your proficiency in the Goſpel.]</p>
                  <p>I before cited Ignatius telling the Biſhop that he muſt enquire after every one by name, even ſervants and maids. And Dr. Jer. Taylor who ſaith, No man can be accountable for them that he knoweth not (or cannot know.)</p>
                  <p>Now is it poſſible for a Biſhop to do this: To inſtruct, overſee, counſel, one of many hundreds of the flock? who know him no more than one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdom? Is this paſtoral teaching of particular Souls, to have an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor call one of a thouſand when he Conformeth not, or offendeth, to a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors Court; How little know they what the work of a Paſtor is that think ſo?</p>
                  <p>3. Biſhops muſt teach the flock by their own viſible example; By holy ſpeaking and holy living before their flocks. Heb. 13. 7. [Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſations.] D. H. [Set before your eyes the Biſhops—obſerve their manner of living.] If it were the Pope at Rome, we might caſt a conjecture by the report of that great liar fame, Becauſe it is a place that we hear often from in the Curranto's and Gazets: But no Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et telleth us of the life of our Biſhop. And how ſhall thoſe obſerve their manner of living, who know not whether they be alive or dead, till a Miniſter is to be ſilenced, or a new Biſhop doth ſucceed the old? You may as well bid us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how they live in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>1 Pet. 1. 5. 3. Neither as being Lords over Gods Heritage (or having dominion over your charges) but being enſamples to the Flock.] D. H. [Walking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly and exemplarily before them.] What! before them that never ſaw or heard them? Before men of another Countrey, that may ſwear and not repent with Peter, We know not the man? What! be examples to them that are out of the notice of their words and lives? But if really you think that fame is ſufficient, 1. It muſt be of perſons and things not too far off. 2. It muſt be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61252:169"/>
in a Golden age or another world, where good men are not hated and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated, and where bad men if Great are not extolled, and where falſe reports be not eaſily believed and reported; where a vile perſon is contemned, and thoſe that fear the Lord are honoured; Where the faithfulleſt Paſtors are not the object of Great mens jealouſie, of bad mens malice, of diſſenters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious mens backbitings and reproch, and are not made the drunkards ſong, nor the ſcorn and off-ſcouring of all things, and where he that reproveth or departeth from evil, doth not make himſelf a prey; or at leaſt where malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, worldlineſs, and lying are not the predominant humours of the Age. When you have ſecured us of a true fame, we will make the example of a ſtranger of another land or Dioceſe, (as ſoon as one of this Dioceſe as ſtrange to us) the exemplar of our lives.</p>
                  <p>4. Another part of the Biſhops work is to preach to thoſe without that are uncalled, as he hath opportunity: To labour in the word and Doctrine, 1 Tim. 5. 17. ſaith Dr. H. To preach the Goſpel to whom it was news: which made Dr. Downam and other Prelatiſts ſay That the City and Territories are their Dioceſe even when few of them are converted, that they may firſt convert them and then govern them; and Dr. H. to Note out of Clem. Rom. that they are made Biſhops over the Infidels that ſhould after believe. And doubtleſs they muſt do their beſt to call the unbelieving and impenitent to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And how much of this will a Biſhop have time to do, that hath the work of a Dioceſe of Chriſtians on his hands?</p>
                  <p>5. It is the work of a Biſhop to Baptize, or at leaſt to judge of thoſe that are to be Baptized, Matth. 28. 19. Go and diſciple me all nations baptizing them. And Dr. H. thinketh that no Presbyter, but Biſhops baptized in Scripture time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were then no other exiſtent. And it is too evident in Antiquity (by what I before cited) that no child or aged perſon was uſually baptized without a Biſhop (when Biſhops came up,) at leaſt they uſed to anoint their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, &amp;c. with holy oyl. And doubtleſs they that Baptized or admitted to baptiſm, did examine them of their faith, and reſolutions, before they took them into the Covenant and Vow of God. And how many hundreds in a year can the Biſhop do this for, beſides all his other work?</p>
                  <p>6. It is by the Engliſh Canons and Rubrick the Biſhops duty to confirm all that were baptized: many think it is meant in Heb. 6. 1, 2. Our Biſhops take it for a proper part of their work. And they that muſt confirm them according to our Liturgy, muſt know their underſtanding, and receive their profeſſion of their faith, and ſtanding to their Baptiſmal Covenant, which requireth ſome time and labour with each one, for him that will not make a mockery of it. Look into the Bills of London, which tell you how many are born every week; and thence conjecture how many hundreds in a year the Biſhop hath in that Dioceſe to Confirm, and conſequently in other Dioceſes proportionably? Or if that will not inform you, try over England where you come, how many are (though but curſorily as a haſty ceremony) confirmedat all? Whether it be one of many hundreds? And ſet this to the reſt of the Biſhops work.</p>
                  <p>7. It is the Biſhops work to defend the truth againſt gainſayers, to confute
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61252:170"/>
and ſtop the mouths of Hereticks and contradicters, and confirm the troubled and wavering minded in the faith: not by fire and ſword, nor by a quick prohibition of others to preach; but by ſober conferences, and weight of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and by Epiſtles as Paul did, when they are not at hand, yea even to other Churches: and as one that is gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekneſs inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25. And ſhall the Biſhop do this for many hundred Churches? While he is defending the poor flock againſt Papiſts, Quakers, Arrians, Socinians, Infidels (alas how numerous are the deceivers!) at Newark, or Gainsborough, or Boſton, what ſhall they all do between that and Barnet, or the remoteſt part of Buckinghamſhire?</p>
                  <p>II. The ſecond part of the Biſhops office is to be the peoples Prieſtly guides in Gods worſhip: principally in the publick Aſſemblies, and oft in private, viz.</p>
                  <p>1. To confeſs the peoples ſins and their own: To be their own and the Churches mouth in prayer, thankſgiving and the praiſes of the Lord. And in how many hundred Congregations at once will they do this?</p>
                  <p>2. To conſecrate and diſtribute the Sacrament of Communion; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to diſcern who are fit for it. And in how many Churches at once will he do this?</p>
                  <p>3. To bleſs the Congregation at the end of every meeting. All theſe I have before proved that the ancient Biſhops did; and Dr. Hammond ſaith, No other in Scripture times; And what Ubiquitary ſhall do this.</p>
                  <p>4. And in private it is the Biſhop that muſt viſit the ſick, that muſt be ſent for by them all, and muſt pray with them. As Dr. H. at large proveth, Annot. in Jam. 5. I have told you before how well and for how many he is able to do this, in one of our Dioceſes. If that ſerve not turn, I pray you if you are foreigners, ask Engliſh men what number it is of ſick men in a Dioceſe that are viſited and prayed with by the Biſhop? Compare them with the Bills of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in London, and judge proportionably of the reſt, whether he viſit one of many thouſands of ſuch as die, to ſay nothing of all the ſick that do recover.</p>
                  <p>5. And it is the Biſhops work to receive all the offerings, firſt-fruits, tythes, and other maintenance of the Church, as the Canons before cited ſay. And ſee Dr. H. on Act. 2. c. and Act. 4. 33, 34, 35, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6. It was the Biſhops work to take care of all the Poor, Orphans, Widows, Strangers, as the Canons cited ſhew; And Dr. H. on 1 Cor. 12. 28. c. ſaith [The ſupreme truſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d charge was reſerved to the Apoſtles and Biſhops of the Church.] So in Can. 41. Apoſt. A Biſhop muſt have the care of the moneys, ſo that by his power all be diſpenſed to the poor, &amp;c. where he citeth Juſt. Mart. and Polycarp. for a particular care. I have before told you that if the poor of every pariſh be not relieved till the Biſhop take notice of them, few of the poor in England would be any more for Biſhops, than for famine, nakedneſs, and death.</p>
                  <p>III. But the principal thing which I reckon impoſſible, and is, and muſt be deſtroyed by Dioceſanes, is the Government of all the particular Churches, (or Pariſhes) in the Dio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61252:170"/>Where note, 1. That I ſpeak not of the Magiſtrates Government, 2. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of that General Inſpection by which an Archbiſhop or General Paſtor overſeeth the inferiour Biſhops with their flocks, as a general Officer doth the Regiments and Troops in his Army, which have Colonels and Captains of their own. But I ſpeak of the particular Church Government of the Biſhops of ſingle Churches, like that of Captains over their own troops, or rather Schoolmaſters in their ſeveral Schools.</p>
                  <p>And I the rather mention this becauſe Biſhops making it more proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than Teaching or Worſhip, muſt hold, (were they conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that they can leſs delegate it to others.</p>

By Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Conſolation, Excommunication, and Abſolution of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which I am now to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>Where diſtinctly note I. What the work is Materially, II. In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it muſt be done, III. On how great a number of perſons.</p>
                  <p>I. 1. To receive accuſations and informations of all the great and perilous hereſies, crimes, and ſcandals in the Dioceſe.</p>
                  <p>2. To judge of the credibility of the witneſſes (hardly done by a ſtranger) and of the validity of their proofs. For Councils themſelves have petitioned the Emperours, that ungodly perſons might not be witneſſes, who make ſo ſmall a matter of other ſins, as that they may be ſuppoſed to make but little of falſe witneſſing. Elſe an Atheiſt or Infidel or man of no conſcience (as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver need to miſs of Church preferment, for want of conforming to mens wills, ſo) he may be maſter of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ame, liberty, and lives of all honeſt men, at his pleaſure, and govern them that govern Church and State. Therefore Biſhops themſelves muſt difference between witneſſes: And to ſay, I know an honeſt man that knoweth an honeſt man that ſaith they are honeſt men, is a poor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in compariſon of perſonal knowledge. Much leſs to truſt the whole trial to another.</p>
                  <p>3. He muſt hear the accuſed perſon ſpeak for himſelf. For there is no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till both are heard.</p>
                  <p>4. He muſt rebuke falſe accuſers, and juſtifie the innocent, and vindicate their good name.</p>
                  <p>5. He muſt by convincing arguments and melting affections, labour to bring the ſinner to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>6. He muſt deſire the Church to be witneſſes of his faithful admonitions, and to avoid the like crimes and impenitence themſelves, and to pray God to give Repentance to the offender.</p>
                  <p>7. He muſt publickly declare the impenitent excommunicate, and bind him over to anſwer it at the bar of God, and ſet Gods terrors before his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>8. He muſt try and judge of the Truth of the Repentance of thoſe that ſay they do repent (where all the ancient rigorous Penances came in.) And not truſt every incredible ſaying, I Repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61252:171"/>9. He muſt receive thoſe publickly into the Church that truly repent, or credibly profeſs to do ſo; and muſt comfort him with the declaration of the pardon of his ſin.</p>
                  <p>10. He muſt perſwade the Church to receive him into their affections and Chriſtian Communion, and to eſteem and uſe him as a Brother again.</p>
                  <p>II. And as to the Manner, all this muſt be done, 1. with great Prudence and diſcretion; elſe the Church may ſoon be ſet on fire, (as by a confeſſion of a Deacons adulteries at Conſtantinople, &amp;c.) 2. It muſt be done with deliberation and througheſt acquaintance and information of the truth: elſe raſh and haſty judgments, and believing knaves will diſgrace the Biſhop, and injure the juſt, and gratifie the wicked, &amp; breed uncurable breaches between ſo unjuſt a Biſhop and the flock. 3. It muſt be done with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs, reverence, and gravity; As knowing that the honour of God and Religion and the Church lieth on it, and the comfort or recovery of the ſouls of men, and the preſervation of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>It is not a Chancellors check, nor ſaying, do you repent, and will you pay your fees, that diſpatcheth ſuch a work as this. It requireth much skill, and time and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Poor ſinners muſt not be taken in a paſſion; nor is it imperious frowns that melt men into true Repentance: The opening of the nature of the ſin, and the aggravation, not reproachfully but convincingly; the awakening of a ſecure hardened ſinner, with the terrors of the Lord; the drawing him home by the opening of the motives of Love and mercy; do all require greater skill, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love to Souls, than moſt Biſhops have that ever I was acquainted with; much more than a Lay Chancellor hath, who is the man that doth the work, that never pretended to be a Divine.</p>
                  <p>I muſt profeſs for my own part, that when I did this with others for one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it called for more skill, and holy affections, and conſequently more convinced me of my weakneſs, by far, than publick preaching to the people. The heart of an honeſt judge will be turned within him, before he paſs the ſentence of death on an offender. And before we paſs the ſentence of Excommunication, our bowels muſt yearn over poor ſouls, and all means be tried to recover them.</p>
                  <p>And here it is not the cleareſt witneſs of the crime that will ſerve turn: For men are not to be excommunicated for any ordinary crime, unleſs it have impenitency and obſtinacy added to it. And therefore the work of the Biſhop is (not like a ſecular Court to judge only of the fact and fault, but) to judge of mens repentance or Impenitence. And that is a thing that cannot be done by a few Lordly awful words.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, Becauſe of all this we judge that ordinary Prieſts are not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo great a work, but a few wiſe and Reverend Prelates.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1. I never yet knew the beſt Biſhop that was to be compared for ability in this work to many a Pariſh Miniſter that I have known: Nor did I ever know One Biſhop tolerably fit for it, who had not for a conſiderable time been a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pariſh Miniſter. Thoſe that come from the Univerſities to be Noblemens and Biſhops Chaplains, and ſo get the Tythes of two or three rich Benefices, and then are made Prebends, Deans, and Maſters of Colledges; and then he made Biſhops, may read, and talk of all this work; but know no more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61252:171"/>
what it is indeed than I know how to build an houſe.</p>
                  <p>2. An experienced Miniſter that liveth upon the place and knoweth all the perſons and witneſſes, hath incomparable advantage above a ſtrange Prelate.</p>
                  <p>3. One that is their familiar and ordinary Teacher, whom they neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, nor fear with a carnal awe, for fear of puniſhment, may diſcern whether Repentance be credibly ſerious; which he that aweth them by greatneſs and terror ſhall never know: For almoſt all the verieſt beaſts will there profeſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though they come home with redoubled malice againſt the perſons that would have reformed them: Only a man that believeth he is in the right will incur the Biſhops wrath for not confeſſing that he is in the wrong.</p>
                  <p>4. But yet our Caution is far greater than the Biſhops; For becauſe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſo much skill and faithfulneſs, we would have no one Man truſted with it (except in a caſe of neceſſity, when a Church can have no more) For in the multitude of Counſellers is ſafety: We would have every Church have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſus of Presbyters (and if one be a Biſhop we contend not againſt it) And we would have it done in the preſence of the Seniors of the flock, who know the perſons; that ſo if one ſhould want skill or truſtineſs, he might be helpt by others, or hindred from doing wrong. And if all this will not do, we would have the next Synod of neighbour Paſtors to have a final audience of the caſe.</p>
                  <p>And now let any thing except utterly blinding Pride and Partiality be judge; WHETHER A CONSESSVS OF MINISTERS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SENIORS OF THE FLOCK, WHO ALL KNOW THE PERSONS, be not liker to JUDGE RIGHTLY IN ONE PARISH, where alſo a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Synod may review the caſe, than ONE STRANGE PRELATE or CHANCELLOR FOR A DIOCESE OF MANY CHURCHES, WHERE HE KNOWETH NOT THE PERSONS:</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially when this Chancellor and all the Proctors and Officers of the Courts do live (in wealth) upon the Trade, and therefore muſt manage it as a trade: When in the way that we deſire, no Presbyter, nor Synod, ſhould have one farthing for all his pains, but his comfort in obeying God, and end ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Churches good and mens ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Alas Lord, How long ſhall Chriſts enemies be the Paſtors of his flocks? and the ſeed of the ſerpent be the great inſtruments that muſt break the ſerpents head, and the lovers of ſin be they that muſt be the ſuppreſſers of it, and thoſe employed to teach men knowledge, who themſelves will not know, and to preach up holineſs who cannot endure it? To willing minds theſe things are plain.</p>
                  <p>Church Diſcipline hath its effect on the Conſciences of men, and theſe things take as they come with ſpiritual life, light and love. We ſee in our Preaching, how much all work is loſt, which is done proudly, unskilfully and marred in the manner. And true Paſtoral diſcipline muſt work juſt as Preaching muſt do, it being but a more particular application of the ſame word, to perſons and carſes. Athanaſius Patriarcha Conſtantinop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his fifth Epiſtle for the reſidence of Biſhops (Bibl. Patr. T. 3. p. 159.) ſaith of conſtant preaching [Haec nocte dieque debent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli Paſtores gregibus ſuis inculcare, quae tam neceſſaria ſunt, quam eſt reſpirare ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manti: Neceſſarium inquam omnia judicia &amp; teſtimonia Dei denunciare; ita ut ab
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61252:172"/>
hoc eſt proſperitas &amp; opulentia, And in his three laſt Epiſtles he counſelleth the Emperor to force thoſe Biſhops to Preaching and Vigilancy, that will not do it without force.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, unjuſt Excommunications moſt hurt the Excommunicators. Read Nicon's Epiſtle ad Euch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de injuſta Excommunicatione, proving that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Excommunication bindeth not another, but falleth on the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators head.</p>
                  <p>But the ſad truth is, that it's uſual with the Prelates to confeſs the vanity of their own Spiritual power, and to call it a leaden ſword, which would but be deſpiſed, if it were not backt with the Magiſtrates ſword, which is the very thing they truſt to.</p>
                  <p>But of this anon.</p>
                  <p>III. And laſtly, let it be conſidered objectively what work it is that every Biſhop hath to do: and then you ſhall ſee whether it be poſſible.</p>
                  <p>1. As to the number of Sins in ſpecie. 2. As to the number of Sinners.</p>
                  <p>1. Such ſins as are in other Countries, and as are condemned in Scripture are among us alſo. 1. As to Intellectual evils, we have ignorant perſons who neither know what Chriſt or Chriſtianity is, or what a Sacrament is, or what are the Eſſentials of Faith. We have Atheiſts that think there is no God, or ſay ſo at leaſt; we have more Infidels, that deride Chriſt and Chriſtianity: we have impious perſons who make a mock of Godlineſs: we have Quakers and Familiſts, and Seekers, who either deny the Scripture to be Gods word, or true, or ſay Scripture, Church and Miniſtry are loſt, or turn Scripture into an Allegory, or that prefer the light within every man, Heathens and all, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without it; and Enthuſiaſts and true Fanaticks who truſt to inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and impulſes inſtead of Gods word. We have Papiſts, we have Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, Libertines, and more Sects which the Biſhops themſelves can name you, and overcharge.</p>
                  <p>2. And for more voluntary ſins, we have almoſt all the breaches of all the commandments: We have open enemies of preaching, praying, ſacraments, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties, catechizing, the Lords days holy obſervation: Common ſcorners of thoſe that fear to ſin, and diligently ſeek God. We have (if the Biſhops could know them) malignant perſecutors, that would force Gods ſervants to moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſins, that hinder Chriſts Miniſters from doing the work to which they are devoted, and from preaching to ſinners the Goſpel of Chriſt, and calling them to Repent and live. We have idolaters, falſe worſhippers, blaſphemers, perjured perſons, common prophane ſwearers, and curſers, and liars; and we have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren deſpiſers and diſhonourers of their parents, and ſervants of their maſters; and ſubjects of Princes and Rulers, (and whether of Biſhops and Paſtors, let the Biſhops judge:) Profane families; husband and wife living in open enmity or wrath: we have murderers, fighters, railers, ſuch as maliciouſly ſeek the ruine of others, great and ſmall oppreſſors, thieves, defrauders, adulterers and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, filthy ſpeakers, gluttons, drunkards, ſuch as waſte their lives in gaming, plays, and idleneſs, falſe-witneſſes, Simoniacal, bribe-takers, ſubverters of juſtice,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61252:172"/>
to ſay nothing of the notorious effects of groſs uncharitableneſs, covetouſneſs, and pride. Theſe and more than theſe are here.</p>
                  <p>2. And for the number of ſinners; 1. Conjecture by the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 2. And then by the commonneſs of the ſins.</p>
                  <p>1. I have before oft told you that ſome Dioceſes have many hundred Pariſhes, ſome above a thouſand; and in the leſſer ſort of theſe Pariſhes, commonly there are in ſome 50, in moſt 100 or 200 families; and in the greater and Market Towns, there are in ſome of the leſſer about 1000 ſouls, in the middle ſort about 2000 or 3000 or 4000; and in the bigger about 5000 or 6000, and ſome few 10000: And in the greateſt Pariſhes of all in London, ſome 20000, ſome 40000, ſome 50000, and it is ſaid in ſome many thouſands more.</p>
                  <p>2. And for the ſins, 1. The Biſhops themſelves ſay, that Atheiſm, Infidelity, and deriſion of Scripture and Religion aboundeth among ſuch as I will not name: 2. They ſay themſelves that Rebels, and Quakers, and Seekers, and Enthuſiaſts, &amp;c. are ſo many as that they know not what to do with them. 3. They ſay themſelves that Papiſts ſo increaſe, as that they give out their hopes to ſwallow up all. 4. One ſort which they call Schiſmaticks, as being againſt their intereſt, they really exerciſe their power againſt: and find that this one ſort are more than they know what to do with. 5. The number that malignantly labour to make all ſeriouſneſs and diligence in ſeeking God, to become a ſcorned hated thing, and make it to ſeem meer ſelf-conceitedneſs and hypocriſie, and to keep people from obeying God, is ſo great, as we cannot reckon them. 6. The number of the groſly ignorant is lamentably great. 7. Common ſwearers and curſers are uſually met with in our ordinary converſe. 8. How common drunkenneſs is, let lamenting Parents, grieved wives, and beggered families tell you. 9. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fornication and adultery (rarely heard of till of late, comparatively) be now grown common, if not in faſhion, I leave the Prelates themſelves to judge. 10. To paſs by all the reſt, Whether ſerious credible Repentance (though not expreſſed by the ancient ſevere penances) be now a common thing, for theſe or many other ſins, I am content that any Engliſh man be judge, that ever laboured to bring men to Repentance, and knoweth what Repentance is.</p>
                  <p>And now by this conjecture 1. How many thouſands (I ſay not the Biſhop who puts it off, but) the Lay-chancellor hath to ſtand at his bar at once, if diſcipline were tolerably exerciſed. 2. How many years, the accuſers and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were like to wait before a cauſe could be heard. 3. Or how ſpiritually, powerfully, meltingly this Lay-man (that never preached) is like to draw all theſe thouſands to Repentance. 4. What the Sinner and the Church ſhall do till the year come that they can be heard. 5. Whether it be poſſible for any ſuch thing as true Paſtoral conviction, exhortation, diſcipline, to be ever exerciſed on them at all, whileſt that new ſins, even heinous ones are ſtill committed; and the Biſhop or Chancellor or Surrogate, that had a thouſand, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſinners at once to ſpeak to, when he could deal but with ſix or ſeven in a day (if he did nothing elſe,) ſhall before he can examine their caſes have thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more (of their and others) to examine.</p>
                  <p>So that nothing of this nature can be more notorious, than that our controverſie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61252:173"/>
with the Biſhops is but ſuch as theſe: Whether the Lord Mayor alone ſhall not only overſee all the Families in the City, but be the Only Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them, ſo that Husbands, Parents, and Maſters, ſhall only teach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort their families, but the Lord Mayor alone ſhall rule them, as to their daily works, their ſpeeches and their lives.</p>
                  <p>Or whether the City and the whole Dioceſe ſhall have but one Schoolmaſter, who ſhall be the ſole governour of all the Schools in all thoſe hundred pariſhes, 20, or 40, or 100 miles diſtant, and the Schools ſhall have under him only Curate Uſhers, who ſhall only teach the boyes as far as they are willing to learn, and for all their untractableneſs, diſobedience, abſence, and faults, ſhall preſent their names to a Chancellors Court, ſet up by the ſole ruling Schoolmaſter.</p>
                  <p>Or whether all the Colledges in the Univerſity ſhall have no Governour but the Vicechancellor, and the reſt be but Tutors to the Voluntiers.</p>
                  <p>Or whether all the Patients in a Dioceſe ſhall have but one Phyſician, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Patient by preſcripts, and under him only Apothecaries to carry about his medicines and directions? Indeed if it were the Phyſicians work to play the Soldier, and cut all their throats, it might be done in a ſhort time. But healing requireth more ado. And if it were the Biſhops or Chancellors work to do no more, than to read an accuſation, and ſay, Do you Repent, and (as ſome do, becauſe they muſt be thrice admoniſhed,) to ſay at once, I admoniſh you, I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you, I admoniſh you, I excommunicate you; or to do as the Pope doth, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict whole Kingdoms at once, (as Herod killed all the children in hope that he ſhould meet with Chriſt among them,) then a few hands might do the work. But whether it be poſſible to exerciſe the diſcipline of Chriſt, in their Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan way on one of a thouſand, let the impartial judge: As alſo whether that Church be fitlier ſaid to be governed or ungoverned where one of a thouſand is governed indeed, whenas it is the body of the people, and not one of a thouſand, that is called the Church.</p>

               <p>1. That of the ancient Churches: what work the enlargement of their Dioceſſes, and growing great by the greatneſs of their charge made quickly by the deſtruction of true diſcipline, abundance of forecited te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies ſhew. To which what ſad complaints might I add out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Chryſoſtome. Iſidore Peluſiata and many others: which made Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianz. Orat. 1. Say ſo much of the difficulty of a Biſhops work, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf when contentious men were ready to depoſe him, and to wiſh ſo earneſtly that there had never been greatneſs and Priority and difference of Seats as Upper and Lower among the Paſtors of the Churches being tired with their contentions pride and envy, even of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Orthodox them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: who inſtead of doing the work, contended for power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence.</p>
               <p>I cited ſome of Chryſoſtomes ſayings before, de ſacerdot. l 3 c. 16. 17. where he ſheweth the greatneſs of a Biſhops work, and p. 57. So p. 58.

Ep. 246. l. 2. p 236. teaching Biſhop Euſebius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius) what a Church is, who had ſo far loſt the true Epiſcopacy, as to take walls for men, and to abuſe and ſcorn the true Church or godly people while the Walls were adorned, as if Chriſt had come from Heaven more for [Walls than Souls] &amp;c. of which before.</p>
               <p>In a word, nothing is more evident than that true Diſcipline was ſhut out at the times and in the degrees as Dioceſſes were enlarged; and that in A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>II. The ſecond ſort of experience is, that of almoſt all the Reformed Churches, who have found the Paſtoral work and Diſcipline particularly to be ſo great, as that leſs than all the Pariſh Miniſters concurring could not perform it. 1. Thoſe Churches which with Calvin ſet up Presbytery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no Paſtor from the Governing part; but took in Elders of the people to help them, becauſe experience had told them that all the Miniſters were too few: what then would one Biſhop and Chancellour or Vicar have been able to do?</p>
               <p>2. The Lutherans who ſet up ſuperintendants, commonly ſo ſet them over the Paſtors as not to take away the true Paſtoral power of governing their particular flocks, as finding by experience, that the old way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy would not do it: And uſually they join Magiſtrates with them, as they alſo in the Palatinate did. And it is ſuch an oderate ſupriority which is exerciſed in Hungary, Tranſilvania, and in Poland till the Papiſts rooted them out thence.</p>
               <p>3. The Helvetian Divines exerciſe a certain meaſure of power in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unfit from the Sacrament; but not what they judge to be the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61252:174"/>
Churches duty, becauſe the Magiſtrate never would conſent: That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are for it, as needful to the right ordering of the Churches you may ſee in Polani: Syntag. at large, and in moſt of their Divines of Baſil, Bern, Zurich, &amp;c. I will now only cite the honeſt hearty words of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus above 100 years ago, becauſe he was a man moſt clear and candid, and that did mancipate his judgment neither to Luther, Calvin, nor any party as ſuch; but took liberty to differ from them all (as in the points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, perſeverance, &amp;c.) At Bern in his Loci Commun. ed. 1567. p. 421: He proveth Biſhops, and Presbyters and Doctors, and Paſtors to be all one. And p. 422. that in the Apoſtolick Primitive Church they governed the Church in common, being ſubject to no head or preſident. But after the Apoſtles daies as Hierome ſaith to avoid ſchiſm, but as he thinketh more out of a deſire of Majority; one got the name and preſidency of a Biſhop: But, ſaith he [whether this counſel did profit the Church or not, by which ſuch Biſhops were introduced, as Hierome ſaith by cuſtome rather than by truth, of divine diſpoſition, to be above the Presbyters, it hath been better manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to after ages, than when this cuſtome was firſt brought in: which we muſt thank for all the inſolency, wealth and tyranny, of the Principal and Equeſtral Biſhops, yea for the corruption of all the Churches, which if Hierome had ſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he would have known that it was the deviſe, not of the Spirit of God, to take away ſchiſms as was pretended, but of Satan himſelf to lay waſte and deſtroy the ancient Miniſters for feeding the Lords flock: whereby it might come to paſs that the Church might have not true Paſtors, Doctors, Presbyters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops but under the masks of thoſe names, idle-bellies, and magniſick Princes, who will not only not themſelves feed the people of God with ſound Apoſtolick Doctrine, but alſo take care by moſt wicked violence, that it be done by no one elſe. By this deviſe of Satan it is brought to paſs, that inſtead of Biſhops, the Churches have potent Lords and Princes, for the moſt choſen out of the order of Nobles and great men, who being upheld by their own and their kindreds power, may domineer over the flock of God as they liſt.</p>
               <p>And p. 423. The office appointed to the Biſhops that came after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times was to preach to the people, to adminſter the ſacred things, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe repentance, to take the care of the clergy and the people both in City and Country, to ordain, to viſit, to take care that the goods of the Church be rightly kept and diſpenſed, and to take the patronage of Church-matters with Princes. And if the Biſhops had but ſtaid here, it had been better with the Church: Or if the Prelates and Paſtors of our times would return to theſe Canonical Rules, there might be hope that the Eccleaſiaſtical State and order might poſſibly be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the controverſies of theſe times might be ended by the word of God—Hence it is plain that the office of true Presbyters and Biſhops in the Church of Chriſt is, to feed the Lords flock with ſound Doctrine, and to be truly Paſtors and Teachers. But now the falſe Biſhops pretend a Paſtoral Cure, when going to the Aſſembly-Offices they are, as they take it, Epiſcopally cloathed. They put on a white ſtole, longer than ordinary; with a girdle (not ſuch as John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt wore, &amp;c.,—The maskd Paſtor thus dreſſed doth not feed the flock of God,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61252:175"/>
but performeth the Church ſervice in ſuch a geſture, Ceremony and dralect, that all the matters of the Church may be nothing elſe than certaine vaine and pompous ſhewes—ſo that if one of the Apoſtles were there, he would never ſo much as dreame that this were the Epiſcopal feeding of the Lords flock. <q>Thus the Biſhop doing once or twice a year doth Suffciently performe his Office, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he do the reſt of the time. The ordination of Miniſters and other things accounted Eccleſiaſtical, he committeth partly to his ſuffiragane, and partly to his Vicar, or Chancellor. The office of Teaching he committeth to ſome Doctor or Monk, ſo ſworne, as that he ſhall not dare to ſpeake a word (<hi>or hiſſe</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what is preſcribed him in the formes of Lawes.</q>
               </p>

But in the mean time, inclining to the other extreme, they take the courſe which by degrees will bring the people into that indifferency in Religions which is the moſt peſtilent, and to drink in Epicuriſm the waſter and extniguiſher of all religion.

Should I cite all that is ſaid by thoſe that never were called Presbyterians, about the degeneration of Epiſcopacy, the largeneſs of their charge, the ruine of diſcipline by their tyranny, ambition and graſping wealth, and titles, when they neither will nor can perform the work, I mean by Luther, Melancton Illyricus, Chytraeus, Tzegedine, Bucer, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Gryneus, Aretius, Gualther, Pet.

I only add that if the Churches of France, Belgia, Geneva and the reſt of the Presbyterians, and the Churches of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania, Hungary, and formerly, Poland (that were Orthodox) and Bobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Brandenburgh, Saxony, the Palatinate, &amp;c. that ſet up another ſort of Epiſcopacy, had found, that the old or Engliſh ſpecies would have done the Miniſterial works it is not credible that they would all have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it.</p>
               <p>III. The third part of that experience which I alledge is the Biſhops own.</p>
               <p>1. This is ſignified by their confeſſions before named,</p>
               <p>Ar. Biſhop Uſhers reaſons for the ancient uſe of Epiſcopacy with their Presbyters who ſhall be acknowledged true Church Governours over their flocks, is fetcht from the need of ſo many to the work. And Mr. Stanley Gower late of Dorcheſter was wont to profeſs (being long intimate with him) that he profeſſed to him that he took a Biſhop to be but primus Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum, of the ſame order, and every Presbyter a Governour of the flock: And when he asked him, why then he would be a Primate as he was, he told him that he took it not for any part of his office as inſtituted by Chriſt but for a Collateral Dignity which the King was pleaſed to beſtow on him, for the more advantageous diſcharge of his Spiritual Office.</p>
               <p>What Biſhop Jewels opinion was to the like purpoſe is plain enough in his works.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Reignolds (that now is) profeſſed to me his opinion to be the ſame, when he took the Biſhoprick, and when he ſaw Dr. Stillingfliets book, that no form of Church Government is preſcribed in Scripture, profeſſed that it was always his opinion; And joyned with us in our propoſals for Biſhop Uſhers Model.</p>
               <p>Dr Stillingfleet in his Irenicon hath ſaid ſo much againſt the Jus Divinum of our Prelacy as can never be anſwered.</p>
               <p>I have talked with many of the Biſhops and Epiſcopal Conformiſts my ſelf of theſe matters, and I do not remember that ever I ſpake to one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Learned man, that did not confeſs when driven to it, that the Greatneſs of the Dioceſſes, and the Chancellors Government by the Church Keyes, were cauſes of ſo great a lapſe of diſcipline, as is to be groaned under: And can ſhew us no probability, it poſſibility of reſtoring it, while it ſo ſtands. And yet they would have us ſubſcribe and ſwear never to endeavour any alteration of the Church Government: not excepting in our place
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61252:176"/>
and calling, by petition, or otherwiſe, no though the King commanded us.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Hall in his Mod. Offer doth confeſs the faultineſs, and deſires refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: and in his excellent Peace-maker, would take up even with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencie durante vita, as ſufficient to reconcile us.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hammond himſelf oft complaineth of the lapſe of diſcipline, and the clergies and peoples vices thereupon.</p>
               <p>The Liturgy wiſheth the godly Diſcipline reſtored, but doth it not, as if in our caſe it could not be done.</p>
               <p>Abundance of their Writers lament the ſcandals of clergy and people which have abounded, of which I ſhall ſay ſomewhat more anon.</p>
               <p>2. And this is yet plainlier confeſſed by the Actual omiſſion of diſcipline: We need not to diſpute whether that can or be ever like to be done, by our Prelacy, which is no where done, and never was done, no not by any one man of them, not excepting the very beſt; ſo that if they had not come neer the Eraſtian opinion in their hearts, and thought this uſe of the Keyes to conſiſt but in bare Teaching, or the reſt to be of no great need, it had not been poſſible that they ſhould have quieted their Conſciences. Or at leaſt, if they did not do it, by ſaying, I cannot help it; It is not long of me: As Biſhop Goodman layeth it on the King in the caſe of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and moſt lay it on the Church-Wardens and Miniſters for preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more: But all muſt confeſs that little is done beſides the troubling of Nonconformiſts. It is not one of a thouſand in a Dioceſſe, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that ever is brought under the excerciſe of Church diſcipline that ought to be; Nor one of many thouſand that ſhould be ſo according to the ancient Canons of the Churches. If I ſhould give no other inſtance, than the ordinarie neglect of all Gods publick worſhip (Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Sacraments) in publick, Churches or any other Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, I do not think but ten thouſand perſons in this Dioceſſe, and twenty thouſand, if not fourty, in London Dioceſſe are guilty, that were never queſtioned by the Church.</p>
               <p>I may therefore argue thus: That which never was done by any one Biſhop in England, being the confeſſed work of their office is naturally or Morally Impoſſible to be done (or if it have a poſſibility it is as bad as none, when it never was once reduced into act) But the true exerciſe of Church diſcipline on all or the hundredth or many hundredth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it is due to; was never done by one Biſhop in England, that can by any credible Hiſtory be proved (ſince the deformation or reformation) Ergo.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of the Major is plain. 1. From the Biſhops own mouths who uſe to praiſe themſelves as the Wiſeſt, Learn dſt and beſt of the Clergie, and therefore fitter to be truſted with the Government of the Church than all or any of the Presbyters (though but under then) And they would take it heynouſly if we queſtion their wiſdom conſcience or honeſty, and if they are all or moſt ſo good, ſure it is long of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61252:177"/>
ſtate and conſtitution of their places, and not long of their perſons, that their very proper work is made but a ſhaddow and a dream.</p>
               <p>2. But though this be but ad homines, yet really we have had very worthy and excellent perſons to be Biſhops; what a man was Jewell? Arch-biſhop Grindal had Godlineſs enough and reſolution too to make him odi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and favoured Lectures and Preaching, &amp;c. Enough to bring him down, if Cambden, Godwin or Fuller, are to be believed: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could do this work of diſcipline, upon one of hundreds or thouſands under him. We had an excellent Arch-Biſhop-Abbot afterwards, good enough to be reproached by Heylin, and to ſuffer what I need not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but never able to do this work. What Learned, Judicious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, were his Brother Robert Abbot and after him Davenant, Biſhops of Salisbury? And how good a man was peaceable Biſhop Hall, ſo Uſher in Ireland, Moron and many more? But no ſuch thing was done by any of them? what ſhould I ſay now of Biſhop Reignolds, and Biſhop Wilkins, Men Learned and extraordinary honeſt in theſe times: But let any man enquire whether any ſuch thing as the diſcipline in queſtion is exerciſed on the thouſandth Criminal in their Dioceſe? Indeed we have heard in Biſhop Reignolds Dioceſe of a great number cenſured for Nonconformity: And it is his praiſe that it was not his doing; but his Chancellours (though heretofore Judge Advocate in Fairefaxes or Cromwells Army.) And to ſay now that it is long of Church-Wardens, Chancellours, &amp;c. Is but to ſay that the Church is corrupted, the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal diſcipline almoſt quite caſt out, and all the remedy is to ſay, It is long of ſomebody: Like the Phyſician whoſe Praiſe was, that his patients dyed according to the rules of art; or the nurſe whoſe praiſe was, that though moſt of the Children periſhed, it was long of themſelves or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe.</p>
               <p>IV. But the fulleſt experience, which ſo far ſatisfieth me that all the books in the world cannot change me in this, is my own, and the reſt of my Brethren in the Miniſtry. I have lived now (through Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful mercy) threeſcore years wanting leſſe than four <note n="*" place="margin">Now ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I lived under a great number of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ignorant Curates that never preached, and Schoolmaſters, my ſelf, and many more were round about us, that were never troubled with diſcipline, or caſt out. I never lived where drunkards and ſwearers were not common; but never one of them underwent the Churches diſcipline: But thoſe that met to faſt and pray, and went to hear a Sermon two miles off, when they had none at home. But yet this is the laſt of my conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:61252:177"/>When I undertook a Paſtoral charge my ſelf; I kept with me two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to aſſiſt me (at one Pariſh Church and a ſmall Chappel): I had three Godly Juſtices of Peace in the Pariſh, who to countenance our diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline kept their monthly meeting at the ſame time and place. I had four an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Godly men that performed the office of Deacons: I had above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Seniors of the Laity, who without pretence of any office, met with us to be witneſſes that we did the Church and ſinners no wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to awe the offenders by their preſence: Theſe met once a month together, we had almoſt all the worthy Miniſters of the Country agreeing and aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to do the like in their ſeveral Pariſhes as far as they were able; that unity might the more convince offenders: We had in the ſame Town the next day after our monthly Town-meeting, an Aſſembly of a doz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or twenty ſuch Miniſters, to edifie each other, and that thoſe might be tryed by them and before them, whether we could perſwade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who could not be prevailed with by ourſelves: And, which was our eaſe incomparably beyond all this, the times nor our judgment allowing us to uſe diſcipline upon none but ſuch as conſented to our office and relation to them, we told them that we had all agreed only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo much of diſcipline as Epiſcopal, Presbyterians and Independants had no controverſie about (ſome of the Epiſcopal joyning with us) and that we would exerciſe it in all our flocks, but we could be Paſtors to none againſt their wills; whereupon of about 3000 perſons, 1800 or more of which were at age to be Communicants, all refuſed to do any more than hear me preach, (for fear of diſcipline) except about 600 or a few more. Theſe 500 were the moſt underſtanding Religious part of the Pariſh, all the groſly ignorant, and the Common ſwearers, and all the Drunkards and ſcandalous perſons were among the refuſers, except about five or ſix young men that had got ſuch a Love to tipling that they could not leave it. Theſe hid their ſin a while: But could not long: Yet the trouble and work that theſe five or ſix men made us, ſometimes by Drunkenneſs, ſometimes by fighting, ſometimes by ſlandering their Neighbours, or ſuch like was more than it is eaſy for an unexperienced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe. So hard was it to bring them to a Confeſſion of their ſins or to ask thoſe Forgiveneſs whom they groſly wronged, that when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with all our skill to convince them, and uſed both gentle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and alſo opened to them the terrors of the Lord, when we prayed before them that God would give them repentance, when their own Parents and relations joyned with us, all would not make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their ſin, but we were forced to caſt them out of our Communion (for the moſt part of them). And among all the reſt there were ſome that ſometimes would need admonitions, and reconciliations with one another, which found us ſome work. But if we had but been troubled with all the other (1000 or 1200 as was ſuppoſed) of the Pariſh, and ſo with all the Swearers, railers, Common Drunkards, ſome Infidels, &amp;c. What work ſhould we have had? So much as I dare confidently ſay that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61252:178"/>
being half ſo ſtrict and troubleſome as the Ancient Canons were) all we could not poſſibly have done more in the work of diſcipline, than Govern that one Pariſh. Nor could we have done ſo much, but with ſuch omiſſions as nothing but diſability would have quieted our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences under.</p>
               <p>And that you may know that I give you not my ſingle experience, the reſt of the honeſt Miniſters of the County. 1. Sometimes durſt not aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with us, becauſe the ſcandalous perſons of their Pariſhes were ſo many and ſo maſterly and fierce, as that they were not able (they thought) to exerciſe any diſcipline among them. 2. Some that did joyn with us were fain to do as the Independants, and gather out ſome of the beſt to be their flock as to Communion in the Sacrament, and let the reſt live quietly as bare hearers, becauſe the offenders were ſo many that they durſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe diſcipline on them. 3. Some did even give the Sacrament to all promiſcuouſly how ſcandalous ſoever, to avoid the difficulties of exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcipline. 4. And all over the land they were faine to take the ſame courſe with theſe ſorts aforeſaid, yea and more, too many quite forbear the Sacrament, becauſe they could not keep away the ſcandalous. 5. And too many took up the way of Separation, and gathered Churches out of theſe Churches, according to their ſeveral opinions, becauſe the Pariſhes were ſo bad, that they thought them uncapable of diſcipline. Though yet the truth is. 1. Many ſuch made them worſe than they were. 2. And took the courſe that was eaſieſt to them, by avoiding the moſt difficult part of their work; 3. And they were led to it by over valuing Expreſſive parts in ſome of the people, and unvaluing the good deſires of ſome that wanted ſuch Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>And if we that found diſcipline too hard a work for us to exerciſe in our ſeveral Pariſhes, ſhould have dreamed that one of us, was ſufficient to have exerciſed it on a thouſand or many hundred ſuch Pariſhes (by our ſelves and Chancellors) O what Monſters of ignorance, ſhould we have been.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Objections againſt Pariſh Diſcipline anſwered.</head>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>YOu make this diſcipline ſeem more needful than it is. A Church may be a true Church without it. The </hi> Helvetians <hi>uſe very little of it at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. The Helvetian Divines write for it, though with lenity and they are for denying the Sacrament to the Impenitently wicked, which is not nothing; and they are for Paſtoral admonition of the perſons that are ſcandalous. And the reſt the Magiſtrates hinder them from, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61252:178"/>
partly undertake themſelves. And verily I take it to be much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous to let the Magiſtrate do what he can, and to pretend to no more diſcipline, than to talk for it, and never uſe it.</p>
               <p>2. A Man may be a true man though he have the Palſie, Dropſie, Gout or Stone, or be diſmembred. And are theſe therefore indifferent things?</p>
               <p>3. Whether diſcipline be needful judge after theſe Reaſons. 1. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Biſhops are not needful to exerciſe it, nor any other Paſtors, but bare Preachers. Why ſhould Lordſhips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wealth and honours, be allowed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for that which is not needful? 2. If it be needful to be exerciſed on Miniſters, why not on the People alſo? And if not on Miniſters, why have there ſo great numbers been ſilenced, ſuſpended, and troubled? Sure ſomebody thinketh, that our ſilencing is needful. 3. If it be not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, why did the univerſal Church uſe it, and that ſo ſtrictly from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? And why do they that ſay this, pretend a reverence to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches, to the Councils, the Canons, and the Biſhops of thoſe times, who went ten times further in their Severities than we do. 4. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by Precept and Divine Canon as may be ſeen, Lev. 19. 17. Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5. Tit. 1. 13. and 2. 15. and 3. 10. 1 Tim. 3. 5. 15. and 5. 19, 20, 21 22, 24. 2 Tim. 3. 5. and 4. 2. 2 Theſ. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 14. 5. It is needful to the honour of God, our Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, that he may be declared Holy in the Holyneſs of his Church, and not by our allowed wickedneſs be repreſented as an unholy friend to ſin. 6. It is needful to the Churches honour, that it be not as a very ſtie and ſink of wickedneſs as the Infidel World. 7. It is needful to the Churches beauty, ſafety, and felicity, that God may delight in it, and not forſake it, as he hath done moſt of the Eaſt, nor make them miſerable by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 8. It is needful to the Honour of Holineſs it ſelf, which will be vilified if we difference not the precious from the vile. 9. It is needful to the Conviction and Converſion of Mahometans, and other Infidels and Heathens, who now are kept in their Infidelity, by ſeeing that Chriſtians as are bad or worſe than themſelves; and would be more drawn to Chriſt, if the holy Lives of Chriſtians, and holy State of Churches did invite them. 10. It is needful to the comfortable Communion of Saints, as it is profeſſed by us in our Creed. 11. It is needful to prevent the infection of the Church, and the increaſe of ſin; ſeeing a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, and he that toucheth pitch will be defiled by it. 12. It is needful to encourage and ſtrengthen the Faithful, when they ſee by this praejudicium futuri judicii, as Tertullian calleth it, the difference that God himſelf will make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 13. It is an Eſſential part of the Paſtoral Office to have the Power of Diſcipline: And what is the Power for but the Work? yea Power and Obligation are eſſential to his Office. 14. It is needful to the Holy Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other parts of Divine Worſhip, that Holy things be not given to Dogs. 15. It is needful to convince the ordinary careleſs ſinners among us, that ſeeing a difference put between
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61252:179"/>
the good and bad, they may not think that preaching is but idle talk and falſhood, and that they are as ſafe as others. 16. It is needful to keep the better people from offending God by their familiarity and communion with the notoriouſly wicked. 17. It is needful to break the Serpents head, that in Chriſts Church the Devils works may be renounced and caſt out, and ſin be publickly made a ſhame, as the Devil out of the Church endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to do by Truth and Holineſs. 18. It is needful to the eaſe and peace of Magiſtrates, that they may not he overwhelmed with the cares, troubles, dangers, that come by multitudes of Wicked Men; but the Paſtors la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with the voluntary may prevent much of the Magiſtrates trouble with the involuntary. 19. It is needful to the ſafety of Commonwealths and Kingdomes, that they be not poyſoned by wickedneſs, and ſo expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the judgment of God. 20. And laſtly, it is needful to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sinners themſelves, that they may not be ſuffered to die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſin, but have all poſſible means uſed to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they may be ſaved. Conſider whether all theſe Reaſons prove not Diſcipline to be needful.</p>
               <p>Object. II. <hi>But till Conſtantines time there was no Chriſtian Magiſtrate, which made it then needful: But ſince the caſe is not the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Down then with Biſhops now, if their work be needleſs. But why then were they ſet ſo much higher, and had ſo much more power ſince the dayes of Conſtantine then before? 2. Are you wiſer than all the Councils (Nice, Epheſ. Chalced. Conſtance, &amp;c.) which have ever ſince made Canons for Diſcipline? 3. Again, try whether none of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going reaſons, be ſtill in force. 4. Read Galaſpies Aarons Rod, which fully proveth the continued need of diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Object. III. <hi>But diſcipline is not to be uſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on all that deſerve it, but only one now and then, one to be a terror to the reſt: You are for too much ſtrictneſs, rigidneſs and ſeverity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. I am not for half the rigidneſs and ſeverity of the Ancient Biſhops and Churches, who made the penitents waite at the Church doors, and caſt down themſelves with cryes and tears to beg abſolution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion, and in many caſes to waite thus many years together, and in ſome, till their death bed. I am for accepting the firſt credible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Repentance: I am for gentle exhorting them and praying for them long before we caſt them out. I am not for troubling any for ſmall faults: Nor for bringing any mans ſecret ſins to light, or making them more publick than he maketh them himſelf; I am not for impoſing ſuch penances as the Papiſts do. And is a ſtrictneſs ſhort of theirs into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to you, that pretend to be more holy than they? Yea more, I am not for the uſe of diſcipline at all, where it is notorious to true reaſon that its like to do more harme than good. And is all this too much ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? But I am not for keeping it out, and then making ſuch pretences, nor for cauſing the inconveniences, and then pleading them againſt the duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61252:179"/>2. The Scripture and Canons do not bid you reprove or ſuſpend or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject one blaſphemer, or drunkard of many; but all that are ſuch: And do you ſay that God and Councils diſſembled, and bid us do that which they would not have us do?</p>
               <p>3. To cenſure one of a hundred or a thouſand, yea, or twenty offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, will be no terror or warning to the reſt; who will look to ſcape that which falleth on ſo few.</p>
               <p>4. When one of ſo many only is cenſured, the Church will be ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moſt of the forementioned danger and defilement; and this much will not reach the End.</p>
               <p>5. Partiality is an odious Character of injuſtice, and ſhould not be found in civil judges; much leſs in the Churches of Chriſt. And it will but harden and enrage thoſe perſons whom you deal with, when you enable them to ſay, you cenſure me, and let many others alone, in the ſame ſin. Is this your Church juſtice, or rather malice to me?</p>
               <p>Obj. IV. <hi>You confeſs your ſelf that it is ſo hard to uſe diſcipline in one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that moſt Miniſters did neglect it when the Biſhops were out: And why blame you the Biſhops then for neglecting it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. We were to deal with the Pariſhes in that defiled and unruly ſtate as the Biſhops left them: And all great works muſt have time to be done in. And at laſt the reformation proſpered apace, till they pull'd it down. 2. We were to make uſe of ſuch Miniſters as the Biſhops left us, and of young men who were newly come from the Univerſities. And men cannot get wiſdom intereſt, experience and reſolution in a day. 3. The remaining reſpects which the people had to the Prelates and their way was a hinderance to us that deſired, to meddle herein with none but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. 4. A great number of Sectaries, raiſed by the diſtaſtes of the Prelates wayes, did alſo hinder us. 5. Yet it was than poſſible and feaſible to Miniſters that were wiſe and willing to do ſo much as might very much attain the ends of diſcipline, though not ſo much as they deſired. 6. But is this an Objection fit for the Prelatiſts to make? or doth it not encreaſe their condemnation? what would you ſay to a Phyſician, a Pilot, a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, that ſhould ſay, It is not an hundred Phyſicians, that can do what ſhould be done for all the Patients in this City; nor an hundred Pilots that can well govern all the Navy; nor an hundred School maſters that can well Govern all the Schools in the Dioceſs: Therefore I will get them all turned out and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will be the only Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician (with my Apothecaries) the only Pilot (with my S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n) the only Schoolmaſter (with my Monitors and Uſhers) my ſelf; for the work can be but left undone? Such rule the Churches muſt have while God for our ſins will ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>The doing it per alios is oft enough anſwered before.</p>
               <p>Obj. V. Many Pariſh Miniſters are young and raw and unfit to govern. Anſ. 1. They are unfit who make this Objection, who bring and keep ſuch in, and caſt ſo many hundred out that are better (however ignorant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ſlander them) 2. This alſo may be ſaid againſt their preaching, much
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61252:180"/>
more: For, 3. They may Rule with others, when they cannot preach by others. 4. There may be appeals to the next Synod (or Prelate if you will have it ſo).</p>
               <p>Obj. VI. You would have a Prieſt to be a Pope in his Pariſh. Anſ. I can call this Objection no better than groſs Impudency: For, 1. Its a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: A Pope is a Head of the Univerſal Church: And ſo it is ſaying, that we make every Miniſter a Head of the Univerſal Church to his Pariſh. 2. We deſire more Presbyters than One in a Church. 3. We deſire Appeals to the next Synod: and is that to be a Pope? 4. Is not one Miniſter as able to Rule a Pariſh, without the help of aſſiſtants and Synods, as one Prelate to Rule many hundred Pariſhes, who likely is a worſe man than the Miniſter? Impudent pride will perhaps ſay no.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The Magiſtrates Sword is neither the ſtrength of Church diſcipline, nor will ſerve inſtead of it, nor ſhould be too much uſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and enforce it.</head>
               <p>THeſe three aſſertions I will prove diſtinctly. 1. The Magiſtrates Sword is not the chief ſtrength of true Church diſcipline.</p>
               <p>I add this, becauſe this is the Prelatiſts laſt Objection, that its true that the Keys are but brutum fulmen and a leaden ſword without the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: For almoſt all men will diſpiſe it: Who will come to our Courts if they may chooſe? Who will regard our Excommunications? Do not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now deſpiſe them? what then would they do if they had their wills? when we have excommunicated the Schiſmaticks, They will Excommunicate us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Prelatiſts who write to me and ſpeak with me, uſe theſe very words themſelves. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. If we prove that Chriſt hath inſtituted diſcipline, and that for ſuch noble ends as aforementioned, it is little leſs than blaſphemy thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it: As if Chriſt had no more Power, Wiſdome or Goodneſs, than to ordain ſo vain and unprofitable a means, to ſuch high and neceſſary ends.</p>
               <p>2. The objection doth but expreſs a carnal mind, which regardeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnal things, and thinketh as baſely of all others, as if nothing moved them but the intereſt of the fleſh; And as if Gods favour or diſpleaſure, and the authority of his word and Miniſters were of no force or regard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. The objection inviteth Kings to put down all Biſhops, except
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61252:180"/>
Preachers and Magiſtrates; For why ſhould they put the people to ſo great charge and trouble, eſpecially when they love the Prelates ſo little as to keep them up to wield a Leaden Sword, and to brandiſh a brutum fulmen, and to make a noiſe to no more purpoſe; yea to rob the Magiſtrate of the honour of his proper work, and to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people believe that thoſe things are done by a brutum fulmen which really are done by the Civil power.</p>
               <p>4. This objection bitterly reproacheth all the ancient Churches and Biſhops, and all General and provincical Councils, and all the Cannons and ancient diſcipline of the Churches; As if they had troubled the world to no pupoſe and all their diſcipline had been vain.</p>
               <p>5. The objection is notoriouſly confuted, in that the Diſcipline was more powerful and had better effect, before Conſtantius time than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and was much more ſtrictly exerciſed againſt ſin. And that which ſo long did more without the Sword, than afterward by it, doth not receive its efficacy from the Sword.</p>
               <p>6. A naturarei there is as much of Divine Authority, as much of the power of his Precepts Prohibitions, Promiſes, and threatnings, as much of Heavenly inducement, as much of the terrors of Hell, as much of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal goodneſs of holyneſs, and evil of ſins, as much of Soul intereſt in what the Miniſter propoundeth for mens conviction, as there is, when it is backt with the Magiſtrates Sword. And if all theſe have no force, Chriſtianity muſt be a dream, and able to do no good in the world; which better beſeemeth Julian, Celſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or Porphyry, Symmachus, or Eunapius, to ſay, than a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>7. By this objection the Prelatiſts openly confeſs that their Churches conſiſt of men ſo carnal as are not moved by Divine authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sword: And conſequently what Paſtors they have been to the Churches, and how they have governed them; and what they allow us to expect from their diſcipline for the time to come.</p>
               <p>8. By this Objection they condemn themſelves and juſtifie the Nonconformiſts: For why ſhould we Swear that we will never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any alteration of ſo brutiſh an Office, as if the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could not take down ſuch an uſeleſs thing? And why ſhould ſo many hundred Miniſters be forbidden to Preach Chriſt, for not aſſenting, conſenting and Swearing to ſuch a vaine and brutiſh power?</p>
               <p>9. By this they give up their cauſe to the Presbyterians, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; Confeſſing that their diſcipline is uneffectual; when as we that plead for another frame, deſire not the Magiſtrates Sword to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and deſire to uſe diſcipline on none but Volunteers. And ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſcipline which we deſire hath ſome efficacy, or none. If none, what need they fear it, or hinder it, or ſilence ſo many hundred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and write and ſtrive, and all to keep men from uſing ſuch a brutum fulmen which can do no harme. But if they confeſs that our diſcipline
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61252:181"/>
hath efficacy, and theirs hath none, what do they but directly call us to ſeek the alteration which we are required to abjure?</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly by this objection they ſhew themſelves too ignorant of the nature of Church, and diſcipline, and Sacrament and Miniſtery: Or elſe they would better know how far Volunteers are proper objects of Church diſcipline, and have the right to the privileges and Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>II. The Magiſtrates Sword will not ſerve inſtead of Church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
               <p>1. Elſe Chriſt would not have inſtituted another office for it.</p>
               <p>2. Elſe it might ſerve alſo inſtead of Miniſtry, Preaching and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p>3. The nature of it tendeth not directly to convince men of Errours to lead them into truth, to move them by heavenly motions, and to bring them to true repentance and godlyneſs. But this will be fuller proved under the next; and is confeſſed by all ſave the Eraſtians.</p>
               <p>III. The Magiſtrates Sword ſhould not be uſed too forwardly or too much to ſecond or enforce Church diſcipline; much leſs to be its life and ſtrength, and inſeparably twiſted with it. I mean,</p>
               <p>1. No unbeliever ſhould be forced to ſay he is a Believer, and to profeſſe the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>2. None upon ſuch profeſſion ſhould be forced to be Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>3. None that hath no right to Church Communion in the Sacrament ſhould be forced to receive it.</p>
               <p>4. None that Apoſtatizeth from Chriſt ſhould be forced falſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he is ſtill a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>5. None that are at age ſhould be forced to ſtay in the Church by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal preſence or relation as a member of it, who is not willing, and the practice of the Papiſts who force no Heathens to be Chriſtians, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward force Chriſtians by fire and Sword, and burn them that were Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, or Apoſtates is ſelf contradicting and ſelf condemning; God having left man as much unto his own choice for continuing as for Entring into the Church: And as for Obedience to Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Infidels may owe it to Chriſtian Kings, as well as Chriſtians: And none but Magiſtrates can uſe the Sword to puniſh either.</p>
               <p>6. No Magiſtrate ſhould puniſh a Mans body, meerly becauſe he is Excommunicate, and ſo puniſhed already. Nor ſhould he be made a meer executioner to the Biſhop without hearing, trying and judging the Cauſe himſelf, in order to his own execution.</p>
               <p>7. No Magiſtrate ſhould force an Impenitent ſinner to lie and ſay he doth repent, that thereby he may be admitted to the Church Communion and Sacrament, but it is the force of Gods word that muſt try his Repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>But yet I acknowledge. 1. That Magiſtrates and Parents and Maſters
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61252:181"/>
may force their Subjects to uſe thoſe means which tend to make them Chriſtians, as to hear Preaching, Conference or diſputations, or to read convincing books: But with theſe two Cautions. 1. That it be but when it is like or hopeful to do more good than harme. 2. That it be by wiſe and moderate means of conſtreint, and not hang or burn them to convert them.</p>
               <p>2. Accordingly Magiſtrates, Parents, and Maſters, may uſe the like force with their Subjects who are Chriſtians, to cauſe them to uſe the foreſaid meanes (of hearing and Reading and conference) for the cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their dangerous errours or ſinful lives.</p>
               <p>3. And I doubt not but Magiſtrates may puniſh men Corporally for their crime according to the nature of them, and even for the ſame that the Church hath excommunicated them. If one be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for Treaſon, Murder, Theft, Swearing, Prophaning the Lords day, and holy things &amp;c. it followeth not that the Magiſtrate may not alſo meddle with him.</p>
               <p>4. And we doubt not but Magiſtrates may Reſtraine falſe Teachers from ſeducing others, and drawing them from God to ſin.</p>
               <p>5. And the Magiſtrate may and ought to encourage Miniſters in the uſe of the Church Keyes, and to preſerve them from the violence of wicked men.</p>
               <p>7. And they may make a difference in their favours and rewards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtians obedient to God and their Paſtors, and Infidels, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, in penitent ones, and Apoſtates, by denying honors and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rewards to the worſe, which he giveth to the better ſort of men.</p>
               <p>But yet as to the Caſes before denied, eſpecially the forcing men by fire, ſword, and impriſonment to ſay, they believe and repent, and to take the Sacrament and other Church priviledges, and making this the ſtrength of Church diſcipline, I have all this againſt it.</p>
               <p>1. No force ſhould be uſed to the hindering and deſtruction of Chriſts ordinance of diſcipline and his Church Laws. But ſuch it would be in the caſe in hand. For Chriſts fundamental Covenant is, that the true wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling penitent and believer ſhall be a member of his Church, or thoſe only that credibly profeſs to be ſo (at age) He that will may freely drink of the water of life. Nemo invitus fit Chriſtianus: ſo that to ſay, that any man hath right to the myſtical Church priviledges, but Conſenters, or any man hath right to the viſible Church priviledges, but credible Profeſſors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is to contradict the very condition of the Covenant of life, which is the ſum of all the Goſpel. Its true, you may compel ſome men to duty, but you cannot compel them to be happy.</p>
               <p>But to force them by perpetual Impriſonment, confiſcation and the ſword, to ſay that they are Chriſtians, or repent, conſent or are willing, and ſo to give them abſolution and Church-communion, is to make Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of none effect. For true diſcipline is to make them penitent and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61252:182"/>
and then to uſe them as ſuch: But, 1, It is not credible that that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is truly penitent and willing to be a Chriſtian, or have Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who will not be perſwaded to conſent by all that can be ſaid by the Paſtors from the word of God, but yet on the rack or to prevent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conſent. This is contrary to the nature of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 2. Or if it did not make this forced conſent utterly incredible, yet it utterly croſſeth the ends of Church diſcipline, which is to diſcern the voluntary penitent; which force ſo obſcureth that no man can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the perſon be credibly penitent or not. If I left a Legacy to ſo many that are Lovers of the Church, and its Communion, and my Executors ſhould get the Magiſtrate to hang, or Impriſon or undo certain men that are accuſed as Enemies of the Church, unleſs they will ſay, we Love the Church, I think my Will would be ill performed, if thoſe men had my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, that were forced to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>2. No man ſhould be forced to his own ſin and diſtruction. But he that is forced to take the Sacrament when he is unwilling and had rather be without it, in likelihood is forced to his ſin and deſtruction: For even the Liturgy telleth the unworthy that they eat and drink damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that the Devil may enter into them as he did into Judas: And who is unworthy if the unwilling are not?</p>
               <p>3. Force is not fitted to cauſe love and willingneſs; therefore men ſhould not be forced to take a Gift, which Love and willingneſs is the condition of; men uſe not to ſay, Love me or I will hang thee or impriſon thee. This ſeemeth to make a new way of Preaching which Chriſt never made.</p>
               <p>4. Chriſts terms are ſelf-denial, Croſs-bearing and forſaking all and following him for the hopes of heaven: But this ſeemeth a new and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Goſpel, as if Chriſt had ſaid; He that will be my diſciple rather than be impriſoned or die, ſhall be ſaved or received.] Chriſt ſaith: He that forſaketh not all that he hath cannot be my diſciple, Luk. 14. 33. This way, ſaith [He that will come to the Church-communion rather than forſake all ſhall be my diſciple]. Chriſt ſaith [He that loveth any thing, even his life more than me, cannot be my diſciple.] This way ſaith, [He that loveth life, credit, wealth, liberty ſo well as that he will rather receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament than loſe it, ſhall be my diſciple] Chriſt ſaith, except ye repent ye ſhall all periſh.] This forceth a Miniſter to abſolve a wicked man, as if he ſhould not periſh, if he will but rather ſay [I repent] than loſe his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and eſtate. God ſaith [He that loveth the World, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him]. This way ſaith [Do but Love the world ſo well as to ſay and do any thing to keep it, and then Paſtor and people ſhall number thee with the Lovers of the Father.] God ſaith; The carnal mind is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God and is not ſubject to his Law nor can be.] This way ſaith [If thy carnal mind make thee ſay or do any thing to ſave thy liberty or money, thou art an obedient Son of the Church and of God.] And is not this to ſet up a new Goſpel, Gal. 1. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61252:182"/>5. And this way compelleth men to lie and play the Hypocrites. when we may diſcerne it is ſo. Mr. Capel of Tempt: would perſwade us that a lie thus differeth from moſt other ſins, that it is ſo evil in it ſelf, as that it cannot in the very act be lawful. When a man againſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, ſaith or ſheweth you, that he doth not believe in Chriſt, or doth not repent, to ſay to that man, [Say thou believeſt, or Repenteſt, or thou ſhalt be confiſcate and lie in jaile] is plainly to ſay [Lie or ſuffer] I deny not but that in ſome caſes a man may be examined when it is foreknown that he will lie. But its one thing to force him to examination and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and another to force him to that particular anſwer.</p>
               <p>6. It is a compelling men to pretend to that which we cannot compel them to, that is, to have a Right to ſo great a benefit as Abſolution and Church Communion. Force giveth no man Right to the Benefit, and their force ſhould not compel him falſly to pretend a Right.</p>
               <p>7. It confoundeth the Church and the world: Whileſt every man is made a member of the Church that had but rather tell a lie and take bread and wine, than be undone, what wicked man on earth will not do the ſame (unleſs he be ſo Conſciencious that miſtake and Conſcience hindereth him) Is there any Infidel, Heathen, Atheiſt, Murderer, Traytor, or Senſualiſt, in the world that will not do it? What ſhould hinder him that believeth there is no God, to do thus rather than be undone? Is it ſo hard a word to ſay in a Chancellours Court [I repent] and deride and curſe them when he is gone out; or is a bit of Bread and a Sup of Wine ſo hard for a Glutton or Drunkard to get down, as that any of them would rather lie in jaile. 1. So that by this courſe the Church and the Infidel world are made equal, and no man can prove that any Mabometan Congregation is not as good, as to the perſons, as ſuch a Chriſtian Congregation: For what Mabometan would not ſay and do this rather then be undone? unleſs he be a Conſciencious one, who is not ſo bad as thoſe Chriſtians that have no Conſcience. 2. And by this meanes no conjecture can be made of the real members of the Church. Thouſands may be driven in at the doors, but we have no means to perceive whither any of them indeed be Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>8. And hereby the Church and the Chriſtian Religion are greatly dishonoured, while this odious ſtigma is made the marke of a viſible member, [One that had rather ſay he is a Chriſtian and repenteth, than lie in a jaile]! Is this a laudable deſcription?</p>
               <p>9. And hereby Mabometans, Jews and Heathens are hardened in their Infidelity and reproach of Chriſt, while Chriſtians are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>10. It putteth every conſciencious Miniſter into a ſnare, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his Conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or turneth him out, when he muſt put the Sacrament into the very hand of every man that had rather take it than be impriſoned; and muſt read the Abſolution of every one that had rather ſay, [I repent] than be undone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:61252:183"/>11. It hindereth the comfort of the faithful in Church Communion to know that this is the meaſure and Character of theſe with whom they muſt hold that Communion, which is called the Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>12. It deſtroyeth Church unity and Love. For every viſible member of the Church being a ſeeming Saint, ſhould be loved with the ſpecial Love which belongeth to Saints, by us who are not Searchers of the heart. But who that is not out of his wits can by any obedience to the Church, be brought to Love all thoſe as ſeeming Saints, who will chooſe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament before a jaile? He that cannot believe them ſuch, cannot Love them as ſuch.</p>
               <p>13. It will ſtrengthen them that Separate from us as no Church, and make it not ſo eaſy to prove that we have any Church, as elſe it would be; when they ſhould argue [Where there is no credible Profeſſion of Faith and repentance there is no true Church: But &amp;c. Ergo. The Major is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable. <note n="*" place="margin">As they that to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But no thanks to them that teach the accuſers thus to argue [When the Laws of Profeſſion are Profeſs or lie in jayle, there is no credible (Voluntary) Profeſſion: But &amp;c. The Major they prove, Non eſſe &amp; non apparere here are equipollent: But under ſuch a law no voluntarineſs and Credibility is apparent: Ergo—And I know but this anſwer to the Minor, it is apparent otherwiſe, though not by that forced profeſſion, becauſe multitudes daily ſhew that they approve of what they do.</p>
               <p>14. Force tendeth rather to hinder mens Repentance and Love to the Church: For Fear breadeth Hatred; or at leaſt Hurt doth. Kindneſs breedeth Love. God winneth our Love by mercy: And we are ſo to win the Love of others. Give a man but a box on the ear or ſlander or wrong him, and try whether it will make him Love you; to ſay, Love Chriſt and the Chriſtian or I will undo thee and lay thee in jaile, is the way to make him hate them.</p>
               <p>15. And the Office of the Paſtors is ſuch as that truth and Goodneſs are the wares which they expoſe to ſinners choice, and Light and Love are the effects which Spirits Word and Miniſtry are appointed to produce. And by Light and Love they muſt be wrought. Therefore no Miniſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth his work, or doth any good to ſome, if by Light and Love and holy Life, he help not the people to the ſame. And therefore the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Jayles and confiſcations, is ſo contrary to his Office and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne as obſcureth or deſtroyeth it. (Though Enemies may be reſtrained, and peace kept by force.)</p>
               <p>16. True diſcipline cannot be exerciſed this way, not only as its loſt in the confuſion of powers (as a little wine in Wormwood juice) but becauſe the Number and quality of the Church members will make it impoſſible. Enemies and rebellious carnal minds are not ſubject nor can be to the Lawes of Chriſt; you may affright them to a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61252:183"/>
but one of them will make a Miniſter ſuch work, who will but call them to credible repentance for their crimes, and will renew thoſe crimes ſo oft till he be excommunicated, and will ſo hate thoſe that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, as will tell you what can be done, when all ſuch are forced unwillingly into the Church. Of this I have ſpoke at large in my Book of Confirmation.</p>
               <p>17. It tendeth greatly to harden the ſinners in the Church in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, to their damnation: when they ſhall ſee, that let one ſwear and curſe and be drunk every day in the week, if he will but ſay, I repent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than lie in Jayl, he ſhall be abſolved by the Chancellour in the Biſhops came, and have a ſealed pardon delivered him in the Sacrament, by the Miniſter who knoweth his wicked life. How eaſie a way to Heaven (which leadeth to Hell) do ſuch good-natured (cruel) Churches make men?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The Miniſter is to refuſe the ſcandalous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. Not when he is abſolved by the Chancellour.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if he ſin again, he may refuſe him again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. How far that is true, I ſhewed before. But not when he is abſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And he may be abſolved toties quoties, if he had, but rather ſay, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent] than lie in Jayle.</p>
               <p>18. Let but the ancient Canons be peruſed, and how contrary to them will this courſe appear? The ancient Churches would admit none to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and communion after divers greater crimes, till they had waited (as is aforeſaid) in begging and tears, and that for ſo long a term and with ſuch penitential expreſſions, as ſatisfied the Church of the truth of their repentance. It would be tedious to recite the Canons. How great a part of Cyprians Epiſtles to the Churches of Carthage and Rome, are on this ſubject? reprehending the Confeſſors and Presbyters for taking lapſed perſons into Church Communion before they had fulfilled their penitential courſe? And what a reproach do they caſt upon all theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Churches and diſcipline, who ſay, That ſinners muſt be taken into Communion, if they will prefer it before a Jayle Though they love a Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, an Ale-houſe, a Play-houſe, a Gaming houſe, yea, a Swine-Stie better than the Church, yet if they do not love a Jayle with beggery better, they ſhall be received.</p>
               <p>19. Even when Chriſtian Emperours had advanced Prelates, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them (though not the ſword yet) the aid of it in the Magiſtrates hand to ſecond them, they never uſed it to force any to the Communion of the Church, but only to defend them, and to repreſs their adverſaries. Yea when Prelates themſelves began to uſe the ſword, or to deſire the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to ſerve them by it, it was not at all to force men to ſay: They Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and ſo to be abſolved and communicate; But only to keep hereticks from their own aſſemblings, and from publiſhing their own doctrines or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, or from being Paſtors of the Churches. And yet now men will force them to be Abſolved and communicate.</p>
               <p>And how great miſchiefs did even ſo much uſe of the ſword in matters of Religion as was the puniſhment of Hereticks then being (though they

Martin towards Ithaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Idacius, I have oft enough repeated: Only I cannot but note the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency of Bellarmine, who de Scriptor. Eccleſ. de Idacio (falſly making Idaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us to be the ſame with Ithacius, when he was but one of his aſſociates) doth tell us that Idacius fell under the reprehenſion and puniſhment of the Biſhops (in eo reprehenſus &amp; punitus ab Epiſcopis fuit, quod Priſcillianum apud ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares accuſaverit &amp; occidi curaverit] whereas Sulpitius Severus, telleth us, that all the Biſhops of the Synod joyned with them, and one S. Martyn and one French Biſhop more diſowned and refuſed them, and Martin would have no Communion with them to the death (ſave that once at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours perſwaſion he Communicated with them to ſave a priſoners life, which was given him on that condition, and yet was chaſtiſed by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel even for that.) And Ambroſe at Milan alſo diſowned them (as you may read in his life), and when the deed was done, the Chriſtians ſpake ill of Ithacius and Idacius for taking that new and bloody way, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Churches commonly diſowned, but they pretended that they did not cauſe this execution.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Sulpitius tells you, that when this new way of ſeeking to the Emperour, was firſt ſet on foot by Ithacius and his Synodiſts, the Priſcillianiſts quickly got the handle of the ſword; and by a Courtier got even Gratian to be on their ſide againſt the Biſhops.</p>

               <p>But you may ſee here that Bellarmine himſelf ſeemeth to diſown Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſeeking to Magiſtrates to puniſh Hereticks; As if he had forgotten their bloody Inquiſition and Maſſacres.

               <p>But the ſaddeſt inſtance of the miſchief of too much ſerving Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by the ſword, is the caſe of the Papal faction: when Cyril had begun the trade at Alexandria, ſaith Socrates, [Epiſcopus Romanus non aliter atque Alexandrinus quaſi extra ſacerdotis fines egreſſus, ad ſecularem principatum erat jam ante delapſus] (it ſeems Rome had the primacy in a Sanguinary Prelacy;) And, ſaith he, Then Pope Celeſtine firſt took their Churches from the Novations, and compelled their Biſhop Ruricolae to keep their meetings privately in houſes: And though the Biſhops commended them as Orthodox, yet they ſpoiled them of their fortunes, Socrat. l. 7. c. 11. ſo impatient are armed Prelates of any that are not of their mind and way, how honeſt otherwiſe ſoever they acknowledge them.</p>

How many thouſands in Belgia, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Poland, Ireland, &amp;c. And when at firſt they precariouſly got the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to ſerve them voluntarily with the ſword, at laſt they would conſtrain them to it, as their duty; and ſuch a duty as they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form on pain of loſing their dominions: For the Pope having firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated them, next may give away their dominions to others, as is fully expreſſed, Concil.

If I do, let this be the cloſe, that God knoweth how many Great men and Commanders are now in Hell, for the perſecutions and murders, which Church men have thus drawn them to.</p>
               <p>2. Laſtly, moſt certain this courſe (of forcing all men into the Church and to the Sacrament by priſon and ſword) will keep up perpetual diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Churches. The more religious ſort of people will ſtill in all ages be flying away from ſuch Churches as from a Peſt-houſe, or infected place, or ruinous houſe that's ready to fall. The unexperienced Prelates think that it is but ſome few preachers that teach the people ſuch ſtrict opinions, and if thoſe were cut off all would be well: But their ignorance is the Churches plague and their own. 1. There is ſomewhat in Scripture that perſwadeth them that God hateth all the workers of iniquity; and that holineſs and unholineſs are as Light and Darkneſs, and that he that nameth the name of Chriſt muſt depart from iniquity, and that the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and ſcandalous muſt be avoided and aſhamed, and hereticks after a firſt and ſecond admonition, and that he that bids them Good ſpeed is partaker of their evil deeds, and that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, and therefore the wicked muſt be caſt out, and muſt be to us (if obſtinate after admonition) as Heathens and Publicans; Theſe are not the words of phanaticks but of Chriſt. 2. There is ſomething in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61252:185"/>
newborn ſoul which is contrary to wickedneſs, and which inclineth men to an enmity with the Serpents ſeed as ſuch, though a love to them as men that are yet capable of grace and which diſpoſeth men to obey all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid words of Chriſt. 3. And there is in the people more than in the Paſtors, ſome remnants of ignorance, which makes them more liable to ſtretch theſe words of Chriſt too far, and by miſtake to run further from wicked men than God would have them. But when they ſee the Wilderneſs called the Garden of God, and the wicked not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Church, but forced into it by the Sword, and ſo the Church to contain the world, and to be as vicious as Infidels; (what ever men ſhould do,) I dare confidently prophecy what they will do; All the Prelates in the world, no nor all the godly that preach, will never prevent it, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age will bring forth new diviſions, and the ſtricter ſort will be ſtill flying from ſuch Churches as theſe, to worſhip God in purer ſocieties; And if you are angry with the Scriptures, and with the Papiſts, keep them from their knowledge, you muſt do ſo alſo by the Creed, Lords Prayer and ten Commandments, or elſe the very Article of [the Communion of Saints] and the praying [Thy Name be hallowed, thy Kingdome come, thy Will be done in earth as it is heaven] with the precepts of Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will have the ſame kind of operation.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But in the Church of </hi>  Rome, <hi>there is unity and concord, and no Sects, and therefore that ſheweth us what the ſword may do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. But the Church of Rome is it ſelf but a fraction, divided from the reſt of the Church. Do they not differ ſufficiently from the Greeks, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Abaſſines, &amp;c. Did they not drive from them Germany, Belgia and the reſt of the Proteſtants? Yea, even by their cruelty, ſo far was cruelty from preventing it? The Anabaptiſts, and many other Sects may be at one among themſelves, and yet not at one with any others.</p>
               <p>2. Are you willing of a concord in your Churches upon the ſame terms as the Church of Rome hath it? What, with the ſame ignorance and ungodlineſs; Locking up the Scriptures, in Latin Prayers and Maſſes, and a Catholick Tyrant or Uſurper, and all this procured by the blood of ſo many hundred thouſands, and kept up by the ſame Love-killing means? would you indeed have ſuch a concord? Et cum ſolitudinem facitis, pacem vocabitis, as Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>3. But indeed the Church of Rome hath one other means for concord which you want; and that is various houſes and orders of Monaſticks. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and prophaneſs will ſerve for the concord of the worſt; but there will be ſtill ſome who believe and forethink of a life to come, and therefore will be religious; and for theſe when they cannot have communion with the wicked, this politickly holy Church hath provided this expedient: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that will be Religiouſer than the reſt, hath a hive or ſociety to fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But men will not ſo eaſily leave a good way when a King ſhall leave it; Becauſe they that are in a good way are often Good men, and true to God, and hold Truth and Goodneſs faſter than bad Men hold Error and Evil. 2.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> An Anſwer to the Objections. 1. No Biſhops no King. 2. And of the Rebellions and Seditions of thoſe, that have been againſt Biſhops.</head>
               <p>I Come not for your own ſake to meddle with ſuch matters as theſe, but you put a neceſſity on us, by making us odious by ſuch pretences. 1. To the firſt I anſwer, 1. Were not all the very Heathen Emperors heretofore, and are not all the Heathen Kings ſtill, Kings, and as great as others, without Biſhops? And may not Chriſtian Kings much more? 2. If the Presbyterians had ſaid, no Presbyters, no King, you would have taken it for treaſonable; as if they had threatned that the King ſhall not be King, unleſs they may have their way, and ſhall not the King be King unleſs you may be Biſhops? 3. What is in the nature of the thing to warrant this aſſertion? Presbyterians own every text and Article for Monarchy as the Prelatiſts do, even as ever any Chriſtian Council or Confeſſion aſſerted, as far as we can learn. They plead no other divine right for their offices, than our Prelates do. And (ſave what ſome of them have held by the Magiſtrates own gift) they pretend to no power over any mans body or purſe. Many of them and the Independants, meddle no further than their own Congregations. What is in all this againſt Kings? That an Ariſtocratical Church Government may not live quietly under Monarchy, or a Monarchial Church Government under Ariſtocracy, is an aſſerted fiction, without all proof. Otherwiſe by the ſame reaſon you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Venice, Holland and all ſuch Governments, that Prelacy may not be endured under them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61252:186"/>4. But what if it were all as true as it is falſe? What is it to thoſe Nonconformiſts that craved Biſhop Uſhers Epiſcopacy? The queſtion is but whether a humble Biſhop in a Pariſh or Market Town, without any Lordſhip or great revenews, or intereſt in the ſword, may not live as ſafely and obediently under Kings, as our Lord Biſhops? Yea in very deed moſt of the Independant Churches themſelves have a kind of Epiſcopacy, whether they own the name or not: For uſually one ſingle Paſtor hath as much as a Negative voice in the management of all diſciplinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>II. But the anſwer to the ſecond will fuller anſwer this. 1. Do you not know that where Prelacy is at the higheſt, there Kings and Emperours have been at the loweſt? Do you not know how the Papal Prelacy at the preſent uſurpeth one part of their Government: and is ready to take away the other when they can, when ever Kings diſpleaſe them? Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be ſaid to hide this by him that readeth, but the two forenamed Councils (Later. &amp; Rom. ſub Gregor. 7.) Did Prelacy preſerve thoſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Eaſt that ſuffered by it? Doth it now preſerve the Emperour of Moſcovy, where the Patriarks intereſt is pretended in the rebellion? Did it preſerve Frederick, and the two Henries of Germany? or Henry 3. and 4th. of France? Did it preſerve the Kings of England, Will. 2. Hen. 2. and 3. John, &amp;c. from their wars and troubles? Did it preſerve the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Navar to the right Lord? What ſhould, I ſay, more of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the copious inſtances of H. Fowlis? and after that volume of W. Prin. of the Engliſh Prelates Treaſons? Read it and judge.</p>
               <p>2. What people more peaceable and obedient to their ſuperiors, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than the Helvetian Miniſters have been? who yet have no ſuch thing as Biſhops.</p>
               <p>3. Dr. Pet. Moulin Junior, one of your ſelves in his anſwer to Philanax Angl. hath ſaid enough to confute moſt of the Calumnies againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in this point.</p>
               <p>4. Who knoweth not, that even in the ancient Churches, and that when Epiſcopacy was thriving apace, yea and by and among the Biſhops themſelves, yea ſome that were good men and are now Sainted, yet tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, ſeditions, rebellions, and contentions troubled the Churches, and the Emperours and Magiſtrates, as frequently as of later times, which I mention not to abate the honour of thoſe better Chriſtians, but 1. To ſhew you, that all this was done under Prelacy, and therefore it was not want of Prelacy, or averſneſs to it that is to be taken for the cauſe. 2. That theſe diſtempers were found in the beſt times, and among the pureſt Churches, and therefore are not to be now thought ſtrange, or taken for a mark of a bad religion.</p>
               <p>I will not repeate what I ſaid but even now of the horrid tumults and blood ſhed at Alexandria, their cruel Murdering of Hypatia, and the inſurrection and ſedition even of the Holy Monks, and Saint Cyrils Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the executed actor of violence on the Governour.</p>

               <p>Even at the Election of Chryſoſtome Theophilus went about by all means to diſcredit him, and to preferr to the place one Iſidore a Prieſt of his own Church.

Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore being careful of his buſineſs, went diligently about this feat, got him to Rome, and hearkeneth after the Victory: But his fetch was not long ere it was found out; for his Reader, that accompanyed him ſtole away his Letters. Whereupon Iſidore being afraid to be taken with the manner, took his heeles in all haſt to Alexandria: This was it that made Theophilus labour ſo carneſtly for Iſidore: But all that were of the Emperours Court preferred John to the Biſhopprick: And afterwards when as many charged Theophilus with heynous crimes, and preſented to the Biſhops (then preſent) libells and Articles againſt him, ſome for this thing and ſome for that; Eutropius one of the Emporours Chamber having gotten the Articles and Inditements, ſhewed them to Theophilus, bad him chooſe whether he would Create John Biſhop, or ſtand at the Barr and anſwer to the Crimes that were laid to his charge. Theophilus was ſo afraid with this that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he conſented to the inſtalling of John].</q>

               <p>What would have been ſaid of one of us now, if we had not only complyed with a victorious Tyrant, but alſo ſo jugled with preſents and double Letters before hand. I did my ſelf diſowne Oliver Cromwel open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his death; and yet becauſe after twelve years poſſeſſion of the Uſurpers, I did but Dedicate two Bookes to his Son Richard, whom I never ſaw nor heard from, only to encourage him to befriend truth and unity againſt Papiſts and Sectaries, who then threatened all, (and this when the Royaliſts themſelves gave out that he was Really for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the King) this is made the odious Crime in me, as a thing deſerving greateſt Infamy.</p>

When the People of his Church had found out Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius their baniſhed Biſhop, they earneſtly perſwaded him to return, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Emperors Edict, and not to ſuffer his flock to be left to the Wolves (which were the Biſhops ſet over them by the Emperour). And is not this more than the people are now condemned for, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear the Miniſters privately?</p>
               <p>Cap. 14. When the Emperors Arrian Biſhop was ſet over them, not one of all the People rich or poor, ſervant or labourer, husbandman or Artificer, man or woman, young or old, would come as they uſed to the Church, nor come in ſight of the Biſhop, nor ſpeak with him: But though he lived very modeſtly, he came to the Church (place) alone. They would not bathe with him nor bathe in the ſame water, but throw it firſt into the Channel; when he left the City (this was Eunomius). Do our hearers deal as harsſhly as this?</p>
               <p>Afterward when Lucius was ſet over them, the Children in the ſtreets did burn their ball, becauſe his Aſſes feet had touched it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61252:188"/>Id. ib. c. 16. When the Biſhop of Edeſſa was removed and another ſet over them, the people frequented private meetings in the Suburbs. And when the Emperour commanded his Prefect, Modeſtus, to take Souldiers and diſturb them, and drive them away, the women ran with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hoping to die with them. And Eulogius the Presbyter asked, Was the Emperour made Prieſt when he was made Emperour?</p>
               <p>And how the Presbiters and People of Antioch continued their meeting whether the Emperour would or not, though he diſturbed them by Soldiers.</p>
               <p>Theodor c. 17. Baſils anſwer to the Prefect, when he offered him the Emperours favour, was, that Children were to be ſo talk'd to, but Men bread up in divine ſtudies, would ſuffer any death rather than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one ſyllable of divine Truth to be blemiſhed. Quod autem ad Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris amicitiam, &amp;c. But as for the Emperors friendſhip I much value it (ſaith he) joyned with godlineſs, but if it want that, I ſay, it is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In one of us this anſwer would have been enough to make us ſeem as bad as it made Baſil eſteemed good.</p>
               <p>Id. 11. c. 19. When the forenamed Lucius was made Biſhop of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and Peter their Biſhop put out, the People would come to the Church place, though he perſecuted them as he had done the other, &amp; omnes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter ceperunt Lucium convitiis lacer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re, they all began to tear Lucius with revilings, becauſe he perſecuted the Monks of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Id. l. c. 38. Audas a Biſhop in Perſia demoliſhed their Temple (or Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum) by violence: For which the Emperour of Perſia killed him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the Chriſtian Churches.</p>
               <p>Id. l. 4. c. 21. When Moſes was deſired by Queen Mavia to be her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop among the Saracens, he would not let Lucius ordain him, becauſe he had perſecuted good men, But ſaid to him (Quis impius non tua cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſâ conventus Eccleſiaſticos petulanter inſectatus eſt? Quis e laudatorum viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum numero non parte exulavit? Quam immanitatem barbaram, malefici abs te in dies ſingulos admiſſa non ſuperarunt?) Do Nonconformiſts ſpeak more harſhly to our Biſhops?</p>
               <p>Theodoret himſelf frequently calleth Julian a Tyrant. cap. 22. The Heathens kept their Feaſts openly; Telis autem Apoſtolicae doctrinae propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natoribus, tyrannus iſte ſe hoſtem praebuit. And when he was dead, they openly rejoyced at his death.</p>
               <p>Id. cap. 30. l. 4. With what bold language doth Izaak tell Valens of his fighting againſt God, and caſting out his Miniſters, and Gods fighting againſt him and what he would be ſure to meet with at the end, if he kicked againſt the pricks.</p>
               <p>Lib. 5. c. 17. The Chriſtian people of Theſſalonica roſe, and killed ſome of Theodoſius his Officers, which provoked him by his Souldiers to kill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand of them, for which Ambroſe brought him to do open pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nane.</p>
               <p>To mention all the blood ſhed at Rome (as at Damaſcus election and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61252:189"/>
elſe) and Conſtantinople, and Alexandria would be tedious, even that which was ſhed on the account of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Lucius Calaritanus was a pious Biſhop; but ſo hot for ſeparation from thoſe that had been Arrians, that he is numbered for it with the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, though an orthodox Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The Novatians were Epiſcopal, and ſo were the Donatiſts, and yet how have they been judged of for their Schiſm I need not tell: Apollinarius father and ſon, Paulus Samoſatenus, Neſtorius, Dioſcorus, Euſebius, Nicomed, Theodorus Mopſueſt, and how many more Biſhops have been Arch-hereticks and the cauſe of tumults and diſſenſions. The very reading over the acts of the General Councils, eſpecialy Eph. 1. and 2. &amp; Calced. is tremendous. It was to be a Biſhop, that Maximus made ſo peſtilent a ſtir at Conſtantinople and Alexandria againſt Gregory Theolog. Yea they tell us themſelves, that it was becauſe he could not be a Biſhop that Aerius ſpake againſt Biſhops, ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent a thing hath the deſire of ſuch Biſhopricks been.</p>
               <p>Theodotus the Biſhop would not ſo much as joyn in Prayer with Baſil morning or evening, becauſe he had but communicated with Biſhop Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius upon his fair profeſſions, Baſil. Epiſt. 43. Admir: ad Terentium Comit.</p>
               <p>The contention between ſuch excellent perſons as Euſebius Caeſar while Biſhop, and Baſil: while Presbyter, was very ſad and ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>The contention between Baſil and Euthemius about the extent of their Dioceſs was no leſs.</p>
               <p>The People of Caeſarea would have torn in peices, Euſebius the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Emperors own Unkle, for Baſils ſake, if he had not hindred them.</p>
               <p>The Church of Neo-Caeſarea wrangled with Baſil for his Pſalmodie, and even avoided him as if he had been an Heretick, ſee Baſils Epiſt. ad mer. 4. to Julian, what language he there ufeth to the Emperour: Not that I judge him, but wiſh you to judge equally of the actions of thoſe times and ours. See Baſil Ep. 82. Theodor. l. 5 c. 19.</p>
               <p>The Antiochians for a Tax under Theodoſius the great, did tumultuate and kill the Magiſtrates, and deſtroyed the Statue of Placilla the good Empreſs.</p>
               <p>In the Weſt good Ambroſe at Milan (was not ſilenced as we are, but) by an Orthodox Emperour deſired and commanded to deliver the Arrians poſſeſſion but of one Church: and he refuſed to do it, and to forſake that Church (or Temple) or deliver the Veſſels till they ſhould be taken by force. Vit. Ambroſ. per Baron. p. 6. whereas we all left our Churches at a word. Nay though he would not reſiſt the Emperour, he would rather die than deliver up the Church.</p>
               <p>When he was celebrating Gods Worſhip he was fain to break off, to reſcue an Arrian Prieſt out of the hands of the Orthodox people, who had laid hold on him: For which multitudes were laid in priſon and Irons, and accuſed of Sedition, and great Calamity followed to the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61252:189"/>
Church, and this from Valentinian an Orthodox Emperour.</p>
               <p>Ambroſe ſaith when he refuſed to deliver up the Temple, E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>qua ſunt Divina Imperatoriae poteſtati non eſſe ſubjecta (If Baronius ſay true); but mine I ſhall yield to him]. But we hold that even Temples (as well as Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops) though dedicated to God, are under the Civil power of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>
               <p>When Ambroſe was deſired but to quiet the people, he anſwered It is in my power not to ſtir them up; but it is God that muſt quiet them] So great was his intereſt in the people that the Emperour ſaid he was a Tyrant, and that the people would deliver himſelf bound to him, if Ambroſe did but bid them. Yet had Ambroſe been the man that had gone on his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie to Maximus, and kept him from coming into Italy in purſute of Valentinian which made Ambroſe ſay [Non hoc Maximum dicere quod Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus go ſum Valentiniani: qui ſe meae legationis objectum queritur ad Italiam non potuiſſe pervenire.]</p>
               <p>And becauſe the late revolutions in England are made by ſome Prelates the pretence for the ſilencing of the 1800 Miniſters, of whom one of ten never medled with Warrs, being fallen again on this caſe of Maximus, let it be noted how like he was to Cromwel, ſaving that it was not the Sectaries, but the Biſhops that he ſtudyed to pleaſe and riſe by. When Gratian the Emperour befriended the Priſcillianiſts, Maximus to pleaſe the Biſhops perſecuted them to the death. When Valantinian by Juſtina the Empreſſe meanes did perſecute or trouble Ambroſe for refuſing to deliver a Church to the Arrians, and alſo other Orthodox Biſhops as well as Ambroſe, Maximus gave to Ambroſe and the Biſhops the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of keeping him out of Italy, and letting Valentinian ſcape: Yea, wrote his Letters to Valentinian for the Orthodox Biſhops, telling him how grievous a thing it is to perſecute the Miniſters of God, and when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his father they went for faithful Miniſters. Quae tanta mutatio, ut qui antea ſacerdotes, nunc ſacrilegi judicantur! Iiſdem certe praeceptis, Iiſdem Sacramentis dilatis; Eadem fide credunt, qua antea crediderunt. An put at Venerabilis mihi ſerenitas tua conceptam ſemel in animis religionem quam Deus ipſe conſtituit poſſe evelli? And proceedeth to ſhew what diſorders and contentions muſt needs follow when there be a ſhew of perſecuting Chriſtians and Miniſters] Upon this meſſage of Maximus, Valentinian being afraid of him, the perſecution ceaſed; and Ambroſe muſt be ſent again on the Embaſſage to Maximus to ſtop him: But when as the Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of France and Germany owned him, and Ambroſe would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with thoſe Biſhops (no more than Martin) ſaith he, cum videret me abſtinere ab Epiſcopis qui communicabant ei, vel qui aliquos devios licet a ſide (that is the Preſcillianiſts) ad necem petebant, juſſit me ſine mora re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi. See here that Ambroſe as well as Martin ſeparated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the multitude of Biſhops for owning Maximus, and for ſeeking to the Magiſtrate to draw his ſword againſt the Priſcillianiſts, whom Sulp. Severus calleth Gnoſticks: When as many among us, have by words and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61252:190"/>
writing provoked Rulers to draw the ſword againſt us that differ, in no one point of doctrine from the Articles of the Engliſh Church.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid Maximus and the Biſhops did ſo cloſe that only one Hyginus a Biſhop is mentioned, and Theognoſtus beſides Ambroſe and Martin that reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Maximus, and refuſed Communion with the Synod and Biſhops, and was baniſhed alſo for ſo doing. By which you may ſee, 1. That Biſhops can comply with uſurpers that will be for them as much as Presbyters, 2. And that all is not unwarrantable ſeparation or ſchiſm, which Biſhops call ſo, when theſe three ſhall ſeparate from ſo many.</p>
               <p>And ſaith Baron. in vita Ambroſ. Maximus ut Tyranni nomen vitaret, perinde atque fidei Catholicae tuendae cauſa bellum illud ſuſcepiſſet, in hereticos pugnam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit &amp; Catholicos ſacerdotes quibus valuit honoribus &amp; officiis eſt proſecutus, p. 24. Maximus raiſeth that war for the Orthodox Biſhops to ſave them from the perſecution of their lawful Prince, and ſets himſelf to do them all the honor he could, and to pull down the hereticks.</p>
               <p>And theſe were the Halcionian daies which Ambroſe himſelf declareth and magnifieth, even when Maximus had ſuppreſt the Arrians [En tempus acceptabile! quo non hiemalibus perfidiae caligantis pruinas annus riget, nec altis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, &amp;c. ibid. Reader was not that time more ſtrange than ours? that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe muſt be ſo loyal as to ſave his Prince and Country from a uſurper; and yet ſo pious as to be perſecuted by his Prince, and he and his brethren ſaved by that ſame uſurper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and openly give praiſe to God for the great felicity of the Church which it received by that ſame uſurper whom he ſo reſiſted?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it not pity that things ſhould be ſo ſtrangely carried?</p>
               <p>And that yet you may ſee more into this buſineſs, Paulinus in vit. Ambroſ. p. 40. tells us, that Maximus took juſt a name to himſelf as Cromwel the Protector did. [Maximus Procuratorem ſe reipublicae nomine praefuiſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretur.] He would rule as the Procurator of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Well! But this is not all the Uſurpers that roſe up in thoſe daies. Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius ſoon becometh more terrible than he (who once was but a Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter). And how doth this loyal S. Ambroſe carry it? when he had got of Theodoſius a pardon for all that took part with Maximus, even his Army except two or three, yea and benefits too, yet did not this holy loyal man think it ſinful to write thus to the Tyrant Eugenius, [Epiſtol. l. 2. p. 103. Clementiſſimo Imperatori Eugenio, Ambroſius Epiſcopus; Biſhop Ambroſe to the moſt Clement Emperour Eugenius. And thus concludeth, [In his vero in quibus vos rogari decet, etiam exhibere ſedulitatem poteſtati debitam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſicut &amp; ſcriptum eſt, cui honorem, honorem, cui tributum, tributum: Nam cum privato detulerim corde intimo, quomodo non deferrem Imperatori?] i. e. <q>But in theſe matters where it becometh us to petition you, we muſt alſo give the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence due to power: as it is written, honor to whom honor, tribute to whom tribute: For when I honored you, when you were a private man from the inwards of my heart, how ſhould I not honor you an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?]</q>

               <p>Reader do not only judge of my two Epiſtles to Rich. Cromwell by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61252:190"/>
theſe paſſages, but even of theirs that ſubmitted to Oliver himſelf: and yet Judge of the inferences that are raiſed by our accuſers.</p>
               <p>Should I but recite the words of ſubmiſſion of Biſhops to uſurpers, yea of Gregory the Great and ſuch of the higheſt note, it would be over tedious to the Reader, who I doubt will think that I have been too long in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Hiſtory already.</p>
               <p>2. But this I muſt need add ad homines, 1. That it hath been the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves that have been the grand cauſe of our Church diviſions and ſeparations: what advantage they have given the ſeparatiſts I ſhewed before. I am ſure in the Congregation where I once was teacher, and the Countrey about, nothing that ever came to paſs hath ſo inclined the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to avoid the Prelates, as their own doing, eſpecially the ſilencing and reproaching their ancient teachers whom they knew longer and better than the Prelates did.</p>
               <p>2. That it was a Parliament of Epiſcopals and Eraſtians, and not of Presbyterians, who firſt took up Armes in England againſt the King.</p>
               <p>3. That the General, and chief Officers of the Parliaments firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ſcarce any of them at all Presbyterians, but Epiſcopal by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaving ſome few Independants.</p>
               <p>4. That the Lord Lieutenants of the ſeveral Counties, were almoſt all Epiſcopal, ſave three Independents.</p>
               <p>5. The Major Generals of the ſeveral By-armies in the Counties were almoſt all Epiſcopal.</p>
               <p>6. The Aſſembly of Divines at Weſtminſter were all ſave eight or nine Conformable.</p>
               <p>7. Moſt of the Epiſcopal men of my acquaintance took the Covenant, that could keep their places by it, or at their compoſition.</p>
               <p>8. I knew few of them that took not the engagement it ſelf, againſt King and houſe of Lords, meerly for liberty to travail about their buſineſs, when we that ran a greater hazard by refuſing, never took it; but many were caſt out of their Churches, and their government in the Univerſity Colledges for refuſing it. Theſe and many more ſuch unpleaſant things, I have fully proved elſewhere, being conſtrained by the falſe accuſations of implacable men, to mention that which I had far rather ſilence.</p>
               <p>9. And what hand the Londoners, the Presbyterian Miniſters, and Gentlemen, and people had in bringing in the King was once known and acknowledged.</p>
               <p>And General Monks Colonels and Captains were ſo many of them Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, when they caſt out the Anabaptiſts, from among them in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and marcht into England and reſtored the King, that as I knew divers of them to be ſuch, ſo far as I could learn from others, the chief ſtrength of them were ſuch or ſo inclined.</p>
               <p>10. And though many of the Parliament were ſuppoſed Presbyterians long after, who were Epiſcopal at the raiſing of the Army, yet could not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61252:191"/>
the late King Charles I. be rejected and judged and put to death, till moſt of the Parliament were violently ſecluded and impriſoned by the Army. And as ſoon as they were but called together again, it was they (in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Council of State) that opened the door for the Kings reſtitution.</p>
               <p>But while the matters of the Church of Chriſt, and the deciſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious controverſies, and the liberty of Chriſts Miniſters to preach his Goſpel, muſt be laid upon ſtate revolutions, and where Biſhops that can neither accuſe Chriſts Miniſters of hereſie, ignorance, negligence, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, pride, nor ſcandalous immoralities, ſhall run to the old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and perſwade Kings that theſe men are not for their profit, that they are peſtilent fellows and movers of ſedition among the people, that they prophecy not good of Kings but evil, and that they would ſet up another King, one Jeſus, and therefore are not Caeſars friends, theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious projects may ſilence Miniſters, and proſper, while our ſins are to be puniſhed, and the peoples, contempt of the Goſpel and their ingratitude are to be chaſtiſed. But the wicked ſervant that ſaith, my Lord delayeth his coming, and beateth his fellow ſervants, and eateth and drinketh with the drunken, will ſee that his Lord will come in a day, that he looked not for him, and will cut him a ſunder and give him his portion, with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites (for their dead Image of Religion will not ſave them) there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Matth. 24. 48, 49, 50, 51.</p>

               <p>1. THat it overthroweth the ancient Species of Churches, and ſetteth up another ſort of Churches, in their place; and ſets up one Church of that kind inſtead of many hundreds.</p>
               <p>2. That it overthroweth the ancient office of a Presbyter, by taking away one part of his work (viz. Government) which as much belongeth to him as the reſt: And maketh a new office of ſubject Presbyters, which Cod never made.</p>
               <p>3. That it overthroweth the ancient ſort of fixed Epiſcopacy, (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Itinerants and Arch-biſhops); taking down a thouſand or very many Biſhops, even the Biſhops of particular Churches, and inſtead of them all ſetting up but one over all thoſe Churches; as if all Biſhops were put down, and the Archbiſhops only take all their charges and work upon them.</p>
               <p>4. That it maketh the Diſcipline or Government inſtituted by Chriſt, in the very matter of it to become impoſſible and impracticable, and ſo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61252:191"/>
excludeth it, under pretence that they are the only perſons impowred for it; and they ſet up a kind of ſecular Courts and Government in its ſtead; and ſo are practically Eraſtians.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all with theſe Conſectaries which follow what is already proved.</p>
               <p>Cons. 1. Such Dioceſane principles greatly ſtrengthen the Browniſts cauſe, who deny us to have any Church or Miniſtry of divine inſtitution: as is before ſhewed. And as for them that ſay. [No form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of divine inſtitution]. Anſ. 1. It is well that they are forced to except both the univerſal and the particular Churches, and expound this only of Aſſociations of Churches. 2. It is well that yet they confeſs that the office of Paſtors is of Divine inſtitution; who are made Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by Chriſt. 3. But it is ſcant well that yet they ſubſcribe to the book of Ordination, which aſſerteth the Divine right of three diſtinct orders, if they do not believe it. 4. And theſe alſo too much gratifie the Browniſt, who affirmeth that we have no Churches of Divine inſtitution, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it is no fault to ſeparate, but from a Church of humane invention.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 2. To ſay that no man High or Low is bound in his place and calling to endeavour a Reformation of ſuch a Church-Government, and ſo to juſtifie the neglecters and oppoſers of all ſuch Reformation is to draw upon a mans ſelf the guilt of ſo much pollution, and of the ruin of ſuch a multitude of ſouls, as ſhould make that Conſcience ſmart and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is not ſeared and paſt all feeling.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 3. To ſwear or ſubſcribe, or ſay and declare, that though milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould ſwear to endeavour ſuch a reformation, in their places and callings, by lawful means, there is no obligation lieth on any one of them from that Vow or Oath: So to endeavour it, is—The Lord have Mercy on that Land, City or Soul that is guilty of it—</p>
               <p>Conſ. 4. All carnal intereſt and all carnal reaſon is on the Dioceſanes ſide, and all the luſts of the heart of man, and conſequently all the De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vil can do: Therefore while carnal Chriſtians make a Religion of their luſts and intereſt, and pride, and covetouſneſs, and idleneſs are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, than the fear of God and the love of ſouls, no wonder if the Dioceſane cauſe prevail with ſuch.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 5. A truly ſanctified heart knoweth the nature and worth of Grace, and the nature and weight of the Paſtoral Office, and is devoted to God and the good of ſouls, and contemneth the eaſe and pleaſures of the fleſh and the riches and the honours of this World, and is the beſt argument in the World againſt ſuch Dioceſane Prelacy; and muſt at leaſt be weakened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can ſubſcribe never to endeavour to amend it.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 6. No wonder if the moſt ſerious zealous practical ſort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ordinarily againſt ſuch Dioceſanes Prelacy, when it hath the deſcribed effects and that thoſe among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 7. No wonder if the principal work of ſuch Dioceſanes, be to ſilence faithful preachers and perſecute zealous Chriſtians, where they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61252:192"/>
a cauſe ſo contrary to the intereſt of Godlineſs that all theſe are unreconcilable thereto: Speak not of any other Prelacy.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 8. Take but from ſuch Prelacy the plumes which it hath ſtolen from Magiſtrates and Presbyters, and it will be a naked thing, and ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a name.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 9. If Magiſtrates were not the Prelates Executioners or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not by writs de excommunicato capiendo, &amp;c. ſuch Prelacy would give up as dead, or aweary of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 10. The ill Mixtures of force and ſecular power, corrupteth Church Diſcipline, and depriveth it of its proper nature, uſe and force, maketh it another thing, or undiſcernable.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 11. Though in caſes of neceſſity civil Rulers may truſt Church men with part of their power about religion, it is far better out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that they keep if wholly to themſelves. And let them thunder their excommunications without any power of the Sword.</p>
               <p>Conſ. 12. Such Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops as overthrow not the Churches officers, and diſcipline of Chriſt, muſt be ſubmitted to by all peaceable men, though we cannot prove them as ſuch to be of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>

As for your labour in the work of the Miniſtry, how little it hath been for many years together, it is even a ſhame to mention, ſome of you wholly exempting your ſelves, from this neceſſary burden of their calling, for eaſe and pleaſure: Others ſuppoſing it a task and employment too low and inferiour for them—The reſt for the moſt part, ſlightly or ſeldome bearing it with their ſhoulders, and laying it aſide preſently, as that which concerned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and not themſelves any longer than they liſted; And thus far had been pardonable with men, had care been taken to ſee this work duely performed by the Clergy—But alas there were not wanting of you, who did not only wink at the wilful neglect of their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

And inſtead of ſending forth meet Labourers into the Lords harveſt, fit Paſtors into his flock, you ſent thoſe that were idle Shephards, loving to ſlumber, given to ſleep, altogether like your ſelves, careleſs of the Lords Heritage, either unwilling if able or if willing unable, or neither willing nor able, rightly to divide the word of truth, giving them their portion in due ſeaſon. As for thoſe to whom God had given both ability and will, to preach the word, ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them not the free uſe and exerciſe of their gifts; but forbade them to teach the people as oft as they ſaw it convenient or neceſſary for their Edification. And though you did at firſt commend to them, the way of Catechizing the younger ſort—yet afterwards, I know not upon what grounds or for what reaſon, you ſo far limited and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Miniſter in this pious and profitable practice, that ye did in a manner take away the key of knowledge, or make it uſeleſs for them, ſo that they could not enter in thereby.</q>

And what could be expected from the common people, but blind ignorance, love of pleaſures more than God—when ye their chief Leaders cauſed them to err, not only through your negligence, but alſo by your example.—And I would to God ſome of you had not proved falſe and deceitful to your brethren whom ye perverted from the way of truth and peace, by your own departing from it—continuing faſt friends to the world—ye were carnal your ſelves and walked as men, ſhewing them the way to heaven with hearts and eyes fixed upon earth. For who more immoderate in their care for the things of this life than you? Who more eager in the purſuit of riches and honor, more tenacious in withholding good from the owners thereof, than your ſelves? Who were more ſet upon the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual courſe of enriching above meaſure, and raiſing your families on high? If a dignity or office fell within the Compaſs of your Dioceſs, who was preſently judged of you more worthy to poſſeſs and manage it, than a Son or a Nephew, or a Kin'man, or an Allie, though they were many times altogether uncapable of the honor and truſt to which ye preferred them in the houſe of God, either they wanted ability of parts requiſite thereunto, or had not as yet attained to maturity of years, being not much paſt their nonage, as we have known ſome of them to be, or in all reſpects undeſerving perſons. And yet men of age, and experience, eminent for learning, and piety, muſt ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled before ſuch as theſe, to receive directions, and commands from them, to whom they were able and fit to give the ſame: who through the juſt judgment of the Almighty, have ſince been as much and more ſcorned—than they do now ſcorn others, every way their ſuperiour, but in place.]</q>

               </p>
               <p>Such changes through Gods mercy were not rare, till Prelacy returned. Reader, I cite, the words of this author ſo tediouſly, becauſe many would perſwade thoſe that knew not thoſe times, that none of this was true on either ſide; And becauſe the Author was a very high Prelatiſt, writing openly againſt their adverſaries, 1653.</p>
               <p>VI.

               <p>And p 262. 263. <q>[They have taught me to eſteem the ancient and Catholick Government of Godly Biſhops, as Moderators and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents among the Presbyters in any Dioceſs or Precincts, in its juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and conſtitution for power paternal duty exerciſed, ſuch as was in the perſecuting, pureſt and primitive times.—] Juſt ſuch we offered them in Biſhop Uſhers Model.—p. 263, [I confeſs after the example of the beſt times and judgment of the moſt learned in all Churches, I alwayes wiſhed ſuch moderation on all ſides, that a Primitive Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy (which imported the authority of one grave and worthy perſon, choſen by the conſent, and aſſiſted by the preſence Counſel and ſuffrages of many Presbyters) might have been reſtored or preſerved in this Church; And this not out of any factious deſign, but for thoſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons which prevail with me].</q>

               <p>VII. I muſt not tire the Reader with more ſuch long citations I next wiſh him to ſee Mr. Alesburies Treatiſe of confeſſion, p. 21. 24 28, 104, 105, 169. Where he deſcribeth the ancient diſcipline, and ſheweth from our own Prelates that it is every particular member of the flock that the Paſtor ſhould perſonally know and counſel; And ſee how far we are from this.</p>
               <p>VIII But none of theſe ſpeak of the times that we are now fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: It can hardly be expected that any of their own party ſhould yet dare to ſpeak againſt them: yet in private talk how common is it? But becauſe it will be too tedious to recite the words, I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to peruſe a Book called Icabod, or the five groans of the Church, which in ſharpneſs and high charges upon the Prelates ſince their return, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all that are before cited. And that you may know that he is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Epiſcopal, one of his accuſations of them is for accepting ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into the Church now that were lately againſt conformity: I know the man who is ſaid to be the Author, and know him to be conformable to this time, and in poſſeſſion of a benefice in the Church.</p>
               <p>IX. Let the Reader remember that the diviſion between the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and Non-conformiſts began at Frankford in Queen Maries days, and that Dr. Ri. Coxe was the man than began this ſtir againſt the Engliſh Church there, by his forcible obtruding the Common-Prayer book on them, and that long led that party; And let him read in Caſſander his 20th.

               <p>X. Yea, when the Popiſh Prelacy is deſcribed, it is ſo like to ours that when Dr. Baſtwick and others wrote againſt the Italian Biſhops, ours take it as ſpoken of them. Hear Biſhop Jewl, Serm. on Mat. 9. 37. 38 [But the labourers are few, I ſay, not there are but few Cardinals, few Biſhops few Prieſts, that ſhould be preachers, few Archbiſhops, few Chancellors, few Deans, few Prebendaries, few Vicars, few Pariſh prieſts, few Monks, few Fryers; For the number of theſe is almoſt infinite—And p 198. And what ſhall I ſpeak of Biſhops? Their cloven Mitre ſignifieth perfect knowledge of the old and new Teſtament; Their Croſiar ſtaff ſignifieth diligence in attending the flock of Chriſt.

ſhews are not enough to fetch in the Lords harveſt: They are garments more meet for Players than for good labourers—whatſoever apparel they have on unleſs they will fall to work Chriſt will not know them for Labourers.—Pag. 144. The Chriſtians in old time, when they lived under Tyrants, and were daily put to moſt ſhameful deaths, and were hated and deſpiſed of all the world, yet never lacked Miniſters to inſtruct them. It is therefore moſt lamentable that Chriſtians living under a Chriſtian Prince, in the peace and liberty of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould lack Learned Miniſters to teach them, and inſtruct them in the word of God: This is the greateſt plague that God doth ſend on any people.</p>
               <p>To which, I add on the by, that if any ſay, we would labour if the Biſhops would give us leave.] Though the charge againſt them thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated is grievous (and it were better for that man that offendeth one of Chriſts little ones, much more that hindereth multitudes from their duty in ſeeking mens ſalvation, that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were caſt into the depths of the Sea) yet that this will not excuſe men from the preaching of the Goſpel to the utmoſt of their power, ſee Biſhop Bilſon himſelf Aſſerting, viz. that ſilenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters ſhould not therefore give over preaching, in his Chriſtian ſubject.</p>
               <p>XI. Yea, read but Caeſars deſcription of the Heathen Druides, and tell us, whether their Character agree not better with the Prelacy which hath prevailed in the Churches theſe ſeven hundred years at leaſt, than Chriſts Character in the Scripture, ſave onely that it is Chriſtianty which they profeſs. Caeſar Comment. lib. 6. p. 72 [In omni Gallia, &amp;c. <q>In all <hi>France</hi> there are two ſorts of men in ſome number and honour, (for the common people are accounted almoſt but as ſervants, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dare do nothing, nor are uſed in any conſultations, moſt of then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed with debts, or the greatneſs of tributes, or the injuries of the more powerful, do give themſelves in ſervitude to the nobles, who have all that power over them as Lords over their ſervants: And of theſe two ſorts, one are Druides, the other Knights. The former are intereſted in Divine affaires, they procure publick and private ſacrifices; they interpret Religions: To theſe flock abundance of young men for diſcipline; and they are with them in great honour: For they determine of almoſt all controverſies private and publick; And if any crime be committed, if mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be done, if there be any controverſies of inheritanc or bounds, theſe men determine them, and do award rewards and puniſhments. If any private perſon or the people ſtand not to their award (<hi>or decree</hi>) they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them the ſacrifices. This is with them the moſt grievous puniſhment. Thoſe that are thus interdicted are accounted in the number of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wicked: All men depart from them, and fly from their preſence and their ſpeech, leſt they get any hurt by the contagion; nor is any Right (or Law) afforded them when they ſeek it, nor any honour done them. And
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61252:196"/>
over all theſe Druides there is one in chief, who hath the higheſt authority among them. When he is dead, if any one of the reſt excel in worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſucceedeth: But if there be many equal, he is choſen by the ſuff age of the Druides: And ſometimes they contend for the principality by Arms. At a certain time of the year in the borders of the Carnuli (<hi>Chartres</hi>) which is counted the middle of all <hi>France,</hi> they have a Conſeſs (<hi>or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>) in a conſecrated place; Hither come all that have controverſies from all parts, and obey their judgments and decrees. It is thought that this Diſcipline was found in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and there tranſlated into <hi>France.</hi> And now they that more diligently would know that buſineſs, for the moſt part go thither to learn it. The Druides uſe not to go to the Wars, nor do they pay tribute with the reſt. They have freedome from warfare, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of all things: Being excited by ſo great rewards, many flock to this diſcipline of their own accord, and many are ſent by their parents and kindred. They are reported to learn there abundance of Verſes: Therefore ſome continue at learning twenty years; And they think it not lawful to commit them to writeing; for in other publick matters and private accounts, for the moſt part they uſe the Greek Letters. It ſeemeth to me that they do this for two cauſes: becauſe they would not have their diſcipline (or learning) made common (<hi>or brought to the Vulgar</hi>) nor thoſe that learn it, neglect their memories by truſting to writings; which befalls the moſt, who by the help of writings, remit both their diligence in learning and their memory, This eſpecially they perſwade that ſouls die not, but after death paſs from ſome to others: And by this they think that men are chiefly excited to virtue, neglecting the fear of death. Many things alſo they diſpute and deliver to youth about the Stars, and their motion, of the magnitude of the world, and of the earth, of the nature of things, of the force and power of the immortal Gods.]</q> So far Caeſar, which I repeated as offering it to conſideration, whether the foreſaid Prelacy for Grandure be not liker to theſe Druides, than to chriſts Miniſters who muſt be the ſervants of all? And yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not far more negligent in the exerciſe of diſcipline? And whether this Diſcipline, which ſhameth ſin; by thus diſtinguiſhing the Godly and upright from the ungodly and wicked, be not of the very light of nature, and round much in Brittain before Chriſtianity, and therefore ſhould not be hated and baniſhed by Chriſtian Biſhops, who pretend that their office is inſtituted for that very uſe and end.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> The Ordination lately exerciſed by the Presbyteries in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is valid: <hi>Ergo</hi> Reordination unneceſſary.</head>
               <p>THat valid ordination is not to be repeated, is agreed on by Proteſtants and Papiſts: It is one of the ancient Canons called the Apoſtles, Can. 67. [Siquis Epiſcopus aut Presbyter aut Diaconus ſecundam ab a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquo ordinationem acceperit, deponitor, tam ipſe, quam qui ipſum ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit.</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. The way of Ordination which was valid in the Primitive Church is valid now.</p>
               <p>But the way of Ordination by meer Presbyters was valid in the Primitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church: Ergo it is valid now.</p>
               <p>The Major needs no proof, at leaſt to the point in hand.</p>
               <p>The Minor, I prove.</p>
               <p>1. From Hieromes frequently cited words in his Epiſtle to Evagrius, where he tells us, that the Presbyters of Alexandria from the daies of Mark till Heraclas and Dionyſius made or ordained their own Biſhops. Having ſhewed that Biſhops and Presbyters were of one office, he addeth. [Qwa autem poſtea unus elecius eſt, qui caeteris praeponeretur, in ſchiſmatis remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um factum eſt, ne unuſquiſque ad ſe trabens Chriſti eccleſiam rumperet: Nam &amp; Alexandria à Marco Evangeliſta uſque ad Heraclam &amp; Dionyſium Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos, Presbyteri ſemper unum exſe electum, in excelſori gradu collecatum Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum nominabant: Quomodo ſi exercitus Imperater in faciat: aut Diaconie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt exſe quem induſtrium noverint, &amp; Archidiaconum vocent.] Where note, 1. That Hierome undertaking to ſhew how Biſhops were made at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alexandria, mentioneth no other making of them but this by the Presbyters:</p>
               <p>2. That [Presbyters made Biſhops] is brought by Hierome as an Argument to prove the Identity firſt, and nearneſs after of their power.</p>
               <p>3. That he aſcribeth to the Presbyters the Election, the placing of him in a higher degree and the naming of him a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>4. And that he diſtinguiſheth the Presbyters making of a Biſhop thus anciently, from that which followed Heraclas and Dionyſius, which was by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal ordination or conſecration. Which obſervations are ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all their objections that will perſwade men that Hierome ſpeaketh but of Election.</p>
               <p>2. This teſtimony is ſeconded by a more full one of Eutychius Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark of Alexandria, who out of the Records and Tradition of that Church,

               <p>Here you ſee in the moſt full expreſſions that the Presbyters Election, impoſition of hands and Benediction created their Biſhop or Patriark; and alſo choſe and made or ordained another Presbyter in his roome, and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained both Presbyters and Biſhops.</p>

               <p>Segenius a Presbyter was Abbot of Hy (cap. 5.) when this was done And (cap. 4.) it appears that this was their ordinary cuſtome, though in reſpect to the Churches that were in the Empire, it be ſaid to be, more inuſitato, that Presbyters did Govern Biſhops: but none queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the validity of their ordinations.

any ſay, It is only Biſhops that Formilian ſpeakes of; I anſwer, 1. He had a little before uſed the word (Seniores) (the ſame in ſenſe with Majores natu here) as diſtinct from (Praepoſiti) to ſignifie either all Paſtors in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, or Presbyters in ſpecial. 2. When he ſpeakes of (Majores natu) in general, they that will limit it to Biſhops, muſt prove it ſo limited; and not barely affirme it. 3. The conjunct acts of the office diſprove that: It was the ſame men that had the power of baptizing.</p>
               <p>8. The great Council of Nice (the moſt reverend Authority next to the holy Scripture) decreed thus concerning the Presbyters ordained by Melitius at Alexandria and in Egypt [Hi autem qui Dei gratiâ &amp; noſtris precibus adjuti, ad nullum Schiſma deflexiſſe comperti ſint, ſed ſe intra Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae &amp; Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae fines ab erroris labe vacuos continuerint, authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem habeant tum miniſtros ordinandi, tum eos que clero digni fuerint nominandi, tum denique omnia ex lege &amp; inſtituto Eccleſiaſtico libere exequendi.] If any ſay that the meaning is that theſe Presbyters ſhall ordain and Govern with the Biſhops but not withoutthem, I am of his mind, that this muſt needs be the meaning of theſe words; or elſe they could not be conſonant with the Church Canons: But this ſheweth that ordination belongeth to the Presbyters office, and conſequently that it is no nullity (though an irregulrity as to the Canons) when it is done by them alone Socrat. lib. 5. 6. cap. 6.</p>
               <p>9. It is the title of the twelfth Canon Concil. An cyrani [Quod non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet Chorepiſcopos ordinare niſi in agris &amp; villulis] Now either theſe Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi were of the order of Biſhops or not; If they were, then it further appeareth how ſmall the Churches were in the beginning that had Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, even ſuch as had but Vnum Altare, as Ignatius ſaith; when even in the Countrey Villages they had Biſhops as well as in Cities; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Chriſtians were but thinly ſcattered among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But if they were not Biſhops, then it is apparent that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did then ordain without Biſhops, and their ordination was valid. And the Vafrities of the Prelates is diſingenious in this that when they are pleading for Dioceſan Churches, as containing many fixed Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then they eagerly plead that the Chorepiſcopi were of the order of Presbyters: But when they plead againſt Presbyters ordination, they would prove them Biſhops. Read &amp; Can. 10. Concilii Antiocheni.</p>
               <p>10. Even in the daies of ignorance and Roman Uſurpation, Bonifacius Mogunt. alias Wilfred, Epiſt. 130 (Auct. Bib. Pat.

               <p>11. Of old it was the Cuſtom of the Church that Presbyters joyn with the Biſhops in Ordination. Concil. Carth. c. 3. All the Presbyters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent muſt impoſe their hands on the head of the Presbyter to be ordained with the Biſhop. Which fully ſheweth, that it is an act belonging to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and therefore not null when done by them alone, in certain caſes: and that it was but for order ſake, that they were not to do it without a Biſhop, who was then the Ruler of the Presbyters in that and other Actions.</p>
               <p>And its worth noting, That ib. Can. 4. The Biſhop alone without any<note place="margin">See Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleets I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. p. 379. &amp;c.</note> Presbyters was to lay hands on a Deacon (though not on a Presbyter) Becauſe he was ordained non ad ſacerdotium ſed ad miniſterium, not to the Prieſthood but to a Miniſtery or ſervice, which plainly intimateth what Arch-Biſhop Uſher ſaid to me, that Ad Ordinem pertinet ordinare (quamvis ad Gradum Epiſcopalem ordinationes regere.) The Prieſthood containeth a power to ordain Prieſts; but the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction as ſuch ſufficeth to ordain a Deacon: Or that the Biſhop ordaineth Presbyters, as he is a Presbyter (his Prelacy giving him the government of the action) but he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth Deacons as a Ruler only.</p>
               <p>Arg. II. Ordination by Biſhops ſuch as were in Scripture time is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid (and lawful). But the Ordinations in England now queſtioned, were performed by Biſhops, ſuch as were in Scripture times, Ergo the late ordinations in England (now queſtionedare valid and lawful.</p>
               <p>The Major ſpeaking de nomine &amp; officio is granted by all. The Minor I prove thus. 1. The Ordinations in England now queſtioned were (many or moſt) performed by the cheif particular Paſtors of City Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (together with their Colleagues or fellow Presbyters) that had Presbyters under them. But the Cheif particular Paſtors of City Churches having Presbyters under them, were ſuch Biſhops as were in Scripture times: Ergo, the Ordinations in England now queſtioned were performed by Biſhops ſuch as were in Scripture times.</p>
               <p>I muſt firſt here explain what I mean by [a particular Paſtor] as in an Army or Navy a General Officer, that taketh up the General care of all is diſtinct from the inferiour, particular Captains, that take a particular care of every Souldier or perſon under their command; ſo in the Church in Scripture times there were 1. General Officers, that took care of many Churches (viz. a general care.) And 2. perticular Biſhops and Presbyters that were fixed in every City or perticular Church, that took a perticular care of every Soul in that Church. It is only theſe laſt that I ſpeak of, that were
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61252:199"/>
Biſhops infimi gradûs; not ſuch as the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; but ſuch as are mentioned Acts 14. 23. and Acts 20. 28. Tit. 1. 5. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for the Major it is notoriouſly known, 1. That ordinarily ſome of our Ordainers were City Paſtors. 2. That they had Presbyters under them; viz. one or more Curates, that adminiſtred there with them, or in Oratorics called Chappels in the Pariſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is Oppidum, and our Boroughs and Towns Corporate are ſuch Cities as are ſignified by that word: And there are few of theſe but have more Presbyters than one, of whom one is the Cheif, and the reſt rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. Beſides, that one was oft-times Preſident of the Aſſembly choſen by the reſt. For inſtance (if I had ever medled in Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as I did not). 1. I was my ſelf a Paſtor of a Church in a City or Burough. 2. I had two or three Presbyters with me, that were ruled by me: ſo that I was ſtatedly their Chief: I was ſtatedly choſen by the neighbourhood aſſociated Paſtors to be their Moderatour (which was ſuch a power as made Biſhops at Alexandria before the Nicene Council.)</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch were Biſhops (ſuch as were in Scripture-times) I prove 1. By the Confeſſion of the Opponents: Doctor Hammond and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers maintain, that there were no ſubject Presbyters inſtituted in Scripture times; and conſequently that a Biſhop was but the ſingle Paſtour of a ſingle ongregation, having not ſo much as one Presbyter under him, but one or more Deacons (which granteth us more than now I plead for:) and that afterwards when Believers were encreaſed, he aſſumed Presbyters in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem curae: So that our Biſhops which I plead for are of the ſtature of thoſe after Scripture times in the Doctors ſence. Defacto this is granted.</p>
               <p>2. The Biſhops in Scripture times were ordained in every City and in every Church, Tit. 1, 5. and Acts 13. 23. So are ours. They had the particular Epiſcopacy over-ſight rule and teaching of all the Flock committed to them, Acts 20. 28. (and if the Angel of the Church of Epheſus were one cheif, he was but one of theſe, and over theſe in the ſame Church and charge). And ſo have our Parochial Paſtours; theſe very words, Acts 20. 28. being read and applyed to them in their ordination. They had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven committed to them, and ſo have ours. If it be ſaid, that theſe are but things common to the Biſhop with the Presbyter: 1. What then is proper to a Biſhop? To ſay [Ordination] is but to beg the queſtion: And Ordination it ſelf is not proper in the ſenſe of our own Church, that requireth that Ordination be performed as well by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the Presbyters, as of the Biſhop. 2. They uſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make the governing or ſuperiority over many Presbyters to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe to whom the deſcription of Biſhops in Scripture belongeth are truly and properly Biſhops. But the Deſcription of Biſhops in Scripture agreeth (at leaſt) to the chief particular Paſtors of City Churches, having Presbyters under them; Ergo, ſuch are truly and properly Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The Minor (which only needeth proof) is proved by an induction
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61252:199"/>
of the ſeveral Texts containing ſuch deſcriptions, as Acts 20. and 13. 23. 1 Tim. 3. and 5. 17. Tit. 1. 5. &amp;c. 1 Theſ. 5. 12. Hebr. 13. 7. 17, 24. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. and the reſt.</p>
               <p>4. If our Parochial Churches or at leaſt our City Churches (thoſe in each Town Corporate and Borough) be true Churches, then the cheif particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of them are true Biſhops, but they are true Churches; Ergo.</p>
               <p>Still note, 1. That I ſpeak of Churches as governed Societies in ſenſu Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litico; and not as a Company of private Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>2. That I ſpeak only of particular Paſtors, or Biſhops infimi gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, and not of Arch-Biſhops, and General Paſtors. And therefore it they ſay It is not the Presbyters but the Dioceſane, that is the cheif Paſtor of your Pariſh Church: I anſwer, there is none above the Reſident or incumbent Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that take the particular charge and overſight: The Biſhop takes but the general charge, as a general Officer in an Army. If they do indeed take the particular Paſtoral charge of every Soul, which belongs to the Biſhops infimi gradus, then woe to that man that voluntary takes ſuch a charge upon him, and hath ſuch a charge to anſwer for before the Lord. If they ſay that the Presbyters have the particular charge for teaching and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Biſhops for ruling. I anſwer, 1. It is Government that we are ſpeaking of, if they are Biſhops infimi gradus, then there are no Biſhops or Governours under them. And if ſo, then it is they that muſt perform and anſwer for Government of every particular Soul. And then woe to them. 2. Governing and teaching are acts of the ſame Office by Chriſts inſtitution, as appears in 1 Tim. 5: 17. Acts 20. 28. &amp;c. And indeed they are much the ſame thing: For Government in our Church ſenſe is nothing but the explication of Gods Word, and the application of it to particular Caſes: And this is Teaching. Let them that would divide, prove, that Chriſt hath allowed a diviſion. If one man would be the general School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of a whole Dioceſs, only to overſee the particular School-maſters, and give them rules, we might bear with them: But if he will ſay to all the particular Schoolmaſters, you are but to teach, and I only muſt govern all your Scholars, (when governing them is neceſſarily the act of him that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, conjunct with teaching, this man would need no words for the manifeſtation of the vanity of his ambition. The ſame I may ſay of the Maſters of every Science, whoſe government is ſuch as our Church Government is, not Imperial but Doctoral: yea of the Army or the Navy where the government is moſt imperial.</p>
               <p>Now for the Argument. 1. The conſequence of the Major is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable: becauſe every ſuch Society is eſſentially conſtituted of the Ruling and Ruled parts, as every Common-wealth of the pars imperans and the pars ſubdita: So every organized Church of the Paſtor and the Flock.</p>
               <p>2. And for the Minor, if they denyed both our Pariſh Churches, and our City Churches (that is thoſe in Towns Corporate to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they then confeſs the ſhame, and open the ulcer and leproſic of their way of governing, that to build up one Dioceſane Church, (which is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61252:200"/>
not of Chriſts inſtitution, but deſtructive of his inſtitution) they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and pull down five hundred or a thouſand Pariſh Churches, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny City Churches.</p>
               <p>If they will alſo feign a ſpecifique difference of Churches as they do of Paſtors, and ſay that Pariſh Churches are Eccleſiae dociae, but Dioceſan Churches are only Eccleſiae gubernatae of which the Pariſh Churches are but parts: I anſwer, 1. The Scripture knoweth no ſuch diſtinction of ſtated Churches: All ſtated Churches for worſhip are to be governed Churches; and the government is but guidance, and therefore to be by them that are their Guides. 2. I have before proved, that every wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Church, that had unum altare was to have a Biſhop or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Presbyters at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Arg. III. That Ordination which is much better than the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Rome, or of any Dioceſane Biſhops of the ſame ſort with theirs is valid.</p>
               <p>The Ordination now queſtioned by ſome in England, is much better then the Ordination of the Church of Rome, or of any Dioceſane Biſhops of the ſame ſort with theirs, Ergo the Ordination now queſtioned by ſome in England is valid.</p>
               <p>The Major will not be denied by thoſe which we plead with; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold the Ordination of the Church of Rome to be valid, and their Prieſts not to be re-ordained.</p>
               <p>The Minor I prove.</p>
               <p>If the Ordination, that hath no Reaſon of its validity alledged, but that it is not done by Dioceſane Biſhops, be much better than the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſuch as derive their power from a meer Uſurper of Headſhip over the univerſal Church, whoſe ſucceſſion hath been oft interrupted, and of ſuch as profeſs themſelves Paſtors of a falſe Church, (as having a Head and form of divine Inſtitution), and that ordain into that falſe Church, and cauſe the ordained to ſwear to be obedient to the Pope, to ſwear to falſe Doctrine as Articles of Faith, and ordain him to the Office of making a peice of Bread to be accounted no Bread, but the Body of Chriſt, which being Bread ſtill is to be worſhipped as God by himſelf and others (to paſs by the reſt) than the Ordination now queſtioned in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is much better than the Ordination of the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>But the Antecedent is true: Ergo ſo is the conſequent.</p>
               <p>And for the other part of the Minor I further prove it: If the Office and government of the Romiſh Biſhops and of any Dioceſanes of the ſame ſort with them, be deſtructive of that form of Epiſcopacy and Church Government which was inſtituted by Chriſt, and uſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, then the Ordination now queſtioned by ſome in England is much better than that which is done by ſuch Dioceſanes.</p>
               <p>But the Office and Covernment of the Romiſh Biſhops and of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſanes of the ſame ſort with them, is deſtructive of that form of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61252:200"/>
and Church Government, which was inſtituted by Chriſt and uſed in the Primitive Church. Ergo The Ordination now queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome in England is much better, than that which is done by ſuch Dioceſanes.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the conſequence is becauſe the Ordination of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now in queſtion is not deſtructive of the Epiſcopacy and Government inſtituted by Chriſt and uſed in the Primitive Church: Or if it were, thats the worſt that can be ſaid of it. And therefore if other Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be valid notwithſtanding that fault, ſo may it. N. B. 1. I here ſuppoſe the Reader to underſtand, what that Ordination is now queſtioned in England: viz. Such as we affirm to be by Biſhops, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Presbyters, as ſuch are called Biſhops, but as the cheif Presbyters of particular Churches, eſpecially City Churches, having Curates under them, and alſo as the Preſidents of Synods are called Biſhops:</p>
               <p>2. Note that all I ſay hereafter about Dioceſanes, is to be underſtood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe Biſhops of a Dioceſs of many hundred or ſcore Churches which are infimi gradus, having no Biſhops under them, who are only Prieſts, who are denied to have any proper Church Government: And not at all of thoſe Dioceſane Biſhops, who are Arch-Biſhops having many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops under them, or under whom each Pariſh Paſtor is Epiſcopus Gregis having the true Church Government of his particular Flock.</p>
               <p>And thus becauſe the Major is of great moment, I ſhall handle it the more largely.</p>
               <p>The Viciouſnes of the Romiſh Ordinations appeareth thus.</p>
               <p>1. In that they commonly profeſs to receive and hold the Ordainers office and power from the Pope: The very office it ſelfe ſay the Italians being from him; And the application and communication of it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſubject being from him, ſay the Spaniards and French alſo. But the Pope as ſuch hath no power to make Biſhops at all: which I prove</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the very office of a Pope as ſuch is not of Chriſt, yea is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his prerogative and Law, and abhorred by him; viz. [An univerſal viſible Vicar or Head of the Church on earth.]</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe on their own principles, the Pope can have no power, for want of uninterrupted ſucceſſion of true Ordination, nothing being more plain in Church Hiſtory ſcarce, than that ſuch ſucceſſion is long ago nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by oft interruptions, as I have proved elſewhere, and as is by many Proteſtants proved.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe the Work that they ordain their Prieſt to is Idolatry, even Bread worſhip; beſides Man worſhip, and Image worſhip.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe all their Prieſts are (in the Trent Oath) ſworn to this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſworn to renounce all their Senſes to that end, and to renounce the Scripture ſufficiency; and to own the Papal Treaſonable uſurpation, which all are contrary to the Office of Chriſts Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Yet are thoſe, that ordained at Rome, received by our Prelates, when they turn to us, without reordination, and their Orders are not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61252:201"/>
taken by them to be null (which I diſpute not now). Much leſs are the late Proteſtant Engliſh Ordinations null.</p>
               <p>II. The Viciouſneſs of ſuch other Prelates Ordinations, is proved by all that is ſaid againſt their Calling it ſelf before. And further. 1. Thoſe Prelates, that are choſen by Magiſtrates and not by other Biſhops or the Presbyters of their Dioceſs or People (what ſtale hypocritical pretext ſoever there may be of the contrary) are by the Canons of the Univerſal Church no Prelates. But ſuch are thoſe in queſtion: Ergo—</p>
               <p>The Major (to omit many other Canons) I prove from Concil. Nic. 2. Can. 3. in Bin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To. 2. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Argument IV. Orders conferred by ſuch as are in orders, and have the Power of Order equal with the higheſt Biſhops, is valid. But the Orders lately conferred in England and Scotland by thoſe called Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were conferred by ſuch as were in Orders, and had the power of Order equal with the higheſt Biſhop: Ergo The Orders lately conferred in England and Scotland by thoſe called Presbyters, was valid.</p>
               <p>As to the Major, I remember Arch-Biſh. Uſher told me himſelf that it was the argument by which he indeavoured to ſatisfie K. Charles I. 1. That Ordinis eſt ordinare, a man that is in orders as to the ſacred Prieſthood, may caeteris paribus confer Orders; it being like Generation or univocal cauſation. 2. That Hierom tells us the Alexandrian Presbyters did more; for they made their Biſhops: And at this day among the Papiſts, men of inferiour Order muſt with them ordain, or conſecrate, or make their Pope. And Biſhops make Arch-Biſhops: How much more may men of the ſame Order confer what they have, that is the Power of the Prieſthood or Presbyterate. As Abbots (who are no Biſhops) have frequently done.</p>
               <p>2. And for the Minor Biſhop Carleton hath theſe words in his Treatiſe of Jurisdiction pag. 7. The Power of Order by all Writers, that I could ſee, even of the Church of Rome, is underſtood to be immediately from Chriſt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all Biſhops and Prieſts alike by their conſecration; wherein the Pope hath no priviledge above others Thus teaches Bonavent. in 4. ſent. d. 17. q. 1.

               <p>Pag. 306.—Theſe Presbyters were as the Biſhops Children, educated and formed by him, being in all they did, directed by him and accountable to him, and were as Probationers for the Biſhoprick, one of them being alwaies choſen to ſucceed in the ſeat, when vacant by the Biſhops death. Now all theſe lived together as in a little Colledge, thus the Churches were planted and the Goſpel diſſeminated through the world. But at firſt every Biſhop had but one Pariſh, yet afterwards when the numbers of the Chriſtians increaſed, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently meet in one place, and when through the violence of perſecution they durſt not aſſemble in great multitudes, the Biſhops divided their charges in leſſer Pariſhes <note n="*" place="margin">The ſtory of <hi>Erani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulos</hi> (much leſs proper Pariſhes) is confuted by the moſt knowing iſiſtorians.</note> and gave aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments to the Presbyters of particular flocks, which was done firſt in Rome, in the begining of the 2d. Century—And things continued thus in a Parochial Government, till toward the end of the 2d. Century, the Biſhop being chiefly intruſted with the cure of Souls, a ſhare whereof was alſo committed to the Presbyters, who were ſubject to him, and particularly to be ordained by him, nor could any ordination be without the Biſhop; who in ordaining was to carry along with him the concurrence of the Presbyters, as in every other act of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical juriſdiction.</p>

               <p>Pag. 331. I acknowledged Biſhop and Presbyter to be one and the ſame office, and ſo plead for no new office bearer in the Church—The firſt branch of their power is their authority to publiſh the Goſpell, to manage the worſhip and diſpence the Sacraments: And this is all that is of Divine right in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; in which Biſhops and Presbyters are equal ſharers,—but beſides this the Church claimeth a power of Juriſdiction, of making rules for diſcipline, and applying and executing the ſame; All which is indeed ſuitable to the common laws of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and the general rules of Scripture, but hath no poſitive warrant from any Scripture precept: And all theſe Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Churches into Synods, and the Canons of diſcipline, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their riſe from the diviſions of the world into the ſeveral provinces, and beginning in the 2d. and beginning of the 3d. Century, do clearly ſhew they can be derived from no Divine original, and ſo were a to their particular forme but of humane conſtitution. Therefore as to the managment of this Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is in the Churches power to caſt it into what mould ſhe will—But we ought to be much more determined by the Laws of the land—In things neceſſary to be done by Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ſince no power on earth can Council the authority of a Divine Law, the Churches reſtraints are not to be conſidered.</p>

I am not to annul theſe ordinations that paſs by Presbyters, where no Biſhop can be had: And this layes no claime to a new office, but only to a higher degree of inſpection in the ſame office; whereby the exerciſe of ſome acts of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are reſtrained to ſuch a Method: And this may be done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Churches free conſent, or by the Kings authority.</p>
