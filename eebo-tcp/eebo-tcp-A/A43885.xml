            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am not ignorant what great advantage the frequent falſe Reports of my Actions and Demeanours hath given to the diſhonour of our Sex: Let me tell you, I had rather chuſe to be diſſolved into Attoms, then juſtly to deſerve to be the occaſion of any ſuch thing. I therefore Adventured upon this Collection, to evince to the World, the Falſhood and Inſufficiency of the Deſigns againſt me. There is no Perſon of Underſtanding, but may eaſily diſcern and conclude as much as I deſire for Vindication of my ſelf from thoſe Things my Enemies aſperſed me with, or that have lately been upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>He who was firſt the Contriver and Promoter of the Falſe Suggeſtions againſt Me, coming to Viſit me within one hour after the Juſt Sentence of <hi>NOT GUILTY,</hi> I told him, If the Modeſty of my Sex would permit me, I would Require the Comba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I could mention him, but it's below me to take notice of him, further then to know him for a Villain. But it being the Opinion of all Philoſophers and Divines, as well Ancient as Modern, That Detraction is the Chief Branch of Envy, which is nouriſhed by Lying, by which People of Honeſt Converſation are grievouſly wounded.—<hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cinick</hi> being ask'd, What Beaſt Bit moſt Deadly? Anſwered, <hi>Amongſt Furious and Wild Beaſts, None like the Detractor.—And amongſt Tame and Gentle Beaſts, None like the Soother and Flatterer.—Themiſtocles</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> upon the ſame occaſion, ſaid, <hi>There was no greater Pain nor Miſery in the World, then to behold the Honour or Credit of an Honeſt or Good Man or Woman to be in the Mercy of a venomous Tongue, and to be tortured by Detracting Speeches.</hi> A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Author that I have ſeen, hath this ſaying, That all Nations do obſerve it as a Law, That a Diſſolute Life in Men, is not held to be ſuch a Vice as in Women: That let a Report paſſe of a Woman, True or

Falſe, Irreparably ſhe lyeth under Infamy. Therefore I do imagine, that our Anceſtors were ſo prudent, that in the Inſtituting of ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Knights, they had ſtill in Charge, That they ſhould defend Innocent Ladies. And I never read of any Knight that undertook a Diſtreſſed Ladies Quarrell, but he Vanquiſhed and Overcame. That Example of <hi>Valentinus Barnthius,</hi> a Native of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in his Hiſtory, wherein he mentioneth a Daughter of one of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> that was Married to the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> She not yielding to the Immodeſt Sollicitation and Requeſt of <hi>Pancalier,</hi> whom the Duke her Husband had left as his Lieutenant in his Abſence, whileſt he was buſied in the Warrs of <hi>France;</hi> The Count Impoſed on her, the Crime of Adultery: For Confirmation (wanting other proof) he Required the Combat of any that ſhould gainſay his Aſſertion. The which was Accepted by a Knight of the Noble Houſe of <hi>Mendoza;</hi> Who ſlew him, notwithſtanding many Diſadvantages of a late Sickneſs, of his long Travel, and Diſproportion of his Strength and Stature, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt of that Name, King of <hi>France,</hi> granted the Combat to <hi>Caſtaigneray</hi> and the Lord <hi>Jarnac; Castaigneray</hi> having by words diſhonoured a Lady, that was by Blood Allied to <hi>Jarnac:</hi> In the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Perſons, <hi>Caſtaigneray</hi> by reaſon of his often Combats, Strength, Judgment in Arms, and the uſe of Weapons, would be too hard for the Lord <hi>Jarnac;</hi> yet the Lord <hi>Jarnac</hi> ſlew him: The which Convinced all the Spectators, That the Innocency of the Lady Influenced the Sword of <hi>Jarnac.</hi> Many other Stories of like nature I could Inſtance, but I ſhall conclude with this:
<q>
                  <l>Sure there is none will a Woman deprave,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs he be a Coward or a Knave.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not mention theſe Stories, to reflect upon any of the Engliſh Gallants, for not Taking part in my Cauſe, I at firſt apprehended I needed it not; and now do much leſſe need it: for that my Enemies by their Inſufficient Proſecution, made way for the World to conclude my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. But I may in ſome ſort complain of my Husband, who wore a Sword by his ſide, and yet could ſuffer me to be ſtript of my neceſſary Rayment. But inſtead of that Civil Defence, the leaſt of Kindneſſes he might have afforded me, that had enjoyed all <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Rites with me ſo

lately before that Tragick-Part, he encountreth me with a Volume of one Sheet in Quarto, wherein he hath theſe Paſſages, That I by my Parts deluded him. In anſwer to which, He deluded me by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>

Her great Pretence to Zeal in her Religion; her Modest Confidence and Grace in all Companies, Fearing the knowledg of none; her Demeanour was ſuch, that ſhe left no room for Suſpition, not only in my Opinion, but alſo in others both Grave and Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some other things he Inſiſts upon, as his undertaking to tell the Story of the Management of the Buſineſs betwixt us; In which he is ſo far from doing Me Juſtice therein, that he wrongeth Me and his own Soul by lying.</p>
            <p>For Confutation of which, I refer the Reader to the enſuing Diſcourſe; Only there is one Paſſage that I am unwilling to let ſlip, that is in page the 6th, he ſaith, That my Father was in Town upon my Commitment, and did acknowledg me to be his Daughter, and that I had playd many ſuch Tricks. It's ſtrange this Father of mine could not be produced at the Tryal, if that had been true; As ſtrange it was, That the Jury-Man himſelf (that was one of the Jury upon the Tryal of <hi>Mary Mauders)</hi> that they produced, who ſeemed to be a Man of Conſcience and Judgment, could not ſwear nor ſay, That I was the <hi>Mary Mauders</hi> alias <hi>Stedman.</hi> But I wave all; and make it my Requeſt to all <hi>Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider the whole enſuing Diſcourſe: The which if done, I may reſt Confident, that there is none but will ſet a Hand to the Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Reputation to a higher Pitch, then from whence my Detracting Enemies endeavoured to depreſs it.</p>

               <hi>EPimenides</hi> the Philoſopher being asked by the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> What that Virtue called <hi>Truth</hi> was, anſwered, <hi>Truth</hi> is that thing, whereof (more then all others) the Gods do make profeſſion, and the Virtue that illuminateth the Heaven and the Earth, maintaineth Juſtice, governeth, preſerveth, and protecteth a State or Kingdom, and cannot indure any wicked thing near it; alſo it maketh all doubtful and ambiguous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters clear and apparent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo demanded of <hi>Chilo</hi> the Philoſopher, what <hi>Truth</hi> was? ſaid, It was a ſure Gage and Standard, to meaſure all things by it who neither diminiſheth at one time, nor increaſeth at another: its a Buckler, a Shield that can never be pierced: its an Army never danted, a Flower that never faileth, a Haven that none ſhall periſh in, or ſuffer peril.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> inquiſitive after this rare Virtue, importuned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxachus</hi> to delineate <hi>Truth</hi> to them; he drew its Portraicture in theſe fair, Lines, <hi>viz. Truth</hi> is a perpetual <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> a Life without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, an Unguent that healeth all misfortunes, a Sun always ſhining, that never ſuffereth by Eclipſe, a Gate never ſhut, a Journey in which none can wax weary: Its a Virtue, without which all Strength is feebleneſs, and infirmneſs it ſelf; Wiſdom, Folly, and Madneſs: Without it, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is but a Counterfeit, and Liberty but a Priſon.</p>

               <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> in the Triumphs that he made for <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> brought with him to <hi>Rome</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> aged 60 years, that was famous for not telling a Lye in his whole Life; the Senate orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Statue to be erected, and himſelf to be High-Prieſt.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> there dyed at <hi>Rome</hi> one <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> that was upon good ground ſuſpected never to have told Truth all the days of his life; He, by the Emperour's Order, was denyed Buriall, his Houſe to be razed, his Goods confiſcate, in deteſtation of ſo veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Beaſt, who was ſo ſuſpected, that when by accident he did ſpeak Truth, the Hearers ſuſpected their own Knowledge.</p>

Mr. <hi>King</hi> ſaid, <hi>His houſe ſhould be at my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> I anſwered him, <hi>That I lookt upon him as a civill perſon.</hi> I took my leave of the Parſon, and upon Mr. <hi>Kings</hi> Invitation, went to my

Chamber, parcel of his houſe that he had alotted me for my appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Returning Mr. <hi>King</hi> many thanks for his civility, I took my leave of him alſo: He told me, that his Wife ſhould wait upon me when I roſe.</p>
            <p>Let the World judge, if it be probable that I could deſign any thing to inſnare Mr. <hi>Carleton,</hi> when at my accidental coming into that houſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more remote from my Thoughts or Apprehenſion, then he was; or then that which hapned afterwards. By what I ſhall further ſay, I doubt not but to undeceive the World, and demonſtrate, that they deſigned againſt me: And whether I have that Eſtate they dreamt of, it is not material; I am not much to be blamed, if I have it, and conceal it, ſince they have purſued me in that envious ſort, of which the World is Witneſs.</p>
            <p>Well, when I roſe about 11 of the Clock, Miſtris <hi>King,</hi> the Miſtriſs of the houſe, attended me; I was furniſhed with all reſpect with what I askt for, or what was neceſſary: After which, I applyed my ſelf to writing of my Letters, ſent them away by the Poſt beyond the Seas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I gave Inſtructions, for the managing of thoſe Affairs that concerned me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> Mrs. <hi>King</hi> made a great Feaſt, where were divers perſons of quality, as ſhe ſaid, amongſt the reſt, her Brother Mr. <hi>John Carleton.</hi> At this Entertainment, Mrs. <hi>King</hi> did adviſe me to call her Cozen, the which I did. <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 2d of <hi>April,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Carlton</hi> came in his Coach, with two Foot-men attending of him, calling him my <hi>Lord,</hi> and Miſtriſs <hi>King</hi> did alſo call him my <hi>Lord.</hi> With that I askt Mrs. <hi>King,</hi> if it was not the ſame perſon that din'd with us yeſterday; ſhe ſaid, True, it was ſo, but he was in a Diſguize then, and withall, that in a humour he would often do ſo: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>I do aſſure you he is a Lord.</hi> Upon that I replyed, <hi>Then his Father muſt be an Earl, if living.</hi> She affirmed, that he was a perſon of great Honour. The ſame time my Lord preſented me with a rich Box of Sweet-meats: I could do no leſs then thankfully accept thereof.</p>
            <p>My Lord came every day afterwards to Mr. <hi>Kings,</hi> and by his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity would carry me abroad in a Coach to <hi>Holyway</hi> and <hi>Iſlington.</hi> Mrs. <hi>King</hi> would often ask me, what my Lord did ſay to me; I told her, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I obſerved, but his Lordſhip abounded in civility-mixt with Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Madam, He loves you. Loves me, for what Miſtriſs</hi> King, I replyed. She ſaid, <hi>For your great Parts and Endowments.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30228:5"/>
I asked her, <hi>How my Lord could tell that I had either.</hi> She ſaid, <hi>My Lord could ſee within me.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>That my Lord must have very good eyes, if he could ſee within me, or elſe I muſt be very tranſparant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which, I did order the matter ſo, that his Acceſs to me was not ſo eaſie: Miſtriſs <hi>King</hi> importuneth me to admit my Lord to viſit me; I told her plainly, <hi>That I did not understand his Lordſhips meaning.</hi> He provided me a great Banquet, at which his Lordſhips Mother was very fine dreſt, who queſtioned what I was. I told my Lord, <hi>That I had received Civilities from him, and he had the like from me, and that I had no neceſsity to give any account to any perſon what I was, for any thing that I intended; and that if any Deſign or Affair of his required any ſuch thing out of conveniencie or otherwiſe, he might forbear it.</hi> His Lordſhip excuſed his Mothers Inquiſitions, by ſaying, <hi>She was his Mother, and that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did think themſelves concerned, in looking after the good of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Madam, Wave all this, however I will marry you to morrow. What</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>my Lord, without my conſent:</hi> My Lord, <hi>I deſire your Lordſhip not to come near me any more, I will not lye under ſuch queſtioning and ſcrutinie: Your Lordſhip will be ſafe in following my advice, in not coming at me at any more.</hi> Upon this his Lordſhip wept bitterly; I with-drew my ſelf from his preſence: He writ a Letter of high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements to me (the which Letter periſhed in the ſtorming and taking of my Out-works, by the Forces of Mr. <hi>George Carleton,</hi> my Husbands Father:). at the ſame time I had a Gown making upon my own account by Miſtriſs <hi>Kings</hi> Taylor in the <hi>Strand,</hi> I took a Coach and went thither; all this while the young Lord, not knowing where I was, remained impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent untill my return, where I found him ſtanding at the Bar (not the Bar his Lordſhip was afterwards pleaſed to be one of the Inſtruments to make me ſtand at) at the <hi>Exchange-Tavern,</hi> and ſuddainly claſpt about my middle, and violently carryed me to my Chamber. I asked his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He anſwered, <hi>That I had forbid him my preſence; that it had almoſt made him mad; that he deſired nothing more of me, then but to let him look upon me.</hi> Upon that he did, with a very ſtrange Jeſture, fix his eyes upon me: In compaſſion to him, I askt him what his Lordſhip meant, and intended; he replied in a kind of diſcompoſed manner, <hi>I would have you to be my Wife.</hi> I anſwered him, <hi>My Lord, I rather think you have Courted me for a Miſtris then for a Wife: I aſſure you, that I will never be a Miſtris to the greateſt of Princes, I will rather chuſe to be a Wife to the meaneſt of men.</hi>

Upon which, he uttered divers aſſeverations in confirmation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his intentions, and earneſt deſire of the Honour in making me his Wife, without any reſpect to what I had.</p>
            <p>The next day being Saturday Eaſter Eve, the Taylor brought me my Gown to my Lodging, I being dreſt and adorned with my Jewels, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain renewed his Sute to me, with all importunity imaginable; and a little before that time, having intercepted my Letters, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how my Eſtate did lie, he and all his friends renewed their Sute to me, to give my conſent to marry the young Lord: His courteous Mother is now moſt forward, preſſing me to conſent, by telling me, that <hi>ſhe ſhould loſe h<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> following, being the 24. of <hi>April,</hi> Lodgings are taken for my Lord and my Self in <hi>Durham</hi> Yard, and much State and Grandeur is uſed for the Credit of his Lordſhip. The next <hi>Friday</hi> following, being

               <hi>May Day,</hi> his Lordſhip with great State carrieth Me into <hi>Hide-Park</hi> where I was accommodated by the Courteous Reſpect of divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, with great Rarities.</p>
            <p>My Husband by this time, publickly owned the Title of Lord, by the which Title privately, he carried on his deſign upon me, he being one day in company with ſome of his old Acquaintance, hearing him boaſt of the fortune he had matched, they told him, that they might poſſibly commit an errour, in calling him Mr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> and that they ſhould readily give him his due, by what Title ſoever was proper to him, and that they knew not better how to be inſtructed then from himſelf, who they thought would be leaſt guilty of flattery in that caſe. Why truly, ſaid he, my Princeſs calleth me Lord: upon that, he took upon him the acceptation of the Title, publickly as well as privately.</p>
            <p>The firſt time he came to me, he pretended to be a Lord, the which Title he could not well-maintain, as the caſe ſtood, unleſs he made me a Princeſs: Now let but the World judge how diviliſhly I had been cheated, if I had been a Princeſs, I had no reaſon to undeceive them in their wilful miſtakes, when I ſaw by their practiſes, how much I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and diſappointed; for now by this time, M<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was the cauſe of my firſt breach with them, and the cauſe of my troubles that did immediately inſue.</p>
            <p>In one or two dayes, the Scene alters, and a Letter from <hi>Dover</hi> is contrived, to be a diſcovery of me; For an accouut of which, I refer you to my Speech in my Tryall, for Vindication of my Self in that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

            <p>The Indictment was Read, which was to this Effect; That I had at ſeveral times married ſeveral perſons that were now living; That I had married in St. <hi>Meldreds</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſome years laſt paſt, one <hi>Thomas Stedman,</hi> a Shoe-maker now living; And that in <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt I had Feloniouſly married one <hi>John Carlton,</hi> againſt the Statute in that Caſe made and provided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Knott</hi> was ſworn, and ſaid, That I was married in the place aforeſaid, unto one <hi>Thomas Stedman,</hi> who is now alive, and would have come up, if he had had Money to have born his Charges; and that he gave Me in Marriage: That I was born at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and that my Father in Law his Name was <hi>Richard Foord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He being asked, If he knew my own Father and Mother; He ſaid, No. And further ſaid, That it was about a Week or a Fortnight before the Act for Marriages by Juſtices of the Peace was put in Execution.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice ask't <hi>Knott,</hi> What were the words uſed in the Marriage? He anſwered, <hi>That he was ſo young, that he could not remember that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Clark</hi> Sworn, ſaid, That there was an Indictment againſt Me at <hi>Dover,</hi> for marrying of one <hi>Day,</hi> after <hi>Stedman,</hi> and that I was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by <hi>Stedman,</hi> of which I was cleared.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Carlton</hi> the Elder being ſworn, gave in Evidence, That he ſaw my Husband at <hi>Dover.</hi> Being asked, <hi>Whether he knew him to be her Husband?</hi> He anſwered, That he could not ſwear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Knott</hi> gave further Evidence, <hi>That I had two Children by</hi> Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Carlton</hi> the Elder being askt, If he had any thing further to ſay, acquainted the Court, That he had ſearcht the Regiſter-Book of

the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Meldreds, Canterbury,</hi> but could not find any ſuch Marriage Regiſtred. And further ſaid, <hi>That the preſent Parſon of the Pariſh did tell him, That the Clerk of the ſaid Place was often guilty of neglect in that kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Carlton</hi> the younger being Sworn, ſaid, That I was married unto his Brother, <hi>John Carlton,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> laſt, in Great St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Parſon that married me there, gave in Evidence, That he married Mr. <hi>John Carlton</hi> and my ſelf, in <hi>April</hi> laſt, by the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and had a Licence produced to him for his Warrant; I craving leave to ſpeak, ſaid, I acknowledged that I was married to Mr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> at the time, and in the manner as is before expreſſed; therefore they might ſave themſelves the Labour, and the Honourable Bench the trouble of further Proof in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Carlton</hi> the elder being askt, If he had any other Evidence to offer, anſwered, <hi>That he had more Witneſſes to prove my being marryed to other perſons.</hi> The Bench Replyed, <hi>That there could be nothing given in Evidence that was not contained in the Indictment.</hi> The Court askt <hi>Knot,</hi> Who were with him beſides at the Wedding he mentioned in his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he ſaid, <hi>That there was Mr.</hi> Man, <hi>the Parſon that marryed Us, the Sexton, my Siſter, and himſelf that gave me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the Jury deſired the Court to ask <hi>Knot,</hi> How old he was now: he anſwered, <hi>That he was one or two and thirty years of Age.</hi> Mr. <hi>Carlton</hi> being askt, If he had any more Witneſſes, anſwered, <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtanding all this while at the Bar, not once interrupting or diſturbing the Evidence of the other ſide, the Court calling upon me to make my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I without any diſturbed thought, or unquiet mind, did in a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate compoſed manner, addreſs my ſelf to the Bench in this ſort:</p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>In the first place, I do with all due reſpect and ſubmiſſion, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech your Lordſhip, and this Honourable Bench, not to impute any thing that I ſhall ſay to confidence, but rather to the neceſsity that lyeth upon me, to make my Defence for my life. A thing that will ſufficiently oblige any to make the beſt Defence they can: but that doth not weight ſo much with me, as that which is every whit as dear to me as my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>It is my Reputation and my innocency, that incourageth me to ſpeak before your Lordſhip at this time, and it is that which produceth confidence in me, that as I am innocent of the thing urged upon me by them, the Juſtice and Reaſon of you before whom I ſtand, by the which I hope to be acquitted and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30228:9"/>
to the World what I am, not what my proſecutors would have the World to believe me to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>I ſhall not trouble you with any thing impertinent, nor with any things that related to theſe affaires more then needs I muſt: When his Son my Husband, came and addreſſed himſelf to me, pretending himſelf a perſon of Honour and upon firſt ſight preſſed me to Marriage: I told him, Sir,</hi> ſaid I <hi>I am a ſtranger, have no acquaintance here, and deſire you to deſiſt your Suit; I could not ſpeak my mind, but he</hi> (having borrowed ſome thredbare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements) <hi>replyed,</hi> Madam, <hi>Your ſeeming virtues, your amiable perſon, and noble department, renders you ſo excellent, That were I in the leaſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in you, I cannot doubt of happineſs;</hi> and ſo with many words to the like purpoſe, courted me. <hi>I told him, and indeed could not but much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that at ſo ſmall a glance he could be ſo preſumptuous with a Stranger, to hint this to me; but all I could ſay, would not beat him off. Therefore</hi> my Lord. <hi>I do humbly acquaint your Lordſhip that old Mr.</hi> Carlton <hi>did rather Deſign upon me, then I upon him, to ſay nothing of what paſſed before I was married to his Son, of which there was enough to demonstrate that evidently, ſo ſoon as I was married to his Son, he deſired me to make over my Eſtate to his Son, to ſatisfie the World, that was ſomewhat amuſed, and in doubt of what is ſeems they had ſpread abroad for their own Reputation: I anſwered him,</hi> Sir, <hi>I ſhall not diſ-invest my ſelf of my Estate, untill I did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Carlton</hi> intercepted my Letters, by that underſtood how my Eſtate did lie, that he had that expectation of what I had, is farther evident; for his Son came to me, pretending to be a perſon of Honour and great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the better to accomodate himſelf in his application to me, he borrowed his Brother <hi>Georges</hi> Cloak, it is the ſame he hath on his back in Court before your Lordſhip; and if any be deceived, I am.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> If that they could but have been inſured that I had been the perſon as to Eſtate, that they imagined me to be, your Lordſhip ſhould not have been troubled at this time, in theſe matters, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them aright, they would have been contented to have practiſed concealment, in caſe I had had more then one Husband. Inſtead of this defamation that I am loaded with, my Lord, my crime is, that I have not an Eſtate, or at leaſt ſuch a one as they imagined it to be; therefore my Lord, I ſay, I am brought at this time to this place; And therefore, my Lord, were my Jewels ſeized to defray the Charge of their expenſive courting of me. To colour what they have done, they fix the Offences of ſome Woman of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a perſon that may be

dead, or gone out of the Land for ought I know, upon me: the place I know not, a place that I am a ſtranger unto; if that had not bin ſo, they have had time enough ſince my firſt Commitment to have produced more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then any that hath as yet been urged before Your Lordſhip: My Lord, They brand me for marrying of a Shoo-make, and another ſad piece of Mortality, a Brick-layer. My Lord, My Soul abhorreth ſuch a thought, and never was accommodated with ſuch Condiſcention, to move in ſo low an O<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>b. My Lord, by all that I can obſerve of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that appear againſt me, they may be divided into two ſorts; the one of them come againſt me for want of Wit, the other for want of Mony.</p>
            <p>That Mony hath been proffered to ſubborn ſome againſt me, I have Witneſs to prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Theſe People have been up and down the Country, and finding none there that could juſtifie any thing of this matter, they get here an unknown Fellow, unleſs in a Priſon, and from thence borrowed, you cannot but all judg to ſwear againſt me. <hi>My Lord,</hi> were there any ſuch Marriage as this fellow pretends, methinks there might be a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate from the Miniſter, or place: Certainly if married, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred; but there is no Regiſtry of it, and ſo can be no Certificate, no Miniſter nor Clerk to be found: And if I ſhould own a Marriage, then you ſee that great Witneſs cannot tell you, whether I was lawfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, or how? But it is enough for him (if ſuch a paultry fellow may be believed) to ſay, I was married. I was never yet married to any but <hi>John Carlton,</hi> the late pretended Lord: But theſe perſons have ſought alwayes to take away my life, bringing perſons to ſwear againſt me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> When old Mr. <hi>Carlton</hi> ſaw that he could not obtain his End of me, he threatned me with a Juſtice, and a Priſon; and the Juſtice bound him over to proſecute me; he muſt make the beſt of it, and therefore it is no wonder that he repaireth to ſuch Means and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to effect my Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I deſire that my Witneſſes may be called.</p>

               <hi>Elizabeth Collier</hi> ſaid, That ſhe coming to the <hi>Gate-Houſe</hi> to ſee her husband, being a Priſoner there for Debt, one pretended that he came to ſee his Wife there, named <hi>Mary Maullers.</hi> Upon that, ſhe took upon her to perſonate the ſaid Perſon he asked for: He ſaid, <hi>I, 'tis true, thou art that unhappy Woman that I married.</hi> The which perſon ſhe never ſaw before in her life.</p>

Mr. <hi>Ed.

            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to ask Me, <hi>Where I was Born?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>In Germany.</hi> He ask'd me, <hi>Where?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>At Colen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> was askt by the Court, <hi>Whether he could prove, or ſwear, That I was the</hi> Mary Mauders <hi>that was Tryed at</hi> Dover? He anſwered, That he could not, neither prove it, nor ſwear it himſelf; for he was a ſtranger to the whole Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I perceiving the ſleight Evidence, and that I needed not either to ſay more, or offer more evidence in my behalf, ſubmitted my Cauſe to the Bench and Jury.</p>
            <p>Upon my being askt by the Bench, <hi>If I had more to ſay;</hi> I Replyed, <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court gave Inſtructions to the Jury as followeth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Indictment was Briefly recited.</p>
            <p>And as to the Evidence, the Court obſerved, That there was but one Witneſs to prove the Indictment, and that he could not remember the manner of Marriage, nor the words uſed there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if that I had been Married, and had two Children, and that the Jury ſhould believe that Single Evidence, and that he had ſworn aright, I was to dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judge told the Jury, <hi>That they had heard of a Tryall againſt me, for having had Two Husbands before, one</hi> Stedman, <hi>and</hi> Day, <hi>at one time, and that from a Jury-Man that was upon the Jury at the ſame Tryall; yet he could not ſwear, That I was the Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury went forth, and continued abſent a quarter of an hour: Upon their Return, and Silence being made, the Jury being called over, they were askt as the Cuſtom is, <hi>Who ſhould ſay for them?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>The Fore-Man.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Fore-Man anſwered, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> Upon which, there was a Great Shout of the People.</p>
            <p>After Silence being made, I moved the Court, That they would Order the Reſtoration of my Jewels. They anſwered, <hi>That I

had Owned Mr.</hi> Carlton <hi>for her Husband, he muſt ſue for them, if Old Mr.</hi> Carlton <hi>ſhall deny the delivery of them.</hi>

            <p>When the Jury was Returning with their Verdict, my Husband in the Garden, met them; he askt one of them, <hi>If they had found me Guilty?</hi> He in anſwer to his queſtion, ſaid, <hi>No, my Lord, We ſhall leave you to make much of your Princeſs.</hi> He Replyed, <hi>By God, I am undone, I will never own her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Envy againſt me reſted not here, they preferred ſeverall other Bills the ſame Afternoon; and endeavoured as much the next day: but the Grand Jury perceiving it to be rather upon Malice, then upon any juſt ground that they had ſo to do, flung them our.</p>

To vainer purpoſe did <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> come</l>
               <l>From diſtant Regions to procure a Son</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Alexander:</hi> 'Twas not (I greatly fear)</l>
               <l>Courage or Wit's Effect, but hot Deſire.</l>
               <l>This Forreign <hi>PRINCESS</hi> ſuch perfections brought</l>
               <l>Into our <hi>Engliſh</hi> World, as Leſſons taught</l>
               <l>Moſt proper; for our Age declining ſtill</l>
               <l>From bad to worſe, goes on to what's moſt ill:</l>
               <l>Our Anceſtors renowned Vertues priz'd,</l>
               <l>But we all reall Honours have deſpis'd:</l>

               <l>And good Examples to the Great Ones give,</l>

               <l>And make the under-duller World admire.</l>
               <l>Thus, though diſguis'd, her moſt Illuſtrious Worth</l>
               <l>Through all Impediments of <hi>Hate</hi> brake forth,</l>
               <l>Which her Detractors ſought within a Priſon</l>

               <l>Through this obſcure Condition, more clear.</l>
               <l>And when they thought by bringing to the Barr</l>
