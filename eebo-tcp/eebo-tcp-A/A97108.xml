            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LETTER OF THE LONDON MINISTERS TO THE Aſſembly of DIVINES at VVeſtminſter; againſt TOLERATION, mildly examined; AND The miſtakes thereof friendly diſcovered; As vvell for the ſakes of the <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> as for the good of the COMMON-WEALTH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I call to minde the generall oppreſſion (before the Parliament) exerciſed upon good people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious in the practice of their religion; and that the Presbyters did not onely ſuffer as much as any therein, but exclaim'd, and labour'd as much as any there-againſt: It is a wonder to me, that now that yoke is removed, and a bleſt opportnnity offered by Almighty God, to the people and their Parliament, to make every honeſt heart glad, by allowing a juſt and contentfull Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to ſerve God without hypocriſie; and according to the perſwaſion of conſcience: That one Sect amongſt us, that is the Presbyters, that have been yoke-fellowes with us; ſhould not reſt ſatisfied with being free as their Brethren, but become reſtleſſe in their contrivances and endeavours, till they become Lords over us. The wonder is the ſame, as it would have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113409:2"/>
been, had the Iſraelites, after the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage, become Task-maſters in the Land of Canaan one to another, but that is more in them who have been inſtructed by our Saviour in that bleſſed rule; of doing unto others, what they would have others doe unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>To diſcover the ſeverall policies the Presbiters have uſed to get into the chayre they have juſtled the Biſhops out of, whoſe example they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in many particulars; as eſpecially in the politick and graduall obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinance for Licencing, upon a pretence of ſtopping the Kings writings, but intentionably obtained, and violently made uſe of againſt the Independents, Separation, and Common-wealths-men, who either ſees more, or ſomething contrary to the deſignes of the Licencer. To ſignifie to the People, how the Presbiters have laboured to twiſt their intereſt with the Parliaments, as the Biſhops did theirs with the King, how daily and burdenſomly importunate they are with the Parliament, to eſtabliſh their Government, (which they are pleaſed to call Chriſts) and back it with authority, and a compulſive power, (which by that very perticular appeares not to be his) To lay open their private juncto's and councels, their framing Petitions for the eaſie and ignorant people, their urging them upon the Common Councell, and obtruding them upou the chuſers of Common Councell men, at the Wardmote Elections, even after the Parliament had ſignified their diſlike thereof; to ſum up their bitter invectives in Pulpits, and ſtrange liberty they take as well there, as in their writings, to make the ſeparation and Independents odious by ſcandals and untrue reports of them, in confidence of having the preſſe in their own hands, by which meanes, no man without hazard ſhall anſwer them, to lay open the manner and depth of theſe proceedings, is not the intention of this worke; I only thought good to mention theſe particulars, that the Presbiters may ſee they walke in a net, no 'tis no cloud that covers them, and that they may fear that in time they may be diſcern'd as well by the whole People, as they are already by a very great part thereof.</p>
            <p>The London Miniſters Letter, contriu'd in the conclave of Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is one of the numerous projects of the Clergy: not made for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Sinod, but the miſinformation of the People, to prevent which is my buſineſſe at this time; I will only take ſo much of it as is to the point in hand, to wit, Tolleration.</p>

Church Communion: you may as well put the queſtion, why men play not the Hypocrites? as they muſt needs do if they ſhould communicate in that Church Society, their minde cannot approve of. The queſtion had been well put, if you had ſaid, by reaſon of different lights, and different ſights, there may be diſſenting in opinion, yet why ſhould our hearts be divided one from another? why ſhould our love from hence, and our affections grow cold and dead one towards another? why ſhould we not peaceably, beare one with another, till our ſights grow better, and our light increaſe?

                  <p>I would to God the people, their own friends eſpecially, would but take notice of the fallacy of the Reaſon: They would have reformation perfected according to the Covenant, before the Independents move to be tollerated: now Reformation is not perfected according to the Covenant, till Schiſme and Hereſie is extirpated; which in the ſequel of this Letter, they judge Independency tobe, that their charity thinks it then moſt ſeaſonable, to move that Independency ſhould be tolerated after it is extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated: their reaſon and affection in this, are alike ſound to the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Their drift in this, indeede is but too evident, they would have the Independents ſilent, till they get power in their hands, and then let them talke if they dare, certainly, the moſt ſeaſonable time to move for tolleration is while the Parliament are in debate about Church Government; ſince if ſtay bee made till a Church Government bee ſetled, all motions that may but ſeeme to derogate from that, how juſt ſoever in themſelves, how good ſoever for the Common-wealth, muſt needs be hardly obtained.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, the State of Holland doth tollerate; and therefore the Miniſters Argument, even in that part where it ſeems to be moſt ſtrong for them, makes againſt them.</p>

Whoſoever ſhall caſt an impartiall eye upon times paſt, and examine the true cauſe and reaſon of the ſubverſion, and devaſtation of States and countries, will I am confident; attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to no other, then the Tyranny of Princes, and Perſecution of Prieſts.

God being all Love, and having ſo communicated himſelfe unto us, and gave us commands to be like him, mercifull, as he our heavenly Father is mercifull; to bear with one anothers infirmities: neither does reaſon and true wiſdome dictate any other to us, then that we ſhould do unto others, as we would be done unto our ſelves; that ſpirit therefore which is contrary to God, to reaſon, to the well-being of States, as the ſpirit of Perſecution evidently is; is moſt eſpecially to be watcht, and warily to be circumſcribed, and tied up by the wiſdome of the ſupream power in Common-wealths.

                  <p>In the laſt place they ſay, 'tis <hi>oppoſite to to the Covenant,</hi> 1.<hi>Becauſe oppoſite to the Reformation of Religion, according to the Word of God, and example of the beſt Reformed Churches.</hi>

                  <p>I anſwer, 1, That the example of the beſt reformed Churches is not binding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> further then they agree with the Word of God, ſo that the Word of God indeed is the only rule.

                  <p>2. <hi>They ſay it is deſtructive to the</hi> 3. <hi> Kingdomes neareſt conjunction and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Religion and Goverment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that the ſame tolleration may be allowed in the 3. Kingdomes, together with the ſame Religion and Government; whether it ſhall be Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, or Independent, or Anabaptiſticall: Beſides that I ſuppoſe which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended by this part of the Covenant, 'tis the Union of the 3. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and making them each deſenſive and helpfull to the other, which a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration will be a meanes to further, becauſe of the encouragement that every man will have to maintaine his ſo excellent freedome; which he cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do, then by maintaining them <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3. <hi>'Tis expreſly contrary to the extirpation of Schiſme, and whatſoever ſhall be found contrary to ſound doctrine, and the power of Godlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That when it is certainly determined by Judges that cannot err, who are the Schiſmaticks, there may be ſome ſeeming pretence to extirpate them, though then alſo no power or force is to be uſed, but lawfull means only, as the wiſe men have interpreted it; that is, Schiſme and Hereſie, when they appeare to be ſuch, are to be rooted out by reaſon and debate, the ſword of the Spirit, not of the Fleſh; arguments, not blowes: unto which men betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon diſtruſt of their own foundations, and conſciouſneſſe of their owne inability.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, as the Presbiters judge others to be a Schiſme from them, ſo others judge them to be a Schiſme from the Truth, in which ſence only the Covenant can be taken.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Hereby we ſhall be involved in the guilt of other mens ſinnes, and thereby be endangered to receive of their plagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that compulſion muſt neceſſarily occaſion both much cruelty and much Hypocriſie: whereof the Divines, labouring ſo much for the cauſe, which is perſecution, cannot be guiltleſſe.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>It ſeemes utterly impoſſible (if ſuch a tolleration ſhould be granted) that the Lord ſhould be one, and his name one, in the <hi>3.</hi> Kingdomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe they mean by that phraſe, it is impoſſible that our iudgements and profeſſion ſhould be one; ſo I believe it is, whether there be a Tolleration or no. But certainly the likelieſt way, if there be any thereunto, is by finding out oue truth; which moſt probably will be by giving libetty to every man to ſpeak his minde, and produce his reaſons and arguments; and not by hearing one Sect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113409:9"/>
That if it does produce a forc'd unity, it may be more probably in errour, then in truth; the Miniſters being not ſo likely to deal clearly in the ſearch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, becauſe of their intereſts, ar the Laity, who live not thereupon, but enquire for truth, for truths ſake, and the ſatisfaction of their own mindes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus I have done with the Argumentive part of the Letter. I ſhall onely deſire, that what I have ſaid may be without prejudice conſidered: And that the People would look upon all ſorts of men and writings, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not as they are repreſented by others, or foreſtall'd by a deceitfull rumour or opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this controverſie concerning Tolleration, I make no queſtion but the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will judge juſtly between the two parties; who have both the greateſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and abilities, to diſcern between the integrity of the one ſide, and the intereſt of the other. That the one party pleads for toleration, for the comfort and tranquility of their lives, and the peaceable ſerving of God according to their conſciences, in which they deſire no mans diſturbance. That the other that plead againſt it, may (I would I could ſay onely probably) be ſwayed by intereſt and ſelf-reſpects, their means and preheminence. I make no queſtion but the Parliament, before they proceed to a determination of matters concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will as they have heard one party, the Divines, ſo likewiſe reſerve one ear for all other ſorts of men; knowing that they that give ſentence, all partees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not heard, though the ſentence be juſt (which then likely will not be) yet they are unjuſt.

                  <p>I ſhall only add one word more concerning this Letter, which is this; That 'tis worth the obſervation, that the ſame men are part of the contrivers of it, and part of thoſe to whom 'twas ſent; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> being Preſident of Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Mr. <hi>Seaman</hi> one of the Deans, (obſerve that word) and Mr. <hi>Roborough,</hi> one of the Aſſiſtants, all three Members of the Synod: who with the reſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it ſeaſonably, and purpoſely to meet with the Letter from Scotland, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Church Government, may w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
