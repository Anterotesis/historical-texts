         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Before I come to the matter, I ſhall firſt ſhew the
manner of the diſcovering it, which was thus.</p>
            <p>On Munday, the 15. day of this November, I was in
my owne houſe at dinner at twelve of the clock, when
I had dined (having no imployments at the worke of my
calling) I tooke a little writing booke in my hand, which
formerly I had written, and did intend to peruſe it, and
correct ſome faults, and ſupply ſome things wanting,
but having no conveniency in my owne houſe, by reaſon
of the frowardneſſe of my childe, I thought beſt (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a calme day) to goe into a ſecret field not far off,
which formerly I had frequented for my owne private
meditations, the field lyeth above Oldſtreete, betweene
the way that commeth from the Peſt-houſe, and the way
that commeth from Brick-lane in Oldſtreete; all men
that uſe to goe that way, know that the firſt of thoſe
fields hath a common path, which goeth from the Kings-gate
at the further end of Brick-lane towards the Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
over againſt this path, all the way on the other
ſide of the field is a high banke caſt up, which on the
further ſide of it is ſhelving, like the ſide of a houſe
eaves, and on that ſide the path is, it is ſtraite downe
like a mudwall, with a little dry ditch caſt up on this
ſide.</p>
            <p>On <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he farther ſide of this banke, I walked a turne or
two, and as I had occaſion I ſtooped, and on my knee
wrote a word or two, and as I was ſtooping and writing,
I heard a man hem, which made me looke if I could ſee
him, and going ſoftly up the banke, I perceived in the
little ditch ſtood a couple of men, on the ſudden I began
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43207:3"/>
to retire to my former buſineſſe, but as I turned, I heard
them ſpeake of State affaires as I thought, which made
me ſtand ſtill to heare more, which when I had, I cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
my ſelfe cloſe on my knees, and on my elbowes,
with my head cloſe to the banke, where with much eaſe
I heard this following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall omit nothing that I can remember, but (as I
related it to the houſe of Parliament) only their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and bloody oathes, with which almoſt each ſentence
was uſhered in, the firſt I could underſtand was this:
as it followeth.</p>

               <p>What a wicked thing was it, that that plot did not

               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>

               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
               <p>For my part I doe not fully underſtand the
matter, for I came but laſt night to Town, and as ſoone
as I came to my Lords, they told me I muſt needs come
againe this morning; and when I came, I was conveyed
up into my Lords Chamber, and there was my Lord
and Father <hi>Iones,</hi> and Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes:</hi>
and Father <hi>Andrewes</hi>
related to me what ſervice I was for, but yet I
could not fully underſtand the ſcope of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I carried Letters into <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi>
and into <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and into <hi>Worceſterſhire;</hi> but I did
not know for what: but at one place I was bravely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
at Maſter <hi>Sh:</hi> as ſoone as ever hee read
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43207:4"/>
the Letter, hee cauſed me to be ſet to dinner; and when
I had dined, he gave me a Letter to deliver to my Lord,
and a piece for my ſelfe, and charged me to make all
ſpeed I could to <hi>London</hi> againe: but prethee why doſt
thou bring me to ſtand here?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I ſtand here, becauſe in yonder path (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <speaker>George.</speaker>
               <p>Tuſh, tuſh, prevaile; how can that be? being
we have ſo many friends, both in the Lower and the
upper Houſe; and when all theſe baſe Puritans are killed,
then on the ſudden all the Citie will be in a tumult,
and then on the inſtant will there be riſings in ſix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places of the Land, to my knowledge: in <hi>Bucking-hamſhire,</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>
(the other two places I remember not.)</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
               <p>Yea marry Sir, this ſounds well, if wee can
but eſcape, we ſhall all be made men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George.</speaker>
               <p>If wee eſcape wee ſhall bee brave fellowes;
Lords, and Knights, and Gentlemen; and wee have as
brave wayes to eſcape as ever men had; for wee can
quickly change our names, and our cloaths, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
too, and with that he plucked a falſe beard out of his
pocket, ſaying, am I the man I was; putting it on as I
conceive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
               <p>That is a dainty way indeed, we may thanke
Father <hi>Andrewes</hi> for that trick; for if we have but the
leaſt time, preſently we can change our ſhapes: but if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43207:4"/>
we ſhould be taken, 'tis but our lives, and then we ſhall
be Saints: for we to day tooke the holy Sacrament on
it, and were ſhrieved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>George.</speaker>
               <p>So did wee on Saterday, I was the 37. man,
and wee had forty ſhillings a man: and when that was
gone, we might come and fetch more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philip.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke I was the laſt of all: for after I was
in my Lords Chamber, I ſtaid till five more came; and
I undeſtood that Father <hi>Iones</hi> ſaid we were all, and I was
laſt ſet downe, and was the hundred and eight; and wee
had all forty ſhillings a peece, (ſhaking his pockets:)
but how cunning Father <hi>Iones</hi> was, hee ſet downe all
our names on the one ſide, and juſt againſt them the
names of them wee ſhould kill: but prethee who muſt
kill the Lords?</p>

               <p>O they bee brave fellowes in their Scarlet
Coates, and their Cloaks lined with Pluſh, they had
ten pounds a man; and if wee ſhould prevaile, we ſhall
every man have the Poſſeſſions and Lands of him that
we kil'd: there be foure <hi>Londoners</hi> Tradeſmen, that are
to kill the Puritan Citizens.</p>

               <p>I doe but thinke what a racket there will be
when this is done; though all be not killed, yet it will
make ſuch a tumult for the time, that it will make them
have little minde to ſend to <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>Ay, that was Father <hi>Andrewes</hi> his wit, to
prevent ſending to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I hope if they prevaile
there, we ſhall not need to feare here.</p>

               <p>Thou knoweſt him that thou art for ay, as
well as I know thee; and I (ſwearing moſt bloudily) will
be his death, though it coſt me my life a thouſand times;
(hee is a great fatguts fellow) either comming downe
ſtaires, or in their Coaches, or at any other place.</p>

Having ſpoken thus, he that they looked for (<hi>Dick
Iones</hi>) it ſeemeth did appeare, which cauſed <hi>George</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to leap up, ſaying, now he is comming; and by
his ſuddaine ſtarting, hee deſcried me on the other ſide
of the banke; which when he had, he deſperately ſware
he would end me firſt; and with that, ſtepping up the
banke on the ſudden, ere I could recover my legges,
(which were ſo nummed with kneeling, that indeed for
the time I could not ſtand) hee drew his rapier and ran
me through both my cloke, ſhort coat, breeches, ſhirt,
and breeches on the other ſide; and by the mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, ran betwixt my thighes, and yet did me
no hurt at all: ſo thinking he had ended me (for indeed
I lay ſtill, being in ſuch a ſudden feare with the fight,
and hearing him ſpeak ſo bloudily, and fearing a ſecond
blow) he leaped backe againe, and ran away out of my
ſight, before ever I could recover my ſenſes to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
which way hee ran; but as ſoone as ever I came to
my ſelfe, I poſted to the Parliament Houſe, and firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
it to Alderman <hi>Somes;</hi> he and Maſter <hi>Pymme</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Lower Houſe of it, where I was examined, and
afterward in the Lords Houſe three ſeverall times; and
ſince that the place hath beene ſeriouſly viewed, both
by Lords and Commons, and the truth made apparant,
and I hope ſome of the Plotters taken; which I pray
God they may bee, if it pleaſe him, for Jeſus
Chriſt his ſake: to whom bee praiſe
for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
