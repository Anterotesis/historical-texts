            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE COPY OF A LETTER Sent from Shirbourne relating the skirmiſh betweene the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> and the Cavalliers there.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have now lighted on a fair oppertunity to returne you kinde greetings by this Gentleman, who (I believe) is like to be one of the firſt that can give you a true information of what befell at <hi>Shirbourne</hi> on Saturday laſt, where (with griefe of heart) he beheld the ſad worke of that day, which from his mouth I tooke as neere as I could poſſibly, leaſt his ſhort abode in <hi>London</hi> (as he telleth me) ſhould not give him time to viſit you himſelfe, (his haſte and buſineſſe you may well gueſſe) not brooking any delay or loſſe of time.</p>
            <p>Vpon Friday laſt (I take it the firſt day of <hi>September)</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> marched to <hi>Shirbourne,</hi> with about five thouſand horſe and foot under his command, unto whom fifteene hundred more from <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> (but came out of <hi>Devonſhire)</hi> did joyne themſelves, having in their march thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by their over careleſſe looking to their powder, blowne up foure of their poore ſouldiers, and hurt ten more, which they ſent backe againe to <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> With this power of about ſix thouſand men in all, the Lord Generall pitched his Campe within a mile and a halfe of <hi>Shirbourne,</hi> behinde a hill, in the evening upon friday ſending out ſome ſallyes of horſe to ſcoure and view the coaſts, that he might be ſecured from danger at his backe, while he wholly bent his forces upon the good worke in hand, that night ſome of his ſouldiers being weary of lying in the open field two nights together, and having eaten nothing upon Wedendſday, and on Thurſday but one meale, and their proviſion being not ſo good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as was to be deſired, did get away from him, but not any conſiderable number, upon ſatterday in the forenoon he marched with all his forces towards <hi>Shirbourne</hi> Townes-end, and in the way the ordinance from the Caſtle, being diſcharged againſt him ſomewhat endammaged him, ſome few of his horſe being then loſt, but no number conſiderable, then marching to the Towne, at the Townes-end divers Musketiers out of ditches and pits played very hotly upon his men upon all ſides on a ſudden, and annoied them very much, but not ſo much as ſome have reported, who report not alwayes according to truth, but according to their malignant wiſhes and deſires, from which God deliver us, the truth is, that it was Gods pleaſure to ſuffer ſome men on our ſide to be ſlayne, about two hundred, but not many above that number. The Cavalliers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hidden themſelves for the moſt part in pits and ditches, whence they did this miſchiefe, for had they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, I believe they had not carried it with ſo little loſſe as the hurt only of foure of their men, for they ſay they loſt none, &amp; this was the paſſage of that ſorrowful day, which with grief of heart I have acquainted you with, leaſt you ſhould be deluded with other falſe relations more to our prejudice then the loſſe of that day. The night being come, very many ſouldiers got them away being weary, but we doubt not but they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſpeedily when they have poore ſoules a little refreſhed themſelves, then they will be better able and more ſerviceable then ever before; the next day being the ſabboth, the Cavalliers in the Caſtle did not much ſtir that I heare of, but our men got them away apace, and crawled of all foure through the corne, at laſt the Generall cauſed the horſe to encompaſſe them to keepe them in, and then the Cavalliers from the Caſtle did ſome hurt among the horſe, but the next day my Lord finding his numbers much decreaſed, for he had but a thouſand or leſſe now left, reſolved to returne to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> where he is at this preſent, but he burnt two houſes at the Townes end before he went, and a ricke of hay, which with the corne that is tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will be a thouſand pounds loſſe to the Cavalliers and their adherents, that ungodly <hi>Lunsford</hi> and his Brother is here among them, God deliver us from ſuch bloody butchers, and ſend us peace if it be his will. This Marqueſſe is now three thouſand ſtrong, but I doubt not but the wiſedome of the Parliament will ſoon rid us of him and his ungracious Cavalliers: I have no more to write, but ſhortly you ſhall heare from me, in the meane time be not disheartned, for I am confident my next letter will afford you more comfortable tidings, for we daily expect ſuch ſtrong ſupplies as will ſoon ſend theſe bloody Cavalliers packing from the reſt.</p>
