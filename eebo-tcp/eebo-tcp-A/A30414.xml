         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so constant, but that it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of some exception; and
therefore though the Wiseman
after all his experience, his most searching
Observations, and the great prospect he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64571:4"/>
had of the order of second Causes, and the
temper of mens minds, does pronounce,
<hi>there was nothing new under the Sun:</hi> Yet
this day, and that never-enough-lamented
Villany we now remember, must put in for
an exception from that rule, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
exceed all the common measures of
wickedness so far; that as there is nothing
in any History like it, so when the World
is some Ages older (if such an action be
not an <hi>Omen</hi> that its end is near) this will
scarce gain credit, but be looked on as the
Tragical contrivance of some deeply-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
wit. Some Princes have been by
their prevailing Conquerors put to death,
others have been assassinated by their own
Subjects. But to see a Soveraign Prince
brought to the Pageantry of a Mock-trial,
and by a Court made up of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on a pretence of Justice sentenced to
lose his life; not in the corner of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Prison, but in the chief City of his
Dominions, and in the most eminent place
of it, is an evidence of the degeneracy of
the age we live in, that would dare to act
what in former ages none would have
thought on.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Phocas</hi> did to the Emperour <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64571:4"/>
is the nearest parallel to it which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
offers, but comes far short of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; for neither were the Rights of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperours derived by so clear a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor so long a Descent as our <hi>Royal
Martyr</hi>'s were; and so no wonder if those
who rose by the sword did also fall by it.
Nor did <hi>Phocas</hi> so far affront Justice as to
pretend to put his Master to a Trial, and
<hi>Mauritius</hi> had by so base an avarice expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so many of his Soldiers to be cut off,
and used the rest so ill, that no wonder they
in their fury against him were guilty of so
foul a Conspiracy. But how much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitly
wicked was the crime we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
when a Prince (whose Rights were
devolved on him, by so many Titles, the
<hi>British,</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> and the
<hi>Scotish</hi> Races, having all united in him,
(who had also in his whole Government
shewed that deep sense of Religion with a
most tender regard to the good and quiet of
his Subjects) was against all the rules of
Justice, and yet upon some colours of it
brought to so publick a death. But as <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
as basely treacherous and wicked as he
was, was most ignominiously and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
courted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64571:5"/>
who writes to him in a stile of so mean and
servile flattery, that it justly stains all the
other good Qualities of that Prelate. And
his Successor <hi>Boniface</hi> did yet more meanly
comply, and got himself declared by him
the Universal Bishop of the Church. From
which we may judg of that See, by vvhat
arts they are resolved to rise and to make
use of the worst of men if they can but
serve their turn. So in this Regicide, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was vouched, and God appealed to.
And indeed it was no wonder that these
treated his Vicegerents so coarsely, that
made so bold with God himself, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he was their Patron and warrant in
what they did. And perhaps if these act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
had as fully complied with him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be Christs Vicegerent as <hi>Phocas</hi>
did, he had as plainly justified their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> did, which might
have been far rather looked for now, after
all the opinions some of their Emissaries
have broached, of murdering Princes, then
at that time when their corruptions were but
a-forming, and their ambition was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to fly at Supremacy and Universal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
                  <p>But is all our work only to reflect with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64571:5"/>
some horrour on this infamous action? have
we no other concern in this Day? The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
tells us, <hi>That the sins of this Nation have
been the cause which hath brought this heavy
judgment upon us.</hi> We also pray, <hi>That this
our land be freed from the vengeance of his
blood.</hi> And indeed had not our sins been
great, so that the cup of our iniquities was
quite full, it could not have run over in a
tract of a long Civil War, which brought
along with it so much bloodshed, rapine and
contempt of all things sacred and humane;
and all was compleated in this crime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which wickedness could go no higher.
Those who were so nobly and generously
loyal as to serve his late <hi>Majesty</hi> of most
blessed memory, do with a just glorying
rejoyce in the reflection on their past Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
yet let me crave leave to offer even to
them how far they ought to be concerned
in mourning and fasting on this Occasion. It
was our contempt of God and Religion, our
being purely formal in our Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
our forgetting to acknowledg God
the author of our Peace and Plenty, our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
these by excess and riot, that brought
on those sad and unheard-of Judgments. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the much-abused words of the late
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64571:6"/>
time were Incendiary and Incendiarism; but
those were the great Incendiaries that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gods wrath, and it is from such that we
may justly fear the like, or rather severer
Judgments, if our sins now be greater than
they were then: Therefore the lamenting
and repenting of these sins, by which what
is past may be forgiven, and what may be
feared be prevented, being the proper work
of this day; I come now to consider my
Text, and what reflections may be drawn
from it, though in a case so much without
a precedent as this is, it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that a Text wholly pertinent can be
pickt up. But we shall make the most of
this we can, and consider three things in
it.</p>
                  <p>First, This King whose Death was so
much lamented, and in what particulars
he was a Parallel, and in what not, of our
Royal Martyr.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What reason <hi>David</hi> with the
rest of the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had to mourn
for his Death, and how far that agrees with
our case.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How they expressed their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and how far their example calls on us
to imitate it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64571:6"/>
For the first, it was <hi>Saul</hi> the Son of <hi>Kish,</hi>
whom God had by the hands of <hi>Samuel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be King of <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had that respect, that even when he was
most unjustly hunting his life, yet he would
not stretch forth his hand against him, seeing
he was <hi>the anointed of the Lord.</hi> And in this
our Royal Martyr was his Parallel, since he
was, by a tract of an undisputed Succession,
that which <hi>Saul</hi> was by immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the <hi>Lord's Anointed.</hi> And indeed he
looked on himself as having his Authority
from God, as will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
instances, (which before I mention I
must preface with this) that I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
on the whole field of that Murdered
Princes Vertues; for that were both end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
they being so many, and needless, they
being so well known: But having by a great
happiness seen not a few (I may add hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of) Papers under his own Royal
Pen; I shall only now offer divers passages
drawn out of those that vvill give some
Characters of his great Soul. And as in the
<hi>Indies</hi> the Art of Painting is only the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together little Plumes of several co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
in such method as to give a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of vvhat they design; vvhich though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64571:7"/>
it be but coarse vvork yet the Colours are
lively; so I can promise no exact vvork,
but true and lively Colours I vvill offer,
being those mixed by our Martyr himself,
though perhaps unskilfully placed by me.
And as the Popish Legend tells of tvvo
Pictures of our Saviour done by himself, one
particularly vvhich he left in <hi>Veronica</hi>'s
Handkercher vvhen he vviped his face vvith
it; so from the svveat of our Royal Martyr
some Lineaments of his Face shall be offered.
And to return to make good the character
of our late Soveraign, he ovvned all his
Authority to be derived from God; and
therefore in one of his Papers I find these
vvords, vvhen he is acknovvledging the
<hi>great blessings, and eminent protection he had
received from the hands of the Almighty, he
adds; To whom we know we must yield a dear
account for any breach of trust, or failing of
our duty towards our People.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paper reflecting on the Demand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Militia,</hi> he gives the reason vvhy
he could not consent to it as it vvas propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<hi>Because thereby he wholly divested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(as he conceived) of the power of the
Sword intrusted to him by God and the Laws
of the Land for the Protection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64571:7"/>
of his People, thereby at once disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Posterity of that Right and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Crown, which is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the Kingly-Office, and so weakening
Monarchy in this Kingdom, that little more
than the name and shadow of it will remain.</hi>
In another Paper he expresses his zeal to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Lavvs, as became Gods Vicegerent,
in these vvords: <hi>If we wanted the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we cannot the discretion, to tempt God in
au unjust quarrel, the Laws of our Kingdom
shall be sacred to us, we shall refuse no hazard
to defend them, but sure we shall run none to
invade them.</hi> And that Paper vvhich is very
long, he thus concludes, <hi>God so deal with
us and our Posterity, as we shall inviolably
observe the Laws and Statutes of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Protestations we have so often
made for the Defence of the true Reformed
Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land,
and the just Priviledges and Freedom of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From these Evidences it will appear what
severe thoughts he had of the Obligations
he lay under to Almighty God, from whom
he had his power, and to whom he knew
he was to give account of his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

2. We find it is said of <hi>Saul,</hi> that after
he was anointed, God gave him another
heart, and that meeting a company of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
he prophesied to the astonishment of
those that beheld him. How much of this
Divine Spirit rested on our Blessed Martyr,
all those Meditations which were his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
in his retirement do abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
If by <hi>Saul</hi>'s prophesying be meant
the foretelling what was to come, I meet
somewhat very near it from his Royal Pen,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1642, in a Letter, wherein he writes
these words; <hi>I have set up my rest on the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of my cause, being resolved that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
or misfortune shall make me yield; for
I will either be a Glorious King, or a Patient
Martyr; and as yet not being the first, and at
present not apprehending the other, I think it
now no unfit time to express this my resolution
to you.</hi> A very overly observer will see much
in these words, even without a Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Or, if by prophesying be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
an elevated way of trusting in God,
and adoring him, then I shall add what I
find under the same Sacred Pen, when he
was at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> in a Letter to one of his
Subjects: <hi>Know that I rather expect the
worse than the better event of things; being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64571:8"/>
resolved (by the Grace of God and without
the least repining at him) to suffer any thing
that injury can put upon me rather than sin
against my Conscience.</hi> And in another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Now for the sad consequences I know no
so good antidote as a good Conscience, which
by the Grace of God I will preserve whatever
else happen to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Character we have of <hi>Saul</hi> is that
he was very careful to protect his Subjects
when in danger; as appears both by his haste
to relieve <hi>Iabish-Gilead</hi> when sore pur to
it by the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
against the <hi>Philistines</hi> with so much
Personal danger to himself and his Family.
Now what our Martyrs zeal for protecting
his Subjects was, (I speak not of his care in
protecting the oppressed Protestants in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> which I leave to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians)
I shall make appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Evidences. What vast Concessions
he made to his native Kingdom every body
knows; and therefore he concluded a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
he signed on his Pacification with them
in these words: <hi>And as we have just reason to
believe that to our peaceable and well-affected
Subjects this will be satisfactory; so we take
God and the World to witness that whatever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64571:9"/>
Calamities shall ensue by our necessitated sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of the Insolencies of such as shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their disobedient Courses, is not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by us, but by their own procurement.</hi>
And in a Letter to one of his Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
there he writes: <hi>But if the madness of
our Subjects be such, that they will not rest
satisfied with what we have given you power
to condescend to; which notwithstanding all
their Insolencies we still allow you to make
good to them; We take God to witness that
what misery soever fall to that Country here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
it is no fault of ours but their own
procurement.</hi> And in another Letter at that
same time: <hi>We take God to witness we have
permitted them to do many things for estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Peace contrary to our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
How far he complied with their most
unreasonable desires to the very great dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions
of his Royal Authority is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When he saw them inclined to engage
in the Civil War in this Kingdom, he left
no mean unessayed to satisfie even all their
jealousies and fears; and therefore in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
under his own Pen he writes these
words:</hi> We do conjure all our good Subjects
of that our Native Kingdom, by the long happy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64571:9"/>
and uninterrupted Government of us and our
Royal Progenitors over them, by the memory
of these many large and publick Blessings
they enjoyed under our dear Father, by these
ample favours and benefits they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from us, not to suffer themselves to be
misled and corrupted in their affections and
duty to us by the cunning malice and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of these Incendiaries.</p>
                  <p>And when he heard these dismal news
of that most barbarous Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
with what zeal he set about the sending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to them may appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words of one of his Letters to one in
his Native Kingdom after he had lamented
the miseries and afflictions, to which his <hi>good
Subjects in</hi> Ireland <hi>were reduced through the
inhumane and unheard-of cruelties of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
there;</hi> and had regrated the delays of
sending supplies to them through the distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>England;</hi> he adds: <hi>So that if some
extraordinary course be not taken for their
present supply, it is not like their miseries
will end sooner their days.</hi> Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
them to haste the sending over their
Forces, assuring them, That if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> did not punctually pay
them, he would engage his own Revenue,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64571:10"/>
rather than delay so good and so necessary
a work; and that he would issue out such
Warrants under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi>
and grant all their other desires which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could be demanded for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. And after that, seeing that work
went on slowly, he was resolved to have
gone in person to have carried it on more
vigorously, and to have hazarded himself
that he might preserve his People. But fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that Resolution gave great Jealousies
to those who censured him whatever he did,
he gave it over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How careful he was to prevent a Rupture
in this Nation, not only his great Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
prove, but his constant offers of Treaty,
even when things went prosperously with
him, do demonstrate, therefore reflecting
on this in a Paper (under his own Pen) he
writes;</hi> We denied not any thing, but what
by the known Law was unquestionably our
own, we earnestly desired and pressed a Treaty,
that so we might but know at what price we
might prevent the miseries and desolations that
was threatned; but this was absolutely and
scornfully refused and rejected. <hi>And in a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
which though it was never sent, yet
remains under his hand, he writes these
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64571:10"/>
words:</hi> And now he conjures his two Houses
of Parliament as they are Englishmen, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and lovers of Peace, by the duty they
owe their King, and by the bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
they have towards their fellow-subjects,
that they will accept of these offers, whereby
the joyful news of Peace may be again restored
to this languishing Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And thus far the Parallel of <hi>Saul</hi> and
our <hi>Martyred King</hi> hath held good, but
now they must depart from one another;
and it shall appear how our late Soveraign
was on many accounts hugely preferable to
the King lamented in my Text; yet I shall
name one particular in which <hi>Saul</hi> had the
better of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> had by his rash Oath endangered
<hi>Ionathan</hi>'s life, which he seemed resolved
to execute, but the earnest intercessions of
his People prevailed on him to change these
his severe and cruel resolutions. But alas!
our Martyr having firmly resolved to save
a person he judged innocent, and clear of
the Treason charged on him, did to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the most pressing desires of his
People, consent to the putting him to
death: We have seen his fault and the
specious colours that led him to it, next let
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64571:11"/>
me lay before you his Repentance, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by himself in a Letter, <hi>Anno 1642. One
thing more, which but for the Messenger were
too much to trust to Paper, the failing to one
friend hath indeed gone very near me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am resolved that no consideration whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall ever make me do the like upon this
ground. I am certain that God hath either so
totally forgiven me, that he will still bless
this good cause in my hands, or that all my
punishment shall be in this world, which
without performing what I have resolved</hi> I
<hi>cannot flatter my self will end here.</hi> And he
ends that Letter thus: <hi>Beside generosity, to
which</hi> I <hi>pretend a little, my Conscience will
make me stick to my friends.</hi> How deep his
sense of that sin, how great his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Judgments of God, and how
true his notion of Repentance was, cannot
but easily appear upon the first hearing these
words.</p>
                  <p>But for this one advantage, the King in
my Text had of the King of the Day, we
shall find many great and noble Characters
in which he excelled him.</p>
                  <p>And first, <hi>Saul</hi> pretended some zeal for
God, he built an Altar for him; he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Samuel</hi> his Prophet, he went and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64571:11"/>
the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> but when it might
serve his turn he did not stick to disobey
God, he saved <hi>Agag,</hi> and much of the
spoil of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> pretending it was
preserved for offering Sacrifices. He had
not patience to stay for <hi>Samuel,</hi> but did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously
offer the Sacrifice himself. But
our Martyr did not only express great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to God in his Prosperity by many high
marks of his zeal and constant attendance
on the Worship of God; his great esteem
of all worthy and deserving Churchmen, and
his Royal bounty to the advancing all pious
and religious purposes: But by his constant
and firm adhering to those Rights of the
Church, and to all he judged himself bound
in Conscience to maintain; therefore it was
that he did choose to bear the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
rather than sin against his Conscience.
When the violence of his Native Subjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Order of Bishops had brought
things to that pass that it could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without much blood and confusion,
he judged that God loved mercy better
than sacrifice, did give way to their fury;
but with that tender care that became a
man of so severe and exact a Conscience;
and this shall appear by some evidences I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64571:12"/>
go to mention. Having signed a Paper of
Concessions, wherein he had used the word,
<hi>it pleased him,</hi> reflecting on the importance
of that, he wrote the following words in a
Letter to him that had the managing of
that business: <hi>I must desire you to alter one
word, that I should not be thought to desire
the abolishing of that in</hi> Scotland, <hi>which I
approve and maintain in</hi> England. <hi>Now the
word</hi> content <hi>expresses enough my consent to
have them surcease for the present. But the
word,</hi> pleased, <hi>methinks imports as much as
if I desired them to take them away, or at least
that I were well pleased they should do so: But
I leave it to your ordering, so that you make
it be clearly understood that though I permit,
yet I would be better pleased they let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
And in the Instructions he gave his
Commissioner for consenting to the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Order of Bishops, he wrote thus:
<hi>Carry the Disputes so, that the conclusion seem
not to be made in prejudice of Episcopacy as
unlawful, but only in satisfaction to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and for setling the present disorders, and
such other reasons of State.</hi> And he likewise
ordered him to take care, <hi>that Episcopacy
should not be abjured as a point of Popery,
contrary to Gods Law, or the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64571:12"/>
And at the same time in a Letter to
the Primate of that Church he wrote thus:
<hi>We do assure you that it shall be still one of
our chiefest studies, how to rectifie and estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Government of that Church aright.</hi>
And he adds a little after, <hi>You may rest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that though perhaps we give way for
the present to that which will be prejudicial,
both to the Church and our own Government,
yet we will not leave thinking in time how to
remedy both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After God in his wise and holy, though
to us unaccountable Counsels, suffered the
Rebellious Arms of his Enemies so far to
prevail, that nothing did promise any hopes
of his being re-established on his Throne,
but the consenting to all the demands of
these in whose hands he had cast himself,
then did the strict care he had to keep a
good Conscience appear, by his hazarding
all things rather than endanger his inward
quiet; and therefore he told them:</hi> That
when he was satisfied in his Conscience with
the lawfulness of what they desired, then, but
not till then, could he grant their demands;
<hi>and was willing to enter in conference with
any they would appoint about these two
Points, the one being the Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64571:13"/>
of Bishops, and the other his being
obliged to defend them by his Oath of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation.
And the account of one of his
Discourses I have seen, is thus:</hi> That he
would run the hazard of all his Crowns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
rather than endanger that above; and
that though the quiet of his Kingdoms, and
the settlement of his Throne were very valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet the peace of his Conscience must be
preferred by him to all things. <hi>And in a
Discourse he had, which he wrote with his
own Pen, he used these words:</hi> Not to stay
you too long upon so unpleasing a subject; I
assure you that nothing but the preservation of
that which is dearer to me than my life, could
have hindered me from giving you full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
for upon my word all the dangers and
inconveniences which you have laid before me
do not so much trouble me, as that I cannot
give full satisfaction to the desires of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country; especially being so earnestly
pressed upon me: And yet here again I must
tell you (for in this case repetitions are not
impertinent) that I do not give you a denial;
nay, I protest against it, and remember it is
your King that desires to be heard. <hi>And in
another Paper he sent to those that gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
then in his Native Kingdom, he writes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64571:13"/>
these words:</hi> If it be so clear, as you believe,
that Episcopacy is unlawful, I doubt not but
God shall so enlighten mine eyes, that I shall
soon perceive it; and then I <hi>promise you to
concur</hi> with you fully in matters of Religion;
<hi>and therefore he subjoyns,</hi> He hopes they
would not press him to do that which was yet
against his Conscience, until he might do it
without sinning. <hi>And he concluded that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with a Postscript to the Ministers:</hi> That
he hoped they, as Ministers of Gods Word,
would not press upon him untimeously the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Church-government, until (<hi>he adds</hi>) I
may have leisure to be so perswaded, that I
may comply with what they desire without
breach of Conscience; which I am confident
they, as Church-men cannot press me to do.
<hi>And in these conscientious Resolutions he
was so firm, that in a private Letter he
writes thus:</hi> For Gods sake do not so much as
expect, much less linger after any other or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter from me; for upon the faith of a
Christian you shall have no more than what is
now laid before you. <hi>And in another Letter:</hi>
As for your Covenant, when, and not before,
that I shall be satisfied in my Conscience that
I may allow it, I will. <hi>He going on grounds
so strict and well-pleasing to God, it was no
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64571:14"/>
wonder he maintained that serenity of mind,
that when he got Letters that told him how
he was to be used, being engaged at Chess,
he continued to play after he had read his
Letters, without shew of any commotion or
disturbance, which I have seen under the
hand of an eye-witness. And in the Moneth
of</hi> March <hi>before his Martyrdom, when he
was almost out of all hopes; yet he would
not depart from these Christian Resolutions,
which I find thus expressed by his own Pen:</hi>
For any enlargement concerning Church-affairs
I desire you not to expect it from me, for such
expectations have been a great cause of this
my present condition, which I assure you I am
still resolved rather to suffer than to wrong my
Conscience or Honour, which I must do if I
enlarge my self any thing in these points. <hi>These
are some of the true Characters of a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Faith; of one that did approve
himself to be under God and Christ, the
Supreme over the Church, and of one that
was indeed fitted to bear all things, rather
than sin against God or his Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Another Character of <hi>Saul</hi> is his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
which was so enraged that he spared
neither Son-in-law nor Son, but threw his
darts at them to have killed them, and his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64571:14"/>
cruelty against <hi>David</hi> was also joined with
perfidy and breach of trust; for after he
had given him the most sacred assurances,
he still continued to pursue him, and caused
to be murdered fourscore and five Priests
for the pretended fault of one which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
upon the delation of an <hi>Edomite.</hi> This
was a fact both so cruel and so impious, that
he could find none to execute it, but that
uncircumcised Alien, and all this was the
effect of that evil Spirit was let loose upon
him, when by his sins he had driven away
the good Spirit of God. But our Royal
Martyr did daily shew more and more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of a truly Divine and Christian Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
What full Indemnity and Oblivion did
he offer his Enemies! even though they
would not allow any Indemnity to his
Friends. And how much he was against all
cruel or severe practices may appear from
these Evidences; one is under his own hand,
in these words: <hi>The present distractions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion are so great, and of that nature,
that perswasion as well as power must be used
to restore that happy tranquillity which the
Church of</hi> England <hi>hath lately and miserably
lost; for certainly violence and persecution
never was nor will be found a right way to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64571:15"/>
settle peoples Consciences.</hi> And this went so
far with him, as to give him a strong aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the excuting sanguinary Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
even the Emissaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
I find he thus expresses in a Paper written
with his own Pen: <hi>Concerning</hi> Goodman <hi>the
Priest, the reason why I reprieved him is, that,
as I am informed, neither Queen</hi> Elizabeth,
<hi>nor my Father, did ever allow that any Priest
in their times was executed meerly for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which to me seems to be this particular
case; yet seeing I am pressed by both Houses
to give way to his Execution, because I will
avoid the inconvenience of giving so great a
discontentment to my People, as I perceive
this mercy may produce, I remit this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
case to both Houses; but I desire you to
take unto your serious consideration the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
which, as I conceive, may upon this
occasion fall upon my Subjects and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
abroad; especially since it may seem
to other States to be a severity with surprize;
which I, having thus represented, do think my
self discharged from all ill consequences, that
may ensue upon the execution of this person.</hi>
For his fidelity in observing his Treaties, I
have already in another branch of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
mentioned some passages that shew
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64571:15"/>
how religiously he resolved to observe them;
and his refusing to serve his Interests by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
which how useful soever they might
have been to him, yet since he could not
with a good Conscience observe them, he
would not make them, shews how sacred
he accounted all his Promises; and his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to quit the command of the <hi>Militia,</hi>
either for a determinate number of years, or
for his whole life, shews how carefully he
intended to observe all he promised; since
he was willing to give such a security, which
as it was strong, so it diminished his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the most tender and most sacred part
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I shall to these add only one instance.
When he saw those of his Native Kingdom
engaging in the War against him, in this
Kingdom, it is obvious enough how much
the securing</hi> Berwick <hi>might have advanced
his service, and his Armies in the North
could easily have done it; yet since by the
Treaty with that Kingdom it was not to be
garrisoned; so religiously did he observe
the Treaty, that he would not put a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
in it: But that fidelity was not minded
by those who conspired against him, who
did, notwithstanding the Treaty, Garrison
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64571:16"/>
the place; upon which occasion he wrote
what follows:</hi> No industry hitherto could
have so far prevailed with us as to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any belief that our <hi>Scotch</hi>-Subjects would
countenance, much less assist this bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>England;</hi> yet we know not how to
understand the levying Forces both Foot and
Horse within our Native Kingdom, and their
entering the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> in a hostile
manner. Our most malicious Enemies must
bear us witness, how religiously we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
these Articles on our part; whereas if
we had not been more tender, than the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of this breach have been, of the Publick
Faith, it is obvious to any how easily we could
have secured that Town from all Rebels. <hi>And
after he had refuted the Pretence they made
use of, he adds:</hi> Such then as shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under that pretext, will find from thence
but a slender warrant before God, who knows
the integrity of our heart, and how inviolably
we intend to preserve all that we have granted
that Kingdom, so long as they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be capable of our Protection, and
those favours. <hi>He likewise wrote in another
Letter at that same time these words:</hi> Such
high indignities to us, and to our Authority
make us believe they have forgot they have a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64571:16"/>
King, and their Oaths in preserving us in
our just power, as their King. But God will
discover and punish such undutiful thoughts,
how closely soever they be clouded with preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of safety to Religion and Liberty, which
they know will be ever dearer to us than our
own preservation.</p>
                  <p>3. And to close up this Parallel, <hi>Saul</hi>
when in danger, betook himself to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
Arts, and went to the <hi>Witch at Endor,</hi>
to ask Responses about the event of that
Battel he was to give the <hi>Philistines,</hi> not
considering how he had provoked God to
withdraw his protection from him, and that
all the powers of Hell, and evil Spirits were
no longer able to preserve him; and having
got a sad answer to his over-curious Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(the common fate of all who will by
these forbidden Arts thrust into the secrets
of the Divine Councels), we find him wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
faint-hearted, sore afraid, fall flat on
the ground and refuse to eat. And after
that fatal Battel he had neither the courage
to out-live it, nor the strength to finish his
desperate design upon himself; but after he
had fallen on his own Sword, he called an
<hi>Amalekite</hi> to compleat that Self-murder,
which he begun by his falling on his Sword,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64571:17"/>
and finished by these cruel Orders he gave.
But nothing of all this belongs to our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Martyr, who depended on God, and
submitted to his will in the course of all his
Councels, both of Peace and War; And
when it pleased God for the punishment of
his People, to expose him to the malice and
cruelty of his Enemies, even then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
more than Conquerour; and according
to the prospect he had of it long before, he
was a <hi>Patient Martyr:</hi> Nor did he express
the least meanness of spirit when brought
lowest, he would neither give up the Rights
of the Church nor the Crown, of People
nor Parliaments, to their insulting pride,
who trampling on all Laws Sacred and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
had made themselves the sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Masters of his Person and Power. And
as he was not cowardly or languid under all
his misfortunes, so he maintained his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as long as he was able, and did not
faintly despond, nor abandon his own
Rights, or the Protection of his People. But
this leads me to the sad part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
wherein I am to compare the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
we have for mourning, with these <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and it will be easily allowed, ours
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64571:17"/>
must be by so much the greater, by how
much our Royal Martyr did exceed their
King, which hath been demonstrated in the
Parallel I have given.</p>
                  <p>First, This Kings Death was his own
Deed; and though the Victory his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
got, drave him to that despair, yet
none of the People were of accession to it:
and for the <hi>Amalekite</hi> (if his relation was
true) as it was an Alien from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
that did it; so <hi>Saul</hi> was well
served for not destroying the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> as
<hi>Samuel</hi> had commanded him; therefore
they had no particular reason to be sorry,
but only because they had lost a King, who
as he was none of the worst, so he was far
from being one of the best Princes. Perhaps
<hi>David</hi> had some more reason to fast and
mourn, and as his Conscience did before
accuse him for cutting off the Hem of his
Garment; so now the Arms he bare against
him did trouble his Conscience. For though
much may be said for <hi>David</hi> in that case, he
was the designed heir of the Crown by Gods
appointment; he was very unjustly and
perfidiously used by <hi>Saul;</hi> he had kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on a pure defensive, and <hi>Saul</hi>'s being
frenetick and possessed with an evil spirit,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64571:18"/>
are great justifications of <hi>David</hi>'s little
Army, or rather Guard; and his being a
Man according to Gods heart, ought to
possess all with that esteem for him, as not
easily to find fault with him, or with any
of his actions; yet his Army being made up
of men distressed, in debt, and disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is a shrewd Indication, that the Cause
was not over-good when he had such a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Besides, his going to live at <hi>Gath</hi>
with the Uncircumcised, his cutting off the
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> and pretending to <hi>Achish</hi> that
he had destroyed his own People by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
deceit; and finally his going out
with the Armies of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
a great desire to fight against the
Enemies of <hi>Achish,</hi> who were no other but
<hi>Saul,</hi> his natural liege-Lord, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Israel</hi> (wherein he either acted a
very unsincere part, or did really resolve to
have engaged against them) are things so
manifestly contrary to the Laws of God,
that they give a strong presumption, that
the whole business of his taking Armes was
contrary to Law and Religion. But I shall
not enter further into the Dispute, and so
leave it; inclining rather to believe, that
<hi>David</hi>'s Conscience did accuse him, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64571:18"/>
failed in his Duty to <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after all this our Case is much more
justly deplorable, who did not lose our
King by the prevailing power of a hostile
Invasion, but by the unnatural hands of
his own Subjects, who were (both by the
tye of Subjection, by their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
which many of them had sworn, and
by their constant professions of fighting for
the King, and in defence of his Authority,
as they gave it out, for training in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
by so deceitful a bait), tyed to the
preservation of his person, and yet did wash
their hands in his blood; and by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Religion and Justice, in a Fact so
contrary to both, did (as much as in them
lay) bring the foulest imputations on both
that could be. How did this open the
mouths of the Adversaries of our Religion,
(whom we had justly charged for their sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and treasonable Doctrines) to insult
over us; but without all cause: for as all
the Reasons pretended, were but upon the
matter the same with those their Doctors
have published, allowing but a small change;
so those of our true and soundly reformed
Church did abominate so foul a Crime, with
all possible horrour; and, as was most just,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64571:19"/>
did both in publick and private declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and with a generous and truly
Christian constancy, endured Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Imprisonments, and every thing which
that insulting Power put them to, rather
than comply with so vile an Action and its
vile Actors.</p>
                  <p>But to all this it may be said, Let these
mourn who were of accession to it, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
not us. To which I must answer, That
such publick Crimes leave a guilt upon the
whole Nation, which therefore must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
with a publick universal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And if in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> God
declared, that Blood was a crying sin which
called to Heaven for vengeance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a Murder was discovered, and the
Murderer was not known, there was to be
a Sacrifice for the whole People to expiate
the guilt; how much more in a Crime, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with so many foul and black Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
ought we by earnest Prayers to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to avert these Judgments, which we may
but too justly apprehend!</p>
                  <p>And to this let me add, that there are
not so many innocent as those perhaps ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
for as <hi>David</hi> here did (it is probable)
charge himself for arming against the Lords
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64571:19"/>
Anointed; so what reason have these who
engaged in Opposition, and Arms to our
Royal Martyr, to charge and judg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they be not judged of the Lord;
who not being satisfied with those great and
large Concessions, he freely and willingly
offered, did pursue his Person and Life in
the Field; after which it was no wonder
others learned to pursue him to the Scaffold.
May not the one be said to have killed the
King that robbed him of his Revenue, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and Authority, and every thing was
necessary for the maintenance of the Royal
Dignity; whereas the other did but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Charles,</hi> after he was spoiled of his
Royal Power, and the Government taken
out of his hands: Though in a formal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry
Writs were issued in his Name. And
thus we find the grounds of our mourning
grow larger, and take, or rather call in, more
mourners.</p>
                  <p>But in fine, by another advance, a great
many more will be comprized within this
Duty, even all those who did not with the
most vigorous opposition was possible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this barbarous Regicide; which made
a foreign Historian, giving account of it,
say, it was a wonder how <hi>Englishmen</hi> could
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64571:20"/>
look on and behold so barbarous and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled
a Crime: Where were the hearts
and hands of the brave <hi>English,</hi> whose
loyal and noble valour appearing on this
occasion, had been a Subject to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by all the highest and most grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
Posterity could dedicate to so
glorious an action? Did a pusillanimous
fear freez their courage, when their Head
was thus struck at? Did the care of their
Fortunes prevail, when they could expect
no longer to live secure in the Possession of
any of their Rights, when all was in this
one Act unhinged? Did the atrocity of the
Fact astonish them so, that they were not
recovered out of this amazing surprize till
it was too late? Or did the suddenness of
the Crime prevent their diligence? Or
were they so charitable to their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as not to think any could be capable
of committing this Crime, till they were
convinced of it by an unanswerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
yet all these palliations or excuses
will not serve turn, they should have put
all to hazard when they saw the Case so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
and all like to be lost. And thus it
appears many are concerned to mourn on
this Occasion, who perhaps think themselves
far from any guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64571:20"/>
Finally, there be yet others concerned,
who (may be) do not so much as imagin
how it may come to their door, and these
be the present Generation, who either were
not born then, or at least of that age that
nothing could be expected from them; but
even they must consider that God visits the
sins of the Fathers upon the Children; and
though no Child is guilty of his Fathers
fact, unless he concurred in it, or did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
approve it, yet many times the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God in Temporal things do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them for their Fathers faults; which is
no more unjust than for the Law to deny the
Child any of the Privileges of Subjects for
the Fathers faults. From all this then it
will appear how much more reason we have
to mourn, than the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had on
this occasion, who have (to the scorn and
insultings of our Enemies) been one way
or other so generally guilty in the Death of
so religious and pious a Prince.</p>
                  <p>2. But the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had this great
allay to their grief that they had a Prince
designed by God for the Succession, who
had given such approved Evidences of his
great Piety, Wisdom, Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that their Government was presently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64571:21"/>
to take a settlement; though it is true <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
set up <hi>Ishbosheth, Saul</hi>'s Son, who was
followed by all <hi>Israel,</hi> only <hi>Iudah, Davids</hi>
own Tribe, adhered to him: But this was
after two years War decided, and all <hi>Israel</hi>
received <hi>David</hi> for their King; and still the
Government was steady and even, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had not that reason to afflict
them which we had on the occasion we now
remember.</p>
                  <p>It is true the right of Succession was clear
and undisputed, but those who killed the
Father continued their Crimes by pursuing
the Son, and not only driving him from his
Rights, but when one of the Tribes of our
<hi>Israel,</hi> even that which justly glories in a
nearer Interest in our Soveraigns Person,
had adhered to him, and crowned him,
though with very unjustifiable reserves, then
did that party, bathed in the Fathers Blood,
thirst likewise for the Son's, and carried the
War into that Kingdom; and when the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Heir of our Murthered Martyr came
into this, then again did carnal wisdom, and
the care of mens Lives and Estates prevail
over those strong tyes of Loyalty and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
God having reserved the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him on his Fathers Throne to his own
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64571:21"/>
immediate Arm; wherein there should be a
clear declaration of his wise and wonderful
Providence, in turning about the hearts of
the Nation to him; so that to Posterity it
will be a Problem, which of the two is the
more astonishing, either the Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Father, or the recalling the Son,
and that some of the very same persons
should have been instrumental in both, by
the latter action expressing their true and
sincere Repentance for the former.</p>
                  <p>But alas! the Interval was long; it was
not only a two-years War, like that betwixt
<hi>Saul</hi>'s Son and <hi>David,</hi> but a ten-years
Thraldom; wherein those that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of some small incroachments on Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
before, did totally overturn all the
Freedoms both of Parliament and People;
but to colour this a little, gave a large and
unrestrained Liberty in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which all sense of Order and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Government being quite cast off, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by the custom of an unbounded Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
became habitually <hi>Sons of Belial;</hi>
and as Heifers unaccustomed to the yoke,
cannot again be brought under these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Restraints and Regularities of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Law. Nay, which is worse, though
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64571:22"/>
but the effect of the former, many youthful
and extravagant spirits being once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all obligation to any piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, come by degrees to lose all
sense of it; and seeing those irregular and
ungoverned Practices of many pretenders to
Religion, who were visibly advancing their
own Designs under the colours of Piety,
they came to imagin Religion was only a
pretence by which ambitious men carried on
their own Ends; and the many Subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and different Parties they observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
matters of Religion, made them also
judg there could be no certainty where
there was so much debate and dispute. And
to all this may be added, that by Oaths and
counter-Oaths, which they often took, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
passed from the Oath of Allegiance
to the Covenant, and from that to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement)
their Consciences became seared,
and past feeling; or, being much wounded
by such swearing, to avoid the smart of
that, they took themselves to these cursed
arts of getting quiet in their impious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by throwing off all sense of God and
Religion, and setting up professedly for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;
which is so natural a result of what
has been said, that I think it cannot be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64571:22"/>
doubted to have sprung from it. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I suppose it is unquestionably clear,
that we have much more reason to lament
the matter now before us, than those had
who are in my Text.</p>
                  <p>3. And now I advance to the third and
last Part of my Discourse, to consider what
this mourning was, and what ours ought to
be; they upon so sad news and so great a
loss, were both very tenderly affected for
the Death of a King that had so many good
Qualities, that he being dead they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to forget his bad ones; the loss also of
so noble a Prince as <hi>Ionathan,</hi> (who may
justly pass for one of the bravest <hi>Hero's,</hi>
and the most generous Friends that ever
was) could not but be very sad, especially
to <hi>David,</hi> whose Friendship with <hi>Ionathan</hi>
was beyond what is either in History or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:
and as hitherto all the generous
parts of the Friendship were on <hi>Ionathans</hi>
side, though we find <hi>David</hi>'s returns were
as tender, and rather more; for at their
parting when their mutual Friendship set
them both a-crying, it is said, <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
But now when <hi>David</hi> was to have
made returns suitable to what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>Ionathan,</hi> he is snatched away
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64571:23"/>
by the Sword of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> they had
also many brave Country-men that were
killed: To this was to be added the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the House of <hi>Israel</hi> was in by so great
a defeat; all which concurring, could not
but make a deep impression on the hearts of
<hi>David,</hi> and the People with him, which
did set them to their Tears and Prayers,
both for their own sins, and perhaps they
reckoned their arming against <hi>Saul</hi> one, and
with these they also mourned for the sins of
<hi>Israel,</hi> praying God to avert his Judgments,
to prevent the mischief might follow, and
to recover his People from the ignominy of
so bad a loss, and in the end to settle <hi>David</hi>
so on the Throne of <hi>Saul,</hi> that their might
be under his Reign, Justice and Truth,
Plenty and Peace, both at home and abroad.
This is a clear fair account of the work of
those with <hi>David</hi> in my Text.</p>
                  <p>And after this the Application will be
easie; from which I shall not digress by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the lawfulness and fitness of Anniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that being so well done by others, but
refer my Hearers to <hi>Zachary,</hi> by whom we
find the People of God fasted during the
Seventy years of the Captivity, the fifth and
7th Month; he also mentions their Fasts of the
4th &amp; 10 Month; though it is plain there are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64571:23"/>
no such Fasts commanded in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and yet the Prophet is so far from
blaming these stated returns that he only
blames their being formal and regardless of
God in them, and gives them directions
how they should have ordered them. But
leaving this unreasonable Objection, which
is made by none but those who have the
chief reason to mourn and fast on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
I go next to propose what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Ends of our Mourning and Fasting
should be, which I shall lay open briefly in
two Points.</p>
                  <p>1. The one is to mourn before God for
the guilt of this atrocious Sin, that if any
of us have been (as was before laid open)
involved in the guilt, we may wash off the
stain of this Sin, which is of so deep a dye,
and if we our selves be on all accounts clear
of it, at least we are to pray for Pardon to
those who were guilty, that God may open
their eyes, so as to confess and mourn for
their sins; and in this we follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Royal Martyr, who looking to
Jesus the Author and Finisher of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who endured the Cross, despising the
shame, and prayed for his Enemies, did
with Patience run the Race set before him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64571:24"/>
and humbly imitate his King and Saviour
in pardoning and praying for his Enemies.
We are also on our own accounts to pray
God to deliver the whole Land from this
guilt, lest when God shall come and make
inquisition for this Innocent Blood, we be
involved in the common Judgments, which
cannot fall on the Land so, but all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it must bear their share. But we must
not only mourn for this particular Crime,
though it be so foul as to need the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many Tears and Prayers, but we
must go higher, and look to the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the late Troubles; and see what
provoked God then to plague us so sadly,
and whether we have not re-acted these
very Abominations which then stirred up
Gods wrath against us. I need not enter
into a particular enumeration of our sins
before the year 40, and compare them with
these that now abound; the comparison
would be as invidious as it is obvious. Let
every one then call himself to an account,
how guilty he is of undervaluing Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and the great deliverance he gave to
his Anointed, and by that to his whole
People; how he abuses our Peace and Plenty
into Licentiousness, profanity, and brutal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64571:24"/>
and avowed impiety; and how he
abuses the protection and security Law gives
to Insolence, Faction and Boldness; how
he despises the Gospel, affronts Religion,
and the Worship of God, either by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
contempt of it, a factious separating
from it, or a bare formal coming to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any serious or devout consideration of
that Majesty he scorns, by a pretended
drawing near him with his lips, when in his
heart he is far from him. These and a great
deal more of that nature (with which our
Consciences will certainly charge us, if we
return our thoughts, and call our selves to
a severe account for what is past) ought to
be now mourned for; otherwise the formal
observing these Annual Returns does but
add to our other sins, and enhance our
guilt, when we mock God by a pretended
Mourning and Fasting.</p>
                  <p>2. And the only evidence of the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Mourning is, our departing from
these sinful courses which may provoke
Gods wrath, and from all seditious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which may be fewel for new or worse
calamities; for we may with good reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
if the late Wars and other Plagues
have not taught us to repent of our sins, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64571:25"/>
amend our ways, that according to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
we find always used in Scriptures,
when Judgments are denounced, the next
shall be much sadder than any we have seen
or heard of. But God is merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
slow to anger and ready to forgive, if
we turn to him with all our hearts; let us
therefore from the deep sense of our sins,
and the just apprehensions of the deserved
Judgment, turn unfeignedly to God, who
hath both by the gentler methods of Love,
and the severer executions of Judgments
been calling on us to Repentance; let us
throw off our impious and debauching Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
by which we make war against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
daring God by unparallel'd wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and defying him by our unheard-of
stoutness against him: But do we think to
prevail against God, are we stronger than
he? Can we resist his Thunders or his
Plagues, Fire and Famine? And though we
were strong enough to resist the impressions
and injuries of all our Neighbours, yet how
easily can God plague us with a Division of
Hearts, &amp; such disjointed Affections, that as a
body paralytick we fall to ruin and misery
with our own weight, &amp; without any enemy.</p>
                  <p>And for the avoiding this, next to the
appeasing the Divine displeasure, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64571:25"/>
our horrour of this Fact by a constant,
humble and dutiful Obedience and Loyalty
to his Majesty who new Reigns, and study
to abstain from (not only all these disloyal
and unchristian courses, which ended so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,
but even from) the first beginnings
of these Disorders, which as sparks of fire
blown on by some seditious Incendiaries,
did set us all in a flame; and a serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the late Times, will demonstrate,
that the wicked Designs of those Enemies
to Monarchy could never have become so
strong, if they had not wrought on the more
innocent, the inconsiderate zeal of some (who
afterwards proved both good Subjects and
faithful Patriots), who complaining over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severely
of some Errors of Government, did
(though as afterwards it appeared contrary
to their Designs) give both strength and
credit to a Faction which did soon scornfully
disdain them, whom at first they owned to
be their leaders. So dangerous it is to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Factions, which will quickly pass all
Bounds. This, I hope, will teach all in the
time to come, how carefully and religiously
they ought to guard against the cherishing
of Discontents, or the possessing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
with Jealousies and Fears, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64571:26"/>
of their Governours, or their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and as no man can guard against
any sin, without he consider well all these
subtle temptations that lead him to it, and
all the smaller and less discerned, or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
beginnings of it; so if we truly mourn
and fast for the Sin committed this day, we
must consider and watch against all these
lesser and more unheeded Motions, Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Fears, undutiful Discourses and Censures,
which do insensibly make way and prepare
men to all manner of Sedition and Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
at least, so weakens their dutiful respect
to Governours, that faint Services are to be
expected from so cold affections.</p>
                  <p>But I hope past experience will teach us
more wisdom, and that this Nation which
with so Religious a zeal designs to expiate
what is past, will with the same care study
the preventing every thing may lead to the
re-acting these sad Calamities, of which we
have still among us many doleful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
besides this day of Mourning and
Fasting. In which God of his infinite mercy
grant we may so repent, that he may deliver
us from Blood-guiltiness, and from all other
Judgments our sins have most justly deserved.
To this God be Glory for ever &amp; ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IT is the <hi>great</hi> and just Glory of our most
holy Faith, that it is no less the Interest
than the Duty of all men to embrace it,
and live according to its Precepts: For if we
examine either the Complex of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion in gross, or the several parcels
of it, and <hi>the Duties it enjoyns; we must confess</hi> all
the Laws of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64571:29"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> come infinitely short of the excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
it gives for the Peace of Mankind, and
the Order of Societies: So that it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
the Author of it was a Lover of Men.
What Rule of Justice can match that <hi>of doing to
others what we would have others do to us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 12.</note> which is
so home, so easily remembred, and readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that no wonder the very Heathens admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it? But, not content with the strictest ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors
of Justice, our Saviour hath also obliged
us to the supererogatings (if I may so speak)
of Charity, and hath commanded us to love
one another as Brethren; nor must our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Love be confined within the narrow
bounds of a Party, but extend it self to all Men
whom it takes within its Verge, forgiving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and loving Enemies. And for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Order and Government, what means
are like those our Religion offers? This is
even confessed by its declared Enemies, who
charge it as the contrivance of designing men
for securing their Power and Authority; and
indeed all the Arts of Statesmen, the Cunnings
of Policy, the Closeness of Councils, the Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Intelligence, the strength of Armies or
Navies, the strictness of Guards, regular Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
great Treasures and vast Magazines,
are but Ineffectual Means, compared to this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64571:29"/>
which Religion offers for the security of a
State, by setting up Conscience as a Sentinel
to watch in every man's Breast, that shall not
let pass through it one thought contrary to the
Peace of the Society. Wise Statesmen hold it
for a Maxim, That the chief security of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
is in his being Master of the Hearts and
Affections of his Subjects, which will draw
with them their Hands and Purses as need shall
require. But Mankind being so subject to a
variety of Passions, which by an unruly vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
possess the Minds, especially of the giddy
multitude, there can be no assurance in this,
unless somewhat that is more fixed and better
grounded, tye subjects to the Duty they owe
the Sovereign Power. And therefore those
who have attempted God and designed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
Men of the sense of a Deity, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of another Life, are the greatest
Enemies to Authority: Their Bloud and
Extraction may perhaps entitle them to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and a high Quality, but their Maxims
destroy all Honour, and would quickly bring
on a levelling of all Qualities. He were, by
the confession of all, highly criminal, who
would question the King's Title to the Crown,
or offer to void his Right; and yet this is the
Crime of those Insulting Hectors: For if there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64571:30"/>
be no God, then that Sacred and Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Sovereign Power, which Princes
derive from him, who is the Original of it, <hi>by
whom Kings Reign,</hi> is out of doors: This levels
the Prince with the Subject, and gives the
Usurper as good a Title as the lawful Sovereign
can claim.</p>
                  <p>I shall not now engage in a long discourse of
Policy, nor examine the Original of Power,
nor the Measures and Limits of it, nor the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Extent of the Subjection we owe
Authority; much less run out in a long Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Obligation of Conscience: but shall
limit my Discourse to one single point, That
Conscience is the great security of a State, the
Spring of Obedience, and the sure <hi>basis</hi> of
Submission. And in opening up this I shall,</p>
                  <p>1. Shew that Conscience doth choak and
stifle the occasions and causes of Commotions
in their first Conceptions.</p>
                  <p>2. That it drives the sense of Duty and the
obligation to Obedience deeper on our Minds
than any other consideration whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>3. That it gives the strongest Arguments
for convincing our Reason, and the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
Motives for prevailing on our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to pay the Duties of Subjection to those
God hath set over us. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64571:30"/>
4. I shall encounter and put out of the way
a formidable Objection, which may offer it
self in prejudice of what I am to deliver.</p>
                  <p>For the first, it is certain, that as the great
Diseases of our Bodies are not so much the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of outward Accidents as of bad Humours,
to which a <hi>crisis</hi> may be given by some foreign
Impression, which may put them in a ferment,
and so endanger our Health: Thus the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the Body Politick owe their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and growth to some ill Humours in it,
and the real Causes of Commotions are seldom
the same with these that are pretended for train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in and engaging a Multitude; for,<note place="margin">S. Jam. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>from
whence come wars and fightings among us, but from
our lusts that war in our members?</hi> I shall therefore
consider some of those Lusts and distempered
Affections from which Commotions may arise,
that I may shew how Religion, and it only,
can secure Government from their bad Effects.
Time will not allow me to make good all I am
to say from History; but those who know
Mankind will easily see the dependence of these
Effects from the Causes I go to name, and such
as have read History will find the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it so clear, that I may well be excused
the labour of adducing particular proofs in so
plain a case.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64571:31"/>
1. But to stand no longer on Generals:
One great occasion of Commotions is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
and aspiring Ambition which makes
many swell big in their own conceit, and they
measuring themselves by what they appear in
the glass of their own inchanted Imagination,
which both multiplies and magnifies all that is
eminent in them, expect that all the World
should court them with the same admiration
which they pay themselves. Now it is a hard
thing to satisfie the pretensions of all these lofty
Aspirers, nor can any State be able to gratifie
them all; since nothing falls, to which many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Competitors do not put in a claim: And
though there be many Corrivals, only one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the prize, the rest being all big with a good
opinion of themselves, and provoked at the
unjust preference, as they imagine it, do upon
that think how to make themselves considerable
at their cost, who they judge consider them
too little, and set up for some pretence to draw
a Party, and make a Faction. But those
mighty men in their own conceits are not at
quiet when they have gained what they did at
first pretend to, as that which would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their ambition, but make use of it as a step
to mount them higher; and thus creep up
through all Degrees; and perhaps when they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64571:31"/>
are as high as can consist with the character of
a Subject,<note place="margin">The Case of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds time,</note> do not rest there, but when they
are become first Ministers, will next design to
justle their Master from his Throne. For Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is as the Grave unsatisfied, but ever
says, <hi>Give, give.</hi> This being so great an evil,
let us see what curb can be found for stopping
its career. It will soon appear, that all the Arts
of Government cannot do it; Religion is that
alone which teaches us to discharge our selves
of this Tympany, whose swellings are so incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.<note place="margin">S. Matth 11. 29.</note>
Our Saviour hath commanded us <hi>to
learn of him, who was lowly in heart;</hi> his Apostles
charge us,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>That in lowliness of mind we esteem others
better than our selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 5. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That we humble our selves in the
sight of God, and be clothed with humility as with a
garment.</hi> And indeed this blessed Doctrine
does no sooner prevail on us, but it changes
that blind value and fondness we have for our
selves, into a profound unaffected Humility,
that represents our Faults and Defects as clear
to us, as our former Vanity did our supposed
Excellencies; and instead of vast towerings,
brings us under great Contrition, deep Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
and an humble mistrust of our selves;
and thus Conscience obliges us to be subject,
by setting out of the way this great provocation
to disorder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64571:32"/>
2. Another Cause to which not a few of
the Distempers of Societies owe their Rise and
Growth, is the heat and fury of mens Passions,
which being once kindled by their pride, and
blown on by many outward accidents, at
length become so fierce and violent, that no
Banks can resist their torrent, but they sweep
all before them. Some are born under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of ill Nature and a Cholerick Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
and if these meet any provocation
(which must needs fall out often; for as a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Body doth soon feel pain, so an ill disposed
Mind is quickly disquieted) their heated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are all in a Fever, and they either swell with
Rage, fret with Envy, or boil with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
And thus are their thoughts set to
work, how to drudge happily under the severe
bondage of their tyrannical Passions. One per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to be revenged on some triumphing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite,
whom he can overtake no easier way,
will be ready to drive all to confusion, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his disquieting Malice: Another that
is not so much in bondage himself to those ill-natured
Passions, yet being captivated with the
Charms of a fair, but imperious and spiteful
Mistress, must give himself up as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all her ill Nature, and, being distracted
with the extravagant Notions of Knight-errantry,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64571:32"/>
thinks himself bravely gallant, when
he has sacrificed all things to her wicked Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Private Animosities are known to
have had a larger share in publick distempers,
than any will willingly own; and this must
needs be so still, if there be no assured means
for qualifying the heat, and tempering the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Men: For no Government can be so
well ballanced, but that many will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
aggrieved by it, or by those who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it; and if upon these irritations we ask
counsel at our blinded and misled Passions, we
may be well assured they will ever drive us into
all the excesses of Fury and Confusion. How
excellent then must this Divine Discipline be,
which tames the wildness, and smooths the
roughness of our unpolished Natures, teaching
us <hi>to put off wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and
evil communication out of our mouths;</hi> and, instead
of those, moulds us into a Divine temper, like
our meek Master,<note place="margin">Col. 3 13.</note> obliging us <hi>to forbear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and forgive one another, as he has done us:</hi> For
that Divine Wisdom which he taught the
World, <hi>is first pure, then peaceable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Jam. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>gentle and easie
to be entreated.</hi> It no sooner gets into our
breasts, but it dulcifies our Choler, qualifies
the bitterness of our Gall, and gives us the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of our Minds, out of which nothing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64571:33"/>
can turn us; and transforms us from that rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Temper into a Dove-like disposition, and,
instead of these boiling thoughts, which do fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
gives the quiet serenities of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and fervent Charity; so that we are no
more Sons of Thunder, but Children of Love,
and do no more bluster out in Passion, but
from the Calm of a cool Spirit do breathe out
soft and gentle Affections: And if of a sudden
a storm arise within us, our Consciences will
at once both arraign, condemn and kill these
Passions that raise it, and thus teacheth us to be
subject, by destroying these passions that do
both marre our own Quiet, and endanger the
Publick Peace.</p>
                  <p>3. Another Occasion that hath engaged
many into seditious Courses, hath been the
narrowness of their Fortunes; to which they,
not understanding the Philosophy of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their desires, which is the safer and easier
course, studied by all means whatsoever to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
them so as to satisfie the Vanities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalities
of an undiscreet Expence. As the
turbulent Youth of <hi>Athens</hi> advised his Uncle,
finding him busied to prepare his accounts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to study how to make none at all. Those
people think they drive a sure Trade, for they
can lose little, and may gain much; therefore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64571:33"/>
are ready to embark in the most desperate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
hoping to fish some advantage from
troubled waters. Their Small Fortunes joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their gaping desires, are ever setting a
new edge on their ulcerated Spirits, and none
are so furious as these, who pinched with want
and cold, and armed by despair, must do or
die: If the ordinary Course of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
go on, they are undone; but the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
these, does both reprieve them from
ruine, and feed them with some hopes. Now
no treasure can answer the demands of all rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
devourers, who <hi>cannot dig, and are ashamed
to beg;</hi> nor can the greatest exactness of care
reach every Individual of a State; or oblige
them to an expence proportioned to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
much less to limit their desires to it; but
still there be many Prodigals, who out-run
themselves, and those are often men of brisk
Tempers and ungoverned Appetites: In what
disorder then must Government be, if this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be repressed? Perhaps in an evener Tract
of Peace and Plenty, when Order and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
maintain their Reputation, such dissolute
wasters of their Fortunes cannot prove so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
as to disturb the Peace of a Nation:
But all States are subject to Accidents that
weaken them, and the Censures of an unruly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64571:34"/>
multitude will often blast the Reputation of the
best Government. And at some such disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
these untoward Male-contents may
catch an opportunity of doing much mischief;
how great a happiness then is it to any Nation
to embrace and obey that Religion which
teaches us,<note place="margin">S Matth. 5. 25, 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Not to take thought what we shall eat,
drink, or put on,</hi> that disbands the solicitudes
about to morrow, and the anxious cares that
oppress weaker minds; our holy Faith teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, that <hi>we are pilgrims on Earth, as all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were,</hi> calls up our thoughts above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of sense, to seed our selves with the
assured hopes of approaching Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in another state, which does so entirely
swallow up the sense of any present Trouble,
that it leaves no other impression on us, but to
make us long to be gone beyond these shadows
of Mortality and false appearances of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which do now impose on our bewitched
minds, and seduce us into a thousand Errors
and Follies. And thus again we see how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
stifles the very first motions of disorder,
and teaches us to be subject.</p>
                  <p>4. A fourth Occasion of disorder, is a busie
medling Temper, that cannot contain its self
within its own Limits and Sphere, but will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in things beyond its understanding, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64571:34"/>
above its reach: Some cannot stay at home
and do their own business, but must ramble
abroad, and insinuate themselves on all Affairs
and Company, and are ever gaping for some
change, hoping it may make way for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in another figure: These are ever
sucking in ill Reports, which they are sure to
belch up again in all Companies, not without
additions. They delight to asperse Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Government, and either to find or
make faults in every thing that is done, and a
volatile unfixedness of disposition makes them
weary of established Laws and Customs, and
gape for Changes through a fond affectation of
Novelty. Now these Vermine creeping into
all Companies, must certainly weaken the
Nerves and Sinews of Government: and most
attempts for repressing this humour make it
boil with the greater vehemence: But, as the
Wiseman instructed us of old, <hi>To fear God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>and
honour the King, and not to meddle with those that were
given to change;</hi> and not to say,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Why were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
days better than these, for we do not enquire wisely
concerning that matter:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 11.</note> So the doctrine of the
Gospel commands every man, <hi>To do his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
to stay at home,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 4. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>not to be a busie-body, nor
meddle in other mens affairs, but to pay tribute to whom
tribute is due; fear, to whom fear; and honour, to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64571:35"/>
whom honour is due.</hi> These being the Rules of
Religion, I may appeal all the World to shew
anything can so settle Order and Authority, as
this which guards against the first appearances
of Clouds and Storms.</p>
                  <p>But as Conscience doth meet the earliest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of disorders in their less discernible
and more plausible colours, so it ties a man to
that severe conduct of himself, that he cannot
embark in Designs which must be managed
with so much fraud and dissimulation, as the
contrivers of wicked courses must needs carry
along with them in all their practices: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the highest respect, when they mean
worst, lying, and forswearing, and sometimes
assassinating, as it may serve their ends, and
never meaning what they say, nor saying what
they mean, but shuffling and warping as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
carries them. Nor can wicked Projects
appear at first barefaced, lest they should be
entertained with horrour by all to whom they
are proposed, but must go masked, till they
be so strong, as to dare to throw off the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise:
Nay, Religion will be perhaps called
in to serve a turn, and Scriptures wrested to a
favourable construction; all this base and foul
dealing will so wound a tender and sincere
Conscience, that it will either contract a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64571:35"/>
and <hi>callus,</hi> and become proof against all
these awakenings; or pull a man out of these
base Courses that must be carried on by so bad
Methods; for there is nothing so candid as
Conscience, and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth us
<hi>not to lye one to another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>since we have put off the old
man with his deeds, and have put on the new man;</hi>
for he that does all things as in the sight of God,
can do nothing that he fears should be seen or
known of men. And thus I have dispatched
the First part of my Design, that Conscience
obliges us to Subjection, by resisting all the
first Motions that lead to Disorder or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor does it only put out of the way those
dangerous Stumbling-blocks, but it drives the
sense of Duty deep into our Minds. Law and
Government can only watch over the Actions
and Words of Subjects, but can neither disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
nor over-rule their Thoughts, which a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
man wrapping up within himself can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to a fit opportunity; but Conscience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
the Duty we owe the Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon our secretest thoughts;<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 20.</note> and Religion
obliges us <hi>not to curse the King in our thoughts;</hi> and
has made the Duty we pay Authority a part of
its self, and of these returns of the holy Fear and
humble Obedience, we owe the great King
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64571:36"/>
of Kings. But this must not be so far carried,
as if those who are vested with the Sovereign
Power, had Authority to command us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
whatever Religion they enjoyn, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the pestiferous spawn of that Infernal
Leviathan, who by this Assertion doth at once
destroy both Religion and Government. For
that base Flatterer of Princes, pretending to
offer them more than was due to them, hath
struck at the Root of their Authority, and at
once robbed them of all their Rights: For we
are either bound to obey the Sovereign by some
obligation the Law of God brings on us, or
not; If not, then all the Sacredness of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is gone, and the Prince has nothing but
Force to maintain his Right, and every Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that Masters him shall have a better Right,
by how much more Power he has to strengthen
his ambitious Pretensions. But if we be bound
by the Laws of God to obey the Supreme
Power, then these Laws had a <hi>prior</hi> Title to
our Obedience, and infer the Duties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as a particular Effect of their Doctrine:
Therefore these Laws having the first Right to
our Obedience must oblige us. Nor can we
be allowed to pick out that one, of obeying the
Magistrate, and leave the rest behind us; for all
the Laws of God being enacted by the same
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64571:36"/>
Authority must equally bind us; and as no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Magistrate can void the Laws of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, so neither can Princes void the
Laws of God without sopping the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their own Authority. But none of
these magnifyings of Magistracy are necessary
to make it great; it being by God himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to so culminating a height, and the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
to God the things that are God's, does
not prejudice <hi>Caesar</hi> in the things that are <hi>Caesar</hi>'s:
But Religion ingages us to so full an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Laws, that our violating them,
when they contradict no Command of God's,
makes us guilty in his sight; and though we
disguise what we do with so much cunning,
that the Secular Power can fix no Censure on
us, yet our Consciences will accuse us before
God for those secret Transgressions which no
humane Care can discover. There is a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
set up by God for the Magistrate in all our
Breasts, which will pass Sentence severely,
and not be put off by the tricks of Law, the
boldness of Denials, the cunning of Excuses, or
any other Arts that may impose upon, or abuse
such Judges, who must proceed upon clear
evidence, and not on dubious conjectures:
But when a man is retired inward, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
takes him to task, then all these visors
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64571:37"/>
are pulled off, and he must needs appear in the
foul colours of guilt. Another Method by
which Conscience binds on us the sense of Duty
and Subjection to those set over us, is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to pray for them, according to that
great Rubrick of Prayer S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1, 2,</note> I <hi>exhort
therefore that first of all supplications, prayers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
and giving of thanks be made for all men, for
Kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty:</hi>
which whosoever is a Christian must needs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
This then must every day awaken and
keep alive the sense of Duty to those over us,
so that if we have been prevailed on to unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
courses, when we retire to our Devotions,
this must certainly open our eyes to discern and
repent of our faults; for if we pray, and act
contradictions, then we either mock God, by
praying for that we do not desire, and which
we study to destroy; or we act most impiously
in opposition to that we judge our selves bound
to pray for: And every man, whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is not strangely asleep, will soon discover
this double dealing in himself, if he pray against
what he acts, and be acting against his Prayers.
Thus it appears, that Conscience brings the
sense of our Duty to the Sovereign Power nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
us, and to closer conflicts with our daily
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64571:37"/>
thoughts, and forceth upon us a frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of them. Nor is this a blind and brutish
Subjection to which Conscience ties us, but it
binds it on us with the fullest evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>3. And this is the third Particular, to which
my Design now leads me, wherein I am to lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
those Arguments that Conscience and the
Doctrines of Christianity offer for this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
we must pay the Magistrates. I shall
not meddle with those Reasons that may be
drawn from the Rules of Humane Policy, the
Nature of Societies, the Origine and Ends of
Magistracy, but shall confine my Discourse to
those which natural and revealed Religion do
offer for obliging us to Subjection to the higher
Powers.</p>
                  <p>1. And first of all, we are taught that these
Powers are of God,<note place="margin">Ver. 1, 2, 3.</note> that they are <hi>the Ordinance
of God,</hi> his Deputies, Ministers and Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<hi>That have the Sword of Iustice put in their
hands by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and
the encouragement of those that do well;</hi> and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath said, <hi>They are Gods;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> a strain of speech,
that, if Divine Authority did not warrant it,
would pass for impudent and blasphemous
Flattery: Though then the Powers that are
over us be clothed with our Natures, and are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64571:38"/>
subject to like Passions and Infirmities with us,
and live and die like men, yet for all that we
must look on them as Sacred and Divine by
their Character. The severe Respect that
Conscience enjoyns us to pay Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Instance of <hi>David,</hi> who, though
pursued by <hi>Saul</hi> with all the violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
of Oppression and Cruelty, yet when
he had him in his hands, and offered him the
small affront of <hi>cutting off the hem of his garment,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 4, 5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>his heart smote him for it:</hi> This was a Character of
a man according to God's heart, Deputed Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are only accountable to those from whom
they derive their Authority; so the higher
Powers, being deputed by God, must indeed
render to him a severe account of their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
but not to others; we are therefore
<hi>to obey them for the Lords sake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. S. Pet 2. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and to be, subject to
them for Conscience-sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Another consideration that obligeth to
Subjection, which Religion offers, is the stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and firm belief of the Government of the
World, by that Unerring Providence that
wisely maintains that great Fabrick and vast
Frame of Beings, which it self raised out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
We are apt upon the first appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of things to judge rashly, even before we
have seen all the sides and secrets of humane
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64571:38"/>
Counsels, which would often alter our
thoughts very much from our over-forward
Judgments: But the secrets of the Divine
Counsels lie hid from all the living, and yet the
long experience which the Oeconomy of the
World offers us, may justly convince us, that
we are not to pass sentence hastily, and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
those things which did look most cloudy,
and threatned some dismal Consequences, did
by the secret Governings of that Supreme
Mind, produce Effects very different from
those that not without great probabilities were
feared: This therefore must clear the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
of our discouraged and dejected minds,
and dissipate those thick mists of fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
which might otherwise damp and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
us. He that gave the Laws to Day and
Night, and can reverse these when he will;
that taught the whole Frame of Nature those
Motions they observe, and yet can force the
Sun both to stop and to give ground when he
will; and can make the Sea to rise up in hills,
is able to extricate the darkest and most invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Ravelings of Second Causes. We are
therefore secure,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28</note> knowing, <hi>That all things work
together for good to them that love God,</hi> believing
that his <hi>Providence watcheth over his Church, and all
that trust in him, so that not a hair of their head falls
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64571:39"/>
to the ground without his care, and that he hath given
his Angels charge to encamp about</hi> and <hi>Minister to the
heirs of Salvation;</hi> and this may well supersede
our fears, and throw off the anxieties of all
perplexing thoughts, and compose our minds
to an humble Subjection to those God hath
brought us under. I know some may think I
plead here the stupidity of Fate, which must
needs dishearten and slacken all good Intentions
and Designs; but we are to consider the Order
God hath fixed in the Government of the
World, and the particular station wherein he
hath placed and posted us, out of which we are
not to stir on the pretence of heroical excitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which, when examined, will be found
the heats of a warm Fancy, or the swellings of
an elevated Mind that distrust the Providence
of God, as if he were not able to compass his
designs, and therefore he must stretch out
his hands to help him, labouring under too
great a load; which is indeed the language of
all those who pretending zeal for his Service,
do step out of their station, and meddle with
matters that are too high for them. The fate
of <hi>Uzzah</hi> should have taught us both more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Religion, who seeing the Ark of God
shake,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6 7</note> and considering how dismal an <hi>Omen</hi>
the overturning that sacred Repository had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64571:39"/>
been, and how disgraceful and impious it
would be to see those precious Symbols of the
Divine Presence laid in the dust; and, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that none but the Family of <hi>Aaron</hi>
might touch those holy Mysteries, put out his
hand to hold them, but was struck dead on the
place. We are rather to look on and adore
the hidden Traces and Methods of the Divine
Counsels, and patiently to wait for that Issue
of things, which notwithstanding of all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
may at any time appear in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the Eternal Wisdom of that Architectoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Mind will in due time bring forth, and in
the mean while rest satisfied in all he does, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
things in our prayers to him, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing that befits our Condition for
preserving Peace, Order and Religion, but
going no further,<note place="margin">S. Jam. 1. 20.</note> for the <hi>wrath of man doth not
work out the righteousness of God.</hi> And thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
fixing our Subjection on the unshaken
<hi>basis</hi> of our Faith and Confidence in God, binds
us by the strongest Ties to our Duty.</p>
                  <p>3. A third Argument Conscience offers to
oblige us to be subject and quiet, is the servent
and extended Charity it possesseth us with to all
Mankind, which must needs hold us from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in courses that will prove destructive to
a great part of it: Where we consider what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64571:40"/>
the mischiefs of Rebellion and Civil War are,
what Dissolution of Government and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Justice it brings after it, how much Bloud
and Rapine, Oppression, Plunder and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of the most Sacred things, are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Effects of Commotions, if they be long-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
what Lover of Mankind or Person truly
charitable will engage in courses so black, whose
<hi>Catastrophe</hi> may prove so tragical, and run far
beyond what was at first designed, and produce
Effects far more mischievous than those that
were complained of? How many dispeopled
Cities, depopulated and burnt Villages; what
Tears of Widows and Orphans, and of Aged
Persons bereft of their Children, who were the
comfort and support of their Age must follow
on such courses, when the fields are covered
with the Carkases of the dead, and the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds
smoak with the bloud of Innocents, and
that not only with common Gore, but Royal
and Sacred Bloud? A pathetick and florid
Eloquence could easily manage this Theme
with those advantages, as to raise horror in all
at Courses so barbarous and unchristian, which
the common Sentiments of Humanity will
make those of softer and relenting Tempers
hate, much more the meek and peaceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
And that these are not the Melancholy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64571:40"/>
representations of a troubled Fancy, a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on what we have seen and known, and
a penetrating prospect into what may be before
us will easily make out to all considering
Minds: Therefore strong and fervent Charity
to Mankind will prove a certain curb to repress
new attempts at those disorders, the Effects
whereof are not yet old, nor out of mind.
And here again Conscience obliges us to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>4. The last Consideration which I shall
propose, by which Conscience binds us to
Subjection, <hi>is the Practice and Example of our great
Master,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>who was made perfect through sufferings;</hi>
the whole course of his Life was a perpetual
Tract of doing good and bearing ill; he paid
the Tribute, when demanded, and charged the
<hi>Iews to render to Caesar the things that were Caesars:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Matth. 22. 21.</note>
And when he was to lay down his life for us,
he submitted himself patiently, not only to the
will of his Heavenly Father, but to the Civil
Powers which then governed in <hi>Iudaea:</hi>
Though he, as the Heir of all things, might
have claimed the Empires of the World as his
Right, yet since he humbled himself so as to be
born in the low character of a Subject, he in
that, as in all other things, became a perfect
Pattern to us of all Righteousness. When the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64571:41"/>
accursed Band came out against him, though
he could have brought down Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
for his relief, yet he not only submitted
himself to them, but both rejected and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s too forward zeal, and told him,<note place="margin">S. Matth. 26. 5.</note>
That <hi>such as drew the sword should perish by the
sword;</hi> and when the ill-guided fervour of that
great Apostle had misled him to the excess of
smiting with the Sword, our Saviour expressed
his displeasure at it, by his miraculous piecing
the Ear again with the maimed Head. And
when he was accused to <hi>Pilate</hi> of being an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and pretending to set up another
Kingdom, he did in the plainest stile was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
condemn all <hi>practisings against Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. John 18. 36.</note> by saying, <hi>My Kingdom is not
of this world; if my Kingdom were of this world, then
would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
to the Iews, but now is my Kingdom not from hence:</hi>
This doth so expresly discharge all busling and
fighting on the pretence of Religion, that we
must either set up for another Gospel, or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reject what is so formally condemned by the
Author of this we profess to believe. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Cause of Religion was of so great concern,
as the preserving the Head and Author of it,
whom with equal mixtures of Injustice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
his enraged Enemies were against all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64571:41"/>
of Equity, and contrary to Law and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
dragging to that death, which, though
it proved the happiest thing to Mankind, yet
on their part who acted it, was the foulest
Crime the Sun ever saw.</p>
                  <p>The blessed Apostles followed their Masters
steps in this, as in all other things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having learned of our Saviour that lesson
of bearing the Cross, and suffering patiently,
when Injustly persecuted, counted it their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be conformable to him in his sufferings;
and indeed, if we examine the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of that holy Religion our Saviour delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we will find nothing more diametrically
opposite to all its Rules, than the distempered
fury of these misguided Zealots, who being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by the fierceness of their Ungoverned
Passions, have, upon colours of Religion, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the World with Bloud and Confusion.
Otherwise does S. <hi>Paul</hi> teach the <hi>Romans</hi> in this
Chapter, though then groaning under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
rigours of Bondage and Tyranny; and
S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth at full length once and again call
on all Christians to prepare for sufferings,<note place="margin">1 S. Pet. 2. 13. ver. to the end, and 3. 14, 15, 16, 17. verses.</note> and
to bear them patiently; and though the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the slaves was heavy and highly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all the freedoms of the humane Nature,
yet he exhorts them to bear the severities, <hi>even
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64571:42"/>
of their froward and unjust Masters,</hi> with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>That Christ suffered for them, leaving them
an example, that they should follow his steps.</hi> From
these unerring Practises and Precepts must all
true Christians take the measures of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Rules of their Life: And indeed
the first Converts to Christianity embraced the
Cross, and bore it not only with Patience, but
Joy; and as long as Christianity continued
pure and unallayed, this Doctrine of patient
suffering was not only a big and empty boast,
but gave proofs of its Reality, by the unexem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
Patience and Sufferings of the Christians
in a succession of Three Ages and Ten Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
These blessed Witnesses of our Faith
were burning and shining Lights, as well by
the Purity of their Lives, as by the Stakes and
Flames of their Martyrdom. <hi>Nero</hi> unpalled
them, and clothing them with Pitch-coats,
made burn them as Torches in the night; but
these Fires scattered the darkness of that Night
of Idolatry in which <hi>Rome</hi> lay buried, and both
enlightned and inflamed many that lay freezing
in darkness. It was the astonishment of the
World to see such numbers of all Ages, Sexes,
and Qualities, with that alacrity and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Submission, offer up their Lives for the
Faith; and neither the Cruelty of their unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64571:42"/>
Persecutors, nor the continued Tract
of their Miseries, which did not end but with
their days, prevailed on them either to renounce
the Faith, or do that which is next degree to it,
throw off the Cross, and betake themselves to
seditious Practices for their preservation, but
continued stedfast both in their Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by which they inherited the Promises.
Nor was Christianity endamaged by all that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
on the contrary, the Bloud of the Martyrs
was the Seed of the Church, whose Field being
thus fatned, did spring up thirty, sixty and a
hundred sold; so that for every new harvest of
a persecution, there was a plentiful crop of
Christians. And there is no reason to think
these blessed Martyrs endured all their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
constrained by necessity, because they
could do do no other; for as we find in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
History, that at two Sermons there were
Eight thousand Converts, so Profane as well
as Ecclesiastical Writers assure us, the numbers
of the Christians became very soon so vast, that
nothing but the Conscience of the Duty they
owed the Supreme Powers obliged them to be
subject. <hi>Pliny,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 10. Ep. 97.</note> who lived a hundred years after
our Saviour wrote to <hi>Trajan, That in</hi> Pontus <hi>and</hi>
Bithynia <hi>there were great numbers of Christians of all
Ranks, both in Cities and Villages, so that the Temples
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64571:43"/>
of their Gods were by the prevailing Growth of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
left desolate.</hi> A little after him <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi>
had a Legion of Christians in his Army,
of whom he gives this Character in his Edict,
<hi>That they carried God in their Consciences;</hi> and when
there were so many in the Army, we may on a
fair computation reckon their numbers to have
been very great. Not long after that does <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
plead for those in his days,<note place="margin">Cap. 37.</note> in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Apologetick, and tells the <hi>Romans, That if
they would stand to their own defence, they wanted not
the strength of Numbers and Armies, that neither the</hi>
Moors <hi>nor</hi> Parthians, <hi>nor any other of the Nations
that fought with the</hi> Romans <hi>could match them, who
filled the whole World, all their places, Towns, Islands,
Castles, Villages, Councils, Camps, Tribes, Senate
and Market-places; only they abandoned their Temples
to them;</hi> adding, <hi>That to what War were they not both
fit and ready, even though they were less numerous, who
were butchered so willingly, if their Discipline did not
allow them rather to be killed than to kill?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ad Scap. c. 2.</note> And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
he vindicates the Christians, <hi>That none of
them were ever found guilty of conspiracies against the
Emperors, whom they acknowledged to be set up by God,
and therefore judged themselves bound to love, reverence
and honour them.</hi> But as the Christian Religion
continued to spread by a vast and prodigious
increase, so did the spite of the Infernal Furies
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64571:43"/>
grow fierce against it by the same proportion;
and in the last Persecution, which continued
about twenty years, we find the Martyrs of one
Province (<hi>Egypt</hi>) reckoned to be betwixt eight
and nine hundred thousand; and yet no tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
were raised against all this Tyranny and
Injustice: And though after that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
turned Christian, and established the Faith
by Law, yet neither did the subtil attempts of
<hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, nor the open Persecutions
of some <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperors, who did with great
violence prosecute the Orthodox, occasion any
seditious Combinations against Authority.
These are the great Precedents this holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Cross hath in the first and purest
Ages, and though Religion suffered great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
in the succession of many Ages, yet for the
first ten Centuries no Father or Doctor of the
Church, nor any Assembly of Church-men,
did ever teach, maintain or justifie any Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or seditious Doctrines or Practises.</p>
                  <p>4. And thus I have made good what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to evince, That Conscience doth with
the greatest evidence of Reason and Authority,
bind us to an absolute Subjection to the Higher
Powers; and have observed what was the Path
our blessed Saviour himself followed, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof are to be known by those bloudy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64571:44"/>
steps he hath left behind him for our Example
and Instruction. We have also seen a glorious
Cloud of Witnesses following him in the same
way he both opened up and consecrated to
them. But after all this, it may be perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That all Christians, at least all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to it, have not followed the same Rule,
and that some Divisions of Christendom, which
in all other things run very wide from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet meet in this Doctrine of resisting the
Supreme Authority, and not only so, but they
vouch Religion for their Warrant and their
Quarrel both, and pretend a Zeal for God,
his Church, and his Cause in all they do: This
is the last part of my Discourse, to which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
my self in the beginning; and I will
handle it with the round plainness that such a
Point, how tender soever some may think it,
requires. It is true, about the end of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Century this pestiferous Doctrine took its
Rise, and was first broached and vented by
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, commonly called
<hi>Hildebrand,</hi> the first Pope of that name; though
a far better man had basely and shamefully
courted the cruel and perfidious <hi>Phocas,</hi> and
treated him in a stile of mean and sordid Flattery
that misbecame any man, much more so great
a Bishop. But the Pope I now speak of went
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64571:44"/>
more briskly to work, and begun that insolent
and bold pretension of the Temporal power of
the Popes over all Kings and Princes; that
they being Christ's Vicars on Earth, must
have all Power in Heaven and Earth deputed to
them, and that as S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors they had
the two Swords, the Spiritual and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
put in their hands. Upon this he aspired
and exalted himself above those whom the
Scripture calleth Gods. Nor did this rest in a
bare speculation, but any that will read his
Epistles, and knows the History of his Life,
will see what dismal confusions he brought on
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and laid the Foundations of
those bloudy Wars which followed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for some Ages: Then did the Factions
of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins</hi> divide Nations,
Towns and Families, and fill all places with
bloud and confusion. How other Popes did
afterwards set the same pretensions on foot,
both in <hi>France, England,</hi> and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is well enough known to all that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with History; and for two or three
Ages the Tyranny of this was so heavy, that
any Insolent Church-man was able to disturb
Government, by carrying Complaints to <hi>Rome</hi>
of some pretended Incroachments on the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Immunity; upon which Monitory
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64571:45"/>
Breves and Bulls were dispatched from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and every Prince was either to obey these, how
much soever they might prejudice his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to look for the Thunders of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
Deposition, absolving his Subjects
from their Oaths of Fidelity, and the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Dominions on some other more zealous
Votary of that See. And any that will read
the Decretals, Bulls and Breves of many of the
aspiring Popes, will find that these were not
only ambitious and disclaimed practises, the
guilt of which being personal, died with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but they founded them on the Rights of
the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the stile of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Pastor imposed the belief of that on
the World. Now I would presume to ask
any of that Communion, if they believe these
Popes were Infallible in those Decisions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
they imposed on the World, or not?
If any say they were <hi>Infallible</hi> in them, they are
without more ceremony of words, Traitors,
who subject our Sovereign's Rights, which he
derives from God only, to a foreign Superior
Power: If they were not Infallible in these
Decisions, then what is become of the Pope's
Infallibility? For the present Pope can have no
more than his Predecessors had; and if they
erred, he may likewise erre. But I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64571:45"/>
this a little farther, to shew that those of
that Communion, though they reject the Popes
Infallibility, yet if they submit to the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their General Councils, are still in the
same hazards of being Rebels: For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is
held General and Oecumenical, that first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
Transubstantiation, did also by the Third
of its Canons decree, <hi>That all temporal Princes
should exterminate</hi> (I shall not critically examine
that word which must amount to banishment at
least) <hi>all Hereticks;</hi> adding, <hi>That if any Temporal
Lord, being admonished by the Church, did neglect to
purge his Lands, he should be first excommunicated,
and if he continued in his contempt and contumacy, a
years notice was to be given of it to the Pope, who thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
should declare his Vassals absolved from the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they owed him, and expose his Lands to be Invaded
by Catholicks, who might possess it without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
having exterminated the Hereticks out of it,
and preserve it in the Purity of the Faith.</hi> This is so
plain, that I suppose without any hesitation it
may be called a down-right Conspiracy against
all Sovereign Princes; and this being decreed
by a General Council, must either be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true, or the Foundation on which they have
raised all their Superstructure of the Infallibility
of their General Councils, is overturned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64571:46"/>
But the same Equality of Justice and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that obliged me to lay open this, ties me
to tax also those who pretend a great heat against
<hi>Rome,</hi> and value themselves on their abhorring
all the Doctrines and Practises of that Church,
and yet have carried along with them one of
their most pestiferous Opinions, pretending
Reformation when they would bring all under
Confusion, and vouching the Cause and Work
of God, when they were destroying that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he had set up, and opposing those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by him: And the more Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
such daring pretenders put on, it still
brings the greater stain and imputation on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as if it gave a Patrociny to those Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it so plainly condemns. This is <hi>Iudas</hi>-like,
to kiss our Master when we betray him, and to
own a Zeal for Religion when we engage in
courses that disgrace and destroy it.</p>
                  <p>But, blessed be God, our Church hates and
condemns this Doctrine from what hand soever
it come, and hath established the Rights and
Authority of Princes on sure and unalterable
Foundations, enjoyning an entire Obedience
to all the lawful Commands of Authority, and
an absolute Submission to that Supreme Power
God hath put in our Sovereign's hands. This
Doctrine we justly glory in, and if any that had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64571:46"/>
their Baptism and Education in our Church
have turned Renegades from this, they proved
no less enemies to the Church her self, than to
the Civil Authority. So that their Apostasie
leaves no blame on our Church, which glories
in nothing more than in a well-tempered Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from the later Corruptions which the
dark Ages brought in, to the pure and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Doctrines which our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
taught, and the first Christians retained
and practised for many Ages.</p>
                  <p>To Resume all then: Let us adorn our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Profession with a Life suitable to it, and let
us shew to the World, that we take not up, nor
maintain our Religion upon Interest, but found
it on sure and unmoveable Foundations, which,
being the same always, will ever oblige us to
the same Duties and Practises. Let us study to
empty our selves of all big self-conceiting
Thoughts, of all hot and inflamed Passions and
Appetites, of all unruly and unbounded Desires,
of all Levity and unstayedness of mind; that
with humble Hearts, calm Minds, contented
Spirits, and steady Thoughts, every one may
follow the Duties of his Station, and contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
within it as becomes a Christian, paying
inwardly in our very thoughts that reverence
we owe the Higher Powers, and offering up to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64571:47"/>
God the constant Tribute of our Prayers for
them; considering they are God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and by his own warrant are called Gods:
And if the Conduct of Affairs do not suit our
wishes or desires, yet for all that we are to trust
to and depend on God's Providence, not daring
once to think of attempting against the Lord's
anointed, nor to engage in courses that may
bring on so much mischief and confusion, but
let us ever set before our eyes our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Who endured the Cross and despised the shame;
who when he was reviled, reviled not again, and when
he suffered, he threatned not, but committed himself to
him that judgeth righteously:</hi> And let us also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Cloud of Witnesses that followed him;
<hi>That so we may run with patience the race that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us,</hi> and not look to or imitate the later pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of some distempered and degenerated
Christians. And then we shall be an honour to
our Profession, and give a credit to that Church
wherein we were Born, Baptised and Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
when we shew that we are <hi>subject, not only
for Wrath, but for Conscience-sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to end as I begun; Let us with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and wonder, contemplate the shining
glories of our most holy Faith, which tends to
raise Mankind to the highest pitch of true
Greatness that his limited Nature can ascend to,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64571:47"/>
and as far excels all the attempts of Philosophy,
or any other Religion whatsoever, as the bright
Splendor of the Day doth the fainter Shinings
of the Night. For nothing can be more the
Interest of all men, than the receiving this
Faith, which both secures a man in all his
Rights, and obliges all others to pay him what
ever is due from the Relations they stand in.
Does a Father desire dutiful Children, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
an affectionate Father? Make them good
Christians, and they are sure of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
Do Husband and Wife expect the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Sacred performance of the Ties of
Wedlock? This must certainly follow on their
being good Christians. Do Masters desire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and careful Servants, and Servants a just
and gentle Master? Make them good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and they will prove such. Do all men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to live by honest well-natured and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Neighbours? Their being good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will certainly make them such. Do Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
desire a good King? Let them pray that
he be a good Christian, and then he shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
govern well; And do Kings desire good
and obedient Subjects? Let them take care
that they be good Christians, and then they will
be Subject, <hi>Not only for Wrath, but for Conscience-sake.</hi>
