            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

'Tis a joy to the young heir to have a view of his estate; that is the work of this Treatise, to set before you the Land of promise. While we are here in the combate, we had need look to the Crown to make us fight the more valiantly. <hi>Moses</hi> had an eye at the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that did animate him against sufferings; yea, our blessed Saviour himself looked at the joy set before him. <hi>Madam,</hi> Could we live in the thoughts of these great things to come, what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, what sweet lives should we lead!

our Faith. We had need main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this grace, it is Faith must maintaine us. While the Pilot keeps his ship, his ship keeps him. <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> Blessed be the riches of Gods grace, who hath set this heavenly plant in your heart, and hath kept you in the faith, insomuch that all the shakings of the times have but settled you the more; and I doubt not but he that hath begun a good work in you, <hi>will performe it untill the day of Jesus Christ.</hi> What an unparalell'd mercy is it to be kept free in the time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? God hath given your Ladyship a sound judgement, and a tender conscience, both which are jewels of great price. I may
<pb facs="tcp:43863:4"/>
say of you, as it is said of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat, his heart was lift up in the wayes of the Lord, 2 Chron. 17.12.</hi> Yet I have observed, the more you have been lifted up in God, the more you have been cast down in your self. It is excellent, when the higher we grow in knowledge, the lower we grow in humility. I speak it to the praise of free-grace, God hath crowned your silver haires with golden vertues, every one of which doth shine as thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your piety is a greater glory to you, then your Parentage; it is more to be the daughter of faith then to descend from Nobles, or to have the blood royal running in your veins. <hi>Madam,</hi> There is a time shortly coming, when neither birth, estate, or any worldly embellishments will do us good; you have laid in provision against that time, and gotten the new birth, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birth and Nobility must lie in the dust. This is that which makes

your name smell in Gods Church, as the wine of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> Go on, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> in those paths which have an immediate tendency to life and blessednesse.

It is wise counsel our Saviour gives, that we should count what religion will cost us, <hi>Luk. 14.28.</hi> It will cost us <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;</hi> this is a part of Christs livery which we must weare. Think not that our innocency will priviledge us from the reproaches and slanders of the world; Christ was the most innocent person up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, never did any unholy thought come into his minde, yet his innocency would not shield him from slander; he was called a friend of sinners. Let us not be discouraged; shall we cease from being Saints, because others will not cease from being Devils? Is it a wonder, when an army is in
<pb facs="tcp:43863:6"/>
fight, to see the bullets fly abroad, and the fire-balls? when the seed of the serpent is fighting with the seed of the woman, is it strange to see the bullets of tentation flie, &amp; the fire-balls of slander? But if our innocency will not keep us from being shot at, it will keep us from being hurt: for as no flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can heal a bad conscience, so no slander can hurt a good. Again, Religion wil cost us <hi>persecution;</hi> this is a part of Christs legacy which he hath left us, <hi>In the world ye shall have tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Our ship would soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, if it were not ballasted with some afflictions. A Christian is a compounded creature, he hath some evil in him, therefore God
<pb facs="tcp:43863:7"/>
afflicts; and he hath some good in him, therefore the Devil afflicts: Hence that of <hi>Cyprian</hi>

What if the times are worse, if they make us better? and if our burdens be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, seeing the way we are to go is but short! <hi>Madam,</hi> I will not hold you longer, I make bold to devote this Manual to your Honour; I acknowledge how weak and unfeathered it is, therefore

Thus the Primitive Saints out of prudence and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had all things common; it will not therefore follow, that in every age and century of the Church, there should be a common stock, and every one have a share.</p>

It is true in one sense, what the Primitive Church had, was not their own; so much as could be spared was for the reliefe of the Saints, thus all things were common; but still they kept a part of their estate in their owne hand.

Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> are yours: All the gifts of a Minister, all his graces, are not only for himself, they are the <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> Churches. A Minister must not monopolize his gifts to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, this is <hi>to hide his talents in a napkin</hi>; such an one makes an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, where God would have all common. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> are yours: The Ministers of Christ should be as musk among linnen, which casts a fragrancy; or like that box of spik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, which being broken open, fill'd the house with its odour<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 12.3.</note>: So
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43863:18"/>
should they do by the savour of their ointments. A Minister by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out a sweet perfume in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and life, makes the Church of God as a garden of spices. <hi>Paul and Apollo are yours</hi>: They are as a lamp or torch to light souls to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1.20.</note>. <hi>Chrysostome's</hi> hearers thought they had as good be without the Sun in the Firmament, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the Pulpit. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> are springs that hold the water of life: as these springs must not be <hi>poisoned,</hi> so neither must they be <hi>shut up or sealed.</hi> A Minister of Christ is both a granary to hold the corn, and a Steward to give it out. 'Tis little better then theft, to withhold the bread of life. The lips of <hi>Apollo</hi> must be as an hony-comb, dropping in season and out of season. The graces of the Spirit are sacred flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which though they cannot die, yet being apt to wither, <hi>Apollo</hi> must come with his water-pot<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.6.</note>. It is not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43863:18"/>
enough that there be Grace in the heart, but it must be <hi>poured into his lips.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> is a beleever, so all things are his; but as <hi>Paul</hi> is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, so <hi>he is not his own,</hi> he is the Churches. There are three corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries I shall draw from this.</p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note>, but all are yours. The weakest Minister may help to strengthen your faith. In the law, all the Levites did not sacrifice, onely the Priests, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his sons; but all were serviceable in the worship of God; those that did not sacrifice, yet helped to bear the Arke. As in a building, some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43863:19"/>
bring stones, some timber, some perhaps bring only nailes; yet these are usefull, these serve to fasten the work in the building: The Church of God is a spiritual buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9</note>, some Ministers bring stones, are more eminent and useful; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers timber, others lesse, they have but a nail in the work, yet all serve for the good of this building. The least nail in the Ministry serves for the fastning of souls to Christ, therefore let none be contemned. Though all are not Apostles, all are not Evangelists, all have not the same dexterous abilities in their work; yet remember, <hi>all are yours,</hi> all edifie.

(even after Conversion) there is much of the wilde Olive still in him; now when this scion, by death is cut off, he doth not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but is set into a more noble and generous stock, he is with Christ, which is <hi>farre better</hi>: a state of perfection, is better then a state of imperfection. Our graces are our best jewels, but they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and do not give out their full lustre: they are like the Moon, which when it shines brightest, hath a darke spot. Our faith is mingled with unbeliefe, our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is stained with pride; the flame of our graces is not so pure, but it hath some smoake; grace is but in its infancy and minority, it will never be of full growth till we are with Christ.

                  </note>The second argument is in respect of the <hi>Union</hi> which the Saints have with Jesus Christ.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43863:91"/>
abstruse and profound; Divines may shoot their arrowes, but it is hard to say how neare they come to the mark: 'tis dubious whether in such a particular age and century of the Church, such a Prophecie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.

Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is <hi>Regina mundi,</hi> the Queen of the world; it is the hand that turns all the wheels in the universe; <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> calls it the Pilot that steeres the ship of the Creation. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are often darke; God writes sometimes in short-hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Providence are so various
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43863:91"/>
and strange, and our eyes are so dimme, that we know not what to make of Providence: hence we are ready to censure that which we do not understand: we think that things are very excentrick and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly; Gods Providence is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times secret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alwayes wise. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations of Providence are often sad, <hi>judgement beginning at the house of God,</hi> and the <hi>just man perishing in his righteousnesse,</hi> Eccles. 7.15. that is, while he is pursuing a righteous cause: though his way be <hi>pious,</hi> it is not alwayes <hi>prosperous</hi>: and on the other side, those that work wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse <hi>are set up, yea, they that tempt God are delivered,</hi> Mal. 3.15. though now our candle be in a dark lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, and the people of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what God is a doing, yet when they are in heaven they shall see the reason of these transactions <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 13.7</note>: they shall see that every Providence served for the fulfilling of Gods
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43863:92"/>
Promise, <hi>viz. that all things shall work together for good,</hi> Rom. 8.28. In a Watch the wheeles seeme to move crosse one to another, but all carry on the motion of the Watch, all serve to make the Alarm strike; so the wheeles of Providence seeme to move crosse, but all shall carry on the good of the elect; all the lines shall meet at last in the centre of the Promise; in heaven, as we shall see Mercy and Justice, so we shall see <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Providences</hi> kissing each other: <hi>Our light shall be cleare.</hi> When a man is at the bottome of an hill, he cannot see ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre: but when he is on the top, he may see many miles distant. Here the Saints of God are in the <hi>valley of tears,</hi> they are at the bottome of the hill, and cannot tell what God is a doing: but when they come to Heaven, and shall be on the top of the mount, they shall see all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious transactions of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43863:92"/>
never a Providence but they shall see either a wonder or a mercy wrapt up in it. A Limner at the first makes but a rude draught in the picture, here an eye, there an hand; but when he hath limn'd it out in all its parts and lineaments, and laid them in their colours, it's beautifull to behold.

This is an Article of our faith. Now for the illustration of this, there are three things considerable: 1. That there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s such a thing as the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 2. That this is not yet past. 3. That the same body that dies shall rise again.</p>

There are some of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces opinion, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, then <hi>let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.32. To what purpose are all our prayers and tears? and indeed it were well for them who are in their life-time as bruit beasts, if it might be with them as beasts after death; but there is a resurrection of the body<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 11.24.</note>, as well as an ascension of the soul <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.12.52.1.</note>; which I shall prove by two Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because Christ is risen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must rise: the head being raised, the rest of the body shal not alwayes lye in the grave, for then it would be an head without a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: his rising is a pledge of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Ex AEquo,</hi> in regard of justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and equity; the bodies of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have been <hi>weapons of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> and have joyned with the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43863:97"/>
soul in sinne; their eyes have been a casement to let in vanity, their hands have been full of bribes, their feet have been swift to shed blood; therefore justice and equity require that they should rise again, and their bodies be punished with their souls. Againe, The bodies of the Saints have been <hi>members of holinesse</hi>: their eyes have dropped down tears for sinne, their hands have relieved the poor, their tongues have been trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of Gods praise, therefore ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and equity require that they should rise again, that their bodies as well as their soules may be crown'd: There must be a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, else how should there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration? We are more sure to arise out of our graves then out of our beds: the bodies of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are lockt up in the grave as in a prison, that they may not infest the Church of God; and at the day of judgement they shall be brought
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43863:98"/>
out of the prison to tryall: and the bodies of the Saints are laid in the grave as in a bed of perfume, where they mellow and ripen against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. <hi>Noah's</hi> olive-tree spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the flood, the blossoming of <hi>Aaron's</hi> dry rod, the flesh and sinews coming to <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> dry bones, what were these but lively emblems of the resurrection?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this resurrection is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet past: some hold that it is past, and make the <hi>Resurrection</hi> to be nothing else but <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which is call'd a rising from sinne, and a <hi>being risen with Christ</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note>; and do affirme, that there is no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection but this; and that only the soul is with God in happinesse, not the body. Of this opinion were <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. But the rising from sinne is call'd the <hi>first resurection,</hi> Rev. 1.6. which implies that there is a second resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and that <hi>second</hi> I shall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43863:98"/>
prove out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake</hi>; he doth not say, they are already awake, but they shall awake. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.28.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.28.</note> 
                  <hi>The houre is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of damnation.</hi> Observe, Christ doth not say, they are come forth of the grave already, but they shall come forth.</p>
               <p>Here a question may be moved, Whether the bodies of some of the Saints are not in Heaven already,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note> then it will seem that their resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not yet to come? as we read that <hi>Elias</hi> was taken up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a fiery chariot: and <hi>Enoch,</hi> Heb. 11.5. <hi>was translated, that he might not see death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I know the Question is controverted among Divines:<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:43863:99"/>
But there are some reasons do perswade me that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are not yet bodily in Heaven, nor shall be till the resurrection of all flesh, when the rest of the Elect, like a precious crop, being fully ripe, shall be translated into glory. The first is <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. where it is said, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>These all died in faith,</hi> where <hi>Enoch</hi> was included. Now why we should restraine this word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43863:99"/>
joyful passage out of his body; he died not after the common manner of men; so saith <hi>Peter Martyr. Seeing</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> are in Scripture oft exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical, the one is put for the other, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I see a law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> that is, <hi>I feel</hi> a law. 2. My se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Argument, is, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appeare what we shall be, but we know, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when he shall appeare, we shall be like him.</hi> We read in Scripture but of <hi>two Appearings</hi> of Christ, his appearing in the flesh, and his appearing at the day of judgment. Now his appearing in this text, must needs be meant of his last appearing; And what then? then saith the Apostle, <hi>we shall be like him,</hi> that is, <hi>in our bodies,</hi> Phil. 3.21. <hi>The spirits of just men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> already <hi>made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. Whence I infer, <hi>Enoch</hi> is not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended bodily into heaven, because none of the bodies of the Saints shall be fully made like Christ till his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43863:100"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> appearing. 3. Besides this may be added the judgement of many of the Fathers, who were pious and learned. It is not probable that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> should be taken up in their bodies into heaven, saith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and he urgeth that saying of our Lord, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3.13</note> 
                  <hi>No man hath ascended into heaven,</hi> (that is, saith he, corporeally) <hi>but the Son of man that descended from heaven.</hi> Of this opinion also is <hi>Oecolampadius, Martinus Borrhaeus,</hi> and learned Doctor <hi>Fulk,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Fulk.</hi>
                  </note> who in his marginal notes upon the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> hath this descant.
<q>It appeareth not, saith he, that <hi>Enoch</hi> now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in body, no more then <hi>Moses,</hi> but that he was translated by God out of the world, and died not after the common manner of men.</q>
And concerning <hi>Eliah,</hi> the same reverend Authour hath this passage,
<q>It is evident, that he was taken up alive, but not that he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43863:100"/>
continueth alive. <hi>And again,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we read expresly, that he was taken up into heaven, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11. It is certaine, (<hi>saith he</hi>) that his body was not carried into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q>
Christ being the first that in perfect humanity ascended thither: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Christ is become the first-fruits of them that sleep:</hi> He is called the <hi>First-fruits,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the most <hi>excellent,</hi> and <hi>sanctified the rest,</hi> but because he was the first Cluster which was gathered, the First that went up in a corporeal manner into the <hi>Seat of the Blessed.</hi> For my part, I see not how Christ could properly be called the <hi>First-fruits</hi>; if <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> were bodily in heaven before him. Hence we see that the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is yet to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is, That at the resurrection every soul shal have <hi>its own body:</hi> the same body that dies shall arise. Some hold that the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43863:101"/>
soul shall be cloathed with a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but then it were improper to call it a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the body, it should be rather a <hi>Creation.</hi> It was a custome in the <hi>African</hi> Churches<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>, to say, I believe the resurrection <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus carnis, of this body.</hi> I confesse, the doctrine of the resurrection is such, that it is too deep for reason to wade here, you must let faith swim. For instance, Suppose a man dying, is cast into the Sea, several Fishes come and devour him, the substance of his body goes into these fishes, afterwards the fishes are taken and eaten, and the substance of these fishes goes into several men; now how this body, thus devoured, and as it were crumbled into a thousand fractions should be raised <hi>idem nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> the same numerical body, is infinitely above reason to imagine, we have scarce faith enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>

The conscience of many a man, is like the body of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> so grosse and corpulent, that though they did thrust needles into his flesh, he felt no paine. Time was when conscience was tender, but by often sinning he is like the Ostrich, that can digest iron; or as it is said of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> that by often accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoming his body to poyson, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt him, but he could live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as his food.

When the Jaylour <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 16.</note> saw the prison-doors open, and as he thought the prisoners were missing, he drew his sword and would have killed himselfe: when the eye of conscience is opened, and the sinner begins to look about him for his evidences, Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. and sees they are missing, he will be ready to kill himselfe: a troubled conscience is the first-fruits of hell; and indeed it is a <hi>lesser hell.</hi> That it is so, appears two wayes.</p>

                  <p>Though <hi>Knowledge</hi> be a necessary antecedent to <hi>Faith,</hi> yet it is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> enough, there must be secondly <hi>Consent:</hi> Faith is seated as well in the heart and will, as in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: as well in the affection, as in the apprehension. <hi>With the heart man believes</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. As an <hi>Head</hi>; the head hath a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> double office: it is the <hi>fountaine of

spirits,</hi> and the <hi>seat of government</hi>: the head is as it were the Pilot of the body, it rules and steers it in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The believer consents to have Christ not only as an Head to send forth spirits, that is <hi>comfort</hi>; but as an head to rule: A sinner would take Christs Promises, but not his Laws: he would be under Christs <hi>benediction,</hi> but not under his <hi>juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> A believer consents to have whole Christ; <hi>non eligit objectum,</hi> he doth not pick and choose; but as he expects to sit down with Christ upon the throne, so he makes his heart Christs Throne.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The believer consents to have Christ for better for worse, a naked Christ, a persecuted Christ: faith sees a beauty and glory in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Christ <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note>, and will have Christ not only <hi>in purple</hi> but when with <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> he is cloathed <hi>in Camels haire.</hi> Faith can embrace the fire, if Christ be in it. Faith looks
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43863:129"/>
upon the Crosse as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, to carry him up to Heaven: Faith saith, Blessed be that affliction, welcome that Crosse which carries Christ upon it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Believer consents to have Christ purely for love; if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wife should give her consent only for her husbands riches, she should marry his estate rather then his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The believer consents to have Christ <hi>pro termino interminabili,</hi> never to part more; he desires an uninterrupted communion with him, he will part with life, but not with Christ: indeed, death when it slips the knot between the soul and the body, it ties it faster between the soul and Christ.</p>

                  <head>§. III. Opening the nature of Recumbency.</head>
                  <p>The third thing is <hi>Recumbency.</hi> The soul having given its consent that the match should be made up, and done it <hi>out of choice,</hi> now it casts it selfe upon Christ as a man that casts himselfe upon the stream to swim, it makes an holy adventure, it clasps about Christ, and saith, My Lord, my Jesus, which is as it were the joyning of hands. This Act of <hi>Recumbency</hi> is sometimes in Scripture call'd a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 6, 37</note>, sometimes a <hi>leaning

upon Christ</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 8.5</note>. This is that faith which justifies.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning this faith, I shall lay down two Rules. 1. That faith justifies not as a formal cause, but purely as an instrument, <hi>viz.</hi> as it lays hold on Christ the blessed object, and fetcheth in his fulnesse: and in this sense it is call'd a <hi>precious faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.1</note>: the worth lies not in <hi>faith,</hi> but in <hi>Christ,</hi> on which it doth centre and terminate; Faith in it selfe considered, is not more excellent than other graces. Take a piece of Wax, and a piece of Gold, of the same Magnitude, the Wax is not valuable with the Gold; but as this Wax hangs at the lavell of some Will, by vertue of which a great Estate is confirmed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed, so it may be worth many hundred pounds. So faith consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purely in it self, doth challenge nothing more than other graces, nay, in some sense, it is inferiour, it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43863:131"/>
being an <hi>empty hand</hi>: But as this hand receives the precious Almes of Christs Merits, and is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or channell thorow which the blessed streams of life flow to us from him; so it doth challenge a superiority above other graces.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, some affirme, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the very <hi>Act</hi> of believing, without reference to the Merits of Christ, justifies. To which I shall say but this; 1. Faith cannot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie as it is an <hi>Act,</hi> for it must have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> an object: we cannot (if we make good sense) separate between the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Object.</hi> What is faith, if it do not fix upon Christ, but fancy? It was not the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> looking up that cured them, but the fixing their eye upon the Brazen Serpent. 2. Faith doth not justifie as it is a <hi>Grace.</hi> This were to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> substitute faith in Christs roome, it were to make a Christ of Faith. Faith is a good Grace, but a bad
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43863:132"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Christ. 3. Not as a <hi>Work:</hi> which must needs be, if (as some affirme) it be in lieu of obedience to the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> Then we should be justified by Works, contrary to that, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.9. where the Apostle speaks expresly, <hi>Not of works.</hi> So that it is clear, faith's excellency lies in the apprehending and applying the object Christ: therefore in Scripture we are said to be justified, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>through</hi> faith as an Instrument deputed <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note>; not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for</hi> faith as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cause.</p>
                  <p>The second Rule is, that Faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth not justifie, as it doth <hi>exercise grace.</hi> It cannot be denied but faith hath an influence upon the graces; it is like a silver thred that runnes thorow a Chain of Pearl: it puts strength and vivacity into all the vertues; but it doth not justifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Notion. Faith begets obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: By faith <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43863:132"/>
as he obeyed, but as he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4.3</note>. Faith <hi>works by love,</hi> but it doth not justifie as it works by love. For as the Sun shines by its brightnesse, not by its heat; though both are inseparably joyned: so faith and love are tyed together by an indissoluble knot, yet faith doth not justifie as it works by love, but as it layes hold on Christ. Though faith be accompanied with all the graces, yet in point of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is alone and hath nothing to do with any of the graces. Hence that speech of <hi>Luther</hi>; in the justification of a sinner, Christ and faith are alone, <hi>Tanquam sponsus &amp; spomsa in thalamo</hi>; As the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and Bride in the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Faith is never separated from the graces, yet sometimes it is alone. And thus I have shewn you the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials of faith.</p>

                  <head>§. IV. Shewing what are the fruits and products of faith.</head>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I proceede to the Consequentials of faith. There are many rare and supernatural fruits of faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith is an heart-quickning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> grace, it is the vitall Artery of the soul: <hi>The just shall live by his faith, Hab.</hi> 2.4. When we begin to believe we begin to live. Faith grafts the soule into Christ, as the cion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stock, and fetcheth all its sap and juyce from that blessed Vine. Faith is the great quickner; it quickens our graces, and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith quickens our <hi>graces</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Spirit of God infuseth all the seeds and habits, but faith is the fountain of all the acts of grace; it is as the Spring in the Watch that moves the Wheels: not a grace
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43863:133"/>
stirs till faith set it a work. How doth love work? <hi>By faith!</hi> When I apprehend Christs love, this doth pullize and draw up my love to him again. How doth humility work? <hi>By faith!</hi> Faith humbles the soul; it hath a double aspect, it looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sin, and a sight of sin humbles: it looks upon Free-grace, and a sight of mercy humbles. How doth patience work? <hi>By faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 1.3.</note>! If I believe God is a wise God, who knowes what is best for me, and can deliver not onely <hi>from</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but <hi>by</hi> affliction: This spins out patience. Thus faith is not only <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> but <hi>vivifica:</hi> it puts forth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Energy and operation into all the graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith animates and quickens <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our <hi>duties.</hi> What was the blood of Bulls and Goats to take away sin <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.4</note>? It was their faith in the Messiah, that made their <hi>dead Sacrifices</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>living Services.</hi> What are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43863:134"/>
Ordinances, but a <hi>dumb shew,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the breathings of faith in them? therefore in Scripture it is called, the <hi>prayer of faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 5.7.</note>, the <hi>hearing of faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note>, and the <hi>obedience of faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16.26.</note>, dead things have no beauty in them, it is faith that quickens and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Faith is an heart-purifying grace: <hi>Having purified their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. Faith is a Virgin-grace, of a pure and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature. Faith is in the soule as lightning in the Air, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; as fire in the Metals, which refines; as Physick in the Body, which works out the disease. Faith works out pride, self-love, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie: it consecrates the heart: That which was before the Devils Thorow-fare, is now made Gods Enclosure, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.</hi> Faith is an heavenly plant, which will not grow in an impure soile.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43863:134"/>
Faith doth not only <hi>justifie,</hi> but <hi>sanctifie</hi>: as it hath one work in heaven, so it hath another work in the heart: He that before was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of some hereditary corruption, as soone as faith is wrought there is a sacred vertue coming from Christ for the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, and weakening that sin: <hi>the waters are abated.</hi> The woman that did but touch the hemme of Christs Garment felt vertue coming out of him <note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 5.27.</note>. The touch of faith hath an healing power: Faith casts the Devil out of the <hi>Castle</hi> of the heart, though still he keeps the <hi>Out-works.</hi> Satan hath a party in a Beleever, but there's a Duel fought every day: and faith will never give over, till, as a Prince, it prevails. <hi>This is the faith of Gods Elect</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note>. Thou that say'st thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest, hath thy faith removed the <hi>Mountain</hi> of sin, and cast it into the Sea? What, a beleever, and a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard! a beleever, and a swearer! a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43863:135"/>
beleever, and an Apostate! for shame, either leave thy sins, or leave thy profession: Faith and the love of sin can no more stand together, then two contraries in the same part of the Subject <hi>gradu intensivo</hi>; as light and darknesse;</p>
                  <p>Faith is an heart-pacifying grace; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Peace is the daughter of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God,</hi> Faith is the Dove that brings an Olive-branch of peace in its mouth; Faith presents God reconciled, and that gives peace. What is it makes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the smile of God? Faith puts the soul into Christ, and there's peace; <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. <hi>ult. That in me ye may have peace.</hi> When the Conscience is in a Fever, and burns as hell, faith opens the Orifice in Christs sides, and sucks in his blood, which hath a cooling and pacifying vertue in it. Faith gives us peace in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Trouble,</hi> nay, out of <hi>Trouble.</hi> 1. It
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43863:135"/>
gives <hi>Peace in Trouble</hi>: Faith is an heart-pacifying, because an heart-securing grace. When <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Ark, he did not fear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge: he could sing in the Ark. Faith shuts a beleever into the Ark Christ: <hi>Lead me to the Rock which is higher than I,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 61.1.</note>. Faith plants the soul upon this Rock. The <hi>West-Indians</hi> built their Palaces upon the tops of hills: in the Flood the waters covered the hills; but a beleever is built higher: <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.16. <hi>His place of defence shall be the munition of Rocks</hi>: but a man may starve upon a Rock; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows, <hi>Bread shall be given him, &amp;c.</hi> Faith builds a Christian upon the power, wisdome, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of God: This is the <hi>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rocks</hi>: and it feeds him with the hidden Manna of Gods love: here is <hi>bread given him.</hi> The way to be safe in evil times, is to get faith; this ushers in peace, and it is such a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43863:136"/>
peace as doth garrison the heart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God shall keep your heart,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: It shall keep it as in a Tower or Garrison. 2. Faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> gathers <hi>peace out of trouble</hi>: joy out of sorrow <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 16.20</note>, glory out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note>. This is the key to <hi>Samsons</hi> Riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came meat</hi>; this explaines that Paradox, <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 7.16</note> 
                     <hi>Can a man gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles</hi>? Yes, of Trials and Persecutions faith gathers joy and peace: here are Figs of Thistles. How were the Martyrs ravished in the Flames? The Apostles were whipt in prison, but it was with Sweet Briar. O how sweet is that peace which faith Breeds? it is a Plant of the Heavenly Paradise; it is a Christians Festival; it is his Musick: it is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Faith is an heart-strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace: a beleever is heart of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43863:136"/>
oke, he is strong to resist tentations, to bear afflictions, to foil Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; he gives check to them, though not <hi>full mate.</hi> An unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is like <hi>Reuben,</hi> unstable as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>he shall not excell.</hi> A state of <hi>infidelity,</hi> is a state of <hi>impotency.</hi> A Beleever is as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who though the Archers shot at him, <hi>his bowe abode in strength.</hi> If a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian be to do any thing, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults with faith; this is the sinew, which if it be cut, all his strength goes from him. When he is call'd out to suffering, he harnesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Faith, he puts on this coat of maile; Faith layes in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strength, furnisheth the soul with suffering Promises, musters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether suffering graces, propounds suffering rewards.</p>
                  <p>But how comes Faith to be so strong? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> piece of Gods Armour; it is a shield he puts into our hand: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43863:137"/>
                     <hi>Above all, taking the shield of Faith:</hi> a shield will serve for a brest-plate, a sword, if need be, an helmet; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the head, it guards the vitals; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> such a shield is Faith. 2. Faith brings the strength of Christ into the soul; <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, through Christ that strengthens me.</hi> The strength of faith lies out of it self, it grafts upon another stock. When it would have wisdome, it consults with Christ, whose Name is <hi>wonderful, Counsellour</hi>; when it would have strength, it goes to Christ, who is call'd the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Christ is a Christians Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Faith is the key that unlocks it. Faith hangs upon the lock of Christ, all its strength lyes here; cut it off from this lock, and it is weaker then any other grace. Christ may be compared to that tower of <hi>David</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 4.4</note>, <hi>on which there hang a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand bucklers, all shields of mighty

men.</hi> The faith of all the Elect, these shields hang upon Christ. Faith is an Heroicall grace; the Crown of Martyrdom is set upon the head of faith. <hi>By faith they quenched the violence of the fire</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.34.</note>; the fire over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their bodies, but their faith overcamr the flame.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith is a life-fructifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grace, it is fruitfull. <hi>Iulian</hi> upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christians, said, that their Motto was <hi>Only beleeve</hi>; and the Papists call us <hi>solifidians:</hi> Indeed, when faith is alone, and views all the rare beauties in Christ, then faith sets a low value and esteem upon works: but when faith goes abroad in the world, good works are the handmaids that wait on this Queen. Though we place faith in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Orb in matter of Justification, yet good works are in conjunction with it in matter of Sanctification. 'Tis no wrong to good works to give faith the upper hand, which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43863:138"/>
goes hand in hand with Christ. Good works are not separated from faith, only faith challengeth its seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. Faith believes as if it did not work, and it works as if it did not believe. Faith hath <hi>Rachels</hi> eye, and <hi>Leahs</hi> womb:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>That ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that ye should bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> Faith is that Spouse-like grace which marries Christ, and good works are the children which faith bears.</p>
                  <p>Thus having briefly shewn you the Nature of Faith, I now come to the reflexive <hi>Act</hi>: Have you faith or no? And here let me turne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> my self, first to Unbelievers, such as cannot find that they have this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this espousing grace; what shall I say to you?

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43863:138"/>
of summons to surrender, what would become of you? you want that grace which should intitle you to Christ and Heaven: oh, I say, mourn: yet mourn not as them <hi>without hope,</hi> for in the use of means you may recover a Title. I know it is otherwise in our Law-Courts; if a Title to an Estate be once lost, it can never be recovered: but it is otherwise here; though thou hast no Title to Christ to day, yet thou may'st recover a Title: thou hast not sin'd away the hope of a Title, unless thou hast sinn'd away the sense of sinning. To such as are resolv'd to go on in sinne, I haue not a word to say, they are upon the spur to go to hell: but to you that have been <hi>prodigall sonnes,</hi> but are now taking up serious resolutions to give <hi>a bill of divorce</hi> to your sins; let me encourage you to come to Christ, and to throw your selves upon his blood; for yet a Title to Heaven is recoverable.</p>

2. Faith oft lies hid in the heart, and we see it not for want of search; the fire lies hid in the embers, but blow aside the ashes, and it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable: Faith may be hid under fears, temptations; but blow away the ashes. Thou prizest faith; hadst thou a thousand Jewels lying by, thou would'st part with all for this Jewel: no man can prize grace but he that hath it. Thou desirest faith, the true desire of faith is faith. Thou mournest for want of faith; dispute not, but beleeve; what are these tears but the seeds of faith?</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There are seven things which I shall say in reply to this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. A little faith is faith; as a sparkle of fire is fire: though the pearl of faith be little, if it be a true pearl, it shines in Gods eyes. This little
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43863:141"/>
grace is the seed of God <note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9</note>, and it shall never die, but live as a sparkle in the main sea. 2 A weak faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will entitle us to Christ as well as a stronger. <hi>To them that have obtained like precious faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1 not but that there are degrees of faith; as faith <hi>purifies,</hi> so all faith is not alike one is more then another; but as faith <hi>justifies,</hi> saith is <hi>alike precious</hi>; the weakest faith justifies as well as the faith of the most eminent Saint; a weak hand will receive the almes: for a man to doubt of his grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is weak, is rather to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace, then upon Christ. 3. The Promise is not made to strong faith,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but to true. The Promise doth not say, Who ever hath a faith that can remove mountains, that can stop the mouth of Lions, shall be saved; but <hi>whoever believes,</hi> be his faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so small, the Promise is made to true faith, and for the most part to weak. What is a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43863:142"/>
what is a bruised reed, but the emblem of a weak faith? yet the Promise is made to these: <hi>A bruised reed he will not break</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12.20.</note>. The words are a <hi>miosis,</hi> where the lesser is put for the greater: <hi>He will not break.</hi> that is, hee will bind up: Though Christ chides a weak faith, yet that it may not be discouraged, he makes a Promise to it. <hi>Hierom</hi> observes upon the Beatitudes, there are many of the Promises made to weak grace: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3 <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit; Blessed are they that mourn,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Blessed are they that hunger,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A weak faith may be fruitfull; weakest things do multiply most. The Vine is a weak tree, it is born up and underpropt, but it is fruitfull; it is made in Scripture the Emblem of fruitfulnesse <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 128.</note>. The Thiefe on the Crosse, when he was newly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he had but a weak faith; but how many precious clusters grew upon
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43863:142"/>
that vine! <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.40. he chides his fellow-thief; <hi>Dost thou not fear God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23.40. Verse 41.</note> he falls to self-judging, <hi>we indeed suffer justly</hi>: he believes in Christ when he said, <hi>Lord:</hi> he makes an heavenly prayer, <hi>remember me when thou comest into thy kingdome:</hi> here was a young plant, but very fruitful. Weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians oft are more fruitful in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how strong is the first love, which is after the first planting of faith!</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Christian may mistake, and think he is weak in faith because he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> weak in assurance, whereas faith may be strongest when assurance is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; assurance is rather the fruit of faith: The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> was weak in assurance, but was strong in Faith. Christ gives her three repulses, but her faith stands the shot; she pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues Christ with an holy obstinacy of faith, insomuch that Christ sets a trophy of honour upon her faith, <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note> 
                  <hi>O woman, great is thy faith</hi>: it may be a strong faith, though it doth not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43863:143"/>
see <hi>the print of the nailes:</hi> it is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall faith that can swim against winde and tyde, <hi>believe against hope</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4.18</note>. Christ sets the crown upon the head of faith, not of assurance. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.29. <hi>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. God hath most care of weak believers; the mother tends the weak child most: <hi>God will gather the lambs with his armes, and carry them in his bosome</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 40.11</note>. The Lord had a great care of his weak Tribes: when <hi>Israel</hi> march'd towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Tribes were divided into several compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Brigades: now it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, all the weak Tribes were not put together, lest haply they should discourage one another, and so have fainted in their march; but God puts a strong Tribe to two weak Tribes; as <hi>Issachar, Zebulon,</hi> two weak Tribes, and <hi>Iudah</hi> a victorious Tribe; therefore he gives the Lion in his standard: surely this was not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43863:143"/>
without a mystery; to shew what care God hath of his weak chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, CHRIST the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> shall be joyned to them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Weak faith is a growing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Faith; 'Tis resembled by the grain of Mustard-seed, of all seeds the least; but when it is grown, it is the <hi>greatest among herbs, and becometh a Tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the Branches thereof</hi>

                  </note>. Faith must have a growing time; The seed springs up by degrees; First the Blade, and then the Eare, and then the full Corn in the Eare: the strongest faith hath sometimes been weak. The faith that hath been renowned in the world, was once in its infancy and minority: Grace is like the waters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, which did rise higher and higher. Wait on the Ordinances, these are the brests to nourish faith: be not discouraged at thy weak faith, though it be now in

It is a great sinne in these times to be bewailed, the looseness of Professors: even those that we hope (by the rule of charity) have the sap of grace in their heart, yet do not give forth such a sweet savour in their lives: How many under the Notion of Christian Liberty, degenerate into Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.
