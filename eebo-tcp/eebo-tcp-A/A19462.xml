         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is easie to gesse (honourable Lorde) why Schollars flocke under the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of men in your place; their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so weake, that unlesse men truly honourable doe defend them, they are most of all in this age distressed. And yet (braue noble Lorde) ingeniously to confesse my true meaning) it is not that which mooued me at this time; but it is the height of admiration which my thoughts concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of your honours worth, that made me thinke all men bound to offer signes of loue and dutie, where both are deserued in so high a measure I take vpon me <hi>Englands</hi> person and speake like a Common-wealth. And therfore howsoeuer it were presumption in me to dedicate papers of so small moment, to a personage of so rare worth, yet (honourable Lorde) take them as your cuntries talke, vouchsafe to reade them stamped with her name, and so all shall be afraide to mislike them, beeing graced with yours. And yet I weigh not whether others mislike them or no; let but your honour for learnings sake (a thing which I know you doe) say you are content to accept of the meanest trifle, and grace it with a good looke, and
<pb facs="tcp:9363:3"/>
then I contemne what male-contented melancholy can speake against me. Your honour (be it spoken without envie) like Englands Cedar is sprung up to preserue with your shadowe, the humblest in all professions, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds malice. The warlike and braue soldier thinkes him selfe (and that in truth is) graced, to be tearmed but your follower. The worthy and kinde passionate Courtier deemes (and worthily) this his honour, to be your fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The sober and devout student, that dispised doeth walke melancholy, takes himselfe (and not without cause) fortunate to be tearmed your schollar. Thus all relye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord, upon your favour. And I (who though I must needs honour) yet usually with so deepe affection am not devoted without cause) doe so in kindnesse and loue (if that be not a word too presumptuous) passe over the full interest of my selfe to your dispose, as in what kinde soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a schollar may doe his dutie, I am readie and desirous to be commanded by you: then accept (noble lorde) the willing mind of him that hath nothing else: and say, that that alone, is absolutely sufficient to content you. Read it, but (or if that be to much) doe but accept it, and so rest. where of not doubting in the middest of so many signes of a schollar-respecting honour, in dutie I kisse my hand, and humbly take my leaue.</p>

I know it could fit these to write, but that <hi>magni laboris est quem plerique fugimus. Homer</hi> wrote of the trauailes of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Graecian <hi>Vlysses; Curtius</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius; Rome</hi> had neuer beene so renowmed but for <hi>Titus Livius; Thucydides</hi> eternized <hi>Iason</hi> and <hi>Minotaure;</hi> and sweet <hi>Salust Iugurth</hi> and <hi>Cateline:</hi> nay this wise age, long since had beene plaine foolish, if our painefull forefathers had not trauailed for their good. And if any man thinke this age is too wisely learned to read any thing which is but some fewe droppes of that mayne Ocean which ouerflowed in their daies, let him knowe this, that care added to their industrious trauailes, is easily able to perform matters of great importance. Learning was let loose ouer all <hi>Europe</hi> euer since <hi>Athens</hi> did first flourish (excepting a fevve yeares when the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> compelled her to liue in exile) who flying fast from their furie left <hi>Italie</hi> and those famous places, and planted her selfe so firmely in these poore countreies, that euer since amongst vs shee hath liued honourably. Thus in the abundance of our knowledge, he that hath taken pains, stands at the courtesie of euery paltrie fellowe to be censured as it please him. In consideration whereof, wise men haue deemed it the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, secretly to smile, and soberly to say nothing.

               <note place="margin">What Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is.</note> 
               <hi>is a foretelling of things to come, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it in diuers manners, as well artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as naturally.</hi> But those that more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously subtilize vpon the Etymologie, say, that to diuine is properly to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and to foresee things to come, by an exteriour motion, without hauing any subiect, cause, or signe before hand<note place="margin">God alone absolutely knoweth things to come.</note> to coniecture so; and therefore in this sort, God testifieth of himselfe, that he alone knoweth things to come, which afterward he reueiled by his Prophets

and Apostles, as it pleased him. Now Satan desiring in this to bee Gods Ape,<note place="margin">Satan Gods</note> (thereby the better to abuse the world, &amp; to drowne men in intolerable super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, by a naturall curiositie to know things to come) hath iniuriouslie and falselie vsurped the same authoritie to<note place="margin">Satan false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Diuiner.</note> diuine, and from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce proceedeth the word <hi>Diuination:</hi> so that thereby Satan so much the more vnder a cloak of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, is for the most part as a forger and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeiter (excepting the diuination whereupon the subiect of this matter depends:) and therefore it is necessarie to trie and examine in the first place, the might, subtiltie and craft of the diuell; in whom we shall finde as great knowledge and vnderstanding,<note place="margin">The power of Satan.</note> (excepting the Angels) as in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures besides; wee shall finde as great subtiltie for interpreting the signes of diuers things: a matchles vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie: an incomparable cunning, to inuent trumperies; and deceit, vnder fine coloured, but false pretences: And
<pb facs="tcp:9363:7"/>
to conclude, a most perfect malice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a perpetuall hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Satan a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</note> mankinde: and the rather, seeing that it is not in his force, to doe any thing of himselfe: to hinder the course of things naturall ordained by God: to destroy and to make againe: to sound the depth of mans heart: or to foresee how God gouerneth the course of the world: the affayres of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before the reuelation of his diuine prophesies. Notwithstanding he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth by his subtiltie the hid proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things bodily and spirituall. His knowledge is exceeding by his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience of things past: he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth so farre as may possibly bee soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into mens maners; and copies out their actions, from whence he deriueth his greatest profit. Thus he incombers the actions of Kings &amp; Princes of each in particular; that contrarie to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and opinion of men, they are all so intermedlingly inwrapped each in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther states, that scarse anie knoweth
<pb facs="tcp:9363:8"/>
how to escape himselfe. Thorough the deepe whereof he so lancheth without sight, that he maketh one of them to entrap and beguile another: whereof euerie where are examples sufficient, and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ephesians setteth downe most liuely Satans puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance. But let vs see a little neerer the diuels policie, of what force &amp; efficacie it is, especially in those things which concerne the ruines of Gouernment, or change of a Common wealth. First then, although that the diuell knoweth not the state and affayres of Kings and Princes in particular, as God from the beginning hath predestinated them in his immutable counsel, nor how he wil dispose and change them contrarie to the opinion of men &amp; ordinarie course of things natural; yet notwithstanding the knowledge which men by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of almightie God, haue drawn<note place="margin">Man infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in knowledge to Satan.</note> out of the diuine prophesies of ancient time, is not comparable to that of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, by reason he farre surpasseth man,
<pb facs="tcp:9363:8"/>
in fine, quick &amp; nimble subtiltie, which he vseth to his owne aduantage. These<note place="margin">Spirits.</note> know by the predictions of Prophets: that such Kings and Princes shall come to gouerne: besides, by what meanes<note place="margin">Note.</note> they shall attaine it, and by whom God will giue the Scepter into their hands: besides, when and how it shall be taken from them. And in one word, Satan<note place="margin">Foretold.</note> knoweth the estate of Gouernment which must happen, and how long it shal endure, and the enemies which shal rise vp for the ruine of it. From these &amp; such like reuelations would they drawe their diuinations. They haue found out by the prophesies of <hi>Daniel</hi> the estate &amp; chaunge of Monarchies which must happen, the ruine of <hi>Darius,</hi> the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Asia:</hi> and that the Monarchie of <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be transported to the <hi>Greekes:</hi> By meanes whereof, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great consulted with the<note place="margin">Oracles.</note> Oracle at <hi>Delphos, Pythias</hi> answered him, <hi>Eris inuictus Alexander:</hi> Thou shalt be vnconquered <hi>Alexander.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:9363:9"/>
for confirming, and giuing credit to his Oracle, hee ceased not to shewe<note place="margin">Satans sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie.</note> signes &amp; wonders together with vaine illusions, in the behalfe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which way soeuer he marched with his armie: on the contrarie not to daunt <hi>Darius</hi> too much, he nourisht in him a<note place="margin">Satan an Ambidex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> vaine hope by doubtfull dreames, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him fondly of victorie, against his enemie. For the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are of that sort, that they promise vs all ioy and happines whatsoeuer: but no sooner they are entertained of vs, but in their place commeth despayre, with a perpetuall torment. By the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Esai,</hi> the diuell<note place="margin">Satan know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> knewe that the Monarchie of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> should be wholly desolate and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the power of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and that al this should be done by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For this cause it was foretold, that King <hi>Croesus</hi> should be chased and spoyled of the kingdome of <hi>Lydia:</hi> And therefore knowing the might of King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Satan ceased not to moue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb facs="tcp:9363:9"/>
               <hi>Croesus</hi> by a bayte of ambition, to<note place="margin">Croesus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</note> oppose himselfe against the <hi>Persian Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> This being done, the <hi>Assyrians</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre was spoyled, <hi>Croesus</hi> conquered, and the Monarchie translated to <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one especiall example farre surpassing all that antiquitie mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Satans subtiltie, whereby appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly he shewed the intent and effect of his whole treacherie: It was that of the great contemplatiue diuine <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iamblich.</note> who desirous to knowe the name of him that should in the Empyre suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Emperour <hi>Ualens</hi> that then raigned, he made trial of it by a certain<note place="margin">A thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> foolish (be it spoken with reuerence to so wise a man) and most vnlearned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination in this manner: He caused the Greeke Alphabet written to bee put by distinct letters, in the ground, and vpon euery one he placed a graine of Barley;<note place="margin">A foolish proofe.</note> in the midst a Cock, &amp; the letters where the Cocke scraped the Barley, should signifie the thing he so much desired. Now it happened that the Cock bared

these foure letters: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> he remained vncertain of the name which these letters should portend, to discerne whether it were <hi>Theodosius,</hi> or <hi>Theodotus, Theodorus,</hi> or <hi>Theodectes.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Ualens</hi> seeing the euent of all this, &amp; fearing some false play, made<note place="margin">Diuination will beget Tyrannie.</note> 
               <hi>(Herod</hi> like) all such to be put to death, as those letters did poynt out. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded likewise, to search foorth the <hi>Diuine.

But we shall finde for the most part that the diuell the more to delude men by<note place="margin">Doubtfull answers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue deceite, or ignorance.</note> these diuinations, gaue his answers hid, darke, double, and doubtful, especiallie when himselfe (which often happened) was vncertaine of the euent, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led by suspicious and sleight conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, without euidence of diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, (as appeared by the doubt of
<pb facs="tcp:9363:10"/>
that name which those foure letters might portend:) for not knowing the trueth, he talketh by circumstances and darke signes, sometimes telling the trueth to gaine credit to his false lyes,<note place="margin">A Caueat.</note> seeing by a malicious instinct he stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to obscure the trueth, to the great dammage of mortall men. For his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in falshood, and his ioy is in our fall. That is the reason why hee vseth these doubtfull &amp; vncertaine answers, to the intent to abuse men by his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous apish mockeries, and finally to bring them by a certaine feare, and a sorrow of things to come, to most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable wickednesse, in executing the self same euil, which before he had told vnto him, that inquired of it.</p>
            <p>We haue a most famous example and worth the marking, of an Oracle (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their doubtfull answers) which was found in <hi>Greece</hi> vnder the shadowe<note place="margin">Ambiguitie in oracles.</note> of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, man, light.</note> placed (for the ancient Greekes were
<pb facs="tcp:9363:11"/>
not careful in this, as it is well noted by <hi>Iustus Lypsius:</hi>) then the doubt of the foresayd Oracle, by reason of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie of the word, made them vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whether their sacrifice should be of humane flesh or some other thing; euen so now we see oftentimes that he hath told the euent of things, whereof he is the author: yet notwithstanding for al that, because God hath admirable meanes in his counsell for to gouerne all that is in the world, and because Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is ignorant of the euent or chaunge<note place="margin">God dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie.</note> of things disposed by GOD himselfe, (whether it bee a punishment or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of his rigor, which he vseth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the execution of his iustice) he vttereth his diuinations &amp; predictions in obscure manner, ballanced with an equal, yet difficult interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may as well agree to this as to that, not only for the doubtfull sense, but for the double reading of it. Of this kind was this: <hi>Croesus Halym penetrans magna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertit opum vim.</hi> Likewise the fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

example of the answere which the<note place="margin">Pope Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias.</note> diuel gaue vnto Pope <hi>Borgias</hi> of eleuen yeares and eight moneths, may serue to confirme this. Furthermore, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not only knoweth by diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies<note place="margin">Satan cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> the subuersions, ruines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroings of Monarchies, but he intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe often into the handling of them, &amp; entermedleth in the counsel of Kings and Princes, enforcing them<note place="margin">A states ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> by all means possible to bring in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: to trouble the estate: to oppose themselues one against another: to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse Realmes: to debase lawes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good gouernment of the Common wealth. He is alwayes ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of some newes, daily to hinder good and sound counsell, and in stead<note place="margin">The author of ill lawes.</note> of them to set abroach other, fatall to the Church and the Common wealth: he enflameth the hearts of the mightie, with an ambitious desire of ruling, to this end, he perswades them to followe bad counsell, seruing for the execution of their dissignments: Such as these are<note place="margin">Ieroboam.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:9363:12"/>
plentifull in the holie scripture. Thus he moued the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to come to rob and spoyle <hi>Iob</hi> of his riches, and to sley<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 17.</note> his seruants. Thus he plotted like an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t states man, to hinder the rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after the returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> perswading<note place="margin">Note.</note> king <hi>Cambyses,</hi> by meanes of the Courts flatterers, to make warre against the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> which hee did: And for feare lest the <hi>Iewes</hi> should enter into alliance<note place="margin">Satan vseth great men sometimes for his turne.</note> with them of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the king comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in plain termes, to hinder the work of the Temple which was then begun: and thus Satan compassed his intended scope. When he asked leaue to enter into the heard of swine, hee had more craft then a common politicke: He did<note place="margin">A foreseeing Polititian.</note> the <hi>Gaderens</hi> a displeasure in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by that meanes, foreseeing they would entreat Christ to go out of their kingdome, and so runne headlong with their swine, into eternall destruction. Againe, he stood at the right side of the Sacrificer in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to hinder that
<pb facs="tcp:9363:12"/>
no good thing might bee done in that citie. Hee attacheth (as it were) with a<note place="margin">Rather them then others to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> contagious infection the most part of publique persons, the better by that meanes to obtaine his purpose, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the charge which they sustaine for to preserue others. Then seeing that Satan intermingleth himself in the midst of affayres publique, and that by a diuine permission, he insnareth both<note place="margin">1. King. 22.</note> one, and other, ayming continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to subuert the state, (especiallie of Monarches) knowing besides, that their ruine and change shall happen, it is no meruaile that hee oftentimes foresees the euents whereof he is the cause, and afterward forgeth <hi>Diuinations,</hi> to the<note place="margin">Satan buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth into mens hearts that which he hath plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe.</note> intent to deceiue both one and other. But although that God oftentimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Satan (by reason of our demerits) to exercise his tyrannie ouer the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall states of the world, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that permission is not infinite; for God keepeth, gardeth, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Realmes, to the intent that being

It is most certaine that GOD permitteth Satan somtimes to tyrannize ouer one, or other, as we see in the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan 4. 29.</note> who was giuen into his power for seuen yeares: yet notwithstanding whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleased him hee made a restraint and brideled his vnruly will.

was a most heroicall King and no Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: (howsoeuer some doe intend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise)<note place="margin">A monarchy easily a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</note> because that by his meanes was established the forme of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, most durable to gouerne,<note place="margin">His begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> and to keepe the people in order and discipline. And so from this first diuine wisedome, humane societie was kept v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited from time to time. This likewise<note place="margin">A Prince Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent.</note> is the cause why the Prince is tearmed Gods Vicegerent vpon earth. Finally, he was garded with such force, that the Empyres (which wee call Monarchies) by this meanes were ordained: &amp; then of the selfe same Monarchies, (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">A thing vsuall.</note> of an insatiable ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to rule) proceeded Tyrannies. But although that Tyrants, by the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, seemed sometimes (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their horrible murders and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions) to bee willing to cancell all law, and peruert all iustice, that tended to the maintenance of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and whereby Empyres flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: yet notwithstanding wee finde by
<pb facs="tcp:9363:14"/>
the discourse of histories, that the verie Tyrants themselues, by a diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">Tyrants haue often had a care of good lawes.</note> haue oftentimes left behinde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good lawes, as the true markes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, tending to the maintenance and conseruation of kingdoms, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that humane societie should not either be disperst, or raced out. God hath the meanes to vs vnknowne, to keep them from such wickednesses, that he turneth the euil of present ruling Tyrants, vnto the especiall good of gouerning poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: for his will is the perfect rule and the infallible direction of all right and equitie. By reason whereof some are of that mind, that although the Empyre of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> in dignitie and greatnes<note place="margin">The Turke no Monarch.</note> exceeded the foure Monarchs of the worlde, yet notwithstanding it could not bee reputed for a true Monarchie, because that amongst those barbarous people, there was neither humanitie nor forme, or shewe of iustice, but a<note place="margin">Without Iustice no Monarchie.</note> meere deuastation of Empyres, and a reall destruction of all lawes and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb facs="tcp:9363:15"/>
which were established and drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly obserued of other Monarchies, vnder whom (notwithstanding their enormities) God had continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued miraculously a forme of iustice, to the intent to preserue his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I will onely alleadge two examples (not to bee too troublesome) without touch or mention of the Romane lawes afterward brought in, to shew by them the equitie and iustice, which Tyrants and Infidels themselues haue somtimes in the gouernment of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths vsed, as well in regard of their<note place="margin">Iustice som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</note> ciuill and politicke order, as Militarie. The one long since famous, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the execution of iustice in King <hi>Cambyses</hi> (otherwise a great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) which he executed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudge<note place="margin">Cambyses.

<pb facs="tcp:9363:15"/>
of his father. The other, is the famous<note place="margin">Anaxilaus.</note> and memorable example of <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> whom the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> vsed thus: He seeing that in the time of the siege of the citie <hi>Byzance, Clearchus</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take the goods of the Burgesses, that dyed for famine, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide amongst his Souldiers, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hold the towne longer, he dealt in the absence of <hi>Clearchus</hi> with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to yeeld vp the towne vpon good conditions, which soone yeelded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pillage or shedding of bloud.

as may bee apparantly manifest, both by the examples alleadged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; by many others here and there which may bee alleadged to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The reason of the difference in regarde of time, and the diuersitie of change which happeneth in them, is likewise grounded vpon the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods word: we haue saide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that GOD giueth the Scepter of realmes as it pleaseth him, and taketh them away as his pleasure is. Likewise<note place="margin">The change of Kingdoms not by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> the change of kingdomes happeneth not by chaunce, but by diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; by reason of the causes, which goe before the ruines of them, by meanes whereof, God so disposeth of Realmes and Empyres, that whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he hath installed for gouernement, are by him defended with might and authoritie, as the especiall gift of God, accompanied with many vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite thereunto, namely wisdom, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, goodwill, iustice, clemencie, &amp;c. all which ioyntly sustaine the pillars of

               <hi>Harmonie.</hi> Master <hi>Iohn Bodin</hi> is of that
<pb facs="tcp:9363:21"/>
minde, that this <hi>Harmonie</hi> is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood<note place="margin">Harmonie.</note> of tunes &amp; melodious sounds. For the better interpretation whereof, and the more to confirme his opinion, in the fourth booke of his Politicks he hath made the forme of a Tria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle with certaine numbers thereupon, to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a musicall harmonie; and so apply it to <hi>Plato</hi> his opinion. Wherein he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Master <hi>Augier Ferrier</hi> Lord of <hi>Castillon,</hi> who making the distinction<note place="margin">Aequiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</note> of the word <hi>Harmonie,</hi> to put away all equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, sayth, that the word <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> is a generall terme, applied to all things well beseeming: and to all good proportions: to all Common wealths well framed: to all families well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and generally to euery thing iustly and orderly disposed: of perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and of fine accorde. So the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians call the best constitutions of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The Musitians take the word o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and referre it to tunes &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious soundes: and so <hi>Plato</hi> saying that Common wealths come to ruine
<pb facs="tcp:9363:22"/>
when the harmonie faileth, that is to<note place="margin">Plato ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by M.

And speaking to Master <hi>Bodin,</hi> thinke you (sayth he) that <hi>Plato</hi> vnderstood that of tunes &amp; melodious sounds, which <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> neuer thought of concerning the change of Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths? And giuing another reason against the former interpretation, hee saith, that all proportion is not song, or melodie, although otherwise it bee a harmonie, for his good structure and equall figure: he alleadgeth onely this place for the defence of the true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of that which <hi>Plato</hi> wrote, and of the word <hi>Harmonie:</hi> for concerning<note place="margin">Harmonie not the ground of Kingdomes.</note> the maine poynt, <hi>Bodin</hi> himselfe is of that opinion, that changing or preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Common wealths, no way depends on the <hi>Harmonie</hi> of soundes.

The reason of such as wholly contemne the Art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">No good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> ascribing vnto it anie vertue, or force at all, is grounded vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of it, as being onely builded vpon vncertaine coniectures, without the true demonstration of things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon onely trueth depends. But those that do auouch the vertue of them, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the first place, that God sayd in the beginning that he made lights, that<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> he placed them in the heauens, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate night from day, and to be for signes
<pb facs="tcp:9363:28"/>
and seasons for dayes and yeares. From this place they reason thus, that Nature made nothing in vaine, since that all creatures are made for some certaine end, but these creatures day lie doe the same workes by their order and course appoynted them of God, and the end of<note place="margin">No good reason.</note> that which they doe is their operation; now the starres doe by the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that which the Art of Astronomie saith hath bin found out by experience, and afterward approued by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Then the end of the starres is that for which they were created. Likewise the demonstrations of things are taken from celestiall causes, and their effects, obserued of a long timed experience, by the influence, intension, remission, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and recesse of starres: for euen as<note place="margin">An vnlike similitude.</note> in the seede the vertue of those things is hid which it bringeth foorth, euen so in the starres is hid the force of that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise giuing the effect of a naturall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie change, which is incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiued of them who before haue
<pb facs="tcp:9363:29"/>
searched by supputation the caelestiall motions, and haue attained by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to knowe the course of things, with the euents and effects. The reason is, for euen as wee iudge of the force of things which wee feele, by their effect, euen so wee iudge of the force of Starres by the experience we haue from the long reach of their effects. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their force being hid vnto vs, is<note place="margin">It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue such experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> not so apparantly discouered and clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene, notwithstanding the ordinarie signes shew them, and the common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations of long experience make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee easilie knowne; so that those who haue this foresaid experience, may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretell by an euident coniecture,<note place="margin">This possible &amp; common.</note> the ordinarie effect of the Starres.

<pb facs="tcp:9363:29"/>
as wee haue spoken before.

And then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Massacre continued throughout al France a new starre bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to appeare in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereof the Lord <hi>Plesseyes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dever. Chr.

The wise of the<note place="margin">Heauens signes serue to confute Atheists.</note> world who in a deepe irreligious poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thought al things to be eternal, now began to worship a Creator. And what shall wee thinke (sayth he) but that it signifieth the newe birth of Christ in earth by the preaching of the Gospell? Wee reade also of a certaine flame of fire which shewed it selfe miraculously in the heauen right aboue the armie of <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour of the East, at the<note place="margin">Licinius.</note>

same time when hee lost the battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, then when there was question for an vniuersall chaunge of the Romane Empire, and a totall destruction of Gods Church: for the one maintained the Christians, the other tyrannized vpon them, and in the cruellest manner put them to death. Hereupon followed a most bloudy and deadly warre betwixt these two. It was then or a little before that <hi>Constantine</hi> had seene in the heauen the victorious Crosse of Christ, whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so assuredly: For when he would combate, <hi>Maxence</hi> hauing seene the<note place="margin">Maxent.</note> foresayd Crosse with this inscription a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, <hi>In this signe shalt thou ouercome thy enemies:</hi> he caused then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to come, and enquired of them concerning our Lord and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, of his natiuitie, of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of his resurrection.

The meaning of <hi>Ieremies</hi> words are no such thing: for he would not seeme either to contemne or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the signes of heauen, thereby to despise Astronomie, but only to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the faithfull fearing God, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they might remaine confirmed &amp; strengthened in Gods promises, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being discouraged or fearefull in their mindes by the sight of the signes in heauen.

But when these and such calamities are whole and entire, as it happened to the townes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> of <hi>Gomorrah</hi> (which in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time were made a lake of Brimstone) and since that to the townes of <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Bura:</hi> that change is then as it were from death to life, &amp; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent farre more great and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then of a Monarchie turned into an <hi>Aristocratie</hi> and <hi>Democratie,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of common wealth; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well deserueth to bee added to the chapter of chaunges, and ruines of Common wealths.

<pb facs="tcp:9363:34"/>
Inundations vniuersall, and<note place="margin">Inundations.</note> particular, are of this sort. Furthermore wee may here adde to the Diuinations aboue sayd, the great Coniunctions of<note place="margin">Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> the hye Planets, which are principallie set to play together, thereby to iudge of the chaunge and fall of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And although these depende likewise vpon Astrologie, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these seeme to bee more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and better grounded then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular predictions of the stars, by reason of their reuolution and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie running euerie eight hundred yeare, or there about, according to the opinion of Master <hi>Augier Ferrier,</hi> which<note place="margin">No absolute necessitie.</note> as a man would think haue shewed their effect (as it were) to the touch, and to the eye, with an astonishment of the wise, although that draw not with it any meere necessitie. For we must not think the necessitie of their operation such, as the Astrologers did say, in the yeare 1524. hauing foretold that there shuld<note place="margin">1524.</note> happen a Coniunction, like to that of

Many notable chaunges, which happened here and there by reason of great Coniunctions, may bee seene in <hi>Bodin</hi> in the same place. By these rules and meanes aforesayd, wee may settle a certaine iudgement for the chaunge that is to happen to Common wealths, Realmes and Empires.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth the last poynt, which principally hath moued me to alleadge those places, concerning this subiect
<pb facs="tcp:9363:35"/>
matter which we haue in hand: that is, of Dreames, which the diuell spreadeth<note place="margin">Of dreames.</note> as a meanes, to make his illusions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, to make his craftie subtilties and false predictions of things to come to be of more force, knowing that men by an exceeding curiositie would force<note place="margin">Mans curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie neuer staied.</note> themselues, by vnlawfull meanes, to finde out the knowledge of the effect of them. Then because there are diuers sorts of Dreames, wee will make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the chiefe of them. And to inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to draw out the better knowledge of their difference, I thinke it good to diuide them into foure parts, (and the rather to auoyde the pluralities of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which authors haue made in the handling of them) that is to say, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Diuellish, Diuinatorie (or as the Greekes call it <hi>Simantica</hi>) and Diuine. The naturall Dreames are when things<note place="margin">Naturall Dreames. 1.</note> before either seene, heard, or touched, or fore-thought of, &amp; afterward as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the phantasie, are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sleeping, bringing the visions which

               <note place="margin">Valer. Max. lib. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Parmensis,</hi> who hauing followed the partie of <hi>M. Anthony</hi> against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Augustus,</hi> betooke him after the battell toward <hi>Athens,</hi> and that night
<pb facs="tcp:9363:36"/>
being in bed without all feare (as hee was) dreamed, that he saw before him a blacke man with a fauchion, long head, and with an ilfauored beard; and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him what he was, he answered him,<note place="margin">Marke it.</note> 
               <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> that is an euill spirit: <hi>Cassius</hi> being afraide as well of the name, as the shape, called his seruants, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Satans illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> if they had seene such a man, either enter or goe out: then when they tolde him they had seene no such, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke himselfe againe to sleepe.

But the historie saith, that soone after he was put to death by the commaundement of the Emperor. The vision of <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> was like to this, then when the Diuell appeared vnto him in a moste hideous shape. The other sort of diuelish dreames are,<note place="margin">A second sort of diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish dreames.</note> when as the men themselues are causes of them, as the heathen were in times
<pb facs="tcp:9363:37"/>
past by meanes of their vowes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices full of idolatrie, which they made by the instigation of Sathan, who went to meete them in appoynted pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Heathen su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> as wee reade of those who went in the night to the Temples, couered with the skinnes of beastes, which they had slaine to idols, with a full perswasion, that all that they dreamed should bee reputed for a most vndoubted oracle: And thus tooke they their beginning. The answers which the diuell gaue to the heathen in diuerse sortes, namely by <hi>voyce,</hi> by <hi>dreames,</hi> &amp; by other meanes<note place="margin">By shaking the head.</note> of them whom hee hath in chaunted, to the imitation of these are instituted, as by tradition those oblations which are at this day to Saintes in the Church of Rome, to the intent to obtaine some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for their maladie, and it makes them answer by hanging downe of the<note place="margin">An imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heathen.</note> head of him, that is put in the image, to the example of those ill spirits, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured men sometimes within these sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by art Magick. These diuelish an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb facs="tcp:9363:37"/>
abouesaide, they termed oracles,<note place="margin">Oracles.</note> and they had diuers names. Amongst many others whereunto histories giue credit, are renowned that of <hi>Trophonius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Trophonius den. Seraphis. Delphos.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; Seraphis</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of <hi>Delphos</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> ordained to the example of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracles: for God declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto his Prophets three manner of waies, namely by <hi>vision walking,</hi> by<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>dreames sleeping,</hi> and by open <hi>voyce</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>all obscuritie.</hi> The two first were with a certaine rauishment of the spirit, and the transporting (as it were) of all the sence by a reuelation. The third with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble, either of sence, or spirite. But concerning the reuelation done by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> to the intent to knowe the successe of things, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the text of the Bible, that that manner of prophesying was not so common, nor continued so long, as those aboue mentioned, for it was one of the principall which fayled at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing<note place="margin">When Vrim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim ceased.</note> of the second Temple. Then it is a thing most cleare, that Satan will i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
<pb facs="tcp:9363:38"/>
all manner of fashions, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to abuse men vnder a pretence of<note place="margin">A perfect Ape.</note> holines: as when God shewed himselfe to <hi>Moyses</hi> in the burning bush, &amp; when<note place="margin">Exod. 3. Math. 3. 17.</note> the voyce came from Heauen at Christs Baptisme; whereby wee were let to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that he was the sonne of God. In like manner are inuented the answers of Satan, which hee giueth by dreames, to the imitation of diuine dreames, as that of <hi>Pharoh, Joseph,</hi> and others from<note place="margin">Gen 41.</note> GOD. To conclude, all practises and sleights of Satan, to the intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue mankinde, haue beene inuented vnder the shadowe of the institutions and workes ordained of God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iustly he may be called Gods Ape.

<pb facs="tcp:9363:38"/>
from whence all had their beginning. For if wee would sift out narrowly the meanes which the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> vsed in their Magick arts to call out the Diuell, we shall finde that they vsed<note place="margin">Satan indeed careth for none of all these.</note> as well light, waxe, candels, and holy wordes, as the priests doe at this daye. There haue been also of other nations, as <hi>Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who obserued other sortes of superstitions and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by them to forge their diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they did to the imitation of the diuine sacrifices, by the inspection of the intrales of beastes which were slaine, namely the liuer, the hart, and the gall, which the Latins call <hi>Extispici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:9363:39"/>
the art of diuining by the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Augures.</note> of birds, and chiefely by the <hi>Angures,</hi> who had the young ones to that ende nourished in Cages, to serue them for their vses: but in the ende they were so mocked with them, as <hi>P.

            <p>The Dreames which wee call Diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie or presaging, differ from naturall Dreames, in that these happen not by reason of the motion, or abundance of any humor, or other qualitie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but by a singular vertue and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:9363:41"/>
of the starres, who (as it were) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with an vnderstanding of things to come, affect likewise the braine of him that dreameth by a commixtion &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction<note place="margin">How starres worke in our Dreames.</note> of the first qualities, which are betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the beginning, in such sort that the Dreamer being as it were aduertised, hee imprinteth that in his braine, and so continually thinking to knowe the euent, by little and little, the formes and figures of things to come represent themselues vnto his spirit. Somtimes that is reueiled by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of things to come, as the Dreame of King <hi>Astyages,</hi> who dreamed that<note place="margin">The dreame of Astyages.</note> from the wombe of his daughter <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> came forth a Vine so great &amp; large, that it couered with the shadowe of it all the parts of his Realme.

            <p>Notwithstanding all that wee haue said, both concerning the singular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the starres, causing the foresaide presaging dreames, as also in respect of Astrologie it selfe, there is an opinion<note place="margin">An excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writer.</note> at this day quite contrarie.

Lastly, with his excellencie, to admonish vs of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the workeman, as one that made all thinges for some good ende. He denyeth also, that the change of the ayre, and the season, are caused by the particular starres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that this new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomer ascribeth all the force of the starres, to the Sunne; and not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie to the vertue of any speciall starre which borroweth light from it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto hee addeth diuers other reasons, which may be found in the third booke
<pb facs="tcp:9363:46"/>
of his Astrologie: Neither is it mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall though (saith hee) it come to passe sometimes as they haue foretolde, for God so testifieth that it shall happen, Deutero. 13. <hi>For if there rise in the middest</hi>

For it is he onely that knoweth all things to come.</hi> On the other side, concerning that which some say of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> as it is written, <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Moses was skilfull in all the knowledge of the Egyptians,</hi> that ought not to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode<note place="margin">An vnlike coniecture.</note> of Astrologie, or <hi>Mateologie,</hi> but of skill in the Hebrue learning, and of such like artes: Wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrarie to Gods trueth: and we see the flat contrarie, that <hi>Moses</hi> in the presence of King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> reprehended the diuines of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and discouered their abominable superstitions. The
<pb facs="tcp:9363:46"/>
same may appeare by <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions, who had in such hatred the diuelish arts that rayned in the court of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded al to abstaine from eating of the Kings dainties. Then because it seemes strange to holde against the common opinion of all Astronomers, that the change of the ayre, and that a happie or vnhappie time is no whit caused by the particular vertue of the starres, as to this present hath beene obserued, how<note place="margin">Ob.</note> happeneth it, that in the 16. of Matth. and in the 12. of Luke, the tempests and stormes, and also faire weather are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde by the appearance of heauen? To<note place="margin">Sol.</note> this he answereth and saith, that it is one<note place="margin">A signe &amp; a cause dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> thing to coniecture by signes likely, and another to foretell what must happen from causes necessarie. For signes and causes farre differ the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as for example, the dawning of the day or the twilight, are neither causes of raine nor faire weather, but onely a signe ioyned to the nature of the thing,
<pb facs="tcp:9363:47"/>
which thereby shewes vnto vs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the ayre: euen as wee see a Phisition, who by the colour of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin can easely iudge of the disposition of the bodie, yet no man will say that<note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> the colour is the cause of his sicknes; in like manner of the heauen, a signe but no cause. The same also may bee done by the appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sun or Moone: neuertheles, it is by the euidence of such signes as necessarilie shall happen, and as he saith. <hi>A causis iam fieri &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientibus, hoc est, vbi iam causa est in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu aliquo posita.</hi> From thence are the causes of the predictions of the change of ayre, and of bad times by the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Phisitions, and such like, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those may bee referred of <hi>Uirgil,</hi> in diuerse places, all which differ from the predictions &amp; prognostications, which the Astronomers ordinarily doe forge vnto vs, a whole yeare before: <hi>Et qui ex causis remotissimis praedicunt effectus.</hi> In the end he concludes, that these predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Astrologicall diuinations
<pb facs="tcp:9363:47"/>
are wholly forbidden, as wel by equitie,<note place="margin">Frischlin is too veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers.</note> as by holy Scripture: and as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe speaketh in the 37. of <hi>Iob, It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for man to sounde the depth of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. Hast thou considered (saith he) the spatious place of the earth, declare it if thou canst tell?</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> in the book of Ecclesiastes saith: <hi>As thou knowest not at all the waie of the winde, nor how the bones are knit together in the bellie of her that is with childe, euen so thou knowest not the whole of Gods worke.</hi> And euen so the starres are made for no other ende<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 17.</note> then for to serue vs for the obseruation of dayes, moneths, &amp; yeres, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Genesis: And to confirme the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> and arguments aboue said, the same author alleadgeth the opinion of <hi>Basill, Chrysostome, Nazianzen, Theodoret, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, Ambrose, Lactantius, Eusebius, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> And of the auncient Philosophers he alleadgeth <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Hipocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Celsus.</hi> Of the latter, <hi>Celius, Rodingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Picus Mirandula, Longus, Thomas, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rastus, Caluin, Luther.</hi> By meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:9363:48"/>
if wee will suppose the trueth of the reasons aboue sayd, the Arte of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie should obtain none or very little credit of vs at all. Notwithstanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appeareth by many places of holie scripture, that it is impossible for<note place="margin">Astronomie must not goe so farre.</note> man to sound the secrets of heauen, as from them to bee able to draw certaine diuinations, or predictions of things to come, as well in particular as in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; so likewise to submit the life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the influences of starres and celestial bodies: yet so it is that the starres and signes of heauen haue bin obserued of a long time to haue in them a certaine especiall vertue, by that of the Sunne. But that is not specially to gouerne the creatures belowe, for GOD himselfe hath tolde vs in the 37. of <hi>Iob: Didst thou knowe when God disposed them and made the light to shine? Hast thou knowne the varietie of the cloudes, and the wondrous workes of him that is perfect in knowledge?</hi> And so <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in Ecclesiastes: <hi>As thou knowest not the voyce of the winde, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Vpon the other side, to returne to Dreames whereof wee haue begun to speak before: those dreames that come by reason of a <hi>Sympathie,</hi> are placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst<note place="margin">Dreames by reason of a Sympathie.</note> those of presaging, as when one friend dreameth of another: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, wee haue that of <hi>Calphurnia</hi> wife<note place="margin">Calphurnia.</note> of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who dreamed the day before he was murdered, that she sawe her husband lye wounded in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and for that cause she prayed him earnestly not to goe that day vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:9363:49"/>
Senate: But to the intent he might not be thought to be skarred with a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dreame, he went &amp; was slaine. It is sayd that <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> dreamed one<note place="margin">Katherine of Medices.</note> day that King <hi>Henry</hi> her husband had one of his eyes put out, as it happened vnto him the next morning. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the trueth &amp; certitude of euents which these dreams haue brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, some are of that opinion that they deserue rather to be called <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> then <hi>Diuinatorie,</hi> to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that of <hi>Pilats</hi> wife, who being set in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Hall, she sent to him and told him, that he should not haue to doe with that iust one: for that night in her dreame she had suffered much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of him, as it is in <hi>Matthew.</hi> That<note place="margin">Chap. 27.</note> likewise of <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> (by reason of a Sympathie and naturall coniunction) when that hee dreamed of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his<note place="margin">C.

of superstition in the world, by reason<note place="margin">Dreames the fountain of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> of vnlawfull meanes, which men vse to attaine to the knowledge of the euents of things to come, for this cause wee ought not either to obserue, or giue<note place="margin">Not to trust them.</note> credite vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor interpret them, as God hath commanded. The trueth and effect of prophesies which is drawne from them is discouered, and made knowne by the ende and impossibilitie (as the scripture speaketh by the works of the Prophet.)

The diuine<note place="margin">Diuine Dreames.</note> Dreames which come by the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counsell of God, are those whereof the holie scripture maketh mention, as of the Prophets and other persons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the reuelations of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of weight and importance; as of Iesus Christ, the gouernment of his Church, and other vnlooked for chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Such were the dreames of <hi>Ioseph</hi> &amp; the Prophets, which were knowne by their certaintie, and by the testimonie of trueth it selfe. Some haue made more degrees of diuine Dreames, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make knowne the diuersitie of meanes, which it hath pleased God in former time to vse in the reuelations of his prophesies, which may bee read at large in the fourth chapter of the first
<pb facs="tcp:9363:50"/>

               <note place="margin">God vseth often simple meanes.</note> there he obserueth as well in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of diuine prophesies, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other miracles, that God is serued by persons of diuers qualitie &amp; condition, which had not the degree of ordinarie Prophets, whereof the scripture maketh mention, as of <hi>Esai, Ieremie,</hi> &amp; others. But wee shall finde that oftentimes the same is done by persons heroicall, and of great respect; as appeareth by the dreames of <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> &amp; others, especially in great matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the state of Monarchies &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. The same he doth sometime in things particular and of lesse moment, as may bee proued by infinite places of scripture, &amp; other histories. The dreame of the Emperour <hi>Mauricius</hi> (by reason<note place="margin">Mauricius.</note> of the diuine prouidence which may be marked in it) may serue vs for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who dreamed that he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to a serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his named <hi>Phocas,</hi> to be slaine: for this cause he sent for the Captaine <hi>Philippick</hi> to come out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="tcp:9363:51"/>
and demanded of him if there were not one named <hi>Phocas:</hi> the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that there was such a one, a <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, ambitious,</hi> and <hi>fearefull.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Emperour sayd, alleadging an olde prouerbe to that ende, <hi>If he be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <note place="margin">A coward a murderer.</note> 
               <hi>he is a murderer.</hi> This was the same, who after that he had first slaine his wife and children, caused his head to bee cut off: but the recitall of it is memorable, that <hi>Maurice</hi> seeing his children murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Phocas,</hi> and that he himselfe must be put to death presently, he spake of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this manner, <hi>O Lord thou art iust,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>and so are all thy workes.</hi> In like manner, the dreame of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so worth the marking, who marching with his armie toward <hi>Iudea,</hi> met with the hie Priest clothed in his solemne at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, who came to demaund peace of him in the name of the people. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> seeing that, lighted from his horse, and saluted him with great reuerence, and promised them peace. His Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines amazed hereat, incontinentlie
<pb facs="tcp:9363:51"/>
demanded, what made <hi>Alexander</hi> to do<note place="margin">Alexander.</note> such honor to the Priest. <hi>Alexander</hi> said, that before the warres of <hi>Macedon</hi> hee had seene him in a vision in the same forme and fashion that hee came vnto him, calling him to come into <hi>Asia,</hi> and commanding him to make warre with the <hi>Persians,</hi> and he put foorth his hand as it were to guide him. And so seeing now that this high Priest is most like to the former visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was perswaded that God had some care of his people there, and for that cause he would spare them, as indeede he shewed afterward, both by freeing them from tribute, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them against their enemies. By reason whereof some are of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is very likely that the <hi>Iewes</hi> aduertised <hi>Alexander</hi> then of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> hauing foretold 200. yeare before, that the King of <hi>Greece</hi> should conquer <hi>Persia.</hi> The dreame of the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> was such like,<note place="margin">Theodosius.</note> then when as sleeping it seemed vnto him that by a certaine vision hee was
<pb facs="tcp:9363:52"/>
commaunded to goe combat <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Argobastus,</hi> both Tyrants &amp; sworne enemies to the name of God, which hee did, and in fighting vpon a sodaine such a great storme arose, that in all respects so hindred the enemie, that that was the cause of the victorie, and the victorie the cause of the Poets song <hi>Claudianus:</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>On the other side, GOD reuealeth sometimes the truth of things to come, by the meanes of some men who are of good life and fearing God; wherein the dreame of <hi>Mardocay</hi> concerning Queene <hi>Esther</hi> his Neece, &amp; of <hi>Aman,</hi> (as it is written in the booke of <hi>Hester</hi>) shall serue vs for example.

Many such like dreames may be found out in the course of histories. Now these dreames whereof wee haue spoken, and all such as are of the same sort, are acknowledged for good, by the conformitie which they haue to the will of GOD, and to the trueth of the dreame, as God himselfe hath taught vs in the 23. of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> saying, <hi>The Prophet</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 23.</note> 
               <hi>that hath a dreame let him tell a dreame, and he that hath my word let him speake my word faithfully, &amp;c.</hi> Furthermore, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of all ages do teach vs, that God manifesteth sometimes the trueth of some things by the meanes of inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Inspiration.</note> onely without dreame; which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of prophesying is put in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of prophesies: and this he doth when as one perceiueth waking somthing which entreth into his soule, which he may vtter to the praise of God and his workes; wherein God vseth such persons as it pleaseth him. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:9363:53"/>
it may seeme needles to haue many prophecies, by reason that by many visions and diuine reuelations continued in the holy Scripture, wee are alreadie assured of Gods trueth and good pleasure, yet notwithstanding histories, besides experience, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared<note place="margin">But great care must be had herein by reason of so manie false inspirations.</note> vnto vs, that we haue such daylie, and that God neuer ceaseth to send ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements to men; bee it by dreame, vision, or any other meanes, to make them knowe his will, to the intent to guide and gouerne them according to the same; as well for the preseruing of Empires, as of his people, and his owne Church: Then for example of such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements and diuine inspirations, whereof wee now speake, wee haue that of the Christian Schoolemaster in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> with <hi>Lybianus</hi> the Sophister, (when<note place="margin">Lybianus.</note> as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperor, and also the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata,</hi> went against the <hi>Persians</hi>) who demaunded what thinkest thou that the carpenters sonne doth? <hi>The other answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, the Creator of all thinges, whome</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9363:53"/>
               <hi>thou scornefully callest the Carpenters sonne, is making a Cofin to intombe Iulian,</hi> and soone after the newes came that <hi>Iulian</hi> was slaine. The most admirable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of the Philosopher <hi>Cratippus,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">Cratippus.</note> he were a heathen) deserueth to be accounted amongst diuine predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who then when as <hi>Pompey</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, if he were vanquisht in a iust cause, and a farre better one then his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, answered that a state and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth vitious, and corrupt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a gouernour to bee a Monarch, and that so the periods of Empires were fatall, &amp; that the Common wealth<note place="margin">Note this.</note> of the <hi>Romans</hi> should change at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant (as afterward it happened) to an absolute Monarchie. The prediction of<note place="margin">S. Iohn.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist is not amisse for this purpose, who being in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and going to the Bathes, founde in the same place <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Sophister, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the name of God, hee hearing it, said vnto his companions, Let vs goe hence, for this house will presently fall
<pb facs="tcp:9363:54"/>
vpon the blasphemer and his auditors; hee was no sooner gone, but the house fell to the grounde vpon <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and his company. We reade also in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that in the time of <hi>Herode</hi> there was a number of Pharisies, who refused to sweare to the Emperor, &amp; for that cause they weare constrayned to paye a great summe of money, as a recompence, which was payed for them by the wife of one <hi>Pheroras,</hi> &amp; in recompence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Inspirations in former times.</note> one amongst them reuealed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine secret vnto her, which hee said was inspired vnto him from God, namelie, that God had determined in his secret counsell to roote out <hi>Herode</hi> and all his race: and that the end of his kingdome was at hand; as afterward it happened. But it cost the Pharisies deare to haue foretolde the death of <hi>Herode,</hi> for hee made them al to be put to death before. Like examples to these may easilie bee founde (besides in histories) heere and there in holy Scriptures, which I omitte for breuitie sake. The late Chronicles
<pb facs="tcp:9363:54"/>
testifie of <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> Martyr, that hee<note place="margin">Iohn Husse. Fox in lib. Martyr.</note> tolde before his death, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Pope should by little and little, come to ruine and vtter decaye, and that out of his ashes and cynders, there should rise a Swan which should<note place="margin">Meaning Luther which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a swan.</note> not bee rosted in the same sorte, as that Goose was rosted; speaking of himselfe; for the worde <hi>Husse</hi> in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> tongue signifieth a <hi>Goose.</hi> He foretold also, that his aduersaries a hundred yeares after his death should come to answer both God and him. M. <hi>Peucer</hi> speaking of the same prediction, saith that the effect followed, for after the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> till the beginning of the disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of M. <hi>Luther</hi> were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a hundred yeares. At the selfe same time was fulfilled the third and last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the 500. yeares; then that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of errors (wherewith Gods Church had been dimmed) began to be disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and vanish away. The trueth of such like inspirations are knowne by their endes; as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> testifieth,
<pb facs="tcp:9363:55"/>
saying, <hi>The Prophet that shall foretell of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 38.</note> 
               <hi>peace, when his speech shall come to passe, then such a Prophet shall be knowne that the Lord sent him.</hi> In truth principally then, when it is perceiued by diuerse cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that the effect wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the will of God, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the changing of matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,<note place="margin">Anote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie conclusions in Diuining.</note> which we see to happen: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee see that God serueth himselfe with whom it pleaseth him, guiding and gouerning their spirites for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his works, according to his good pleasure. For example of our times, there is extant the prediction of one <hi>Paule Greber,</hi> which hee made of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states<note place="margin">Paul Greber.</note> &amp; Common wealths of <hi>Europe,</hi> of the house of <hi>Burgonie,</hi> and of the Lowe Countries, who amongst other things which he foretold (whereof many haue come to passe) he named the succession of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> in the yeare 1589. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding further in the course of that matter, hee promiseth greater things to
<pb facs="tcp:9363:55"/>
the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and of the good successe which hee shall haue in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and of the Lowe Countries, that they shall speedilie bee deliuered from the tyrannie of <hi>Spaine:</hi> in one worde, as the prouerbe is, <hi>Halcionia promittit.</hi> But comming to the yeare 1590. hee telleth of the death of a great and mightie<note place="margin">Vncertaine who, and so are all such diuinations.</note> king, enemy to the former, which death (saith hee) shall happen in the yeare 1590. But concerning any certaintie, or true coniectures in numbers, either of<note place="margin">Numbers vncertaine.</note> yeares or such like, wherein Master <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> &amp; others are too curious, I let them passe as matter impertinent and things of too nice &amp; nimble coniecture. Then by the difference of dreames, whereof wee haue spoken before, by the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their kinds, likewise by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall exposition of diuinations, lawfull and vnlawful, it may be vnderstood and easily knowne, how to applie them to the alteration and chaunge of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. There be also other sorts of Diuinations besides these, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:9363:56"/>
they cannot serue to iudge of the change of states (by requiring a whole treatise themselues, &amp; being most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly<note place="margin">My L.

But as of all the meanes and rules which haue been obserued from anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, to confirme the iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the chaunge and fall of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, there is none necessarie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">No rule ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to iudge of the chaunge of a Kingdome.</note> God sometimes permit things to fall out according to their naturall course: therfore it becommeth vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to attend patiently the ende &amp; the euents of all things, as God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his immutable counsell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out presuming too farre, by too great a curiositie vnbeseeming our blind and dull capacities. And although by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our weaknes wee cannot sound the vnderstanding of the depth of those predictions, which GOD hath made, sometime by one meane, sometime by
<pb facs="tcp:9363:56"/>
other; yet notwithstanding wee must<note place="margin">We ought to marke Gods threatnings.</note> not cast aside his threatnings, seruing to aduertise vs of what must happen, to the intent to auoyde the scourge of his wrath, (nor yet esteeme them as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, and that God cannot turne them to good:) but on the contrarie wholly rely vppon his mercie, which is infinite towards them which repent in fit and conuenient time: consider what wee haue obserued by discourse of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and according to our capacitie, touching diuinations in this kinde, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnlawfull, to the intent that by their difference it may bee the better iudged, what shall happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the chang and ruines of Common wealths, and of the estate of Realmes, and Empires: not to the intent to set downe certaine rules whereby to diuine generally of things<note place="margin">The scope of this whole treatise.</note> to come, against the might and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of God, or to giue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to some, to relye vpon superstitious and foolish vanities; but to the intent to iudge by things past, of thinges to come, and by

Besides, either to pardon these at home, or fondly to credit those abroad, can bring no other benefite to the land but this, a contempt of our authoritie, a certaine danger to the Princes person, a perpetuall and needfull feare of some new attempts: yet euer I must reserue a prerogatiue to my gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; for gracious <hi>clemencie</hi> (a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie<note place="margin">Mercy often cruell.</note> vertue to a subiect) but dangerous to a traytor, giues them but leasure to fortifie themselues; graunts them but time to renew their force, &amp; the storme is no sooner past, but there is present feare of as great a tempest.

(as almost it was lately in the Realme of <hi>France</hi>) yet it were easie to proue out of the histories of al times, that traytors &amp; seditious persons, howsoeuer they haue been so bold that they durst in the field incounter the Lords annoynted: yet he whom the scripture calleth the author of victorie and the God of battell, shall make them to flie, when no man follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, shall cause ten thousand of them to bee chased with a thousand, and in the day of battell giue victorie to his owne annoynted.
