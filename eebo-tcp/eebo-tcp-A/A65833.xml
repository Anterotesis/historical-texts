            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Treatise, we the peaceable Christian People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are Conscientiously vindicated and cleared, in our CRISTIAN SOCIETY, CHURCH-ORDER and DISCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLINE, from the unjust Charge of APOSTACY and INNOVATION, and from the great Envy, horrid Abuses and Fallacies of WILLIAM ROGERS, in his Book falsly Entituled, THE CHRISTIAN-QUAKER DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINGUISHED FROM THE A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSTATE AND INNOVATOR; but his own Apostacy and Innovation is herein clearly Detected.</p>

            <p>A Holy concern of Soul and Conscience, on behalf of our Lord Jesus Christ, his Kingdom, Church and People, THAT only was the real Motive to this ensuing Treatise. The matter whereof is not to trace the <hi>late Difference</hi> and <hi>present Controversie</hi> Historical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor to traverse the Way of the crooked Serpent in all his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> windings, there's no need of that, the Eyes of many are open to see his perverse Wayes; but clearly to Detect and set Judgment upon his <hi>Work of Enmity</hi> in <hi>WILLIAM ROGERS</hi>'s said Book, in the most Material Parts, that are Wicked and Scandalous to Truth, and Christ's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Followers and Subjects, and to Evince the most Subtil and Fallacious Pretences thereof, and his most manifest <hi>Inconsistences</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58889:4"/>
and <hi>Self-Confutations,</hi> as well as his <hi>Froward Oppositions</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> to us, as we are a Church and People, gathered by the Lord, and settled in good Order and Society by his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Ground and Cause of the present <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> and <hi>Opposition,</hi> furiously mannaged by <hi>W. R.</hi> and his Abettors against us, has been and is <hi>originally</hi> placed upon a <hi>wrong Spirit</hi> in them, a <hi>Murmuring, Complaining, Dividing Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Rending Tearing Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Dark Jealous Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Loose, Gainsaying, Opposit Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Proud Exalted Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Contemning Scornful Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Turbulent, Froward, Wilful Spirit;</hi> against this Spirit have the Complaints been, by several Tender-hearted Friends among us. If we be asked, how we prove <hi>that</hi> to be the <hi>Spirit,</hi> against which we are now engaged in this Treatise? We may justly Answer, <hi>W. R</hi>'s Malicious Book is apparent Proof, being a <hi>Birth</hi> of that same Spirit, it bears the exact Image and Shape of all the Parts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it; 'tis Proof against him, and all that own it, being brought to the Test of Truth in all Consciences; for it shews all that which is charged upon that <hi>Jealous, Rending, Dividing, Proud, Exalted, Scornful Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> from whence the Book proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Its Stile and Matter (on his <hi>Jealousies,</hi> and <hi>if Report be true, &amp;c.</hi>) bespeak all these, to his and its great Shame and Disgrace. He
<pb facs="tcp:58889:4"/>
places the <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation</hi> against us, not only in <hi>outward Order, Discipline</hi> and <hi>Form of Church-Government,</hi> but even in the very <hi>Doctrine and Life of Christianity,</hi> as if they were greatly <hi>extinguisht</hi> from among us, and therefore has divulged his Book (and that from a <hi>great</hi> pretended <hi>concern of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science on many) that it might not be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pref. p. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>reputed, that the Doctrine and Life of</hi> Christianity <hi>are wholly extinct among the People called</hi> Quakers, but that both yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in some of them (<hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>W. R.</hi> and his Party) But his termed, <hi>Honourable Friend John Wilkinson</hi> gives a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<note place="margin">Par 4. p. 77.</note> Account concerning the Breach of Concord and Jarr: <hi>The Cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>God hath shewed me, that it is not in Principles of Truth, nor in Christ's Doctrine, nor in any Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which Truth in the members of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body leadeth into, but about Prescriptions, through the blind Zeal of the Weak, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>W. R.</hi> also grants, 'tis but about the SHELL, and not the KERNEL, soon after he has placed the <hi>Apostacy</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> as if both Christian Doctrine and Life were extinct among the greatest part of us, as a People. But how can that be true, if <hi>no Breach of Concord,</hi> nor <hi>Jarr in Principles of Truth,</hi> nor <hi>in Christs Doctrine,</hi> nor <hi>in any Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which Truth leadeth into,</hi> and that this be shewn of God too? yea, <hi>W.

<pb facs="tcp:58889:5"/>
that <hi>those small Differences, which</hi> at first seemed but <hi>like unto little Sparks, Pref.</hi> p. 2. 'tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>great Endeavours,</hi> in <hi>much Christian tenderness,</hi> have been used for a <hi>Composure,</hi> and matters were brought near it at <hi>Drawell;</hi> but Satan has prevailed to make this fiery Agent an Incendiary to make the Breach wider, (having been secretly animated) his abusive Book is Proof; whereby he has abused divers of the Servants of Christ by Name, and many not named in's Book, rendring them <hi>Apostates, Innovators,</hi> &amp;c. He has Abused and Scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed our Meetings, and our Order and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as being but a Form and Government, set up by man, and <hi>Mans Tradition;</hi> G. Fox's <hi>Form of Church-Government,</hi> G. F's <hi>Orders, &amp;c.</hi> These Expressions we own not, they are not proper; for though we grant, that <hi>He</hi> hath been Instrumental in the hand of Christ for stirring up others to <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>good Order,</hi> yet we are satisfied that the great Builder, Former and Orderer of the spiritual House, is <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and that HE is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that <hi>Christian Religion, Care, Over-sight</hi> and <hi>good Government among us,</hi> as a Church and People; the Substance, Intent and End of all which, is, that pure Religion, which is not only to visit the Fatherless and the Widows, but to keep Unspotted of the World, which we have Scripture-Testimony and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and Christ's and his Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:58889:5"/>
               <hi>W. R.</hi> has not spared to seek out occasions against Persons, to gather up and divulge Weaknesses, to pervert Truth, and make false Constructions of mens words, his Heart being filled with Pride and Envy, his Head is loaden and confused with cloudy Conceits and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Imaginations against the Innocent. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his great Clamour and heavy Charge of <hi>Apostate</hi> and <hi>Innovator, &amp;c.</hi> about <hi>Orders, Prescriptions, Impositions, Innovations, Form of Church-Government, &amp;c.</hi> setting aside his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> and <hi>Enmity,</hi> his <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>evil Jealousies, Perversions, false Inferences, false Reports,</hi> and the like: The Matters of Fact, wherein he can place a real Difference, as to <hi>Church-Order</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> may be summed up in this narrow Compass, under these Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>W. R.</hi> and some others (his Party) seem to be ONLY for a select Company of Elders and Deacons to order in Church-Affairs about the Poor, Marriages, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our Meetings in that case are more free and open for others also of the Younger sort to be present, whose Conversations are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Sober.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>W. R.</hi> in his Contest with <hi>R. B.</hi> seems <hi>not</hi> to own that the Church of Christ hath Power or Right of Judgment to decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies (in matter of Evil Fact <note n="*" place="margin">Pref. p. 8.</note> or Trespass of one Brother against
<pb facs="tcp:58889:6"/>
another) in things of outward Property, &amp;c. but only the Parties differing to have an equal Choice of Persons, to determine the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet he varyes, and is not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with himself, but is some-what off and on in these cases, as is more fully evinced in this Treatise.</p>
            <p>Whereas we distinguish between a wilfull Injury and an Offence (whether real or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) only through mistake.</p>
            <p>In the first, the real (not supposed) <hi>Offender</hi> has not an equal right of Choice with the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;</hi> but the <hi>Offended Brother</hi> hath Power to proceed with the <hi>Offending,</hi> according to the Doctrine and <hi>Order</hi> prescribed by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. so far, as (if there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity) <hi>to make his Complaint to the Church, and if he refuse to hear the Church, then he is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as an</hi> Heathen Man; accordingly we assert, the Power and Right of Judgment in the true Light, to be in the Church of Christ, in cases of real Trespass of one Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, which is not to set the general Judgment of Truth in the Church, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to any measure of true Light and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any particular Member, but to the <hi>real Offence,</hi> which the <hi>Light</hi> in all condemns.</p>
            <p>In the second, Where the <hi>Offence</hi> is not <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> but through <hi>Mistake,</hi> both the <hi>Parties dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> are more easily perswaded, either to compose the matter between themselves, or
<pb facs="tcp:58889:6"/>
to submit to a hearing and determination of two or three <hi>just, judicious</hi> and <hi>discreet Persons</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> whom neither Party hath any just Exception against.</p>
            <p>III. They are against proposing Marriages before the distinct Meetings of faithful <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> amongst us.</p>
            <p>We judge it very convenient and sociable to lay them before those Meetings, where they are settled.</p>
            <p>IV. They are against recording Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to Posterity.</p>
            <p>VVe judge it needful in many Cases, for the clearing us from Reproach, and vindicating of Truth; and that both the Condemnations and Repentance be recorded, and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies kept against such as continue Impenitent, whose Conversations are reproachful and scandalous to Truth, and to our Society, as a People gathered by the Lord's Power.</p>
            <p>Now, if these things seem inconsiderable to divide and seperate upon, and that they might <hi>easily be accommodated</hi> or <hi>reconciled</hi> upon <hi>amicable conference.</hi> We say so too; therefore the greater is the Enmity of that Spirit, that will seperate on any of them, &amp; cast the <hi>odiums</hi> of <hi>Imposition, Apostacy, Innovations,</hi> &amp;c. upon us, for our <hi>Christian Care</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> about them; <hi>urging with Severity</hi> we need not among our tender-hearted Friends, and 'tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to those that are in <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>hardness,</hi>

            <p>As for <hi>W. R</hi>'s Book against <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 'tis <hi>outragiously Wicked, Clamorous</hi> and <hi>Abusive;</hi> it admits of no <hi>Mediation</hi> nor <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

Qualification,</hi> or <hi>Accommodation;</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Character than <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Innovators</hi> will serve his turn against the very Body of Friends, who are not of his Party; his Book is <hi>revengeful</hi> and <hi>scornful,</hi> it gratifies the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi> and tends to make <hi>our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>us a scorn to Fools</hi> (if they take him for a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which now he is not) it tends in many things to expose us, not only to the <hi>Censure of our profest Adversaries,</hi> but to the <hi>Fury of our Persecutors,</hi> and to bring <hi>open Persecution</hi> upon us, by Implicity, rendring us <hi>Obnoxious to the outward Government:</hi> The Lord rebuke that <hi>Malicious, Proud Spirit,</hi> from whence his Book came (and he will rebuke it, and send it to its place) and stop the Mouth of Iniquity, for his Name and Seed's sake. His Title <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> is a false Title, as his <hi>Unchristian Work</hi> evinceth.

<pb facs="tcp:58889:8"/>
Infamous</hi> and <hi>Injurious,</hi> we grant out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and certain Evidence, Proof and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge very needful, safe and judicial; though a true and spiritual Discerning, Sence &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spirits in the Church of Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in <hi>Truth</hi> be denyed, it being a <hi>spiritual gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> As the said Text [<hi>As I hear I judge</hi>] is applyed by <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>Now we entreat the Patience, even of all those that have any way encouraged or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted <hi>W.

               <pb facs="tcp:58889:8"/>
and <hi>Impartially</hi> in the <hi>Light of Truth</hi> weigh the Matters, and we doubt not but God will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open their Eyes, and <hi>enlighten their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, to the Acknowledgement of the Truth, and to escape the Enemies Snare, which we pray God in Mercy effect, in order to their Stability and Peace in the Truth, as 'tis in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>W.

'Tis answered; They are used according to the several occasions given in his Book, which the matter treated on shews; sometimes in the <hi>Name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Quakers,</hi> when vindicated from his <hi>Scandals;</hi> sometimes in the name &amp; behalf of our <hi>publick Meetings;</hi> sometimes in behalf of <hi>Christs faithful Ministers &amp; Servants</hi> among us; sometimes in behalf of our <hi>Second Dayes Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> according as there is occasion, to vindicate these from his <hi>abuses</hi> &amp; <hi>scandals.</hi> And though 'twas thought meet this ensuing Treatise should only be signed by our antient and known Friend <hi>Ellis Hookes,</hi> as witness for our said Meeting concerned, not doubting but his Credit in the case, will go as far as <hi>W.

<pb facs="tcp:58889:9"/>
of <hi>freeness of Spirit,</hi> that the Name or Names of such Friend and Friends as are most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned in this Treatise, are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; there's time enough yet to concern the Names of such in Print, as some already are, if <hi>W. R's Enmity &amp; Revenge</hi> continues farther to throw <hi>Dirt</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> at any rate upon us (or any of us by Name) in Print, as he has done, this Treatise contains but little in Comparison of what several have in reserve against <hi>W.

                     <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s Preface saith, <hi>Now, so it is, that so great a concern of Conscience lies on many to encourage the Publication thereof, as that we can no longer forbear, lest it should be reputed, that the Doctrine and Life of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity <hi>were wholly extinct amongst the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said People.</hi>

                  <head>Observe.</head>
                  <p>This Passage we also judge tends to the great <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> of the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> as implying, that they by a great Apostacy have given occasion to be so repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that therefore W. R. and his Party only are so deeply concern'd to Vindicate the <hi>Doctrine and Life of Christianity</hi> (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only) by the Publication of his Book. But who those many are, that had such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Conscience lying on them for its Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, is yet to be enquired; And what <hi>Antient Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines of Christianity</hi> are those People called <hi>Quakers</hi> (whom he writes against) Apostatized from? And what <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Unchristian Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> are they fallen into? We find no Proof nor Discovery thereof in all his Book, but the said People greatly abused thereby.</p>
                  <p>The Passage before-cited about such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Conscience,</hi> as that they could <hi>no longer forbear</hi> the Publication of his Book, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Thoughts of the <hi>Doctrine and Life of Christianity</hi> being <hi>wholly Extinct</hi> amongst the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> together with many Passages in the Second Part of his Treatise, do shew, that it was designed to be published not only among the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> but among the World's People, and such as are our <hi>Adversaries</hi> and <hi>Opposers,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58889:17"/>
as appears by these <hi>Objections,</hi> amongst others, in his second Part, Chap. 2. page 6. <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Obj. <hi>Do you not think that those</hi> Jews <hi>who Crucified Christ, acted not from the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, since some of them verily thought they did God good Service therein?</hi> (which having given an Answer to) he frames another Objection, thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>However some Objecting may say, What is this to a Light Within? 'Tis very plain that</hi> John <hi>the Evangelist meant nothing of the Light within, in your sence, but of the Personal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ without, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>That these <hi>Objections</hi> are taken from our <hi>Adversaries</hi> and <hi>Opposers</hi> of the Light of Christ within (and not from any called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>) which W.

                     <hi>First,</hi> That [<hi>These kinds of Declarations are frequently published among the People called</hi> Quakers] we utterly deny; he hath therein (as we judge) uttered Falshood, and abused the said People. And yet to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction he hath granted the matter herein opposed by him in pag. 18. <hi>first Part,</hi> in his Marginal Note, the words are these, viz. <hi>We would not be understood, that it is not fit to have an Eye to faithfull Brethren in any thing;</hi> whereby he grants, that an Eye is to be had to faithful Brethren in some things at least; the more unjust he to make such ill use, as he has done, of the words before-cited by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If any of the said People have at any time so published, as, <hi>Let us exclude the Reasoning, the Wisdom and the Jealousie, and have an Eye to the Brethren,</hi> we cannot but in point of Justice, as well as Charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the words will bear a better sence than <hi>W.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58889:19"/>
to be full of; and that the intent of the words was to exclude <hi>Fleshly Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Reasoning,</hi> and <hi>Evil Jealousie,</hi> and to <hi>have an Eye to such faithfull Brethren in their Doctrine and Example, as shew forth Righteousness and Christianity in both,</hi> as he hath in part grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and not that those eying them therein should be kept in Blindness, or brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Submission without Conviction,</hi> or kept under a <hi>Blind Obedience</hi> to be nurtured up in <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Bondage,</hi> like those in the Dark Night of Apostacy, where <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion;</hi> for how should they eye faithful Brethren, if they be Blind or have no Eyes to see the <hi>Christian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? nor have we any such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine among us, as to shut out the Reason, the Wisdom and Jealousie <hi>without Distinction</hi> (that is, Wisdom and Reason of <hi>all kinds</hi>) as he falsly saith, pag. 18, &amp; 27. first part; as if we were taught to shut out <hi>True Reason, Divine Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Godly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,</hi> as his words [<hi>Without Distinction</hi>] <hi>and all kinds</hi>] imply; Oh Horrid Abuse! These things considered, we judge <hi>W. R.</hi> hath most Unjustly inferred his false Jealousies against us, tending to render us, the said People, highly guilty of gross <hi>Popery,</hi> wherein he has taken up the Persecutors Weapon against us, tending to make us so Obnoxious, as that our Persecutors may take the more occasion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58889:19"/>
to destroy us, but that the Lord stands by us; and herein we judge W.

                     <hi>W.

                  <p>These passages compared, we look upon them as unjustly reflecting on those Meetings of our Friends mentioned, and a gross mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, at least, in his so stating the matter against the Persons desired or chosen to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the General-Meeting, and upon this mistake depends much of his Book, from whence he hath deduced most scandalous Consequences, to render the Members of our said Meeting, as from their choice, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Power to ordain and appoint certain things to impose upon their fellow Members, to yield Obedience unto, whilst not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Christs Light in their Consciences of their duty therein; this we testifie against as a <hi>falshood,</hi> and as a <hi>scandalous Aspersion</hi> cast upon the <hi>members</hi> of our said Meeting, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still to render the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> assertors or imposers of <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> to make us look as like <hi>Papists</hi> as he can; but if he cannot prove that either our said Meeting, or the Friends of the Country, who come to it, do so assert, as he saith, <hi>That they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with Power to ordain and appoint certain things unto which others as Members of Christs Body ought therefore to yield Obedience,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58889:20"/>
that whilst <hi>not perswaded by Christs Light in their Consciences,</hi> &amp;c.

And secondly, when did ever our Meeting, or our Country Friends attending it, assert, that <hi>They are Invested with Power to ordain certain things, unto which other Members of Christs Body ought to yield Obedience, WHILST NOT PERSWADED by CHRIST's LIGHT IN THEIR CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCES OF THEIR DUTY THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN?</hi> For since our Adversary has framed this passage in pursuance of his Charge in his Title, viz. <hi>Apostate and Innovator,</hi> he might as truly have told the World, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their Meetings do ordain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such Innovations or New things, that in themselves are so unjust, dishonest or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as that the Light within cannot own

so as to perswade his Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, (but he has known the contrary in his own Conscience) for whatsoever things are just, honest, commendable, and of good report, consistent with Truth, Christian Charity, Love and Good Works, the Light of Christ within doth own and perswade to such things, and for such things, Christian Ends and Services we testifie our Meetings are, and to stir up thereunto in Practice, whatever Satan (the <hi>Accuser</hi> of the <hi>Brethren</hi>) or his <hi>Agents</hi> say to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>W. R.</hi> his <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> he puts the <hi>Question</hi> thus.</p>
                  <p>Query, <hi>Why hast thou omitted to mention the Names of some Persons and Authors of some Books and Papers reflected on in this Treatise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In answer to this, he gives this principal consideration and reason, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though hardness of Heart hath so over-taken some, as that they may still continue to oppose their Brethren in the Truth, without the least just ground or pretence either from the Light of Christ within, the Scriptures of Truth or right Reason; yet I am not without hope that some others (concerned against their Brethren in the present Differences) may in some time come to a sence of their failings, and Repent, and then either the Memory of their Offence may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58889:21"/>
out, or their Repentance therewith (if time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty known) Recorded, and that according as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity may permit and Truth require.</hi> [Thus far <hi>W. R.</hi>]</p>
               </div>
               <div type="rebuttal">
                  <p>Hence observe: <hi>1st,</hi> That the Reason why he has reflectingly mentioned the Names of some Persons in his Book, is, <hi>their hardness of Heart,</hi> and continuing to oppose, as he judges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The Reason why the Names of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reflected upon are omitted in his Book, is, <hi>That he hath hope of their coming to a sense of their failings ana Repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>3dly, That when they Repent, either the memory of their Offence may be blotted out, or their Repentance therewith Recorded.</hi> See now what Authority and Judgment he hath, (<hi>Diotrephes-like</hi>) assumed to himself (without the <hi>Church,</hi> or consent thereof) to <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> to <hi>Condemn,</hi> and <hi>Record</hi> such Persons as oppose him, and with what distinction some by Name, as <hi>hopeless of their Repentance,</hi> others not by Name as having <hi>hope for them:</hi> hence it follows, that all whom he hath cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and condemned by Name, are in his account hardned past Recovery, as <hi>George Fox, Charles Marshal, Jasper Batt, Robert Barclay, John Blaykling, Robert Barrow,</hi> and others (<hi>Men more Righteous than himself</hi>) he has reflected on and severely judged by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58889:22"/>
Name, and that on Record, rendring them Infamous (what in him lies) to Posterity, in his printed Volumn; and when is such a Record and Memory like to be blotted out, as he pretends? But if to get off this hanck, he should alledge, <hi>That his meaning was not so severe as to render them whom he has named Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably Hardned, or Without Hope,</hi> (though it most evidently follows, from his <hi>Reason</hi> before cited, why he has omitted the Names of others, Persons reflected on) for that he hath intimated some hopes concerning <hi>G. F.</hi> in his fifth part, p 92. in these Words, (viz.) <hi>On this score I am now concerned in my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thus to declare, and conclude, that for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time past</hi> G. F. <hi>hath stood in a state of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from many of the Lord's People; May the God of Heaven give him a true sight and sense thereof unto Repentance, that so before his Body be turned to Dust, from whence it came, he may be restored into fellowship with them again, saith my Soul,</hi> William Rogers.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that he has herein intimated that there is yet some hope for <hi>G. F.</hi> as that his <hi>Offence is not so great,</hi> nor <hi>he so irrecoverably hardned,</hi> but that he may possibly <hi>Repent,</hi> and be <hi>restored into Fellowship with the Lord's People;</hi> that is, in his sence, with <hi>W. R.</hi> and his party: but then how fairly doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his Reason for <hi>omitting the Names of others,</hi> as not being <hi>without hope of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58889:22"/>
to a Sence and Repentance?</hi> for by the same Reason, he should have omitted to name <hi>G. F.</hi> and others upon Record, so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously as he has done, if he be not without hope of their Repentance and Restoration, otherwise he has dealt very <hi>partially</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly</hi> in recording <hi>G. F.</hi> and others by Name, whilst there is the same Reason for to have omitted their Names, that he gives for omitting others; thus this <hi>severe Judge,</hi> and <hi>Excommunicator,</hi> runs himself into a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Confusion; and this is not all, but there lies another palpable Contradiction in the case, he appears for recording Persons Offences, and their Repentance also, as his great Book in Print contains matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Condemnation against many Friends, some by Name, and others not, all as being the <hi>Apostate and Innovator,</hi> from whom he distinguishes the <hi>Christian-Quaker</hi> in his Title page, and yet as Persons not Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably fallen, but that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to a true sight and sence unto Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but how Notoriously in this matter hath he contradicted the Testimony of his frequently termed <hi>two Ancient and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friends and Brethren, J. W.</hi> &amp; <hi>J. S.</hi> cited in his fourth part, pag. 39. where they thus declare, viz. <hi>From that Inward Sence and Heavenly Understanding we have, we see no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to leave them (i. e. Condemnations) upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58889:23"/>
Record to Posterity, or retain them when the Sin is</hi> blotted out <hi>and remitted by the Lord, neither to be extended farther then the Offence is known, nor yet to continue longer than the Memory of the Offence abideth.</hi> Thus far <hi>W. R's</hi> said Brethren.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>W. R.</hi> hath recorded Condemnations in his great Book in Print, that are like to be of farther Extent and longer Continuance then either the Offences supposed, or Memory of them otherwise would have been, and that in a very infamous and disgraceful manner against particular Persons by Name, whom yet upon serious thoughts, he dares not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally condemn as Persons Irrecoverable: See how apparently contradictory his Work is to it self, and to his Brethrens Testimony, he is contradicting them whom he advocates for; so that his Judgment against particular Persons will be of less Credit with all Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Readers, because of its inconsistency.</p>

And to be sure, his Book was put to the <hi>Press</hi> a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time before that; the <hi>Printer</hi> saith, 'twas begun withal in the <hi>Press</hi> in the Moneth called <hi>August,</hi> 1680. which was about or near two Moneths before the said Epistle (alledged by him) was in being; for it was not delivered unto the <hi>Printer</hi> until the 25th of the 8th Moneth, 1680. which was Four Dayes after
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58889:27"/>
the date of <hi>W. R</hi>'s said Letter to <hi>J. B.</hi> the Printer, which intimates so much of his Book then already Printed, and requires Expedition for the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But then why was <hi>W. R.</hi> so ready to catch up the said Epistle that came to his Hands but the 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. for to make such a Principal Instance of it to prove the <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Reasonableness of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Print his Book of Divisions?</hi> seeing he knew in his Conscience he had proceeded so far in the Printing his Book so long before, and not only so, but confesseth the same 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. <hi>That all his Treatise, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting</hi> Postscript, Index <hi>and</hi> Errata, <hi>was then already Printed?</hi> We can make no better of it, than that he was befool'd in his Craft, so as to manifest his own Fallacy and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in his Silly Pretences and Deceitful Subterfuges, and the plain Truth of it is, the said Epistle by <hi>Anne Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Mary Elson</hi> was so far from being the Cause of of <hi>W. R</hi>'s <hi>Printing</hi> and <hi>Publishing</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Book, that his <hi>Printing</hi> thereof was an Occasion of their Writing and Printing their Epistle, as they were concerned in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when they heard that <hi>W. R</hi>'s Book was in the Press, and had been for some time Printing before they writ heirs, and they understanding what kind of Book his was (when some Sheets of it were handed up and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58889:27"/>
down) tending to Strife and Division; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their end in writing theirs was to warn Friends against the Spirit of Discord, and not against Persons by Name; so that <hi>W. R.</hi> has not Imitated that Copy, what-ever Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he makes of it.</p>
               <p>If he alledges, that the <hi>Publication</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> was not till after he met with the said Epistle. We <hi>Answer,</hi> That's an Unjust and Silly Evasion again, only varying from his Terms <hi>Proceeding to Print</hi> (for which he brings the Instance of their Epistle) unto the Term <hi>Publication,</hi> which leaves him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his chief <hi>Plea of Righteousness in Printing.</hi> This Equivocal and Fallacious way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Pleading will not excuse or cover him, as an Innocent or Righteous Person in his <hi>proceeding to Print,</hi> or in his Allegations for himself therein, against others; for he has granted <hi>Printing</hi> to be a <hi>Promulgation</hi> or <hi>Publication,</hi> as in his words [<hi>Frequent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgators by Printing</hi>] (which is a Falshood) and he has confessed, his Treatise was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the said Epistle came to his Hands, being the 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. so that in <hi>Printing</hi> his Book of Divisions, he did <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate</hi> or <hi>Publish</hi> it, only it was so Bulkey that he could not get it all Compleated, Bound up, and sold abroad, before the said Epistle was Printed; however, that was Accidential, the Bigness, Trouble and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58889:28"/>
Charge of his Book made it not so Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as an Epistle of two Sheets, which no whit proves his Intention or Proceeding to be <hi>Righteous,</hi> in first putting his to the Press, and having gotten it Printed before the two Sheets came to his Hands; besides, was not <hi>W. R.</hi> so earnest for Expedition, in the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Book, that (in its several Parts) it was put into several Hands of the <hi>World's Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> Persons not called <hi>Quakers?</hi> and not only so, but being Printed, it appears to be designed to go abroad in the World.</p>
               <p>And further, if to evade the Charge of Fallacy and Injustice, Deceit and False cover laid on <hi>W. R.</hi> in this matter, he flies to his <hi>Gramatical sence</hi> of his Words, and pleads his <hi>Intention,</hi> &amp;c. as thinking himself safe in both—1st, We say <hi>his present proceeding to Print</hi> cannot in reason be confined to his <hi>Postscript,</hi> wherein the Words are—Nor Answer the SOME of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> he tells of, <hi>that have judged him Wicked as for intending to Print against Friends,</hi> Post. pag. 25. (whom he undertakes to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in that case) nor vindicate him, as to his Historical Relation mentioned in the same page, which includes his Book, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confined to, nor included in his <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2dly, The Reasons he gives in his <hi>Postscript</hi> to prove himself <hi>Righteous in his proceeding to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58889:28"/>
Print,</hi> cannot relate only to that his <hi>Postscript,</hi> but to his whole <hi>Book,</hi> because they areadded for a <hi>Supplyment</hi> to his <hi>Preface to the Reader, his Introduction to the First and Fourth Parts of his Treatise,</hi> which <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi> concern his whole Book, or <hi>Historical Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> (as he calls it) and which <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi> he thinks may give sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to every Impartial and Unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Reader; <hi>but lest the Ignorance or Blindness of any should be so great, as not from thence to perceive the Righteousness of his present proceeding to Print, &amp;c.</hi> he gives his Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Reasons and Instances in his <hi>Postscript,</hi> the chief whereof is that relating to the two Printed Sheets which came to his Hands the 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. as aforesaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Supplymental Reason given, was more clearly to evince the Justness of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Print, than he had done before in his said <hi>Preface</hi> or <hi>Introduction,</hi> as that it was even to prevent such great Ignorance and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, as would hinder any from perceiving his <hi>Righteousness</hi> in proceeding to <hi>Print.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3dly, If <hi>W. R.</hi> says, <hi>That he thinks himself safe, both in his Intention and Gramati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sense</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">As he pleaded at a Meeting at <hi>Devonshire-house, London,</hi> the 27th of the 3d Moneth 1681.</note> 
                  <hi>of his Words,</hi> viz. <hi>That such as have been of Party against us, concerned in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof, have been the</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58889:29"/>
FIRST <hi>and</hi> FREQUENT PROMULGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORS <hi>by</hi> DECLARATION, <hi>by</hi> MANU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCRIPT, <hi>and by</hi> PRINTING, <hi>that there have been Divisions among the aforesaid People,</hi> as thence concluding, the words being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, only to import that FREQUENT cannot relate to <hi>each one</hi> abstractly, but to <hi>all</hi> joyntly, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Publishing</hi> by <hi>Declaration,</hi> by <hi>Manuscript,</hi> and by <hi>Printing,</hi> and that he intended by PRINTING, only the said Epistle of two Sheets being Published before his Book came out of the Press. We say, that then he writes Fallaciously and Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catingly; for [<hi>Frequent</hi>] doth as well relate to <hi>Printing</hi> as to <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Manuscript,</hi> wherein we cannot think that he intended only that there was <hi>but Once</hi> a <hi>Publication</hi> by <hi>Declaration,</hi> and <hi>but Once</hi> by <hi>Manuscript,</hi> and so <hi>but Once</hi> by <hi>Printing,</hi> as if only those three Publications, in these three wayes, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to make up the <hi>Frequent Publication</hi> intended; for he quotes <hi>several Declarations</hi> and <hi>several Manuscripts,</hi> and but that <hi>One Epistle in Print,</hi> for his Printing; as also his <hi>Intentions</hi> in Printing cannot be proved <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> by his Instance of that Epistle being publick before his Book; for his Intention of Printing, as also his often Threatning to Print, was a long time before that Epistle ever was in being; and when he gave his said Supplymental Reasons in his <hi>Postscript,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58889:29"/>
on the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. he had Printed his Treatise, except the <hi>Postscript, Index</hi> and <hi>Errata,</hi> as he confesseth the 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. being the same day that Epistle came to his Hands, and therefore his <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>Printing</hi> and Publishing Divisions could have no Relation to that Epistle, as any Cause or Reason of his Intention; And how could that Epistle be any Reason of his Printing, when it was not in being till after he had Printed a great part of his Book in the Five Parts of it?</p>
               <p>4thly, If he yet alledge, <hi>That in the Title Page of the said Epistle, 'tis said to be Printed by</hi> Andrew Sowle, <hi>and to be sold at his Shop in</hi> Devonshire-Buildings, and that therefore he was the more concerned for the <hi>Publication</hi> of his Book, when it was Printed. To this we say, That Addition, shewing by whom it was Printed and Sold, was the Printer's own Addition, and not the Authors, and yet suitable enough for him to add, being cautioned in the same Title Page how far it was intended by the Authors to be published, being plainly <hi>Recommended to Friends in Truth, chiefly for the sake of the Weak and Unstable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, for Information and Encouragement in our</hi> Christian <hi>Unity and Society, held in the Spirit of Christ, both in Faith and Practice,</hi> as their words are; so that the Advice, where to have that Epistle, was for Friends, to whom
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58889:30"/>
it was recommended, that they might know where to have it; whereas <hi>W. R.</hi> has given no such Caution in his Title page, but leaves his whole Book, and Friends Reflected on therein, to the Censure and Judgment of the <hi>World, Unbelievers</hi> and <hi>Truth's Adversaries,</hi> to the great Scandal and Reproach of Truth and Friends in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But hath not W. R. placed the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of his Book upon a higher Motion and Necessity, than the occasion pretended of the aforesaid Epistle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, a far higher; and what is it? 'Tis upon such a <hi>great concern of Conscience</hi> pretended, that the Publication of it <hi>could no longer be forborn.</hi> The Accounts he gives in the case are these, viz. <hi>So great a concern of Conscience lies on many to encourage the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof, as that we can no longer forbear, lest it should be reputed, that the Doctrine and Life of</hi> Christianity <hi>were wholly extinct among the aforesaid People</hi> [as in his <hi>Preface.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And pag. 77. <hi>1st part, The Righteous God bears us Record, that the very reason why this Treatise is now prepared, is, because our very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, on behalf of God's People, are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> [Thus far <hi>William Rogers, William Ford,</hi> the Subscribers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That these high Pretences of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> both for the Preparation and Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Book, as that <hi>they could no longer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58889:30"/>
forbear,</hi> must needs be before 'twas Printed; here was two great concerns in the case, the one to <hi>Prepare</hi> it, the other to <hi>Print</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it by Printing,</hi> both which <hi>Concerns</hi> were before the aforesaid <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>A. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>M. Elson</hi> was in being (at least, before ever <hi>W. R.</hi> knew or saw that Epistle) and therefore that Epistle could not be the cause of such concern of Conscience to Prepare, Print or Publish <hi>W. R's</hi> great and Chargeable Book; besides, it may be observed, that all the Allegations (used by some of his Party) for the Publication of his Book, as about <hi>G. F's</hi> not giving him a Meeting, or not giving it under his hand to meet him, appear but meer Pretences and slight Covers, having placed a Necessity to encourage the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof upon a higher and more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute concern of Conscience, as namely, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such a Misrepute, as that <hi>of the Doctrine and Life of</hi> Christianity <hi>being wholly extinct amongst the People called</hi> Quakers. And there's not the least Colour or Pretence of Reason, that this Danger should be placed either upon the said Epistle, or upon <hi>G. F's</hi> not meeting <hi>W. R.</hi> in his time: This his pretence of such concern of Conscience is far higher than these.</p>
               <p>But if it shall yet be pretended by any, that G. F's not giving W. R. a Meeting, was cause of his publishing his Book. Then how
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58889:31"/>
Unjust, and grosly Unreasonable was it, to expose the Names of divers other Faithfull Friends in Print, and that to Infamy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such particular Offer to them, and Refusal on their parts?</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>W. R.</hi> is so far from proving himself <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Righteous in his proceeding to Print,</hi> by those Instances he gives of a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Divisions <hi>by Declaration, by Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, and by Printing,</hi> that his great Injustice and Iniquity therein appears, there being no just Comparison between these (so far as he yet gives Instances) and his great Book in Print, either as to the Nature, Quality or Quantity; For, <hi>1st,</hi> What he mentions of <hi>Declaration</hi> in their Meetings, if it were all true, it was not published in Print to the World until he himself did it; neither do we understand, that such Unprinted <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can <hi>Equalize</hi> his Book, in the <hi>Pernicious Nature</hi> and Tendence of it, in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which are Scandalous to us as a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and against divers honest Men by Name, and not only so, but 'tis against Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The <hi>Forty Four Articles</hi> he mentions, were not in Print, nor the Paper of <hi>Sixty Six,</hi> nor the <hi>Narrative</hi> at <hi>Drawell,</hi> nor were these ever intended to be exposed in Print, or to the World, as his Book is, but to be reserved within the Church, till matters might be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58889:31"/>
cleared, and Reconciliation and Union effected, which divers faithful Friends among us have earnestly desired and travelled for, whose Work and Reward is with the Lord, though this Perverse Spirit turns all into Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, Gall and Wormwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And as to that Epistle written by a <hi>Publick Preacher,</hi> as he saith, <hi>Post.</hi> pag. 26. that was not in Print, nor any Persons by Name reflected on in it, though mention be made in it of <hi>Rents, Schisms, Contention, Strife, Distraction, Discord, &amp;c.</hi> A faithful <hi>Testimony</hi> was therein given against the Spirit of <hi>Discord, Division</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> refering it to the Witness of Truth in all Consciences, and the Spirit of Judgment in themselves, to make the Application to Persons, and not by Name to Infamize any. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> owns the said Epistle, and saith, he hath stood by it, and hopes ever to stand by the Testimony and tender Counsel therein, in the same Spirit that moved him to write it; as also, that since W. R. has made such an occasion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it, to justifie his own proceeding to Print, he had done him more Right, if he had printed it together among others, in his Book, which Epistle, and the publick read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, was approved by divers of W. R's own Friends: And what if it were read in such a publick Meeting for the Worship of God within the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> the 21st of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58889:32"/>
11th Moneth, 1678. (as he saith) where some were present <hi>not accounted to be of the People called</hi> Quakers? though there was but very few such there then, as Credible Account was given from <hi>Bristol;</hi> but at that Meeting the People present were mostly Friends, as in an Account, dated, <hi>Bristol,</hi> the 25th of the 11th Moneth, 1678. And what though some others were present, and heard it read? What knows he but it had a good Effect on some of them? seeing <hi>Division, Contention</hi> and <hi>Discord</hi> have (both before and since that) happened in that Meeting, according as he has related in Print, there was the more need of such a <hi>Testimony</hi> going forth against such a <hi>Spirit of Contention and Discord,</hi> that hath so openly appeared in that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> Neither is there any just or equal Comparison between the said Printed <hi>Epistle,</hi> and <hi>W. R.</hi> his great Invective <hi>Book,</hi> which tends to the Perpetual <hi>Reproach, Scandal</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> of divers Faithful Persons by Name, and of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Christian Religion</hi> professed by them; whereas the said <hi>Epistle</hi> by <hi>Mary Elson</hi> and <hi>Anne Whitehead</hi> was not to Infamize any Friends or Professors of Truth by Name, but according to the Title, <hi>An Epistle for True</hi> LOVE, UNITY <hi>and</hi> ORDER <hi>in the Church of Christ, against the Spirit of Discord, Disorder and Confusion, &amp;c.</hi> All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58889:32"/>
                  <hi>W. R.</hi> hath manifested his <hi>Injustice</hi> in these his several Instances, as well as his apparent <hi>Fallacy</hi> and <hi>Impertinency</hi> in that one principal Instance of the said Printed Epistle, so that the Foundation of <hi>W. R's</hi> proceeding to Print is evidently proved Deceit and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But come on, we have dwelt some-what long upon this point, let's now briefly sum up and present the Case in <hi>W. R.</hi> his own sence (and see how far that will go) thus, <hi>viz. The said Epistle of two Printed Sheets, given out by</hi> Anne VVhitehead <hi>and</hi> Mary Elson, <hi>amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Publication of Divisions (though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on no Persons by Name) coming to my Hands the 8th of</hi> November, 1680. <hi>it was a great Provocation to me, and the chief concern upon me to Publish my Book of Eighty Sheets, or above, reflecting on many of the Chieftains among the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>by Name in Particular, and upon the greatest part of that People in General, who own them, as also upon their Meetings that are for an Outward Form of Church-Government, Visible Orders, &amp;c. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Apostates <hi>and</hi> Innovators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which it may be said, Oh! great <hi>Champion Scribe of the Schisme and Faction, and Popular Person!</hi> wast thou so provoked by two poor VVomen, with their but two Printed Sheets against the Spirit of Discord, that thou must needs revenge thy self with a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58889:33"/>
Furious Confused Book of above <hi>EIGHTY</hi> Sheets in Print? Is this thy <hi>Justice, Manhood</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> so Excessively to vent thy Fury, for the sake of two such (in thy esteem doubtless) Inconsiderable persons, their two Sheets? At this rate we may expect, that we shall so hugely provoke thee, by this Treatise, against thy work of <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> that thou wilt severely pay us off with a Book of Five or Six Hundred Sheets at least (but then thy Friends must very highly advance their <hi>Purses</hi> towards the Charge, if they'l be so Mad or Silly.) Be sure (if thou writest against us) make it a huge big Book, or else thou wilt not proceed according to thy former <hi>GREAT CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERN OF CONSCIENCE</hi> and <hi>JUSTICE</hi> against the <hi>TWO Womens TWO Sheets,</hi> and many more because thereof. However, if thou pretends to make <hi>Answer</hi> or <hi>Reply</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, let it be as big as it will, let it but refer to holy Scripture, and be Argumentative, and it may probably be the more taken notice of; but if it be a kind of History, made up of Stories, Reports (and thy own Jealousies) to expose <hi>Weaknesses,</hi> and to render Persons by Name <hi>Odious;</hi> 'twill then be <hi>No Answer,</hi> but a <hi>Dirty Revengeful Clamour,</hi> like much of thy Unchristian Book already extant, to thy (and thy Abettors) great Shame and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>

                  <p>In these Passages we judge our <hi>adversary</hi> has writ very Confusedly &amp; Contradictorily; for, <hi>1st,</hi> he grants from the words of Christ and the Apostle, that the Church ought to be heard, &amp; to judge in Personal Offences, and Differences in Worldly Matters; yea, that therein the Duty of the Church was to Exhort to submit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58889:42"/>
to their Counsel. <hi>Query,</hi> What Counsel, if not tending to decide the Difference?</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>2dly,</hi> he undoes that again, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Churches Power of deciding mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Conscience, and outward things also, on occasion of Differences raised touching Worldly Estate, as tending to claim a Power over Properties, as well as Consciences; which is not only Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, but unjustly deduced; for in that the Church is to be heard, even in <hi>Personal Offences</hi> or <hi>Differences,</hi> and to Exhort to a <hi>Submission</hi> touching <hi>Worldly Matters,</hi> as he grants; and in those matters, the least esteemed in the Church have power to judge.

                  <p>But whereas <hi>W.

                  <p>His charge of claiming Power over the Properties as well as Consciences of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, upon those counted <hi>Chieftains</hi> among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the <hi>Second Dayes Meeting at London,</hi> we do judge to be very <hi>Scandalous</hi> as well as <hi>Unjust,</hi> and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render us the People called <hi>Quakers Obnoxious</hi> to the Civil Government, as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming an Arbitrary and Absolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the Properties and Consciences of others, which is an Abhorence to us.</p>
                  <p>And what he alledges out of R. B.'s Book in the case, does not appear to us any proof of his charge against us, being rightly and ingeniously considered, as to what <hi>R. B.</hi> affirms, of the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> having power in some cases that are matters of Conscience to give positive Sentence or Decision, which may be obligatory upon Believers: We would ask this Opposer, if in no cases of Conscience the Church of Christ hath power to give such positive <hi>Sentence</hi> as is <hi>Just and Righteous?</hi> (for the true Church neither pretends nor claims any other) if she hath, then whether such Sentence be not obligatory to other Believers concerned?

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58889:47"/>6thly, In the Scripture alledged, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13. its said, <hi>One of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my Brother that he divide the Inheritance with me.</hi> It is not said, 'twas one of his Disciples: Nor would it have been Judicial for him to have given Judgment in the matter, upon the motion and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one pa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty <hi>assigning</hi> what <hi>he</hi> would have done in's own case aforehand, and whose fault Christ seems to reprehend in the following Words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetousness; for a man's Life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</hi> Nor was it so properly Christ's Ministry and Work, to be concerned in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining those outward matters of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having given a higher Ministry and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Law, Light and Judgment in mens Consciences to determine what's Right, and to do Right in those cases, especially in his Church and Followers. The Lord is exalted when <hi>Sion</hi> is filled with Judgment and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
                  <p>And now, whereas R. B. pleads for the <q>
                        <hi>Church of Christ</hi> having Power in some cases of <hi>Conscience,</hi> to give a positive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or Decision, which may be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory upon Believers.</q> This W. R. oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as <hi>being a Government over the Consciences of Believers, contrary to the Principle of Truth, and Liberty they have in Christ Jesus,</hi> pag. 48.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58889:47"/>
because his Plea is for a Liberty, for a Believer to refuse to submit on account of <hi>not seeing it his Duty.</hi> This is still to divide the Church of Christ, and Believers, as if the Church did see, and Believers were blind, which is Absurd and Ignorant. He now neither allows the <hi>Church</hi> power in cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor outward things, to give positive Sentence or Judgment, to decide difference, pag. 48, &amp; 51. but both these he has suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently contradicted, <hi>1st,</hi> in concluding the words of Christ and the Apostle, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. did concern <hi>Personal Offences,</hi> or Differences touching Worldly Matters: <hi>2dly,</hi> In granting, that <hi>Every Case</hi> wherein one Brother may Trespass against another, may be comprehended in it.</p>
                  <p>But now, to his Opposition against the <hi>Churches Judgment,</hi> set case, the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> in some, or any matters of Conscience or Property (where a Difference is) doth give a positive Sentence or Judgment, which in it self is Just and Reasonable. Our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser is for a Liberty for Believers to refuse to submit, on account of not seeing it their Duty; that is to say, That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are Members of <hi>Christ's Church,</hi> may refuse Submission to their Brethren in things that are in themselves Just and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable (according to the Law of Truth in the Conscience) on the pretence, of not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58889:48"/>
it their <hi>Duty,</hi> which is a most Blind and Irrational way of pleading and arguing; and we can make nothing of it, but what tends to <hi>Confusion, Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Ranterism,</hi> and to a <hi>Contempt of the Church of Christ,</hi> and an <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing</hi> of the <hi>Light</hi> of Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is in all true Believers ready to engage in a concord, in whatsoever things are Honest, Just and Reasonable. And that which aggravates the Offence of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary is his Fathering this Contradiction and Opposition, which he would make in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> (and this Liberty for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers refusing to submit to this Church) upon the Liberty that is in Christ Jesus; which is as Absurd as to tell us, the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> may in some things have a Liberty in <hi>Christ</hi> to give a Righteous Judgment, both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conscience and Property; but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are Members of the same Church, must have a Liberty in <hi>Christ</hi> to refuse to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the same Judgment; and not only so, but a liberty in <hi>Christ</hi> to plead, That they see it not to be their <hi>Duty,</hi> as the Reason of such their refusal. What a large extent would he make this Liberty in Christ Jesus! and how Contradictory to it self! God preserve his People from this <hi>Libertine Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he has contrarywise stated the matter, which may be taken for both an <hi>Answer</hi> and <hi>Confutation to himself,</hi> 1st part, pag. 43. where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58889:48"/>
he confesseth plainly thus, viz. <hi>Some may run into Looseness, and say, The Light in Conscience condemns me not, and therefore 'tis the care of Faithfull Brethren to appear as Watchmen over the Flock,</hi> WE SAY SO TOO, <hi>and those who approve themselves Watchmen, will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to convince such, who in very deed run into Looseness, &amp;c. that though they may pretend, the Light condemns them not, yet that their Deeds are Evil, and that the Light doth condemn the same, though they may be hardned and see it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> Now he has granted some to be Watchmen over the Flock, and their care as such, and that the Blindness and false Liberty is placed upon such as run into Looseness, and become hardned, and not upon any Innocent Members of the true <hi>Church,</hi> or tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Believers, whose Liberty is in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; and this Blindness and Hardness cannot excuse them in Sin or Evil, whether in Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Comission, because the Light doth condemn the same, and both their Blindness and Hardness being effects of their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Light of Christ in them, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can be no excuse for Sin, when it self is Sin;</hi> as also W. R. confesses, pag. 52. <hi>That the Church of Christ hath Power to Admonish the Parties differing to their Duty, and if they refuse to take their wholsome Counsel, may then declare such Unworthy of their Society;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he has granted the Churches Power, both
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58889:49"/>
of Admonition and giving Judgment against those that refuse the Churches wholsome counsel and admonition; so that 'tis plain, that Power of Judgment and Rejection he has granted the Church, in which he has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Authority and Government pleaded for by us (for <hi>Power of Coertion</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> we claim not) and this leaves no room for <hi>W. R.</hi> or any else, to plead a Liberty in Christ for the Members of his Church, either for not seeing it their Duty to practise such Counsel, or for refusing to submit on that score.</p>

               <p>W. R. 1st part, pag. 52. <hi>For any Members under the Notion of the Church to say,</hi> We have Power to decide and remove these things, without the assent of the Parties differing, <hi>is an Usurpation; and that the Assent of Parties was not intended by the Approvers of the said Book of Government, is evident to us, for that there is not in any part of the said Book one Tittle to that purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two gross Untruths in this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, insinuated against us.</p>
               <p>First, [<hi>Without the Assent of the Parties Differing</hi>] When did any of us so pretend a Power to remove the Difference? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force Unjust &amp; Injurious Persons to make Restitutions for Wrongs done, but leave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58889:49"/>
them to the outward Power to subject them, to common Law and Justice, though we have Power by Perswasive Means with those among us, who design nothing but Justice and Right to all men, that they may do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Assent of Parties was not intended by the Approvers of the said Book;</hi> is a very gross Abuse and Untruth; for it is most acceptable to us, as we are a People, for Peace and Concord, to have all Parties differing among us, assent to a just decision, and fair end of the Differences, by faithful and competent Persons among our selves, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their going to Law one with another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And if the very words [<hi>Assent of Parties differing, to the Decision of honest men in the Church, skilled in the Matters</hi>] be not expressed, yet we take the thing to be all along implyed in the said Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Parties differing to be concluded by some or other Judicious Persons in the Church, and not to go to Law before Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; there is much in the said Book will prove that their Submission in that case is urged.</p>
               <p>His telling us, pag. 50. <hi>That the Author to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>speaks nothing of the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as Judges,</hi> is still to lessen the Churches Authority, contrary to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostle, <hi>viz. If he will not hear
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58889:50"/>
the Church, let him be unto thee as an</hi> Heathen <hi>Man,</hi> Mat. 18.

contrivance: When did any of our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies so tell their Fellow-Members?</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be noted, that in such places where he in his Book allows not the Church of Christ <hi>power to judge,</hi> or <hi>to give positive sentence</hi> in cases of Difference, nor yet so much as to chuse or set a part any for the persons dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to decide their Differences, but only those <hi>at variance to make their own choice,</hi> as in pag. 53. Herein he has endeavoured wholly to make void all <hi>Church-Government and Authority,</hi> allowing more Power to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons differing,</hi> yea, to the <hi>person offending,</hi> than to the <hi>Church;</hi> the person offending to make his own choice as well as the person offended; whenas the Offender, if one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to make Restitution for the Injury done, he will be apt to chuse some partial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his own party, to serve his own turn, if he can; which no wayes can tend to bring the difference to a fair and just end. Now to allow such Offender an equal power of choice, is not according to Christ's Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. where the <hi>Brother offended</hi> was to make his Complaint, and tell the <hi>offender</hi> his <hi>fault,</hi> who refusing to hear, <hi>then two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> and for want of hearing them, lastly, <hi>to tell the Church;</hi> and if he would not hear the <hi>Church,</hi> then to count him as an <hi>Heathen man,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58889:51"/>
the Churches Authority, and right of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the case of Offences, which such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious offending Brother had not, and therefore to be rejected, as an <hi>Heathen man,</hi> chiefly for <hi>refusing to hear the Church;</hi> and herein consists the Nature of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between <hi>Us</hi> and <hi>W.

                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Power, W.

                  <p>Moreover, the Church of Christ, and every faithful Member thereof, hath Power to give Testimony, absolute Judgment and Sentence against all Loose, Disorderly and Scandalous Wayes and Conversations, when duely manifest among any Professors of Truth, which dishonour our holy Profession, and let up a Spirit of <hi>Ranterism</hi> and <hi>false Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> and these ought to be testified against, judged and condemned; and 'tis not justly in the Power of any Offender, in those cases, to make their own choice of any Person whatsoever, to evade or make void any such Judgment or Sentence; nor ought the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be at his own choice in such criminal Cases of Looseness, and Disorderly walking, but the Universal Judgment of Truth to be set over the Transgressors Head, in a Gospel Way and Order, on a Judicial hearing and discovery of the Offence; for the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was commended, in <hi>not bearing them that were Evil, and hating the Deeds of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 6.

have received Mercy, we faint not, but preach the Gospel in much Boldness and Assurance in Christ of the good Effects thereof, and are one with the Apostle's Testimony, as having renounced the <hi>Hidden things of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty, not walking in Craftyness, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truth, commending our selves to every mans Conscience in the sight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 2. Our preaching is to convince the Conscience, and not to leave it dark, or unsatisfied in that wherein the Duty of Obedience stands. A Blind Conscience is Convincible by Spiritual and Effectual Preaching, which hath the Evidence of the Spirit of Christ in it, making its way into the Conscience, if not wholly hardned and seared through Rebellion and Stubbornness; even <hi>Gainsayers are to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and Convinced by sound Doctrine,</hi> Titus 1. 9.</p>

                     <q>DEar Friends, let the Authority of God's Power, heavenly and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wisdom be Eyed in all your Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that the Government of Truth and Righteousness may be Exalted over all, that true Judgment and Mercy may have their place.—And though a General Care be not laid upon every Member, touching the good Order and Government in the Churches Affairs, nor have many travelled therein, yet the Lord hath laid it more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some, in whom he hath opened Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for that end (and particularly in our dear Brother, and God's faithful Labourer <hi>G.

                  <p>Wherein <hi>W. R.</hi> and the rest have plainly confessed, <hi>First,</hi> To that Care the Lord hath laid on some, with respect to good Order and Government in his Churches.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That God hath in his Wisdom afforded those <hi>Helps and Governments</hi> in the Churches, which are not to be despised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things do Answer, Confute and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn much of <hi>W.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58889:58"/>
Rules, &amp;c.</hi> with respect to <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which he calls <hi>G. F's Methods and Orders,</hi> pag. 86. 1st part; but though in his Letter to <hi>G.

S.</hi>] whose Sence herein appears contrary to <hi>W. R's,</hi> both in respect to <hi>G. F.</hi> and to those Outward Instructions or Directions: <hi>J. S.</hi> granting also, <hi>That God and his Leading Grace in his People might lead them to make Use thereof, as he should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a need of such Counsel or Advice;</hi> which Answers and Confutes W. R. in his opposing Outward Directions, Methods and Forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Church-Government: Thus his Pleading and Advocating on his honourable Friends behalf, is run to a Contradiction to them and their Sence, as well as to himself, in many things, and that on the same <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> he makes to prove G. F. and others <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states;</hi> and its very much if he do not fly out against <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J.

                  <p>W. R. 1st part, pag. 63. <hi>There is amongst many Friends a Difference touching the</hi> Meetings <hi>of</hi> Women <hi>separate from the</hi> Men.</p>

                  <p>Not amongst <hi>many Friends</hi> does a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence appear; but amongst a few Heady Rash Spirits, who despise those Meetings, and the Service of them, calling them an <hi>Image,</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>W. R.</hi> appears more warey in this point, in not so directly and absolutely opposing the Meetings themselves, as some have done, but only giving a History of the different Sences and Jealousies of some about them, as also his Friends <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> write more Cautiously in this point of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings, in these words, viz. <hi>That 'tis not agreeable with the Line of Truth to oppose

                  <p>Herein they appear'd more moderate than some that take their parts, who Oppose, Contemn and Vilifie those Meetings.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 64. <hi>In process of Time some Friends thought it necessary that</hi> Marriages <hi>might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the</hi> VVomens-Meetings, <hi>but yet several Friends in divers Counties would not assent that they should be concerned in Marriages; at length several of those who appeared for those distinct Meetings to be concerned, said, The Faithfull see a Necessity and Cause to propose Marriages to the faithful Men and Womens Meetings; This being uttered with those of Party</hi> with G. F. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Many faithful Friends, who are not for Party for <hi>Man,</hi> but Followers of <hi>Christ,</hi> do see a real Conveniency and Service in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Marriages both to the Faithful Men and

Faithfull VVomens Meetings distinctly; and because our Adversary gives us no valid Reason nor Proof to the contrary, we shall only at present cite the Reason given in an Epistle from the Quarterly-Meeting in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> dated, <hi>Mendlesham,</hi> the 29th day of the 7th Moneth, 1674. and directed, <q>To be read at the several Monethly Meetings, and VVomens Meetings, and at every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Meeting of Friends in <hi>Suffolk</hi>
                     </q> (in which Epistle our dear Friend <hi>Robert Duncon,</hi> and many other good Friends were concerned) their Advice and Reason given in the said Epistle follows in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>ANd as at our <hi>Men Friends Meetings</hi> we have advised together in the Wisdom of God to order all things, so we shall also be ready and willing to confer with our <hi>Women Friends,</hi> who feel it laid upon them by the Lord to meet together, and to take care especially in the Houshold of the Faithful; and we have real Unity with their so Meeting together, and taking care in the Church of Christ; and also in those Parts where God hath put it into our <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Friends</hi> to meet together, we desire that those Friends that have Intentions to Marry together, do acquaint our Women Friends with their Intentions of Marriage,—that our <hi>Women Friends</hi> may ask Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58889:62"/>
that they may also be satisfied, as is but Reasonable, that <hi>Women Friends</hi> should be satisfied in this matter, as well as the <hi>Men,</hi> seeing we cannot make a Marriage without a Woman, and that Women are Members of the true Church, and that Women are Competent Witnesses in the Case, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, we may add another Passage, being the 9th Article of Advice, given by <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, Robert Duncon, Charles Harris</hi> and <hi>John Crook,</hi> dated, <hi>Hartford,</hi> the 18th of the 1st Moneth, 1678/9. <q>For the Monethly and Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Hartford,</hi> for a quiet and peaceable Management of Truth's Affairs, therein the Advice is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That all <hi>Women Friends,</hi> who are or may be fully perswaded in their own Minds that they have a Service in the Church in Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting distinct from the Men, be left free therein, without Interruption, Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reflection upon them, yet so as not to Limit or Restrain them (or any of them) from coming among the <hi>Men Friends,</hi> if they shall find Freedom and Service in the Lord.</q>

                  <p>Friends, who in Simplicity assented to the <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> without Exception, are charged with this Jealousie of <hi>Women Ruling over them,</hi> which is a Notorious Untruth and Scandal against many honest-hearted Friends, who never entertained any such Jealousie against the <hi>Womens Meetings;</hi> but in the Love of God do encourage them and their Wives in frequenting them, with respect to their Religious and Christian Service, in Submission to the Royal Law of Love; and therefore the Jealousie pretended of such <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> as is Insinuated, is Groundless, and a false Imagination; for the Submission intended, in both our faithful <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> is to the Power and Spirit of Christ Jesus in them, and not to a Rule or Dominion of meer Creatures, either <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Women;</hi> neither has he proved the said Jealousie (<hi>against</hi> our <hi>Women Friends and their Meetings</hi>) reasonable by

                  <p>Concerning Tythes, 2d part, pag. 43. <hi>William Rogers</hi> puts an <hi>Objection</hi> thus, viz. <hi>But what if it please the Supream Powers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on the National Ministry</hi> Tythes, <hi>how prove you from the Scriptures, that those who freely pay it do ill, or that 'tis not Lawful for them to receive it from such, and Sue for it by the Law from others, who are not free to pay it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>W. R. Answ. <hi>We are so far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all those who freely pay them, and not as by Constraint, that we look upon it to be the Duty of all professing</hi> Christianity, <hi>to Contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Outward Maintenance of such whom they usually hear, and account to be the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ (though not obliged thereto by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58889:67"/>
Law) in case they have need; and if the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any should be such, as to bestow upon them one Fifth Part, instead of a Tenth, far be it from us to condemn it; but the Testimony of Truth is against all those who under pretence of being Gospel Ministers have received Carnal Things, from any who give them not freely, but by virtue of Humane Institution.</hi>

                  <p>We are wholly dissatisfied with this his Answer; it appears to us both Loose and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious: In the first part, he grants a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of paying Tythes, as being far from condemning all who freely pay them without Constraint; in the second place, he preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricates, and alters from the Terms of the Objection, that is, from <hi>freely paying Tythes,</hi> unto <hi>Contributing towards the outward Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> as being the Duty of all professing <hi>Christianity,</hi> with respect to those they usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear, and account the true Ministers; so that his Answer looks with two Faces; as if it would please the Tythe-Payers, and yet save himself from the Censure of Truth, by varying from <hi>Paying Tythes,</hi> which was <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Typical,</hi> to a <hi>Contribution</hi> towards an outward Maintenance or Relief of Christs Ministers, in case they have need, which is a Moral and Christian Act, not limited to a particular Proportion or Number; whereas
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58889:68"/>
the Number <hi>Tenth</hi> or <hi>Tythe</hi> was <hi>Jewish</hi> and Typical, not Moral nor <hi>Christian.</hi> But what Indifferent or Judicious Readers can reasonably take W. R'<hi>s</hi> words [<hi>Contribute toward the outward Maintenance</hi>] to mean any other Maintenance than <hi>Tythes,</hi> the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> being wholly about Tythes, and he presenting a [<hi>We</hi>] that are so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning those that so freely pay Tythes, that he grants them one Fifth part instead of a <hi>Tenth,</hi> if the Charity of any be such as to bestow it on them they account Ministers of Christ. Thus we judge he hath declined our antient Testimony against Tythes, and shewn his own Apostacy and Innovation, and given away the true Christian Right and Freedom (under the Gospel) from that <hi>Yoke of Tythes,</hi> which his Friends J. S. and J. W. have accounted <hi>Antichristian.</hi> But W. R. though he has opposed Tythes as claimed, either upon a <hi>Divine Right or Humane Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> under the Gospel, as in the same <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>2d part;</hi> yet in his Answer he grants a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the freely paying them as an outward Maintenance of their Ministers; which being compared with his Friends Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony against them, amounts to thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> Tythes in these dayes are an <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Yoke,</hi> yet nevertheless we are far from condemning any that will freely put their Necks under it, and bear it without Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58889:68"/>
or Sueing at Law; whereas there is no need of Compelling them by Law, who can freely submit to bear that Yoke; but we deny that Freedom assented to by <hi>W. R.</hi> 'tis not a true Christian Freedom, nor a Freedom in Christ; before he had given the said Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Answer, he should have considered whether it would not thwart or lessen the Testimony of <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> cited by him in his 4th part, pag. 39. in these words, <hi>viz. As to Tythes, we can in Truth say, 'twas never so much as in our Hearts to strengthen any in the Payment thereof, nor yet to weaken the Faith of any, having a Testimony in our Hearts, that Tythes, as at this day paid, are Antichristian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to <hi>W. R</hi>'s Indulgence to the Blindness of those that freely pay Tythes to them they account Christ's Ministers, in being so far from condemning them for that Practice (or rather seeming to render it their Duty) This is to make void Christ's <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> to make it suit with mens <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Blindness,</hi> and not to answer his Light in them; this is to leave them in Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness under their Priests, &amp; not to bring them to Christ; this will never be the way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert People to Christ, the true Shepherd; but is to leave them under their false Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Hirelings; had we taken this Course in Preaching, what success should we have had in our Ministry? (How little has
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58889:69"/>
W. R. ever known of the Work of Christ's Ministry? 'Tis a Question whether ever he Converted one Soul to God in all his Days?) This kind of Liberty and Indulgence to <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Blindness,</hi> yea, to <hi>Erroneous Practices</hi> on the one hand, and to <hi>neglect what's good</hi> on the other, on pretence of <hi>not seeing it their Duty,</hi> as also to make Opposition, Dissention and Separation, under pretence of <hi>Different Gifts and Measures of Grace;</hi> this appears to us as the very Nature and Medul of <hi>W.

                  <p>By all this opposition to the Doctrine, that the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil is not good for Food; <hi>W. R.</hi> seems to account it good for Food, because that Tree in it self, or in its own Nature is good; and so it might; and yet it follows not that it was good for Food, for the Soul to feed upon in a state of Innocency. And we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that <hi>W. R.</hi> may remember that 'tis no Innovation in Doctrine, to say, that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was not good for Food.

have so expressed themselves; not thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present that Wisdom which is accounted Sensual and Devilish, but rather to shew forth, that if we should feed upon, or admire any excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification or Endowment whatsoever, and not have the Eye of our mind chiefly unto the Giver, we might then come to a loss.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all whîch observe, that our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary has here found out a Salve, or better Construction for the said Doctrine, than his opposing and contradicting of it before, as not being according to Truth. At this rate he may make large Books against us; but to what purpose, thus to <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Unsay?</hi> as if he should tell us, 'tis unsound Doctrine, to say, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food;</hi> But to turn about again, It may be used in a good and sound Sense; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would not be understood to reflect upon all that have used that expression, viz. <hi>The Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food.</hi> What kind of Preacher would he make, if he should tell People, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge is good for Food?</hi> The Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food.</p>

No sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who then present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tree of Knowledge as good for Food to be eaten, to make one Wise, &amp;c?

The <hi>Serpent</hi> said unto the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Ye shall not surely dye: For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, your Eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil: And when the Woman saw that the Tree was good for Food, and a Tree to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to make one Wise, she took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. Did the <hi>Serpent</hi> say true, in saying. <hi>Ye shall not surely dye?</hi> No, sure: For God had said the contrary; <hi>In the Day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt dye.</hi> Therefore when the Woman saw that the Tree was good for Food, she saw not aright; she had let in the <hi>Serpents</hi> perswasion to eat thereof, contrary to God's command. There was an Eye open, giving way to the Temptation, which God did not open, a mistaken sight: It was the same by which she saw it was a Tree to be desired to make one Wise. VVhence came that Desire, but from the Serpent's allurement? That begot a false sight, a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehension, not consistent with the Law of Innocence or Uncorruptness of mind, that stood in the Simplicity of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58889:72"/>All which considered, our Opposer is so far from proving any of us <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators,</hi> in saying, <hi>That the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not good for Food,</hi> that he has disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his <hi>own Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation,</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the <hi>Serpent's Doctrine,</hi> contrary to <hi>God's command,</hi> and the Doctrine ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached among us.

And that Eye that the Serpent opens, is not a Single, but an Evil Eye, which Christ came to blind, and to bring that Knowledge to nought, that puffs up, before men can clearly see with that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Single Eye that Christ opens, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that true Divine Knowledge, which is Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>The Matter we Principally aim at and stand for, both in the foregoing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controversie on our parts, is included in these general Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. That since the Term [<hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>] is of late so much cast upon us, we do thereby intend <hi>Christ's Government in his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58889:72"/>
Church,</hi> exercised by him both Immediately and Instrumentally.</p>
                  <p>II. That <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>Governs, Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> in his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People, Immediately</hi> and <hi>Principally</hi> by himself, and Instrumentally (in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) by his Ministers and Servants, as well as he Teaches and Instructs both Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Instrumentally.</p>
                  <p>III. That <hi>Christ's Governing and Ruling Instrumentally by his Ministers and Servants,</hi> relates to the Godly Care, good Instructions, Admonition, and true Judgment given to (and Ministred by) such his Faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Ministers and Elders in Truth, whom the holy Ghost has made <hi>Overseers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12</note> and appointed for <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> for the sake especially of the Younger and Weaker Members, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and such as are under Age, as to Truth and Experience in the Work of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>'Tis about this last Proposition that the Controversie does most depend; for <hi>Christ's Immediate Rule and Government in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is in words owned by our Opposers.</p>
                  <p>IV. No other kind of Government in the Church of Christ, in Substance, Nature and End, do we at this day plead for, than what was exercised in the Primitive Christian Churches before the Apostacy, in a <hi>Spiritual, Perswasive, Convincing Way</hi> and <hi>Manner, suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58889:73"/>
to Christ's Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> which pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by his Truth and Meekness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and true Judgment; wherein we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be our <hi>King, Lord</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> all Carnal Force and Rigour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>V. In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ we utterly deny and detest <hi>Exercising Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over God's Heritage,</hi> or <hi>seeking Dominion over the Faith and Conscience of his People,</hi> and <hi>assuming to our selves any Power, Dominion</hi> (or <hi>Arbitrary Jurisdiction</hi>) <hi>over their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or the <hi>Properties of any other People in outward Things;</hi> but in the Name of the Lord, are, and stand for <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> between <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> against all <hi>Injurious</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Actions</hi> and <hi>Dealings,</hi> we being for <hi>Doing to all men as we would they should do unto us.</hi> God is our Record for our Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Conscientious Tenderness in these matters.

of the Case, is both rendred Obnoxious to the outward Government under which we live, and against the inward Government of Christ, insomuch that all the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are for <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>visible Form</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> among them, are put under the Character of the <hi>Apostate</hi> and <hi>Innovator;</hi> and this still tends to expose them to Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas our Innocent Conversations and Peaceable Deportment towards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government (under which we live) hath been and is well known to be such, as neither our Opposer is able to disprove, nor need we here Vindicate our selves therein, although unjustly rendred, as <hi>neither consistent with the Outward and National Government,</hi> (which has been the Charge of our <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) nor yet with Christ's Inward and Spiritual Government:</hi> This appears not only Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but Absurd; as if because Christ's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Government and Kingdom is <hi>Inward and Spiritual in the Conscience,</hi> therefore he must have No <hi>Visible Ministers</hi> in his Kingdom; No <hi>Visible Order</hi> and <hi>Form of Government</hi> under his Dominion; No <hi>Visible Persons</hi> exercised in any <hi>Rule, outward Order, Laws</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if all Christ's Ministers, Apostles, Elders, Overseers, Helps, Governments, (which were appointed by him in his Church,

with all the Instructions, Decrees and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apostles setting in order things that were lacking, doing all things decently and in order) were a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Invisible,</hi> and <hi>nothing Outward, Visible</hi> or <hi>Formal,</hi> because Christ's Inward and Spiritual Government (whence these proceed) is Invisible; we can make no better arguing than this kind, in our Adversaries Distinction of his <hi>Christian-Quaker</hi> from the <hi>Apostate</hi> and <hi>Innovator;</hi> nor deduce a more Natural Inference from his opposition against <hi>Visible Persons</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in an <hi>Outward Form of Government and Order</hi> in the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How does he consist with himself, in relation to the Paper which he sayes is <hi>accounted the Foundation of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the North?</hi> 2d part, pag. 78. which Paper was subscribed by his said honourable Friends J. W. and J. S. and above Eighty more Persons, in which Paper are these words and terms, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>We who are chosen by the Churches, and in their behalf to Act—Some of other Counties, and some amongst our selves, not chosen by the Churches, have usurped Authority over us.—The Meetings by whom we were Imployed—Our Men, who have their Authority given them by the Churches Choice and Consent, are hindred by others not so appointed, to whom we gave no Power by our Consent,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58889:75"/>
but do deny, that they have had Authority from us to dispose of our Collections or Records, or ORDERS, or Matters of our Concerns—Our Chosen Men—They who are not chosen by the Churches—You who are concerned and rightly Chosen by the Churches—&amp;c.</q> With many other Passages in the said Paper, all which intimate <hi>Authority, Power</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> (together with <hi>Records, Orders, &amp;c.</hi>) what <hi>Power,</hi> as a Church, they assurned to chuse Persons to act in their Concerns, and give Power to Persons therein; so that here was <hi>W. R</hi>'s great Intimate Friends for a sort of a <hi>Church-Government, Authority, Orders, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, Prescriptions,</hi> &amp;c. Does he not deserve to be severely reproved by them, for so manifestly contradicting them (whose Cause he pretends to plead) by his Publishing such a great Book against <hi>Church-Government, Visible Forms, Orders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And now, we would ask W. R. if those <hi>Churches chusing,</hi> and giving Power to others, and the <hi>Persons chosen</hi> to be Imployed in their Affairs, were all <hi>Invisible?</hi> and their Affairs and Business <hi>Invisible?</hi> and their respective Meetings, with the Methods they intended therein <hi>Invisible?</hi> and their Records and Orders <hi>Invisible?</hi> Surely the said Paper of theirs, with the limitted Prescriptions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58889:75"/>
was not Invisible any more than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that formed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> but seeing <hi>W. R.</hi> is so much for Invisibility in Church-Order, Government, &amp;c. it had been well his great Book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and those his confused Oppositions and Gainsayings had never been so Visible, but kept all Invisible, that he might not have troubled poor simple-hearted Friends, and the World with such his groundless Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, and ill mannaged Controversies; We are perswaded, if this his Fruitless Work had been all kept in Obscurity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility, it had been far more Reputable for him than it now is, or ever like to be in its Visibility. Howbeit, 'tis observable, that he varies in his <hi>Objection</hi> against Visible Persons, being invested with Power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, &amp;c. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ's Government, in an Outward, Visible Form; whereas this <hi>Objection</hi> is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in other places; he seems to restrict and qualifie it with this frequent Addition, viz. <hi>Whether they see it their Duty or no;</hi> that is, that they are not bound to obey outward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, Orders, &amp;c. unless they see it their Duty. As for Instance, see his 3d part, p. 9. pretended, <hi>On behalf of Christs Government, and his Spirit's Guidance into all Truth,</hi> he gives this Testimony, (viz.) <hi>That there is no ground either from the Scriptures of Truth without us, or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58889:76"/>
Light of Christ within us to believe, that any</hi> Christian <hi>Professor can in Truth affirm, That there are outward Prescriptions and Orders given forth by the Spirit of God through any one or more Mortal Men in this our day, which others ought to obey and follow, whether they see it their Duty or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe again here, That his <hi>Objection</hi> is not absolute as before, against Visible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being invested with Power from Christ, to execute or put in Practice outward <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Instructions</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> &amp;c. nor against such outward Prescriptions and Orders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given forth by the Spirit of God through one or more Men or Persons in this our day; (for there are many wholsome and binding Rules, Precepts and Commands outwardly recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, that proceeded from the holy Spirit in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God and Christ, which are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the same Spirit in his Servants) but his Objection is against their being given forth with intent to be obeyed by others, <hi>whether they see it their Duty or not;</hi> wherein the Objection does not only vary from that in his Title Page, but is very Frivolous and Loose, and will serve only for a pretence to Loose Spirits, who (to evade just Precepts and Instructions, proceeding from the Spirit of Truth in the Servants and Ministers of Christ) will be apt to pretend, <hi>They see it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58889:76"/>
not their Duty;</hi> which yet is no proof that any thing <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Lawfull</hi> in it self is not their Duty: On the other hand, seeing whatever Precept, Direction or Command is given forth from the Spirit of Truth, which concerns our Duty, either towards God or Man, and the keeping a Conscience void of Offence towards both, is not given forth to be left Indifferent, as to be Accepted or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but to be put in Practice; it cannot reasonably be supposed, That the Spirit of Truth in that Case, leaves the Conscience without Evidence, or the Creature, to whom it directs in such Blindness, as not to see that a Duty which in it self is Just and Righteous, having a necessary Tendence to that Godly, Righteous, and Sober Life, which the Grace of God Universally appears to teach and lead men into; and therefore, for any professing Truth, and the Guidance of the Spirit, and Light thereof, to pretend, <hi>That Spirit may through Instruments direct such Orders and Rules unto them, as they see not to be their Duty;</hi> This will not excuse them in the Day of the Lord; for if they sin against Sight and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge given of God, that is their Rebellion and Stubbornness; if they are become Blind and Ignorant of what's their Duty towards God or Man, through their own careless Neglect of his Grace given them, they are justly condemnable therein, their want of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58889:77"/>
Sight proceeding from their idle Sloath, and want of Diligence, if he grants that every one has a measure of the true Light and Spirit: On the other hand, whatever is really any ones Duty, in relation to a good Conscience, it cannot be livingly and acceptably perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in God's sight, without keeping in a true Sight and Sence of that divine Light and holy Spirit, which is near to shew man his Duty, both in shunning Evil and doing good, as also to lead him into all Truth, as he gives up to it, and attends upon its Guidance. But further, the Members of Christ, the true and spiritual Believers, have so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sence and feeling of those <hi>outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> that proceed from the Spirit of Truth in their Brethren, that they have Unity therewith, and have some discerning of the Nature, good Tendence and End thereof; and even such as are but weak in the Faith, being tender and honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, as the Lord layes no more upon them than what they can bear; so they are so far from opposing any thing of God's Counsel through his Servants, which they have not a present sight of, that they apply their Hearts to the Lord with diligent Attention, that he may reveal that unto them. For in assurance of God's revealing what should be needful to the true Believers (in the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians dayes) as they walked by <hi>one and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58889:77"/>
same Rule, and minded the same thing;</hi> the Apostle to the <hi>Philipians</hi> saith, <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,</hi> Phil. 3. 15. and to the <hi>Thessalonians, We have Confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do, and will do the things which we command you,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. 4. The true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Servants of Christ writ and spoke in a <hi>Holy Confidence</hi> in Christ Jesus, and preached in <hi>Much Assurance,</hi> that their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony would meet with Reception in the Hearts of them who received the Love of Truth: They did not leave the Concerns of Truth and of the Churches of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Unity or good Order, upon Loose and Indifferent Terms, as when the Spirit of the Lord required them to Teach, Exhort or Command any thing needful to be practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Churches of Christ, with respect to good Order, Society, Unity, and Holiness of Conversation, they faithfully signified it, and did not leave the matter loose and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, in this wise, (viz.) <hi>These things we are required of the Lord to signifie to you, as very needfull in such and such Cases, but they are not Binding upon you, you need not Practise them unless you see them to be your Duty; or if the Lord doth not let you see them to be your Duty, you may let them alone; you are not Bound to Practise any thing we Preach, Direct or Counsel you to do, if you do not see it to be your Duty.</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58889:78"/>
This would be a very feeble kind of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bespeak such Inconsistency and Distrust in their Testimony, as if the Lord would not open their Eyes to see that which his Spirit Directs to, and Leads his Servants to Testifie; and not only so, but such kind of Loose Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Preaching would be a means to leave them Blind and Dim-sighted, who are so, instead of opening their Eyes by the plain Evidence of the Spirit and Power of God; whereas the true Ministers and Servants of Christ by the Manifestation of Truth did commend themselves to every mans Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the sight of God, as having Faith, Confidence and Assurance, That they should have an Evidence and Answer in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, being <hi>unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that were saved, and in them that perished; to the one, the savour of Death unto Death; and to the other, the savour of Life unto Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16. They preacht both in Assurance and Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>These things Command and Teach, Preach the Word, be Instant in Season, out of Season, Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort, with all Long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Doctrine: I Charge thee, &amp;c.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58889:79"/>
them; and therefore, we do profess serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we see no real Cause or valid Reason our Opposer shews for the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noise and Rumble he makes about <hi>outward Laws, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, Orders, Edicts or Decrees, outward Form of Government, Apostacy, Innovations, Impositions, Lording over Faith, over Conscience, &amp;c.</hi> whilst he shews us no Unjust, no Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor Uncomely Order or Proceedings among us as a People, nor yet gives us any Instances or Catalogue of those Impositions, Innovations, New Doctrines or Practices, brought in and received among us, which are either Inconsistent with our first Testimony to the Light and Grace of God within, and the Teachings thereof, or thereby condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Evil, or wholly Unnecessary in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: He should have given us a Catalogue of those <hi>Innovations</hi> he complains of, and what <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> he would prescribe to the contrary, whether any or none, and not go to fill the Peoples Ears with a general Clamour of <hi>Apostacy, Innovations and Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> scandalously to render us as bad as the Church of ROME.

may come into such Meetings, such sway not the Meetings in Truth's Affairs; but there is an Eye to the Universal Power of God, to sway and rule in our Proceedings, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Truth; and what Reason and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in Truth given in matters before us, these have place in our Meetings: and 'tis very needfull that some that are not grown into the Exercise of Help and Government in the Church, who are Honest-minded, should be present at such Meetings, that they may have the Advantage thereof, in order to their furtherance in the Truth and Service, as the Lord shall make them capable; for the least sound Member hath its Service in the Body: But <hi>W.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58889:81"/>
disapproved our proceedings therein or not, or prove them inconsistent with those Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Ends, that he himself has granted.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And though in some Circumstances every thing be not specified in the Scriptures, yet whether there is any part of Church-Discipline practised among us, that does not tend to answer the Apostolick Doctrine, in respect to Good Order, a Holy Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Heavenly Society, and things that are Honest, Just, Reasonable, and of good Report. What Form or Discipline do we practise that is unsuitable to these Righteous Ends? We affirm, that his crying out <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, Innovations, Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Orders, Prescriptions,</hi> &amp;c. in general, is no answer, nor any proof of his Charge of <hi>Apostate and Innovator</hi> against us; let him either specifie the particulars thereof that he condemns us for as Apostates, and that we practise as <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> or else forever be ashamed of such Impertinency and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous charging the Meetings of the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which are concerned in and about those Outward Affairs and <hi>Christian</hi> Services (for which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58889:82"/>
as <hi>Charitable Duties, inspecting Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, taking care that Truth be not Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,</hi> &amp;c. which he hath confessed, (and the Service of such our Meetings being to answer those Righteous and Good Ends.) As also to the same purpose (in reference to Friends care about <hi>Printing</hi>) in these Words, viz.</p>
               <p>Third part, pag. 31. <hi>I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that it is unnecessary for the Members of the Church of Christ to take care, that nothing Scandalous to the Truth come forth in publick under the Name of any who make Profession thereof; and were it so, that I had ought upon me on Truths behalf to bring to publick view, I should be glad of the opportunity to lay it before such Brethren with whom the Word of Wisdom, Knowledge and Discerning of Spirits dwelt.</hi>

                     <p>We do testifie in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that where this is really the case of any one weak in the Faith, who is under some private Scruple or Dissatisfaction of Conscience, yet peaceably minded, and having

his Faith to himself, there ought to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Forbearance</hi> towards such, and no urging with <hi>Severity;</hi> for too much of that (we mean of <hi>Severity,</hi> or <hi>Zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Knowledge or Wisdom from God</hi>) may possibly discourage the weak, drive and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Truth into Prejudice, and make some Desperate, Hard, and Careless; but tender Perswasion and Instruction towards such is needfull; and far be it from us to be <hi>Severe</hi> in such Cases; the Lord Jesus Christ hath taught, and daily teacheth his Servants how to bear the Burden of the <hi>Weak Ones,</hi> and their Weakness and Infirmities, to help them, and not drive them out for a <hi>Private Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Opinion</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> in one that's peaceable (though but Weak) may be better born than <hi>Publick Opposition</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> in the Church.

for such to undertake the Place or Office of Elders, Overseers and Counsellors of others, who are neither Sound nor Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Judgment and Advice themselves, (with them who are for Peace and good Order, and to prevent Reproach and Scandal) but are ready to let Loose Youth, and let up a Spirit of false and fleshly Liberty, under pretence of <hi>Conscience.</hi> For Instance, set Case two Young Persons about to propose their Intentions of Marriage to a Meeting, shall pretend a Scruple of Conscience (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from themselves, or as they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest by others) for not proposing it a Second Time, and some pretending to sit as Overseers in the Meeting, take part with them, abet and plead for such Liberty therein against coming a Second Time, and against the Sence of a great part of the Meeting, who are Tenderly and Conscientiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for that good and needfull Order of proposing the Marriage Twice; they that oppose this, and plead a Liberty to come but Once, are therein Unsociable, and what they stand for is not in Reality Tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but Flesh and Fleshly Will; it looks not like the pure Spirit, but Flesh; nor like Tender Conscience, but Self-Will and Humour. What! a Tender Conscience against so much Patience, Temperance and due Order, as to forbear Consumnating the

                        <hi>They cry against outward Forms, Methods and Order, Visible Form of Church-Government and Discipline, pretending a fear of getting too much into the Form, going from the Power, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teacher,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>We may rather plead, a fear of the other Extream, <hi>i. e.</hi> that by opposing <hi>Forms,</hi> due <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> they'l be so in <hi>Form</hi> confused and void of good Order, due Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Discipline, that they are in danger to let up a <hi>Libertine</hi> Spirit, Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Ranterism, Wilfulness and Contempt in Youth against the godly Care, Oversight, good Government and Order in the Church of Christ, that through their neglect of true Judgment, due Care and Order, they'l let in <hi>Ranterism</hi> and Confusion, and the Spirit and Anarchy of the Ranters over them.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58889:88"/>
in your Testimony till they answer by Condemnation: And do not strive and make Bargains with That which is out of the Truth.</q> Against which <hi>W.

By which, if his meaning be, that he would not have Friends to discourse with such, nor yet to agree about any orderly Conference, in order to a Reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or hearing of Differences; then his own Practice afterward condemns his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in submiting to a limitted Meeting with me within the City of</hi> Bristol, <hi>in the 12th Moneth,</hi> 1677. <hi>Gainsayers were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by sound Doctrine—And whether 'tis not Rational to conclude, that</hi> G.

But if otherwise his meaning be, that such whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, have no right to Bargain, Buy or Sell, until they answer by Condemnation, then I may justly term that to be a</hi> Mark of the Beast, <hi>spoken of</hi> Rev. 13. 17. <hi>where 'tis thus said,</hi> No Man might buy nor sell, save he that had the Mark or Name of the Beast. <hi>Let the Reader take either of these two Meanings (for a third I cannot think of.)

                  <p>He gives a Positive Judgment against G. F. as a Deceiver, upon his own Uncertain Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of his meaning.

could not be to forbid Friends having any Discourse or orderly Conference for the Convincement of the Persons mistaken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, nor yet to forbid Friends buying and selling or Trading with any of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore W.

                  <p>Whereby (if these be <hi>J. S.</hi> his words) he takes it for granted, <hi>1st,</hi> That the said <hi>H. S.</hi> his Certificate contains nothing but Truth in the Citation of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words. And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58889:90"/>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> He gives positive Judgment, that <hi>G. F.</hi> has reported Lyes therein, as not being the first Lyes. Howbeit, the Charge, as laid down and contained in the said Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, <hi>G. F.</hi> denyes, as a Perversion and Confounding his words, yea, as <hi>Horrid Lyes,</hi> except that of <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> as <hi>W. R.</hi> has cited <hi>G. F</hi>'s Answer and Negation before <hi>H. S.</hi> his Certificate, 5th part, pag. 83. We think, that <hi>J. S.</hi> should not have taken the words so Hardly and Censoriously up against <hi>G. F.</hi> until he had been sure <hi>G. F.</hi> would have owned them directly, as laid down by <hi>H. S.</hi> and that upon a fair hearing Face to Face. Now the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>W. R.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> have heard <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Accusers, Face and Face, concerning this Matter whereof he is accused by <hi>H. S.</hi> before he was <hi>Condemned</hi> and recorded as a <hi>Lyar</hi> therein? If not (as we presume they have not) then whether they have therein done Judicially and Justly, according to their own Pretentions of Justice and Right, and their severally declaring <hi>against condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any man before heard; judging and censuring him when unheard in defence of himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Crime laid against him?</hi> And if it be a grand Mark of Apostacy and Persecution so to do, as <hi>W. R.</hi> signifies, we would know how they can escape their own Judgment herein, thus to condemn a Person, and that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58889:91"/>
in Print, before he be heard or duely tryed in the Case? And seeing also W. R. 2d part, pag. 76, 77. thus saith, viz. <hi>That which to us seems to aggravate the Offence of the Sixty Six Subscribers is this,</hi> J. S. <hi>doth POSITIVELY affirm, That a great part of the Subscribers never spoke or sent to him about the matter; we have great cause to doubt, that not a few, but many of the Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> (IF NOT ALL) <note n="†" place="margin">Can this be justly Insinuated, when many of them had heard both Parties at <hi>Drawell,</hi> in Matter of Fact? And why does W. R. take no better notice of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given by the said Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers, for Reconciliation? And can he think that none of them could shew Reason for such Advice and that from their own Knowledge, who were Persons of more Credit than himself?</note> 
                     <hi>have given Judgment without hearing of either Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we may still Question, <hi>1st,</hi> Whether <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>W. R.</hi> did ever speak or send to <hi>G. F.</hi> (the Party accused) in this matter, <hi>before</hi> they condemned him to such Infamy (as <hi>W. R.</hi> hath recorded him in Print) for a <hi>Lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Whether <hi>J. Story</hi> gave way to, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or advised, or doth really own the Printing of what he saith to <hi>H. Sweeting's Certificate</hi> against <hi>G. F. J. S.</hi> his plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer hereunto may justly be expected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> The Question is also, whether <hi>H.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58889:91"/>
Sweeting,</hi> and the rest that Certified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>G. F.</hi> on this point, were not a Party against him, when their Certificates were written?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> Whether their Certificates do not so much vary in their relations, as may justly render them of less Credit, and to be looked on as from Parties set against <hi>G. F.?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>H. Sweeting</hi> certifies <hi>G. F.</hi> did say, <q>That to the Seperate Meeeting there was Whores and Rogues, Drunkards and Swearers, and that there came a couple to be Marryed, and one stood up and said, Master <hi>Story,</hi> I take such a one to be my Wife, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. B.</hi> testifies to <hi>G. F.</hi> thus, viz. <q>That thou saidst, Master <hi>Story,</hi> I take such a one to be my Wife, and I take such a one to be my Husband, and eat Bread and drink Wine, go together like Whores and Rogues.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>See now how various &amp; differing the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates are, as between saying, That <hi>to the said Meeting there was Whores &amp; Rogues, Drunkards,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>go together like Whores and Rogues,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Seeing these Certificates are so differing in the manner of stating the matter; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether these Persons might not mistake in both upon failure of Memory or Prejudice, and might possibly mis-place the Words, if spoken? However they might have been better imployed than to make such sorry Certificates, and so might <hi>W. R.</hi> than
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58889:92"/>
to publish a Judgment upon them without any Judicial hearing of the Parties Face to Face.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>E. P.</hi> he appears angry against <hi>G. F.</hi> as one willing to be his Accuser, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him this perverse Insinuation, with an [IF] viz. <hi>So</hi> IF <hi>he did speak a Rabble of Lyes of People behind their Backs, be it upon his own Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>W. R.</hi> has publisht this doubtful and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Insinuation among his Testimonies against <hi>G. F.</hi> and its pretended in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth too, pag. 84, 85. part 5. And not only this, but there's another [IF] against <hi>G. F.</hi> in <hi>E. P</hi>'s pretended Testimony, viz. <hi>as IF he had surrounded the Countries to get up all the Miscarriages and Failings done and committed in time past;</hi> Was ever such sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Testimonies Printed before? Herein <hi>E. P.</hi> has neither appeared Impartial, nor done Friendly, nor as he would be done by; howbeit, to do him Right on the other hand, we understand that he gave not his consent to the Printing these angry Words of his; how willing therefore was <hi>W.

                     <hi>W. R.</hi> 1st part, p. 30. <hi>Neither can we be at unity with the appearance of that spirit in any one that villifies others for Fleers in time of Persecution—when such an one hath appeared a Fleer himself.</hi> This compared with <hi>W. R.</hi>'s Charge in his Letter to <hi>G. F.</hi> dated the 3d day of the 10th Moneth, 1677. pag. 93, 94. 4th part. <hi>There are endeavours to send Papers to and fro, to be spatter</hi> J. S. <hi>for going out of a Meeting when the Persecutors came; yet I know that thou thy self hast been found in the like Action, and (If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports be true) the</hi> FREQUENTEST <hi>of any Man that ever I heard, called by the Name of a</hi> Quaker.</p>

               <div type="rebuttal">
                  <head>Observe.</head>
                  <p>A very high and foul Charge to render <hi>G. F.</hi> a <hi>Flyer in times of Persecution,</hi> yea, the <hi>frequentest Flyer</hi> or Goer out of Meetings, when Persecutors came, of any man that ever he heard called by the Name of a <hi>Quaker.</hi> Oh sad! Will any that has known <hi>G. F</hi>'s many and frequent Sufferings, and long Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments for the Truth's sake, believe this Accusation, so grosly cast upon him, and that on no better Proof, than IF REPORTS BE TRUE; when doubtless <hi>W. R.</hi> could
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58889:93"/>
not but know such Reports to be false. This is that Judicious and Conscientious Person <hi>William Rogers,</hi> that's so severely set against Censuring and Judging Persons upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, without hearing the Accusers and the accused Face to Face, who thus extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and grosly hath represented a Person in Print as the <hi>most frequent Flyer</hi> in times of Persecution, of any called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> that ever he heard of, and that upon <hi>Reports,</hi> with an <hi>If,</hi> i. e. <hi>IF REPORTS BE TRUE,</hi> but his pretences of Justice will not hide his manifest Injustice.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted that <hi>W. R.</hi> in his 2d part, pag. 88. has Printed these Reports against <hi>Jasper Batt,</hi> viz. <hi>That he went abroad Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thereby occasioning sometimes twenty Pound Fines, sometimes forty Pound Fines to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the Hearers—whilst his Estate was well secured out of the Persecutors reach.</hi> And yet <hi>W. R.</hi> would be thought a very Just man in this case, by this False and Hypocritical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, pag. 89. viz. <hi>We are not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse on Report:</hi> When it is his frequent Practice against <hi>G. F.</hi> and others, which if he be Just towards <hi>Jasper Batt,</hi> in not accusing him <hi>upon Report,</hi> then he is very Unjust to <hi>G. F.</hi> in accusing and judging him <hi>upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports:</hi> And he hath not shewn himself Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious towards <hi>J. B.</hi> in Printing those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports against him, to cast and leave an Odium
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58889:93"/>
upon him, which we are not bound to Credit all, either as undeniable Verities, or as just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated by him upon bare Report.</p>
                  <p>And this is not all, as to <hi>G. F.</hi> we must proceed further to find some more likely proofs for his Charge against <hi>G. F.</hi> of <hi>Flying in time of Persecution,</hi> and that is to some pretended Certificates and Testimonies in his fifth part, pag. 62, 63. in the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made, <hi>Of a Meeting held in</hi> Broad-Mead <hi>in the City of</hi> Bristol, <hi>when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution attended Friends, and that</hi> G. F. <hi>stood up and spoke in the Meeting, and after departed out of the Meeting at a back pair of Stairs, a very considerable time before the Meeting broke up, and was not taken Prisoner that day; and the ground of his departure at that time, we have cause to believe, was to avoid being taken Prisoner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>M. G. M. N.</hi> and <hi>A. D.</hi> who are the Subscribers, we are sorry your Names should be exposed in Print to such an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and silly <hi>Testimony</hi> as this, to gratifie an Envious Spirit against <hi>G. F.</hi> and we testifie, the Charge contained in it is no matter of <hi>Testimony,</hi> but an <hi>Accusation</hi> on your own belief, that his departure then was to avoid being taken Prisoner, nor do we remember any back pair of Stairs belonging to that Meeting, but such as were a common passage to it; such Insinuation therefore was not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58889:94"/>
kind nor friendly. To your <hi>Testimony,</hi> so called, <hi>William James</hi> saith, He also can bear Witness. And also <hi>Nathaniel Day</hi> saith thus, viz. <q>I believe his so departing was to save himself from being taken by the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</q> [How now <hi>N. D?</hi> how comest thou in Print, as a Witness for <hi>W. R?</hi> Look at home and mind thy own condition.]</p>
                  <p>But to the Matter, we have this to say, That as your <hi>Belief</hi> imports no matter of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> so if the <hi>belief</hi> of all those who have appeared a Party with <hi>W. R.</hi> were taken and Recorded for <hi>Certificates</hi> and <hi>Testimonies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>G. F.</hi> we might have more <hi>strange Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> suppose they believe as <hi>W. R.</hi> does, and are full of Jealousie, as he is, they might Write and Print such Testimonies as this, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We believe and are jealous that</hi> G. F. <hi>is an Apostate, an Innovator, an Imposer of Blind Obedience, a Deceiver, a Lyar, one that hath the Mark of the Beast, the greatest Fleer in times of Persecution, that ever we heard of, among any called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. according as <hi>W. R.</hi> hath represented him; pray what kind of valid <hi>Testimonies</hi> would these be? and of what Credit with impartial Readers? from such as are a party with <hi>W. R.</hi> against <hi>G. F.</hi> Oh Friends! consider what <hi>Impertinencies</hi> and <hi>silly Occasions</hi> PREJUDICE is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; and we must tell <hi>W. R.</hi> that this kind
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58889:94"/>
of his proceeding to Print such pretended <hi>Testimonies,</hi> or rather <hi>Accusations,</hi> grounded on the Belief (or Jealousie) of a Party, is a new kind of process, neither Christian nor Legal; has he heard the Accusers and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused Face to Face in this matter, according to his own rule? We presume he has not; then what a new uncouth and irregular course has he taken to Infamize a Person in Print, upon <hi>pretended Testimonies</hi> and <hi>Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> without any real Proof or lawful Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on any Judicial procedure? At what an easie rate can he Defame and Expose Friends by Name to publick censure in Print? Besides, (Friends, <hi>M. G. M. N. A. D. W. J.</hi> and <hi>N. D.</hi>) your pretended Testimonies bear no Date, as to the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> when that Meeting in <hi>Bristol</hi> was held, when <hi>G. F.</hi> departed (as you believe) to avoid Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, nor as to the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>time</hi> of the making and signing your said <hi>Testimonies,</hi> nor do you shew how long it was between the <hi>time</hi> of the said <hi>Meeting,</hi> and the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>signing</hi> your said <hi>Testimonies,</hi> and we may question whether they were formed and drawn up by your selves, or by <hi>W. R.</hi> or whether you were not drawn by him to sign them? And whether it was by your advice or consent that he Printed them? However, Pray, for the time to come, be you more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and no more drawn to sign such Insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58889:95"/>
and Impertinent <hi>Testimonies</hi> or <hi>Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> against any Friend or Brother, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie an Envious Revengeful Spirit, as is <hi>W. R</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Samuel Hollister,</hi> how comest thou to expose thy Ancient deceased Uncle's Name in such a Certificate as this? viz. <q>I do also remember that my Uncle <hi>Dennis Hollister</hi> did acquaint me, That <hi>G.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hast thou herein shewn that Reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to thy Aged, Grave Uncle, as thou oughtst to have done, thus to expose his Name so long after his decease? which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less had he been alive, he would either have prevented, or severely reprehended thee for; and we may justly question whether thou hast given a Just and Impartial account of thy deceased Uncle's Words in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he is not here to answer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; to be sure thou hast not given a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial Account to render it credible to us; and dost thou not know, that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may greatly vary matters? Nor do we believe that <hi>G. F.</hi> gave him any such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Advice as <hi>to absent himself from Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in time of Persecution;</hi> for he absolutely denys it, and says, <hi>He did encourage him to the contrary, when he was able or capable.</hi> Dost thou not know and remember, that thy Uncle
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58889:95"/>
was an Aged, Weakly and Sickly man, that much kept his Chamber in Winter time, and therefore sometimes unfit to endure such Hardship and Sufferings as Friends were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten exposed to, at Meetings? Was he then meet to expose himself to stand in the Streets, when Friends were either haled out, or kept out of their Meetings in the Streets? Thou sayest thou <hi>Remembrest thy Uncle did acquaint thee,</hi> but thou certifies neither Day nor Year when. And suppose <hi>G. F.</hi> spake any thing in tenderness to thy Uncle, with respect to his Age and Infirmity of Body, it could not amount to any such general advice <hi>as to absent from Meetings in time of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he having encouraged him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. However, could it be Just in thee to expose both thy Uncle and <hi>G. F.</hi> as thou hast done, to gratifie <hi>W. R.</hi> his Spirit of Enmity against Friends, in such a <hi>Certificate?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thy framing, and whether Printed by thy advice or consent, or not, thou canst best Answer; we do not believe it will be grateful to <hi>Dennis Hollister's</hi> honest Children and Family, to see their Ancient, Grave and Honoured Father's Name thus exposed in Print, so long after his Decease, to gratifie an Envious, Quarelsom, Proud, Disdainful Spirit.</p>

F. positively denyes, that he so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised or intended; there has been some Mistake in the Case, 'tis probable; and here is no date of the day and year when he so advised, in either of these Certificates or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, as <hi>W. R.</hi> calls them: The one saith, it was <hi>several Years past;</hi> the other says, <hi>as he remembers, it was that time that he came into their Country.</hi> It seems, 'twas several (or many) Years after they had some private Discourse apart with G. F. that they made their Certificates or Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from it, and that upon the Credit of their Memories, which might easily fail them in so many years time; and which incertainty <hi>W. R.</hi> has grounded his Charge and Judgment against G. F. upon, as having advised a Friend to <hi>Purchase Tythes,</hi> thus to make this a matter of Credit against G. F. he layes it down, under the Title of <hi>Testimony,</hi> with his own Judgment presumed on it, to wit, that he so <hi>advised them to buy their Tythes,</hi> which is contrary to G. F's known Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58889:97"/>
and Principle, who has been for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years, and is at this present in trouble for Non-Payment of <hi>Tythe,</hi> being under prosecution at Law, because he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Plantiff, which is far from buying off his Tythe. And that which renders these mens Certificates of less Credit, is, that G. F. would have them that paid Tythe admonished: Strange! what <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished against Tythe,</hi> and at the same time <hi>advise to the buying off Tythe?</hi> that's very Improbable. And why should he advise them to purchase or buy the Tythes of the Priests? For what time, or how long could they sell them, or give them Title to them? Hath the Priest the Tythe any longer than for his Life? and how uncertain is that? But hath not <hi>N. C.</hi> appeared an <hi>Accuser</hi> of G. F. as being <hi>more Guilty himself,</hi> &amp;c? And does W. R. in point of Judicial Proceedings, allow of an <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>Informer</hi> to be a <hi>Competent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> we suppose not; some of his Party have distinguished between a <hi>Witness</hi> and an <hi>Accuser;</hi> but he has taken <hi>N. C</hi>'s Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Testimony</hi> against G. F. yea, for granted; he has given his Censure and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, that G. F. did so advise to <hi>the Purchasing or Buying of Tythes,</hi> both of the Priest and Impropriators. But before he gave this Judgment and exposed those <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates</hi> in Print, did he Examine and hear all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58889:98"/>
the Parties concerned Face to Face? Did he Examine and hear all Circumstances on all hands relating to the Accuser and Accused, face to face? We may presume he did not. And who induced <hi>N. C.</hi> and <hi>R. A.</hi> to make and give out their Certificates upon a Private Discourse so many years after? Have they not done Unkindly and Prejudicially therein, and <hi>W. R.</hi> more basely to Print them, and give a Judgment thereupon, without hearing the Parties face to face? Where was his <hi>Justice?</hi> his <hi>Conscientiousness</hi> and his <hi>Legality</hi> pretended, according to his own Plea upon <hi>John</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Doth our Law judge any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hear him, and know what he doth?</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 16. <hi>For him which is Accused, to have his Accusers face to face, and have Licence to Answer for himself concerning the Crime laid against him;</hi> and not to judge and censure a Person in matter of Fact, when unheard in Defence of himself? has not <hi>W. R.</hi> much pleaded for this Method? but how has he kept to it? Did he hear <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>N. C.</hi> and <hi>R. A.</hi> face to face, and <hi>G. F.</hi> answer for himself, and make his own Defence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? and that before such time as he had exposed and promulgated their <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates,</hi> and his <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> against <hi>G. F.</hi> upon them? If not, (as we are apt to think he did not) then what gross Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, Irregularity, as well as Unfair and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58889:98"/>
Unchristian Dealing, is he guilty of? And how False and Inconsistent with himself is he in these matters discovered to be? And how will he escape the <hi>Grand Mark</hi> of <hi>Apostacy</hi> (in his own Terms and Sense) in judging and censuring a Person unheard in Defence of himself before his Accusers face to face? Let the Impartial and Prudent judge.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>N. C.</hi> thou hast known some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what belongs to the Administration of Justice, dost thou not know, that the Omission of Material Circumstances, in point of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may greatly alter the Case? And what probable Circumstances hast thou given in thy pretended Testimony? How tender is Common Law and Justice in such Cases? Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi> saith, <hi>Quod in Criminali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Probatione debent Esse Luce clariores, Cook's Institut.</hi> 3d part, fol. 210. i. e. <hi>That in Criminals, Proofs</hi> (or Testimonies) <hi>ought to be more clear than the Light.</hi> And <hi>Michael Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> plainly shews how many wayes Justice may be perverted; amongst which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>When they proceed hastily, without due Examination and Consideration of the Fact, and of all MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, without hearing both Parties; for as one saith,</hi> (Qui aliquid Statuerit, Parte inaudita altera, aequum Licet Statuerit haud equus. est) <hi>He that shall Judge or Determine of a Matter,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58889:99"/>
the one Party being Unheard, although he shall Judge Aright, yet is he not a just Judge.</hi> We do confess, and will grant, That where Matters Criminal of outward Fact or Overt Act are charged, 'tis most safe and judicial to have the Parties face to face, and a fair and equal Hearing and Proof, before Judgment be given. But this is not the Case of <hi>W. R.</hi> who in many things is <hi>Informer, Accuser</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> and herein has assumed to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any such equal Hearing or Evidence.</p>
                  <p>What Concerns Matters of Charge, Trespass or Crime upon Persons, in common Law and Justice, ought to have fair and judicial Hearing of all Parties, and sufficient Evidence Outward, of the Fact, before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be past; but true Judgment of Spirits, Angels, or Inward States, considered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly, without outward Evidence of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact (whether they be Good or Evil) this cannot be without a Spiritual Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Inward Sense, or Divine Revelation given by Christ Jesus, whereby both Right and Wrong Spirits and States have been Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, even <hi>Satan,</hi> when Transformed as an Angel of Light, and his Ministers, when transformed like the Ministers of Christ. And <hi>W. R. 1st part, pag.</hi> 2. himself grants, <hi>The Evidence of our heavenly Union to spring from that which neither the Carnal Eye, nor the Carnal
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58889:99"/>
Ear could be Witnesses of:</hi> And pag. 24. <hi>We who had believed in the Light of our Lord Jesus Christ, had the Evidence in our selves, that we were of the true Brotherhood, and Members of Christs Body.</hi> So that he has granted an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual Evidence in Spiritual Cases, which is higher than the outward.</p>
                  <p>But to the occasion of N. C'<hi>s</hi> Certificate, aforesaid, What kind of Discourse could be between him and <hi>G. F.</hi> that he could ground HIS CHARGE upon? (as <hi>W. R.</hi> calls it) Or what Discourse could they have that might any wayes seem (in <hi>N. C</hi>'s Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hention) to look like an Advice, to <hi>Buy his Tythe of Priest and Impropriator?</hi> for we are not willing to leave him under the suspicion of a designed Forgery in this Case, but rather in Charity, to impute it partly to the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Age, and Defect of Memory, that he has thus represented <hi>G. F.</hi> as having advised him to buy his Tythe, and that this said Certificate was prejudicially drawn from him so many years after that private Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he had with <hi>G. F.</hi> which he grounds it upon, as 'tis very possible and easie for an Aged Man's Memory to fail him, in such a Case, that is, in making a <hi>Prejudicial Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate</hi> or <hi>Charge,</hi> upon a private Discourse, many Years after the Discourse, as his against <hi>G. F.</hi> was; What then could be the Matter or Subject of that Discourse, which he might
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58889:100"/>
very likely be Mistaken in? Was there any thing said about Buying off Tythe on any account? To this we may cite <hi>G. F</hi>'s own Answer to <hi>W. R</hi>'s Queries, in a large Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, dated, the 20th of the 9th Moneth, 1678. in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I could hardly have believed that <hi>N. Crips</hi> would have done such a thing, as I told him, when I came to his House, that he did confess he had sent such a <hi>Certificate</hi> to <hi>Bristol</hi> to <hi>W. R.</hi> as I take it. I asked him, <hi>When it was that I should bid him buy off his Tythes, and what Year?</hi> he told me, <hi>He could not tell</hi>—he said it was in the Field, but could not tell what Year; then the thing came into my mind, what I said to him, his Son, and others, about twenty Years since, how that—<hi>H. Lower</hi> came from <hi>Cornwall</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and endeavoured to Convince several of the Parliament-men how they might ease the Nation of the grand Oppression of Tythe—and to buy off all the Impropriators Tythes, (the manner of the expedient for the Money to buy them off, we here omit) and this I might say would do very well, unto him and several others; but for him to turn this and say I advised him to buy off his Tythes, he doth me a great deal of wrong; and he told me then, it was his Principle to pay his Tythes to the Impropriators
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58889:100"/>
—I was sorry for him, that he neither writ nor spoke to me about it this twenty Years, I took it unkindly from him; and if he doth give forth an Hundred Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and <hi>W. R.</hi> spread them abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what I have here asserted, I shall not give Credit to them; none will that fear the Lord, that knows my Innocency, and the Falshood of thy Charges, &amp;c.</q> Thus far <hi>G. F.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all which it appears that this <hi>G. F</hi>'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerned something <hi>H. L.</hi> had to propound to the then Parliament, to make some Provision for the <hi>buying off the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators Tythes,</hi> and not to advise him or any perticular Person charged with those <hi>Tythes</hi> to buy them off, such a mistake does greatly alter the Case: And we may add, that whatever the private discourse was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>N. C.</hi> when in Friendship and Kindness, was it not very unfair and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly in <hi>N. C.</hi> to frame a <hi>Certificate</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon so many Years after against <hi>G. F.</hi> and not only so, but to put it into the Hands of <hi>W. R.</hi> an <hi>Adversary</hi> to <hi>G. F.</hi> and others, and then for <hi>W. R.</hi> to expose it in Print, as a Charge against <hi>G. F.</hi> to make him a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor, an Adviser to that in <hi>Private,</hi> which was contrary to his Testimony in <hi>Publick,</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> hath so plainly denyed, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58889:101"/>But <hi>N. C.</hi> we would ask thee a Question or two farther:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> Whether two Publick Friends in the Ministry, after a Meeting at <hi>Nailsworth,</hi> in the 6th Moneth, 1679. did not ask thee, <hi>Whether thou gavest thy Advice or Consent, that</hi> William Rogers <hi>should insert thy Certificate concerning</hi> George Fox, <hi>about buying of the Tythes, in his Paper or Letter which he sent to the Yearly Meeting before; and whether thou gavest</hi> William Rogers <hi>any order so to Publish it to the Nation, as he endeavoured in his Paper?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Whether thou didst not then give this Answer, viz. <hi>NO SURE; I gave no such Advice; I knew nothing of his so doing; he had no order from me, to spread it any further, than to produce it at</hi> Bristol, <hi>if there was occasion, when G. F. went down thither, I hearing that he then intended to proceed or give Testimony against</hi> J. S. <hi>and</hi> J. W. <hi>concerning Tythes, and I was desired to give that Certificate, only to produce then at</hi> Bristol, <hi>if there was such occasion, not expecting it should have gone any further?</hi> Canst thou deny this to be thy Answer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> We desire to know, who it was that desired thee to give that Certificate?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> Whether thou gavest any order to <hi>W. R.</hi> to put thy Certificate in Print against <hi>G. F?</hi> and whether or no thou dost now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his so doing?</p>
                  <p>And we do not find, that <hi>W. R.</hi> doth clear
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58889:101"/>
himself from the Censure of <hi>breaking Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> in his sending forth a Relation of some Passages discoursed on between himself and other Friends at <hi>Bristol,</hi> in the 12th Moneth, 1677. with his own and <hi>William Ford</hi>'s Name to it (Entituled, <hi>A brief Relation of some Passages happening among the People called</hi> Quakers <hi>at the City of</hi> Bristol, <hi>since the late coming of</hi> George Fox, George Whitehead <hi>and</hi> William Penn, <hi>in the 11th Moneth,</hi> 1677.) contrary to the Propositions and Agreement made between <hi>William Penn</hi> and himself, &amp;c. by his alledging, that in that Agreement, <hi>There is not a word intimating, that no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation should go forth; and that there was not one word of Covenant or Agreement, that any Person should be obliged not to send abroad a Narative, whether it might relate to all, any or either of the Meetings,</hi> part 5. pag. 15, &amp; 88.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he knows the Method was mutually agreed upon, for a <hi>Narative</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all that each Party thought fit to have written, and which should be finally agreed by both Persons, to be a true Record, Minute or Memorial of the Conference; and that any Friend present had the Liberty to speak his or her Mind; and that every such thing said by Friends on either side, if desired, might also be recorded,</hi> as more fully intimated in the first and third <hi>Propositions</hi> agreed upon, 5th part, pag. 10, 11. and that <hi>all things so agreed on to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58889:102"/>
be Recorded, should be subscribed by both Parties, and by, at least, six Credible Persons of each side,</hi> as in the second Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Now though this could not be done at the end of each Meeting, as was proposed, (for want of Time and Opportunity to read over and Correct what was done, for such mutual Subscription) yet neither the <hi>Agreement,</hi> nor the <hi>Intent</hi> of it gave any Liberty for one Party <hi>alone,</hi> without the other, to send out a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> of Passages relating to any of those Meetings, as <hi>W.

'Twere absurd, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Rules were agreed upon for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative

or Record, by mutual Consent and Subscription, and <hi>W.

And canst thou reasonably think, thou servest Truth's Interest by such kind of smiting at thy Brethren and Fellow-Servants, as thou hast formerly esteemed them? And did W. R.

                  <p>We look upon these unkind and bitter Passages and Insinuations to be very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, and as proceeding from a wrong Conception, and Birth of Cruel Jealousies, under the pretence of <hi>fear</hi> concerning many, and not from the Spirit of Christ; and the Construction made of some's Censuring some out of the Unity, for their Opposition (to

such Orders, or orderly proceedings, as they account good and wholsome) <hi>as the greatest Penalty and Persecution they can Inflict;</hi> and that they would Inflict greater, if they had but outward Power, this appears very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, even the same that our open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Adversaries have often Insinuated against us, and greatly tends to stir up Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution against us, as do also the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> WANTING NOTHING TO EFFECT HIS DESIGN BUT THE OUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD POWER TO CARRY. THEM ON TO KILL. Here, <hi>John,</hi> thou hast severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudged many, which we are assured, thou hast no Proof for, but thy own Jealousie. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how thy Friend and Advocate <hi>W.

Oh <hi>John!</hi> we are perswaded thou must meet with an Hour of Tribulation for this Prejudicial and Uncharitable Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Were ever worse things exposed in Print against us before? And wouldst thou be thus dealt by? We pray God to give thee a sight of the Danger of these things, and tender thy Heart unto Repentance, and a Return to thy first Love; for thou hast known
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58889:106"/>
better things than these thy Printed Letters bespeak; which if thou gavest way to the Printing them, thou wast not aware how they would (and assuredly do) make against thy Interest, and your Cause, which <hi>W. R.</hi> Pleads and Advocates for. And we would seriously ask, Whether such bitter Invectives and Infamies, cast upon G. F. and others, in thy Letters, do not rather shew forth the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Horns of the Dragon,</hi> than the <hi>Zeal</hi> of any Friends doth in testifying for <hi>good Order and Government in the Church of Christ,</hi> and against <hi>fleshly Liberty</hi> and <hi>loose Walking?</hi> which if any such have exceeded in their zeal, or their zeal at any time hath not been so prudently and warily mannaged (in thy or your account) as should have been; yet to judge them as so far possessed with the <hi>Wrath of the Dragon,</hi> as that by them he accuseth such <hi>as keep the Testimony of Jesus,</hi> with <hi>fleshly Living and loose Walking;</hi> this we think is very Hard and Uncharitable: and we pray thee consider these things.</p>
                  <p>And let it be observed also, that in <hi>W. R</hi>'s Letter to G. F. part 4. pag. 97. is this passage, viz. <hi>Therefore is the zeal of the Lord of Hosts kindled against that ungodly insinuating Spirit, that makes it its business to bespatter</hi> J.

                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which we must needs note, how
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58889:107"/>
Zealous he is for these two Persons, and what a great stress he layes upon them &amp; their Reputations; as if to write or speak what reflects upon them, might indanger the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Simple-hearted out of the Way; and why so? We may suppose 'tis because he thinks that many Simple-hearted have a good Opinion of them; though we would tell him, not so many since VV. R. became such a furious Advocate for them as before; a great many are offended at his Book, and at him for suffering it to come forth, and him to go on in their defence, without shewing publick and absolute dislike thereof. The truth on't is, whatever <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> may think of <hi>W.

                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 2dly, [<hi>The Apostle doth not say, what the will of the Church is, but what the Will of the Lord is.</hi>] This Parenthesis is to oppose the <hi>will of the Church</hi> to the <hi>Will of the Lord,</hi> and so render <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Church</hi> divided, but then he contradicts this Parenthesis in the very next Words, <hi>Submitting your selves one to another in the fear of God.</hi> Very well; and was not this the <hi>Will of the Church,</hi> so to submit in the fear of God? And could this be any other than in his Will? Doth the Church in the fear of God <hi>Will</hi> any other submission than Christ wills in his Church? No sure; Christ
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58889:112"/>
does not will one thing, and his Church in him another contrary: But to qualifie or mend the matter, <hi>W. R.</hi> (as one inwardly interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Attempts, but six Lines after in the same page) saith, <hi>I say</hi> [<hi>not the Church, but what the Will of the Lord is</hi>] <hi>yet hereby I would not be understood to render Christ and his Church divided; but rather to shew that his Will, who cannot Err, is a surer Foundation to build upon, than the Wills of those, who, if they depart from Christ their Rock, may Err.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhich we'l readily grant him; but 'tis nothing to purpose; 'twill not serve his turn for his opposing the <hi>Will</hi> of the Church (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided from Christ) to his <hi>Will,</hi> but only to signifie, that his meaning is, that the <hi>Will</hi> of the Lord, who cannot Err, is a surer Foundation to build upon, than the <hi>Wills</hi> of those who depart from Christ their Rock. But here he has varied from the <hi>Will</hi> of the Church, as undivided from Christ, to the <hi>wills</hi> of those, who (if they depart from Christ) may Err. How Impertinent to his purpose is this! If they depart from Christ their Rock, they Unchurch themselves, and cease to be his Church. But then, how if they do not depart from Christ? what then? (which is the Case we aim at, and he should have kept to, then they are his Church, and in his Will; and what they will and command (as in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with him) is Christ's will and command,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58889:112"/>
and if so, then <hi>W. R's</hi> Parenthesis before (on the Text, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 17, 21.) is wholly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and Improper (and his Inference remote and forreign thereto) yea, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to his desiring not to be understood, to render Christ and his Church divided. Thus he sayes and unsayes; he is off and on; he marrs, and he mends; he mends, and he marrs; he darkens Counsel with his many VVindings, Twistings, and Tossings.</p>

                  <p>It may not be amiss to note what Comparison <hi>W. R.</hi> makes between G. F. and J. W. on the Character he gives of each; the Character <hi>W. R.</hi> gives <hi>J.

Part 4. pag. 63, 64. To all which we say, though we grant all these commendable in their places, and do not understand that he was charged in these things with a <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Lofty Spirit;</hi> yet we must tell <hi>W. R.</hi> he pleads but Impertinently, as well as Pharisaically, in these Instances for <hi>J. W.</hi> unless it be a certain Proof that every man is of a <hi>Lowly Humble Spirit,</hi> that has but an Estate of 15 <hi>l.</hi> or 20 <hi>l.</hi> per annum, <hi>and sometimes goes to Plough, and other Bodily Exercise, &amp;c.</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58889:115"/>
as he pleads for J. W.) and can, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Education,</hi> be contented with <hi>indifferent mean Dyet.</hi> On the other hand <hi>W. R.</hi> shews his Spight and Contempt against <hi>G. F.</hi> to prove him a man of a <hi>High and Lofty Spirit,</hi> Reflecting on his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Trade of a <hi>Poor Shoemaker,</hi> and of <hi>mean</hi>

                        <hi>Qu.</hi> Did W. R. know his <hi>Parentage?</hi> how many degrees were they meaner than his own? However, he would have us all know, what an <hi>Industrous Merchant</hi> he is, and how able to <hi>assist others;</hi> thus he has divulged his own Fame in Print, part 5. pag. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Parentage</hi> (as his slight Language is) Reflecting also <hi>on his Poor Relations,</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that of late Years, <hi>their Outward Man wanted some Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Comfort with necessary Food, Rayment,</hi> &amp;c. as in Part 5. pag. 49. By all which he endeavours to make G. F. as contemptible as he can; but we never heard such an Account before of those Relations; this appears meer Malice: And what cause have any to believe him in it? We may wonder when-ever any of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations did complain to W. R. of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency or Poverty! He also Reflects upon <hi>G. F.</hi> his <hi>Marriage,</hi> and his <hi>Travelling with a Man,</hi> and his <hi>Enjoyment of things Lawful in the Creation, and necessary for the Ease of the Body, and Pleasure of the Pallet</hi> [Thus our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors have falsly upbraided us when we lay

They that fear God, had need to have a care, how they eat and drink at his Table, or at any of theirs that own his Book, lest he upbraid them with it in Print.</note> 
                     <hi>often free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making use of those things when to be had—so far</hi> (saith he) <hi>as we can understand,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot but take notice how Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously and Basely this man treats G. F. and what Beggarly, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Stuff he is willing to make use of, to cast an Odium and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon him.</p>
                  <p>He addeth this Character of J. W. viz. <hi>He takes not upon him to give forth an Outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for the Children of Light to walk by.</hi> Is not this a manifest Untruth? Was there no <hi>Outward Directory</hi> in that Paper which <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J.

                     <q>That they who are not chosen by the Churches, do cease meddling about the Churches concerns; and that all cease meddling for time to come, (in your Work) who are not concerned, and only keep unto their own, whether it be of God given unto them, or of outward things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind to offer them, and <hi>SO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PART.</hi>

But touching G. F. how Silily and Impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth W. R. argue, to prove him of a High and Lofty Spirit? though <hi>G. F.</hi> saith, <hi>He esteems W. R's Reproaches great Riches:</hi> and we do not believe, that he is or will be (or has any cause to be) asham'd either of his <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Parentage;</hi> but rather Magnifies the Power and Wisdom of God, according to his antient Testimony, in raising up poor honest Trades-men to be Ministers of the Gospel, Fishers of men, &amp;c. Again, we do not understand, that G. F'<hi>s</hi> desiring J. S. and J. W. to come to him at his House (in order to end Differences) doth prove him a man of a high and lofty Spirit; for G. F. was then in Bodily Weakness, unfit to come to them, and his end was for Peace (as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand) which no wayes tends to prove the Charge against him.

Aquired, but they seem to us to be greatly, clouded and perverted by that <hi>Lofty, Proud Contemning</hi> and <hi>Tempestuous Spirit</hi> that has entred him, and puft him up, so much in Disdain against others: You that are his Friends and Relations, pray Counsel him to lay aside his <hi>Spiritual Pride and Contempt;</hi> for it is hateful to all Lowly-minded and Serious Souls, who are truly Conscientious towards God.</p>

                  <p>W.

—<hi>Which occasioned me immediately to take care that my Mind might be communicated to</hi> Nicholas Lucas, <hi>who thereupon—acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> William Mead, That their desire, that I would give <hi>G.

Account of <hi>William Mead</hi>'s Engaging on <hi>G. F's</hi> behalf, for his giving W. R. a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but W. R. would not accept of his Security in that Case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Matter was more particularly thus,</hi> viz. <q>
                           <hi>William Mead</hi> understanding that <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Lucas</hi> and <hi>John Barnard</hi> were concerned on <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s behalf, for the bringing forth of his Book in Print, he asked them the reason, <hi>Why they would bring forth such a Book (as he heard it was?)</hi> They told him, <hi>That</hi> George Fox <hi>would not give</hi> W. R. <hi>a Meeting. William Mead</hi> replyed, <hi>That he did believe, that</hi> G. F. <hi>would not decline giving him a Meeting. Nicholas Lucas</hi> asked him, <hi>If he would Engage he should give him a Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? William Mead</hi> told him, <hi>'Twas not Proper so to engage, till he had spoken with</hi> G. F. <hi>first.</hi> VVhereupon <hi>William</hi> forthwith went and spake with <hi>G. F.</hi> about it, who very freely and readily answered, <hi>That if</hi> William Rogers <hi>desired it, he would meet him, in his own way, before Persons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen on each side, provided, he came within a certain time, while he staid in or about the City.</hi> VVith which Answer, the very next day on the Exchange, <hi>William Mead</hi> acquainted <hi>Nicholas Lucas,</hi> then adding, <hi>That he now would Engage on</hi> G.

                           <pb n="257" facs="tcp:58889:143"/>
VVhereupon <hi>Nicholas Lucas</hi> seemed to be satisfied, and said, <hi>He would stay the coming forth of the Book;</hi> and said, <hi>He would write to</hi> VVilliam Rogers <hi>about it.</hi> Some time after, <hi>Nicholas Lucas</hi> meeting <hi>William Mead</hi> upon the Exchange, told him, <hi>He had writ to</hi> VVilliam Rogers, <hi>and received his Answer, which was, THAT HE WOULD HAVE IT UNDER</hi> GEORGE FOX <hi>HIS HAND. William Mead</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with again spake with G. F. about it, who said, <hi>He mattered not the giving it under his Hand; but that he was sensible, they would make an ill use of it in Print;</hi> for which very cause only, he forbore giving it under his hand; but did not refuse giving <hi>W. R.</hi> a Meeting. However, then <hi>William Mead</hi> did proffer very earnestly to Engage on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of G. F. for his certain giving <hi>W.

               </p>
               <p>Part 2. pag. 64, 65. <hi>The Author to the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>tell us,</hi> That Jesus is the Author and Finisher of our Faith: <hi>No doubt, this was not a work done in a Moment or Twinckling of an Eye; for though he is the Authour &amp; Object of every true</hi> Christian Faith, <hi>yet we learn from the holy Scriptures, that such as believed, that Jesus was the Lord, stood in need of many Exhortations, Reproofs and Instructions, to build them up in the most holy Faith; and all this may be attributed to Christ, the Author thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Part 3. pag. 34. <hi>The Apostles Labours were to establish the Churches in the Faith, and in the Power, having them so established to be in the Practice of that Form which the Power either had or should lead them into; and therefore the Apostle might well say,</hi> Be ye not unwise, but understanding what the VVill of the Lord is; submitting your selves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
               <p>Part 3. pag. 41. <hi>If Differences arise between Brother and Brother, I do conclude, that going to Law before Unbelievers, is an Indication that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58889:145"/>
one or both are departed from the Truth; and that it is the Duty of such who are at variance, to request such Brethren as are skilled in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching which they differ, to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Case, and then of a willing and ready Mind (and not as by constraint) to submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Determination; and that it ought to be as an incumbant Duty on the Members of Christs Church, to be watching over one another, so as that by wholsom Counsel, Admonition, and sound Doctrine, all Variance, Strife, Emulation, Rents and Divisions, both in relation to Temporal, as well as Spiritual Matters, may, as much as in them lies, be kept out from amongst the Members of Christs Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Part 3. pag. 23. <hi>Not that I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that its not necessary to be in the Exercise of outward Order, with respect to that Gospel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline which becomes the Church of Christ</hi>—Pag. 24. <hi>The Principle of Truth in these latter dayes hath and may further lead into the Practice of outward Order in Discipline, with relation to the Church of Christ.</hi> [This is a very fair Confession in words, to the Overthrow of much of his Book.]</p>
               <p>Part 4. pag. 38. <hi>John Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>John Story</hi> their Testimony, viz. <hi>That inward Sence and heavenly Understanding we have received from God, hath and yet doth confirm us in this Judgment, That 'tis not agreeable with the Line of Truth, to oppose others in the Exercise and

               <p>Part 4. pag. 24. <hi>As perticular Members are become Marryed unto Christ, and having all fellowship each with other in the Spirit; those who are such, ought to demean themselves each towards other full of Love, Charity, Bowels of Compassion, Long-suffering, Forbearance, Meekness, Humility, Patience, Gentleness, and all other Virtues that are the Fruits of the Spirit of God.</hi> [A fair Acknowledgment, good Words; but these Virtues and Fruits are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanting in <hi>W.

               <head>A Postscript, Partly by way of Question, and partly some Friends Sence on <hi>W. R</hi>'s way of Writing.</head>
               <p>SEeing <hi>William Rogers</hi> has taken so much occasion at the Printed Epistle of two Sheets, by <hi>Anne White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> and <hi>Mary Elson,</hi> as the Principal Instance for his proceeding to Print and Publish his Book, the Question is, Whether some of Party with <hi>William Rogers</hi> did not publish several Parts of his Book to divers Persons, whilst it was designed to be published by single Parts, and before the said Epistle by <hi>Anne Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Mary Elson</hi> was writ or designed for the Press? And whether <hi>William Rogers</hi> did not assent or give way to their so doing? He inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reader, <hi>That though the five Parts of his Treatise be bound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet 'twas once designed, that they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58889:147"/>
should be also published by single Parts.</hi> The Question still is, If some of those Parts were not published in single Parts, as before?</p>
               <p>Let <hi>William Rogers</hi> or any of his Party deny it if they can; And was not this a Publication in Print, every one of his five Parts being designed for a single Book, as well as to be Bound together in one Volumn?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, as he saith, <hi>That some things</hi> (he should have said many things) <hi>are often inserted, and the wording of other things not so Proper and Concise as might be,</hi> Pref. Cond. For indeed many things are often inserted, and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as well as Impertinently, reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after a tedious manner, and in a perplexed perverse way. The Stile and Method is not Compendious nor Succinct, nor yet plain or easie to be understood by Persons unacquainted with his Knotty and Fallacious way of Writing, and long deviating Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis; much of it looks asquint and with two Faces; its writ as by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son upon various Reserves and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58889:147"/>
to save his Head from an expected Blow. It appears to be no Simple or Innocent way of Writing, or clear Oratory; 'tis neither pleasant in the Manner, nor in the Matter, to a Clear, Ingenuous or Tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: It makes a show and flourish of Conscience, Reason and Religion, but appears void of all, and much of it but like a HOCUS POCUS, or LEGER DEMAIN, upon a strict and clear Inspection with the Light of Truth, into the matter and manner of it.</p>

               <p>WHereas there is a false Jealousie begot in some of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and Opposers, <hi>That we would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose things upon them (that have not Sence, do not See, and have not Faith in them) to act without Faith, in a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> which is utterly false, and against our Principle, to Impose any thing upon Senceless, Blind and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less People.</p>
               <p>And now, all you that have opposed us without Sence, Sight and Faith, your Senceless, Blind and Faithless Opposition hath not pleased God; for without Faith none can please God; and where there is Faith, there is Sence and Sight; and God never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58889:148"/>
the BLIND for a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRIFICE, neither do his Faithful Spiritual People.</p>
               <p>And therefore we say and declare to all our Opposers, Let them return to the Light, Spirit, Truth and Grace, which at first convinced them, and judge down the contrary, and in that we can receive them. And let them call in all their Papers, and the Book which they have given forth in Print, since they went out from their Unity with Friends in the Spirit of God, and come again to it, and with it condemn and judge all that they have given forth (tending to Division) since they went out from the Spiritual Union and Fellowship; and let <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> take out their Names from the Paper of Separation, as also the rest of them that are left behind in the Seperation; in which Paper they say, <q>That some of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and some amongst themselves, not chosen by the Churches, have
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58889:149"/>
come and intermeddled with them, and with their Business, and usurped Authority over them, whom they never gave Power to.</q> So that if they (who yet remain in the Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will burn this Paper <note n="*" place="margin">Not because it contains a Form rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but because it hath in it such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted kind of Terms and Prescriptions as could not be received in the Universal Spirit of Christ, or Unity thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it tended to a Separation, as strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stood upon by the Proposers and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and testifie against that Spirit that gave it forth, and not pretend themselves to give People Power (in the Churches Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) calling others, <hi>Usurpers of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whom they have not given Power to,</hi> and so to set up mans Power, to do Business in the Church of God; and if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this Power of their own, &amp; leave every Man and Woman to the Light, Grace and Truth, Spirit and Gospel, which they have from Christ Jesus, in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58889:149"/>
which all receive Christ Jesus, their Lord from Heaven, who gives Power to become his Sons and Daughters, and to meet in his Power; in this Light, Grace and Truth, Spirit and Power, which is received from Christ, in which is our Order and Fellowship; we say, as we feel them come into this, we can receive them, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>We are Men of Peace, and are in the Peaceable Gospel, and in the Kingdom of Peace, and would have all Mankind come into Peace, the Covenant of Peace, Grace, Light and Life; and also we would have these return again, that have been Opposers, to come to the Spirit and Gospel of Jesus, that they are gone from, that in it we might have Peace with them; without it, is not the Eternal Peace.</p>
               <p>And as we are concerned to bring to Truth, such as were never convinced,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58889:150"/>
so we Travel for their Return to Truth, that are gone from it, that they may come again to that which did at first convince them of it.</p>
