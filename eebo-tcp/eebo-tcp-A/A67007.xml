            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving in the Essay it self given some Intimation both of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it, and the Reasons which induced me to make it publick, I shall not here keep the <hi>Reader</hi> in suspense much longer than only while I acquaint him that, proposing to draw a considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Materials into so narrow a Compass that they might all be contained in this small Volume, I was obliged to be very brief and concise. And therefore, as Pieces of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niature, Sculpture, or other Workmanship in little, must be allowed a closer Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reatise will require some Care and Application in the Perusal.</p>
            <p>Not but that I have endeavoured, as far as was practicable in so little room, so
<pb facs="tcp:99549:4"/>
to dispose and order things, by interwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the Assertions some of the Proofs whereon they depend, and occasionally scattering several of the more important Observations throughout the Work, that it will be no very hard Task for any one to discover the main Grounds whereon all that I here advance is founded.</p>
            <p>That this may be the more clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, I shall beg leave to illustrate it by one or two Instances. It will perhaps at first sight seem very strange, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most shock an ordinary <hi>Reader</hi> to find me asserting, as I do, that the whole Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe was taken all to pieces and dissolved at the Deluge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Particles of Stone, Marble, and all other solid Fossils dissevered, taken up into the Water, and there sustained together with Sea-shells and other Animal and Vegetable Bodies: and that the present Earth consists, and was formed out of that promiscuous Mass of Sand, Earth, Shells, and the rest,
<pb facs="tcp:99549:4"/>
falling down again, and subsiding from the Water. But whoever shall duely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what I elsewhere lay down, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are vast Multitudes of Shells, and other Marine Bodies, found at this day incorporated with and lodged in all sorts of Stone, in Marble, in Chalk, and to be short, in all the other ordinary Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Globe which is close and compact enough to preserve them: that these are found thus reposited amongst this Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Matter from near the Surface of the Earth downwards to the greatest Depth we ever dig or lay it open, and this in all Parts of it quite round the Globe: that the said terrestrial Matter is disposed into <hi>Strata</hi> or Layers, placed one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in like manner as any earthy Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, setling down from a Fluid in great quantity, will naturally be: that these Marine Bodies are now found lodged in those Strata according to the Order of their Gravity, those which are heaviest lying
<pb facs="tcp:99549:5"/>
deepest in the Earth, and the lighter sorts (when there are any such in the same place) shallower or nearer to the Surface: and both those and these amongst terrestrial Matter which is of the same specifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity that they are, the heavier Shells in Stone, the lighter in Chalk, and so of the rest; I say, whoever shall but rightly weigh all this, he'll have no need to go further for Proof that the Earth was actually so dissolved, and afterwards framed a-new, in such manner as I have set forth. And if to this he shall think fit to add the other Arguments of the same Thing which he will meet with in their Place, they also will I hope not fail of doing their Part in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing him still more of the Truth and Certainty of this Matter.</p>
            <p>The other Instance I make choice of shall be of the Universality of the Deluge, which is another Proposition that I insist upon. And for this, let but the Reader please to consider, what I deliver from authentick
<pb facs="tcp:99549:5"/>
Relations, that the marine Bodies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said are found in all Parts of the known World, as well in <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> as in <hi>Asia,</hi> and this even to the very tops of the highest Mountains; and then I think he cannot reasonably doubt of the Proposition: but more especially if hereunto he shall joyn what I offer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Great Abyss, and thence learns that there is at this day resident, in that huge Conceptacle, Water enough to effect such a Deluge, to drown the whole Globe, and lay all, even the highest Mountains under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if he should be at a loss to know how I got such Notice of that subterranean Reservatory, as to enable me to make a Computation of the Quantity of Water now conceal'd therein, if he carefully peruse the Propositions concerning Earthquakes, and some others in the Third Part, he cannot but discover at least some of the ways whereby I got light thereinto: and at the same time find why it is that I am so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="tcp:99549:6"/>
in relating the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Earthquakes, and dwell so long upon that Subject in this shorter Work.</p>
            <p>These I intend for Example and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Reader</hi> how he may satisfie himself in any of the other Heads. 'Tis impossible for me to foresee the Difficulties and Haesitations of every one: they will be more or fewer, according to the Capacity of each Peruser, and as his Penetration and Insight into Nature is greater or less. They who have Attention enough to take in the intire Platform as here laid down: who see the Chain which runs through the whole: and can pick up and bear in mind the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and Proofs here and there as they lie, and then confer them with the Propositions, will discern (in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) how these Propositions flow from them: but they who cannot so easily do this must be intreated to have a little patience, untill the Thing be further unfolded, and more amply and plainly made out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99549:6"/>A few Advances there are in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers, tending to assert the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence and Agency of Providence in the Natural World: as also to evince the Fidelity and Exactness of the Mosaick Narrative of the Creation, and of the Deluge. Which 'tis not improbable but some may be apt to stumble at, and think strange that in a Physical Discourse as this is, I should intermeddle with Matters of that kind. But I may very safely say, that, as to the former, I have not entered farther into it than meerly I was lead by the necessity of my Subject: nor could I have done less than I have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the most apparent Injury and Injustice to Truth. And for <hi>Moses,</hi> he having given an Account of some Things which I here treat of, I was bound to allow him the same Plea that I do other Writers, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he hath delivered. In order to this I set aside every thing that might byass my Mind, over-awe, or mislead me in the
<pb facs="tcp:99549:7"/>
Scrutiny, and therefore have regard to him here only as an Historian. I freely bring what he hath related to the Test, comparing it with Things as now they stand: and finding his Account to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually true, I fairly declare what I find; wherein I do him but simply Right, and only the same that I would to a common Historian, to <hi>Berosus</hi> or <hi>Manetho,</hi> to <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi> on like occasion.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS Upon which this DISCOURSE Is Founded.</head>
            <p>FROM a long train of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the World is at length convinc'd, that Observations are the only sure Grounds whereon to build a lasting and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Philosophy. All Parties are so far agreed upon this matter, that it seems to be now the common sense of Mankind.</p>
            <p>For which reason, I shall in the Work before me, give my self up to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99549:9"/>
be guided wholly by <hi>Matter of Fact</hi>; as intending to steer that course which is thus agreed of all hands to be the best and surest: and not to offer any thing but what hath due warrant from Observations; and those both careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, and faithfully related.</p>
            <p>And that each Reader may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform himself, not only of what sort my present Observations are, but see in what manner also, and with what kind of Accuracy they were made, 'twill be convenient to give some light into that matter, and to begin with an Account of them; whereby he may be enabled to judge how far they may be relyed upon, and what measure of Assent the Propositions which I draw from them may claim.</p>
            <p>But before I go any farther, I ought to put in a Caution, that an ample and prolix Relation either of the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themselves, or of the Deductions from them, is not to be expected here. I design <hi>this</hi> but for a Sample of what I hope, in good time, more fully to discuss and make out: proposing no more in this Treatise, than only, in a few plain words, to deliver my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on certain Heads of Natural
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99549:9"/>
History, with some of the Reasons and Grounds of them, in order to give somewhat of present Satisfaction to the Curiosity and Demands of some of my Friends.</p>
            <p>The Observations I speak of were all made in <hi>England</hi>; the far greatest part whereof I travelled over on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to make them: professedly search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all places as I pass'd along, and taking a careful and exact view of <hi>Things</hi> on all hands as they presented, in order to inform my self of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition of the Earth, and all Bodies contained in it, as far as either Grotto's, or other Natural Caverns, or Mines, Quarries, Colepits, and the like, let me into it, and displayed to sight the interiour Parts of it; not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting, in the mean time, the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour or surface, and such Productions of it as any where occurred, Plants, Insects, Sea, River, and Land Shells; and, in a word, whatever either the Vegetable or Animal World afforded.</p>
            <p>Nor did I confine these Observations to Land, or the Terrestrial Parts of the Globe only, but extended them to the Fluids of it likewise, as well those within it, the Water of Mines, of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99549:10"/>
Grotto's, and other such like Recesses, as those upon the surface of it, the Sea, Rivers, and Springs.</p>
            <p>My principal Intention indeed was to get as compleat and satisfactory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the whole Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as I could possibly obtain. To which end, I made strict enquiry wherever I came, and laid out for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all Places where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the Earth were laid open, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Nature (if I may so say) or by Art, and humane Industry. And wheresoever I had notice of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable natural Spelunca or Grotto; any digging for Wells of Water, or for Earths, Clays, Marle, Sand, Gravel, Chalk, Cole, Stone, Marble, Ores of Metals, or the like; I forthwith had recourse thereunto: and taking a just account of every observable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Earth, Stone, Metal, or other Matter, from the Surface quite down to the bottom of the Pit, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it carefully into a Journal, which I carry'd along with me for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And so passing on from Place to Place, I <hi>noted</hi> whatever I found me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in each particular Pit, Quarry, or Mine: and 'tis out of these <hi>Notes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99549:10"/>
that my Observations are compiled.</p>
            <p>After I had finish'd these Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and was returned back to this City, such were the Commotions which had then so unhappily invaded <hi>Europe,</hi> that I saw I must necessarily desist here, and sit down (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at least) with what I had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done; having little prospect of an opportunity of carrying on these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations any farther, or of going beyond Seas, to consider the state of the Earth, and of all sorts of Fossils, in more distant Countries.</p>
            <p>But to supply, as far as possible, that Defect, I made Application to Persons who had already travelled, and I knew were of such <hi>Integrity,</hi> that they would not impose uncertain or false Relations upon me: as also of so much <hi>Curiosity</hi> as to be likely to give me some tolerable insight into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>these things</hi> in Foreign Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I likewise drew up a <hi>List</hi> of <hi>Quaeries</hi> upon this Subject; which I dispatch'd into all parts of the World, far and near, wherever either I my self, or any of my Acquaintance, had any Friend resident to transmit those <hi>Quaeries</hi> unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99549:11"/>The Result of this was, that in time I was abundantly assured, that the Circumstances of <hi>these Things</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Countries were much the same with those of ours <hi>here</hi>: that the Stone, and other terrestrial Matter, in <hi>France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> was distinguished into <hi>Strata,</hi> or Layers, as it is in <hi>England:</hi> that those <hi>Strata</hi> were divided by parallel Fissures: that there were enclosed in the Stone, and all the other denser kinds of terrestrial Matter, great numbers of Shells, and other Productions of the Sea, in the same manner as in that of this Island. To be short, by the same means I got sufficient intelligence that <hi>these Things</hi> were found in like manner in <hi>Barbary,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Guiney,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Africa</hi>; in <hi>Arabia, Syria, Persia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar, China,</hi> and other <hi>Asiatick</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; in <hi>Iamaica, Barbadoes, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, New-England, Brasil, Peru,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>America.</hi> But I reserve the more <hi>particular Relation</hi> hereof to its proper place.</p>
            <p>So that though my own Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were confined to <hi>England,</hi> yet by this means I was made acquainted with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99549:11"/>
the state of <hi>these Bodies</hi> in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; even in almost all parts of the World wherewith the <hi>English</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Commerce or Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and learn'd from all hands, that the state of them <hi>there</hi> was conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of ours <hi>here,</hi> in the main, and as far as I shall lay any stress upon it in my Conclusions; which indeed are not built upon any Niceties, or solitary and uncommon Appearances, but on the most simple and obvious Circumstances of these terrestrial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>As to the Certainty and Accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Observations, thus much may modestly and very truly be said, that I do not offer any one before I had first thoroughly and clearly informed my self in all material Circumstances of it, and had opportunity of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in more places than one, that I might be satisfied there was nothing casual or contingent in any of those Circumstances. This will not be thought an over-great exactness, or any thing more than was needful, by <hi>those</hi> who have noted how much Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy hath suffered by the neglect and oversight of some Naturalists in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99549:12"/>
this respect. A transient and perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Examination of things, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads Men into considerable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, which a more correct and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Scrutiny would have detected and avoided. The truth is, I have been the more scrupulous and wary in regard the Inferences drawn from these Observations are of some importance: 'twas but necessary that the Foundation should be firm, when a Superstructure of Bulk and Weight was to be raised upon it. And therefore I advance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from any Observation that was not made with this Caution, and that any Man may not, as well as my self, without any great pains, inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the truth of: And as long as the next Cole-pit, or Mine, the next Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Chalk-pit, will give abundant Attestation to what I write, <hi>these</hi> are so ready and obvious in almost all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I need not be any where far to seek for a Compurgator; and to these I may very safely appeal.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Observations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therefore, there cannot well arise any doubt but what may be easily satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: And what I propose in this Essay being founded upon these Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99549:12"/>
every Reader will be judge of the truth and probability of it, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which I do so propose natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows from them or not.</p>
            <p>I shall distribute <hi>them</hi> into two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Classes or Sections, whereof the <hi>former</hi> will comprehend my Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon all the Terrestrial Matter that is naturally <hi>disposed into Layers,</hi> or <hi>Strata</hi>; such as our common Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, Marble, Cole, Chalk, all sorts of Earth, Marle, Clay, Sand, Gravel, with some others.</p>
            <p>Of this various Matter, thus formed into <hi>Strata,</hi> the far greatest part of the Terrestrial Globe consists, from its Surface downwards to the greatest depth we ever dig or mine. And it is upon my Observations on <hi>this</hi> that I have grounded all my general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions concerning the Earth; all that relate to its Form; all that relate to the <hi>Vniversal</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Deluges; in a word, all that relate to the several Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes and Alterations that it hath yet undergone. Nay, upon the same Observations I have also founded seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conclusions touching Metalls, Spar, and other Minerals, which are found lodged either in these <hi>Strata,</hi> amongst
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99549:13"/>
the Sand, Chalk, Earth, and the rest; or in the perpendicular Intervals of the <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone, Marble, or other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Matter.</p>
            <p>For upon the <hi>particular</hi> Observations on the said Metallick and Mineral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (which are the Subjects of the <hi>second</hi> Section,) I have not founded any thing but what purely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerns the Natural History of those Bodies.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore to the Account of my Observations upon Sand-stone. And in <hi>these,</hi> though I do not neglect to note the several Kinds or Varieties of it: Free-stone, Ragg-stone, Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and the rest: the different Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Solidity, of each: as also its Colour, Texture, and the peculiar matter which constitutes it: yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self more strictly to consider the manner how 'tis disposed in the Earth: the <hi>Strata,</hi> into which, by means of <hi>horizontal</hi> 
               <note n="‖" rend="inter">
                  <hi>I call those Fissures, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne into Strata,</hi> Horizontal <hi>ones; and those which intersect these</hi> Perpendicular: <hi>not so much with respect to the</hi> present <hi>site of the Strata, which (as I shall shew) is altered in many places, as to its</hi> original <hi>situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; concerning which, see</hi> Part 2. Consect. 5.</note> and parallel Fissures, it is divided: the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Number of these <hi>Strata</hi>: their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in respect of the Horizon: the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99549:13"/>
Thickness, Depth, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of each: the Interruptions of the <hi>Strata,</hi> I mean the <hi>perpendicular</hi> ‖ Fissures, which intersect the horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ones: the different Capacity or Largeness of these perpendicular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals: their Distances from each other: and the Spar, and other Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Metallick Matter, usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
            <p>But, because I saw that Deductions of considerable import and consequence might be drawn from them, I have with great Care and Intention obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Condition of such heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, which I found immersed and included in the mass of this Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; particularly the Shells of Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Muscles, Scallopes, Cockles, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwinkles, and very many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Productions. I have, I say, very diligently noted all Circumstances of these Shells: the vast Numbers of them; the several kinds that are thus lodged in the substance of the Stone: the Order and Manner of their position in it: the several Depths at which they are found: the Matter which they contain in them, and wherewith their Cavities are usually filled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99549:14"/>These Observations about Stone are succeeded by others, of like nature, concerning Marble, Cole, and Chalk: their Fissures: the Situation of their <hi>Strata:</hi> the Shells, and other heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies lodged therein.</p>
            <p>In the next place, those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Marle, Clay, the several kinds of Earth, Sand, Gravel, and some other Fossils: the Shells and other like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, lodged in their <hi>Strata:</hi> the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those <hi>Strata</hi>: their Order; their Distinctions from each other, by the difference of the Matter of each, and by its different Consistence and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the <hi>Strata</hi> of these laxer kinds of Matter being not ordinarily divided from each other by interposition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal Fissures; as those of Stone, and such other solid Matter, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are.</p>
            <p>And lastly, those which relate to the upper or outmost <hi>Stratum</hi> of all: I mean that blackish Layer of Earth or Mould which is called by some <hi>Garden-Earth,</hi> by others <hi>Vnder-turf Earth,</hi> wherewith the Terrestrial Globe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every where invested, unless it be disturbed, or flung off by rains, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, plowing, or some other external
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99549:14"/>
force; insomuch, that whatsoever lies deeper, or underneath, whether Stone, Marble, Chalk, Gravel, or whatever else, this <hi>Stratum</hi> is still expanded at top of all; serving, as it were, for a common Integument to the rest: and being (as shall be shewn in due place) the Seminary or Promptuary that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth forth Matter for the formation and increment of Animal and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bodies; and into which all of them successively are again finally returned.</p>
            <p>The Observations being thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, my next step should have been to have proposed the Deductions from them; to have determined how these Sea-shells were brought to Land, and how they became interr'd in the bowels of the Earth, in the manner described in those Observations. But before I could proceed any farther to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>that,</hi> I found my self necessarily obliged to take off a difficulty not long since started 'by some learned Men, who suspect that these Shells are not real; that they were never bred at Sea; but are all of Terrestial Original, being meer Stones, though they bear a resemblance of Shells, and formed, in the places where they are now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99549:15"/>
found, by a kind of Lusus of Nature, in imitation of Shells.</p>
            <p>How nearly I am concerned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Obstacle, before I pass on any farther to the prosecution of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, any one may presently see. For to go about to enquire at what time, and by what means these Shells were conveyed out of the Sea to dry Land, when a Doubt hath been moved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are Shells or not, or ever belonged to the Sea, without first clearing this Matter, and putting it quite out of doubt; would be sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and absurd. In order therefore unto this, I premise</p>
            <div type="dissertation">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99549:15"/>
               <head>A Dissertation concerning Shells and other marine Bodies, found at Land; Proving that they were originally generated and formed at Sea: that they are the real spoils of once living Animals: and not Stones, or natural Fossils, as some late Learned Men have thought.</head>
               <p>I Shall be the more brief and sparing in my Extract of this Dissertation, in regard that coming on thus in order before the other Parts of this Work, it will it self, of course, see the Light somewhat sooner than they, any of them will. For which reason, I shall at present only say thus much of it in general; that <hi>therein</hi> I first fairly lay before the Reader the Arguments that have been urged by these Gentlemen to perswade us that these Bodies are mere Mineral Substances; and having detected the insufficiency of them, by evincing from the most plain and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Reason, how far they are from being conclusive, and how much they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99549:16"/>
fall short of proving what they are alledged for; I then proceed to lay down my own, and offer those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which have induced me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that these are the very <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Animals, and all owing to the Sea.</p>
               <p>I would not be thought to insinuate that the Opinion of these Gentlemen carries no shew of Truth, nor umbrage of Reason of its side. 'Tis not to be supposed, that Persons of their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Abilities would ever have espoused it, were it not in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure plausible: and had not at least a fair appearance of probability. The very finding these Bodies included in Stone, and lodged in the Earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Minerals, was alone enough to move a Suspicion that <hi>these</hi> were Minerals too: the finding them even to the very bottom of Quarries and Mines: in the most retired and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Parts</hi> of the most firm and solid Rocks: in the deepest bowels of the Earth, as well as upon the surface of it: upon the tops of even the highest Hills and Mountains, as well as in the Valleys and Plains: and this not in this or that Province only, not only in one or two Fields, but almost every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99549:16"/>
in all Countries and Quarters of the Globe, wherever there is any digging for Marble, for Stone, for Chalk, or any other Terrestrial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is so compact as to fence off external Injuries, and shield them from Decay and Rottenness.
<hi>This,</hi> together with their <q>being lodged in company of the Belemnites, Selenites,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasits, Flints, and other like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which were incontestibly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fossils, and, as <hi>they</hi> supposed, in the <hi>place of their formation,</hi>
                  </q> was enough to stagger a Spectator, and make him ready to entertain a belief that <hi>these were so</hi> too. 'Tis a <hi>Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> so surprizing and extraordinary, that 'tis not strange that a Man should scarcely credit his very Senses in the case: that he should more readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to believe that they were Minerals, as the Belemnites, and the others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, are: or indeed almost any thing else rather than Sea-shells; especially in such Multitudes, and in places so unlikely: so deep in the Earth, and far from the Sea, as these are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found.</p>
               <p>Nor was this, as indeed they tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> us, the only difficulty these worthy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99549:17"/>
Persons had to surmount;
<q>They found, together with these, certain Bodies that bore the shape and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Cockles, Muscles, and other Shells, which yet were <hi>not really such</hi>; but consisted intirely, some of them, of Sand-stone: others of Flint, and others of Spar: or some other kind of Mineral Matter.</q>

<q>That were in all appearance Shells: that were of the same bigness, figure, and texture, with the common Echini, Scallops, and Perewinkles; but had notwithstanding Flint, Native-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Spar, Iron-Ore, or other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick or Mineral Matter, either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering firmly in lumps to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides of them, or insinuated into their substance, into their pores, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts, so as to disguise them very much, and give them a face and mien extremely unlike to that of those Shells which are at this day found at Sea.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They observed also, that
<q>amongst the Shells,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that were fair, unaltered, and free from such Mineral Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there were some which could not be match'd by any species of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99549:17"/>
Shell-fish now found upon the Sea-shores.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And that on the contrary,
<q>there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> were several Shells found commonly upon the said Shores, such as the larger Shells of the <hi>Buccina</hi> of the <hi>Conchae Veneris</hi>; of Crabs, Lobsters, and others, both of the Crustaceous and Testaceous kind, which yet we never met with at Land, or in our Quarries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay there were some other Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which they have urged, and which (though they be of lesser weight) shall all of them be recounted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered more particularly in the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it self.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole therefore 'tis very plain, that these Authors did not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse <hi>this</hi> Opinion without some grounds: without some countenance of probability: and that they have charged the <hi>opposite</hi> with a large crowd of Difficulties. Yea, so far are they from being destitute of an handsome Apology, that they very well deserve the Thanks of the world for what they have done. For although they have not succeeded in their Attempts about the Origin of these Bodies, yet they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99549:18"/>
have made Discoveries in other respects concerning <hi>them,</hi> and in <hi>other parts</hi> of Nature likewise, of that moment and consequence, as to have thereby laid a great and lasting Obligation upon the intelligent and discerning part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>But that they have failed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in this Enterprize, 'tis, I think, not over difficult to prove. And <hi>this</hi> is the Subject of the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Wherein I hope clearly to make out, that the Sea gave Birth to these Bodies: that <hi>they</hi> are so far from being formed in the Earth, or in the places where they are now found, that I shall evince, <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That the above-mentioned Bodies which consist of Stone, of Spar, Flint, and the like, and yet carry a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Cockles, Muscles, and other Shells, were originally formed in the

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99549:19"/>
I insist upon; there being so very few of these in comparison of those which have undergone no such Alteration. There being, I say, besides <hi>these,</hi> such vast multitudes of Shells contained in Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are intire, fair, and absolutely free from any such mineral Contagion: which are to be match'd by others at this day found upon our Shores, and which do not differ in any respect from them: being of the same size that those are of, and the same shape precisely: of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and texture; as consisting of the same peculiar Matter, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and disposed in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is that of their respective fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds at Sea: the tendency of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres and <hi>Striae</hi> the same: the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lamellae,</hi> constituted by these Fibres, alike in both: the same <hi>Vestigia</hi> of Tendons (by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Animal is fastned and joyned to the Shell) in each: the same <hi>Papillae:</hi> the same <hi>Sutures,</hi> and every thing else, whether within or without the Shell, in its Cavity or upon its Convexity, in the Substance, or upon the Surface of it. Besides; these Fossil Shells are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ordinary Accidents of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99549:19"/>
the <hi>marine ones, ex. gr.</hi> they sometimes grow to one another, the lesser Shells being fix'd to the larger: they have <hi>Balani, Tubuli vermiculares,</hi> Pearls, Coral, and the like, <hi>still</hi> actually grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them. And which is very considerable, they are most exactly of the same specifick Gravity with their fellow-kinds now upon the shores. Nay farther, they answer all Chymical try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in like manner as the Sea-shells do: their parts when dissolved have the same appearance to view, the same smell and taste: they have the same <hi>vires</hi> and effects in Medicine, when inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administrated to Animal Bodies: <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Oyl of Vitriol, and other like <hi>Menstrua,</hi> have the very same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon both. In one word, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conformable to the marine ones are these Shells, Teeth, and Bones, which are digged up out of the Earth, that though several Hundreds of them, which I now keep by me, have been nicely and critically examined by very many Learned Men, who are skill'd in all parts of Natural History, and who have been particularly curious in, and conversant with, Shells, and other marine Productions, yet never any

Man of them went away dissatisfied, or doubting whether these are really the very <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Sea-fishes or not. Nay, which is much more to my purpose, some of the most eminent of those very Gentlemen who formerly were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Matter, and rather inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe that these were natural Minerals, and who had <hi>wrote</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Opinion, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing upon strict and repeated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of these Bodies in my Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and upon farther Enquiry, and procuration of <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unalter'd</hi> Shells from several parts of this Island, fully assent to me herein, and are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that these are the spoils and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Sea-Animals. And, being thus satisfied, such is the Ingenuity of these worthy Persons, and so great their Affection to Truth, when, where, and by whomsoever manifested, that they have personally requested me to publish my Thoughts in order to the fuller clearing of this matter. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That although I can <hi>pair,</hi> with Sea-Shells, several of these Fossil ones that these Gentlemen have pronounc'd alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike any thing that the Salt-Water
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99549:20"/>
produceth; yet 'tis indeed very true, that there are found some Shells at Land, in Stone, and in Chalk, which cannot probably be match'd by any species of Shells now appearing upon our Shores. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I cannot but affirm that <hi>these,</hi> even the most strange and enormous of them, have all the essential Notes and Characters of Sea-Shells, and shew as near a relation to some now extant upon the Shores, as the different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>those</hi> themselves do to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that they are of the very same specifick Gravity with those to which they are so generically allied: and of the same Texture and Constitution of parts; the substance of <hi>these</hi> being as plaintly testaceous, as that of <hi>those</hi> is; insomuch that any Man that compares them, can no more doubt of the reality of the <hi>one</hi> than of the <hi>other</hi>; whence it must needs follow, that there were such Shell-fish <hi>once in being</hi>; which is enough for my purpose; I being no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make out that there are of the same kinds <hi>still</hi> actually <hi>living</hi> in the Ocean. Though if I <hi>was,</hi> 'twould be no very hard task; it being evident from the Relations of Dyvers, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99549:21"/>
Fishers for Pearls, that there are many kinds of Shell-fish which lye perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concealed in the <hi>Deep,</hi> skreen'd from our Eyes by that vast world of Water, and which have their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al abode at the bottom of the Ocean, without ever approaching near the Shores, it being as unnatural for <hi>these</hi> to desert this their native station, as 'tis for those that are the inhabitants of the Shores, to quit theirs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the deep: that for this reason <hi>these</hi> are called by Naturalists <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <hi>Pelagiae,</hi> as the others, that reside nearer to the Shores, are by them called <hi>Littorales.</hi> Now the Shells which we find exposed upon our Shores, are only those which are cast up and stranded by tides and by storms; and consequently are all of them <hi>Exuvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> of those kinds that live near the Shores, and not of those that inhabit the <hi>Main,</hi> or the deeper and remoter parts of the Ocean; it being certain from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also of Dyvers, that the Tides and Storms, even the most tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and turbulent, affect only the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial parts of the Ocean, the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and Shores, but never reach the greater Depths, or disturb the bottom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99549:21"/>
of the <hi>Main: these</hi> are as quiet, and free from Commotion in the midst of storms, as in the greatest calm; so that the Shell-fish, which are resident in these places, live and dye there, and are <hi>never</hi> dislodged or removed by storms, nor cast upon the Shores, which the <hi>Littorales</hi> usually are. When therefore I shall have proved more at large, that those which we find at Land, that are not matchable with any upon our Shores, are many of them of those very kinds which the forecited Relations particularly assure us are found no where but in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the Sea: and that as well those which we can match, as those we cannot, are all Remains of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Deluge, when the Water of the Ocean, being boisterously turned out upon the Earth, bore along with it, Fishes of all sorts, Shells, and the like moveable Bodies, which it left behind at its return back again to its Chanel, it will not, I presume, be thought strange, that amongst the rest, it left some of the <hi>Pelagiae,</hi> or those kinds of Shells which naturally have their abode at main-sea, and which therefore are now never flung up upon the Shores:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99549:22"/>
and it may very reasonably be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all these <hi>strange</hi> Shells, which we cannot so match, are of these <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagiae:</hi> that the several kinds of them are at this day living in the huge bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of the Ocean: and that there is not any one intire species of Shell-fish, formerly in being, now perish'd and lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That it is also very true that there are some Shells, such as those of the larger <hi>Buccinae,</hi> and <hi>Conchae Veneris,</hi> of Lobsters, Crabs, and others of the crustaceous kind, that are very rarely found at Land; so <hi>rarely,</hi> that some of these Gentlemen have asserted that they are <hi>never</hi> found; but <hi>that</hi> I shall shew to be a mistake, all the Shells in their whole List having been found in the Earth in one place or other. But that these are very <hi>seldom</hi> found any where, I most readily grant; and this is so far from being an Argument against what I am going to advance, that 'tis as full and substantial a Proof of the truth of it as I could possibly wish. For the Shells in this List are all lighter than Stone, Marble, and the other ordinary Terrestrial Matter. Now both these and all other sorts of

Shells that are <hi>so light,</hi> occur very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at Land, or in the Earth, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Shells of Cockles, Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkles, and the rest which are more ponderous, so as to equal the Stone, and the other Terrestrial Matter in Gravity.

To conclude, those Shells, and other Bodies, that were still light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>these,</hi> and consequently lighter than Stone, Chalk, and the other common Matter of the Earth, such as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99549:24"/>
the Shells of Lobsters (which are but as 1 ⅓ to 1) of Crabs, (1 ¾ to 1) and the rest of the Crustaneous kind: the Teeth and Bones of the cartilaginous and squammose Fishes, and many other Bodies, would subside last of all, and so, falling above the rest, be lodged near, if not upon the Surface; where being continually exposed to Weather, and other Injuries, they must in tract of time needs decay and rot, and at last quite vanish and disappear; and 'tis not to me any great wonder, that at this distance of four thousand years, we find so very few of them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that I think I may now safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeal to any ingenuous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Looker on, whether this, <hi>That we find all those kinds of Shells (now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon our Shores) which have nearly the same Gravity with Stone, and the other ordinary Matter of our Earth, that is so tight and compact as to preserve them, enclosed in great plenty therein, and only those, the rest which are lighter being so very rarely found,</hi> can reasonably be supposed to have happened by meer chance, with this Constancy and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and that in so many and distant Places: as also, whether <hi>this</hi> be any

               <head>PART I. An Examination of the Opinions of <hi>former Writers</hi> on this Subject. The <hi>Means</hi> whereby <hi>they</hi> thought these Marine Bodies brought out upon the Earth. Of certain <hi>Changes</hi> of Sea and Land, and other Alterations in the Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe, which <hi>they</hi> suppose to have happened.</head>
               <p>THIS so considerable a point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus gained: the Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Reality of these Marine Bodies vindicated and asserted: and my Way so far effectually cleared by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Dissertation; I now re-assume my original Design, and pass on to enquire by what means they were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Ocean, the place of their native Abode, to dry Land, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99549:25"/>
even to Countries very remote from any Seas.</p>
               <p>And this is a Question of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and which hath, for many Ages, given no small Fatigue to Learned Men. Nor hath the <hi>present</hi> been less inquisitive into this Affair than the <hi>former</hi> Ages were. We have seen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands employed herein; and many of them very excellent ones too. The great number of the Undertakers: the Worth of some of them: and their Zeal to bring the Matter to a Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are sure Arguments of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Importance of it: and that it is not hitherto decided, is as certain a proof of its difficulty.</p>
               <p>Some were of Opinion, that these Shells were fetch'd from Sea, by the ancient Inhabitants of those Countries where they are now found; who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had used the included Fishes for Food, flinging forth the Shells, many of them became petrified, as they speak; being thereby preserved down to our times, and are the same which we at this day find in our Fields and Quarries.</p>
               <p>Others rather thought that they were only Reliques of some former
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99549:26"/>
great Inundations of the Sea; which, furiously rushing forth, and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adjacent Territories, bore these Bodies out upon the Earth along with it: but returning at length more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely and calmly back again, it left them all behind.</p>
               <p>Many were of Opinion, that the Sea frequently flitted and changed its place: that several parts of the Globe which are now dry Land, and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lay heretofore at the bottom of the Sea, and were covered by it: that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the very Countries, which present us with these <hi>Spoils</hi> of it, were anciently in its possession; being then an Habitation of Sharks and other Fishes: of Oysters, Cockles, and the like; but the Sea, in tract of time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating thence, and betaking it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new Quarters: gaining as much ground on the opposite Coasts, as it lost upon those, left these Shells there as Marks of its ancient bounds and seat.</p>
               <p>Amongst the rest there were indeed some who believed these to be Remains of the General Deluge, and so many Monuments of that calamitous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Irruption. These last assuredly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99549:26"/>
were in the right; but the far greater part of them rather asserted than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this: rather deliver'd it as their Opinion, than offered any rational Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to induce others to the same Belief: And for the rest, who did offer any, so unhappy were they in the Choice, and unsuccessful in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them, by reason of the shortness of their Observations, and their not having duely informed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the state of these Things, that none of the other Partizans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with less Applause: none less strenuously maintained their ground, than these did.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, as Matters were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered amongst them, no Man could receive much Light or Satisfaction from what was advanced by any of them. They little more than clashed with one another: each could demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the others Work with ease enough, but not a Man of them tolerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own; which was sure never to outstand the first Assault that was made. Yea upon so equal Terms did they all stand, that no one could well lay claim to a larger share of Truth for his side: no one had a fairer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99549:27"/>
of <hi>right,</hi> than the rest; and it being impossible to imagine that all could be in the right; some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Learned Men began to suspect that none of them were so.</p>
               <p>These thereupon laid out on all hands for some new Expedient to solve and put an end to the perplexity; and 'twas this last Effort that brought forth the Opinion, that these Bodies are not what they seem to be; that they are no Shells, but meer Sportings of active Nature in this subterraneous Kingdom; and only Semblances or Imitations of Shells; they imagining that this shortned the Difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it spared them the trouble of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for their Conveyance from Sea; which was what had so severely exercised all the former; though in reality, this only heightened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hansed it, and render'd it still more intricate; as will appear more at large when I shall have published the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Dissertation, whereof I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given some Account above. And this was the most received and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Opinion when I first brought my Collection of these Things up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99549:27"/>There have been, besides these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, some other Conjectures proposed about the removal of these Bodies to Land: which I choose, rather than trouble the Reader with a detail of them here, to deferr to their proper place, that I may proceed directly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in my Design. Now the more effectually to smooth my way, and that this very great diversity of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may not be any longer an Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the World, 'twill be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that I look into the Reasons and Pretensions of each, and shew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground 'tis that I embrace that of the Deluge, and set aside all the rest.</p>
               <p>Why I adhere to them who suppose these Marine Productions brought out by the Universal Deluge, will be best learn'd from the succeeding part of this Essay, which is wholly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that purpose: and whereunto I shall prefix, An Historical Account of the Labours of <hi>Fab. Columna, Nic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Steno, P. Boccone, Iac. Grandius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Ray,</hi> and other Learned Men, on this Subject: shewing what they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done in it, wherein they failed, and what remains still to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:99549:28"/>Why I reject all the other Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, falls under our present Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and to make as short of the Matter as possible, 'tis because they will none of them abide the Test: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not due warrant from Observation, but are clearly repugnant thereunto: in a word, because the present Circumstances of these Marine Bodies do not square with those Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but exhibit <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that thwart them, and that give plain Indications that they could never have been put into the Condition we now find them by any such short and partial Agents as those they propose.</p>
               <p>Now in regard that the said Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are impartially related in my Observations, we need only have recourse to them to put an end to this Business. For, as Mathematicians say of a streight Line, that 'tis as well an Index of its own Rectitude, as of the Obliquity of a crooked one; so <hi>these</hi> may serve indifferently to detect the erroneous ways, and to point forth the <hi>true</hi>; and it is from these Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: from the Number, Order, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, Situation, Depth, Distance from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99549:28"/>
the Sea, and other Accidents of these Bodies, that I shall shew</p>
               <p>That <hi>they</hi> were not brought from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sea to the Parts where they are now found, by Men, the ancient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of those Parts, as some Authors have been of Opinion; they presuming that these Shells were at first only slung out upon the Surface of the Earth; and that those which we now find buried in it, were, in tract of time, covered, either by that Terrestrial Matter which falls down along with rain, or by the Earth which is wash'd from off the Hills by Land floods.</p>
               <p>That <hi>they</hi> were not carry'd together <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with the Water, which some suppose to pass continually from the bottom of the Sea, to the Heads of Springs and Rivers, through certain subterranean Conduits or Chanels, untill they were by some Glut, Stop, or other means arrested in their Passage, and so detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bowels of the Earth; as others have rather inclined to believe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>they</hi> were not born forth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Sea, and laid upon the Land by particular Inundations; such as were the <hi>Ogygean,</hi> the <hi>Deucalion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an,</hi> and others of fresher date: such as are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99549:29"/>
those which usually attend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: or those which are sometimes occasioned by very high Tides, by impetuous Winds, and the like; as other Writers have thought.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That <hi>they</hi> were not left behind at the <hi>beginning</hi> of the World, when the Sea overspread the whole Globe, till its Retreat into its assigned Chanel, and that <hi>the Waters</hi> were <hi>gathered together unto one place,</hi> the third day from the Commencement of the Creation; which others believed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That <hi>they</hi> were not left by the Seas being constrained to withdraw from off certain tracts of Land, which lay till then at the bottom of it, but being raised to an higher pitch, so as to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Level of the Seas surface, they, by that means, became Islands and habitable: the said tracts being thus elevated by Earthquakes, or the like subterraneous Explosions; in such manner as <hi>Rhodes, Thera, Therasia,</hi> and many other Islands were supposed to have been raised; which is the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> That <hi>they</hi> were not left by the Seas changing its place, receding from the Parts it anciently possest, and betaking
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99549:29"/>
it self to new Quarters: <hi>this change</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occasion'd by some accidental Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Transposition of the common Center of Gravity in the Terraqueous Globe; and thereupon the Fluids of it, the Sea, and the rest, immediately shifting likewise, as being the more easily moveable parts of the Mass, and coming to another <hi>AEquilibrium</hi>; that they might thereby the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themselves to their new Center. As others.</p>
               <p>That <hi>they</hi> were not left upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seas being protruded forwards, and constrained to fall off from certain Coasts, which it formerly possessed, by the Mud or Earth which is dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into it by Rivers; the said Mud being reposed along the Shores near the <hi>Ostia</hi> of those Rivers, and by that means making continual Additions to the Land, thereby excluding the Sea, daily invading and gaining upon it, and preserving these Shells as Trophies and Signs of its new Acquests and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments; which <hi>others</hi> have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: they concluding that the Islands <hi>Echinades,</hi> the Lower <hi>Egypt, Thessaly,</hi> and many other Countries, were thus raised out of the Mud brought down
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99549:30"/>
by <hi>Achelous,</hi> the <hi>Nile, Peneus,</hi> and other Rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Lastly. That <hi>they</hi> were not left by the Seas continual flitting and shifting its Chanel: this Progression being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the Seas wearing and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one Shore, and flinging up Mud, and, together with it, these Shells, upon the other, or opposite Coasts, thereby making perpetual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions unto them; which is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of other Authors.</p>
               <p>These Propositions (which are no other than so many Consectaries drawn from the Observations) are, we see, all <hi>Negative</hi>; as being directed against the Mistakes of some who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly engaged in this research. The ways they have taken to account for the Conveyance of these Marine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Land, are very many, as well as different from each other. For so eager and sollicitous hath the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and better part of Mankind been to bring this Matter to a fair issue and determination, that no Stone hath been left unturned, no way, whereby these things could ever possibly have been brought forth of the Sea, but one or other of them hath pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99549:30"/>
it. So that by this Refutation of all these, I might prove my own (which is the only one remaining) by Induction; but this kind of proof is not needful, where more cogent and <hi>positive</hi> Arguments are not wanting.</p>
               <p>And thus much of this Part I get over by the sole guidance of my Senses. A View of the present state of these Bodies alone convinced me sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the means, proposed by these Authors, were not the true ones: that they were both levelled wide, and fell all short of the Mark. Now though this was enough for my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and when I had evinced that, although such Alterations, as those which these Gentlemen suppose: Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and Migrations of the Center of Gravity: Elevations of new Islands: whole Countries gained from the Sea: and other like Changes had <hi>actually</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, yet these Shells could never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have been reposed thereby in the manner we now find them: I say, when I had proved this, I was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Alterations had really ever happened or not; yet partly for a fuller and more effectual Disproof of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99549:31"/>
Opinions: and partly because I am more especially obliged by my <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> design to look into all Pretences of Changes in the Globe we inhabit, and I saw very well, that scarce any, of all these alledged, had the least coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance either from the present face of the Earth, or any credible and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Records of the ancient state of it, I resolved to pursue this Matter some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther, and to shew that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there do indeed happen some Alterations in the Globe, yet they are very slight and almost imperceptible, <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99549:31"/>
Land have been more fix'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent: and in short, that the terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe is to this day nearly in the same condition that the Universal Deluge left it: being also like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so till the time of its final ruin and dissolution, preserved to the same end for which 'twas first formed, and by the same Power which hath secured it hitherto. But, with respect to my present Design, I more particularly make out,</p>
               <p>That although Rain-water be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as these Writers suppose) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plentifully saturated with terrestrial Matter, and (as I shall make appear) that peculiar Matter out of which the Bodies of Vegetables, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Animals, are formed, nourished, and augmented, Water being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vehicle and Distributer of it to the Parts of those Bodies, and all Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (especially that of Rain) being, more or less, stored with this, it being light in comparison of the common Mineral earthy Matter, and therefore easily assumed into Water, and moved along with it; yet that this Matter being all originally derived from the surface of the Earth, either by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99549:32"/>
that continually issues out, and ascends from all parts of it, <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>That the terrestrial Matter, which is thus carried by Rivers down into the Sea, is sustained therein, partly by the greater Crass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tude and Gravity of the Sea-water, and partly by its constant Agitation, occasioned by the Tides, and by its other Motions, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99549:32"/>
is not permitted to sink to the bottom; or, if any of it do, 'tis raised up again by the next Storm, and being support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mass of Water, together with the rest, 'tis by degrees exhaled, mounted up with the Rain that rises thence, and returned back again to the Earth in fruitful Showers. That by this perpetual Circulation a vast many things in the System of Nature are transacted: and two main Intentions of Providence constantly promoted; the <hi>one</hi> a Dispensation of Water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously and indifferently to all parts of the Earth; this being the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Agent that both bears the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent Matter to all formed Bodies, and, when brought to them, insinuates it in, and distributes it unto the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of those Bodies, for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Growth: <hi>the other,</hi> the keeping a just <hi>AEquilibrium</hi> (if I may so say) betwixt the Sea and Land; the Water, that was raised out of the Sea, for a Vehicle to this Matter, being by this means refunded back again into it: and the Matter it self restored to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Fund and Promptuary, the Earth; whereby each is restrained, and kept to due Bounds; so that the Sea may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99549:33"/>
not encroach upon the Earth, nor the Earth gain ground of the Sea. That there never were any Islands, or other considerable parcels of Land, amassed or heap'd up: nor any enlargement, or addition of Earth made to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, by the Mud that is carried down into the Sea by Rivers. That although the Ancients were almost unanimously of Opinion that those Parts, where <hi>Egypt</hi> now is, were formerly Sea: and that a very considerable portion of that Country was <hi>recent,</hi> and formed out of the Mud discharged into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Sea by the <hi>Nile</hi>; that yet this tract of Land had no such <hi>Rise,</hi> out is as old, and of as long a standing, as <hi>any</hi> upon all the whole Continent of <hi>Africa:</hi> and hath been in much the same Natural Condition, that it is at this day, ever since the time of the Deluge; its Shores being neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced one jot further into the Sea for this three or four thousand Years, nor its Surface raised by additional Mud deposed upon it by the yearly Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Nile.</hi> That neither the <hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi> nor the <hi>Euxine,</hi> nor any other Seas, fill up, or by degrees grow shallower. That <hi>Salmydessus, Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scyra,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99549:33"/>
Sidene,</hi> and the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, upon the Coasts of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, were not formed out of the Mud brought down by the <hi>Ister, Thermodon, Iris,</hi> and the other Rivers which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves into that Sea. That <hi>Thessaly</hi> was not raised out of the Mud born down by the River <hi>Peneus:</hi> the Islands <hi>Echinades,</hi> or <hi>Curzolari,</hi> out of that brought by the River <hi>Achelous: Cilicia,</hi> by the River <hi>Pyramus: Mysia, Lydia, Ionia,</hi> and other Countries of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> by the <hi>Caicus, Hermus, Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and the other Rivers which pass through them. To be short, That no Island or Country in the whole World was ever raised by this means, notwithstanding that very many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and some of considerable note, have believed that all the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Countries were so raised; nay, to so strange a height of Extravagance do some, otherwise Learned and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Persons run, when they indulge Fancy too far, and rely wholly upon Probabilities and Conjectures, there is hardly any one single Island or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try all round the Globe, that one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other hath not thought to have been formed after this manner, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99549:34"/>
at least, some very large part of it.</p>
               <p>That there is no authentick Instance of any considerable tract of Land that was thrown up from the bottom of the Sea, by an Earthquake, or other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Explosion, so as to become an Island, and be render'd habitable. That <hi>Rhodus, Thera, Therasia,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Islands, which were suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Ancients, and, upon their Authority, by later Authors, to have been thus raised, had really no such Original, but have stood out above Water as long as the rest of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Islands, and stand now just as the Universal Deluge left them.</p>
               <p>That as to that affection of Bodies which is called their <hi>Gravity,</hi> it clearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urpasses all the Powers of meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all the Mechanism of Matter. That as any one Body, or part of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cannot be the Cause of its own Gravity: so no more can it ever possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the Cause of the Gravity of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body, or part of Matter. That neither the Earth's diurnal Revolution upon its Axis: nor any magnetick Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia of the Earth: nor the Air, or Atmosphere which environs the Earth: nor the <hi>AEther,</hi> or <hi>Materia subtilis</hi> of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99549:34"/>
the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> in what manner soever moved or agitated: (all which have been proposed by several Learned Men as the Causes of Gravity) nor any other Fluid or Matter whatever, can of it self produce such an Effect as is that of the Gravity of Bodies. That it does not proceed from the Efficiency of any such contingent and unstable Agents, but stands on a Basis more firm and stedfast, being intirely owing to the direct Concourse of the Power of the Author of Nature, immediately in his hand, and the main Engine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this stupendous Fabrick of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse is managed and supported: the prime Hinge whereon the whole frame of Nature moves: and is principally concerned, if not the sole Efficient in the most remarkable <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of the Natural World; which, should Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity once cease, or be withdrawn, would instantly shiver into Millions of Atoms, and relapse into its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confusion. That the common Center of Gravity in the terraqueous Globe is steady, immovable, and not liable to any accidental Transposition, nor hath it ever shifted or changed its Station. And that there is no declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99549:35"/>
of Latitude: nor variation of the Elevation of the Pole; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what some Learned Men have asserted.</p>
               <p>What concerns the raising of new Mountains: Deterrations, or the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Earth down upon the Valleys, from the Hills and higher Grounds: and Islands torn off from the main Continent by Earthquakes, or by the furious and impetuous insults of the Sea; these, I say, will fall more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly under our Consideration on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occasion <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 2. and <hi>Part</hi> 5.</note>. And for the Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of lesser moment, which some have fancied to have happened within this Interval, I mean, for the last four thousand Years since the Deluge, I chuse rather to pass them over at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, than to crowd and encumber this short Tract with the account of them.</p>
               <p>I must needs freely own, that when I first directed my Thoughts this way, 'twas matter of real Admiration to me, to find that a Belief of so many, and such great Alterations in the Earth, had gained so large footing, and made good its ground so many Ages, in the World; there being not the least signs nor footsteps of any such thing upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99549:35"/>
the face of the whole Earth: no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Foundation for such a Belief ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Nature or History. But I soon saw very well, that the Moderns ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally entertained it meerly upon the Credit and Tradition of the Ancients, and <hi>that</hi> without due Examination, or Enquiry into the Truth and Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and 'twas not long e're I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what it was that so generally misled the Ancients into these Mistakes. But of that more by and by.</p>
               <p>Those ancient Pagan Writers were indeed very much excusable as to this matter. Philosophy was then again in its Infancy: there remaining but few marks of the old <hi>Tradition,</hi> and those much obliterated and defaced by Time; so that <hi>they</hi> had only dark and faint Idea's, narrow and scanty Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Providence: and were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of its Intentions, and of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> of its Conduct in the Government and Preservation of the Natural World. They wanted a longer Experience of <hi>these things:</hi> a larger stock of Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Records of the state of the Earth before their times; having, as things then stood, nothing to assist them in their Enquiries besides their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99549:36"/>
own Guesses and Fancy. For their Progenitors, and those who had lived in the earlier Ages, were almost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely taken up with Business of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind. That fatal Calamity, the Deluge, had wrought such a Change, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>they</hi> beheld every where a new face of things: and the Earth did not <hi>then</hi> teem forth its Encrease, as <hi>former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> of its own accord, but required Culture, and the Assistance of their Hands, much more than before it did. The provision of Bread for Food: Clothing to ward off the Injury and Inclemency of the Air: and other like Employs for the Comfort and Support of Life, being of indispensible necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were to be first look'd after; and these Employs, being then for the most part <hi>new</hi> to them, and such as they were unskill'd in, were alone enough to take up the greatest part of their time. The methods they used of Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, and other Arts of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, were so aukward and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to afford them little leisure for <hi>Works of the Brain,</hi> for History, or Contemplations of that nature. And till better Experience had led their Posterity to the Improvements of Arts:

till the Plow, and other useful Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were found out: and they had learn'd more compendious and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ways of dispatching those Affairs, whereby they shortned their Labours, and so gained time, there was no <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> or Matters of Speculation among them; and we hear little or nothing of <hi>Writing,</hi> nay 'twas a very considerable time before <hi>Letters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were found out. I know very well, there are some who talk of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Deluge; but that is a matter of meer Conjecture, and I think nothing can be peremptorily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either the one way or the other; though I shall shew, that 'tis highly probable they had none. Be <hi>that</hi> how it will, I shall plainly make out, that the Ages which next succeeded the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge <hi>had none</hi>; so far from it, that they knew nothing at all of them; and the first Writing they used was only the simple Pictures, and Gravings of the things they would represent, Beasts, Birds, and the like; which way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression was afterwards called Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick. But <hi>this</hi> fell into disuse, when Letters were afterwards disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; they being, in all respects, a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99549:37"/>
far more excellent and noble Invention. We see therefore that there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reasons why those early Ages could not transmit Accounts of the state of the Earth and of these Marine Bodies, in their times, down to the succeeding Generations. So that <hi>these</hi> having little more to trust to than their own Imagination, and no surer a Guide in their Reasonings about <hi>these things</hi> than bare Conjecture, 'twas no wonder that they fell into gross and palpable Mistakes concerning them.</p>
               <p>Nor much more wonder is it that an <hi>Epicurus:</hi> one who could ever es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse a Notion so enormously absurd and senseless, as that the World was framed by Chance: that this vast, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and most stupendous Pile was owing to no higher a Principle than a fortuitous Congress of Atoms: and that either there was no God at all, or, which is much the same thing, that he was an impotent and lazy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and wholly without concern for the Affairs of this lower World: I say, 'tis in no wise strange that such a one should believe, as he did, that things were blindly shuffled and hurled about in the World: that the Elements were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99549:37"/>
at constant Strife and War with each other: that in some places, the Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Land: in others, the Land got ground of the Sea: that all Nature was in an Hurry and Tumult: and that as the World was first made, so should it be again dissolved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, by Chance: that it had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made large Advances that way, being infirm and worn with Age, shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and crazy, and would in time dwindle and fall back again into its original Chaos.</p>
               <p>Did Gravity, the Inclination of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies towards the same common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which Inclination they owe their respective order, and site in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of each other, very many of their Motions and Actions, and in a great measure, their present Constitution: did this, I say, happen from so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, precarious, and inconstant Causes as many have believed: or did it stand upon so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icklish and tottering a Foundation as some Mens fancy hath placed it, 'twould be no wonder should it frequently vary: its Center swerve and shift, upon every turn: and that there should ensue thereupon, not only such Motions and Alterations of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99549:38"/>
Bounds of the Sea as they imagine; but likewise many other, and not less pernicious, Perturbations of the course of <hi>even universal</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p>Or was the Universe left to its <hi>own</hi> Conduct and Management: the whole Mass of created Matter to its <hi>proper</hi> Disposition and Tendency: were there no restraint of Bounds to the Earth, nor Curb to the fury of the Ocean: was there not <hi>One</hi> who had <hi>set bars and doors to it, and said hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther, and here shall thy proud Waves be staid</hi>; then indeed might we well expect such Vicissitudes and Confusions of things: such Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Clashings in Nature: such Depredations, and Changes of Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>But if the same mighty Power, which in the beginning produced this vast System of Bodies out of Nothing, and disposed and ranged them into the most excellent and beautiful order we now behold: which at first framed an Earth of a Constitution sutable to the innocent state of its primitive Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: and afterwards when Man had degenerated, and quitted that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, altered that Constitution of the</p>

               <p>And whatever may be urged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> I cannot well see, I confess, what can be said for the <hi>later Authors,</hi> who have embrac'd the same Tenets, more than that these Learned Men took up those Tenets <hi>on trust,</hi> their over-great deference to the Dictates of Antiquity betraying them into a persuasion of such Changes in the Earth. I have given my Reasons above why I cannot think the Ancients competent Judges in this Case. We have, at this time of day, better and more certain means of Information than <hi>they</hi> had; and therefore it were to have been wish'd, that these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had not thus obsequiously follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>them,</hi> but gone another way to work. It would certainly have been much better, had they taken the pains to have look'd a little into <hi>Matter of Fact:</hi> had they consulted History and Geography, in order duely to acquaint
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99549:39"/>
themselves with the <hi>past</hi> and <hi>present</hi> state of the terraqueous Globe; and not to have pass'd Sentence till they had first compared the most ancient Descriptions of Countries with the Countries themselves as <hi>now</hi> they stand. Nay, had they but read and attended to the Accounts which the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, from whom they borrow these Opinions, have left us, they might have discovered, even from them, the Errors and Oversights of their Authors: and have learn'd, that the Face of Sea and Land is the very same at this day that it was when those Accounts were compiled: and that the Globe hath not sustained any considerable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, either in the <hi>whole,</hi> or any of its <hi>Parts,</hi> in all this time.</p>
               <p>Those who can content themselves with a Superficial View of Things: who are satisfied with contemplating them in gross: and can acquiesce in a general, and less nice Examination of them: whose Thoughts are narrow and bounded: and their Prospects of Nature scanty, and by piecemeal, must needs make very short and defective Judgments, and, oftentimes very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and wide of truth. Some
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99549:40"/>
fanciful Men have expected nothing but Confusion and Ruin from those very means whereby both <hi>that</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is most effectually prevented and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>One</hi> imagines that the terrestrial Matter, which is showered down along with Rain, enlarges the Bulk of the Earth, and that it will in time bury, and lay all things under ground. Another, on the contrary, fancies that the Earth will ere long all be wash'd away by Rains, and borne down into the Sea by Rivers; and, its Chanel being thereby quite filled up, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Ocean turned forth to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the dry Land. Whereas by this Distribution of Matter, continual Provision is every where made for the supply of Bodies: the just state of Sea and Land preserved, and the Bounds of each secured; quite contrary to the preposterous Reasonings of those Men, who expected so different a Result of these things. And should this Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (from which they dreaded those dismal Consequences) once cease, the Formation of Bodies would be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at an end: and Nature at a perfect stand. But I am aware that I transgress: and that this is a Prolixity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99549:40"/>
not allowable in a Treatise of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wherefore I shall conclude, after I have performed my Promise of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what it was which led the ancient Historians, Geographers, and others, so generally into a belief of these frequent Changes betwixt Sea and Land; and 'twas this.</p>
               <p>They observed, almost wherever they cast their eyes, vast multitudes of Sea-shells, at Land, in their Fields, and even at very great distance from any Sea. This, <hi>Eratasthenes, Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Xanthus Lydus, Strabo, Pausanias, Pomponius Mela, Theophrastus, Strato</hi> the Philosopher, <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and others of them assure us. They found them upon the Hills, as well as in the Valleys and Plains: they observed that they were immersed in the Mass of the Stone of their Rocks, Quarries, and Mines, in the same manner as they are at this day found in all known Parts of the World.</p>
               <p>Nay in those Elder Times, and which were so much nearer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge than ours are, they found these Marine Bodies more frequently, and in much greater plenty than we now do; and most, if not all of them, fresh,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99549:41"/>
entire, and firm. The whole crusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous kind, and the lighter ones of the testaceous, which together would be a vast number, subsiding last, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Surface of the Earth; <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </gap>t: how they could lye so long expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Air, Weather, and other Injuries, without vast numbers of them, and especially the siner and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer Species, being, long e're this, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd and rotten, some of them quite dissolved and vanish'd, and the rest so damaged, many of them, and altered by time, as not to appear the things they then were, and so create a doubt amongst some of <hi>us</hi> whether they are really Shells or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:99549:41"/>This was a Scruple that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into <hi>their</hi> Heads. The Shells, being then fair, sound, and free from decay, were so exactly like those they saw lying upon their Shores, that they never made any question but that they were the <hi>Exuviae</hi> of Shell-fish, and that they once belonged all to the Sea. But the Difficulty was how they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by what means they could ever arrive to places oftentimes so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Ocean.</p>
               <p>The Ages that went before knew well enough how these Marine Bodies were brought thither. But such were the Anxieties and Distresses of the then again infant World: so incessant their Occupations about Provision for Food, Rayment, and the like, that (even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Letters were discovered) there was little leisure to commit any thing to Writing; and, for want <hi>thereof,</hi> the memory of this extraordinary Accident was in great measure worn out and lost. 'Tis true there was a general and loud Rumour amongst them of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Deluge of Water that had drowned all Mankind except only a very few Persons. But there had also happened very terrible Inundations of later date,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99549:42"/>
and which were nearer to the Times when these Authors lived. Such was that which overflowed <hi>Attica</hi> in the days of <hi>Ogyges</hi>: and that which drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thessaly</hi> in <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s time. These made cruel Havock and Devastation amongst them: their own native Country, <hi>Greece,</hi> was the Theatre whereon these Tragedies were acted: and their Progenitors had seen and felt their Fury. And these happening nearer home, and their Effects being fresh, and in all Mens mouths, they made so sensible and lasting Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their Minds, that the old great Deluge was eclipsed by that means, its Tradition mightily obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Circumstances of it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven and confounded with those of these later Deluges, that 'twas e'en dwindled into nothing, and almost bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Relations of those Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In their Enquiries therefore into this Matter, scarcely a Man of them thought, or so much as dream'd, of the Universal Deluge. They concluded indeed unanimously, that the Sea had been there, wherever they met with any of these Shells, and that it had left
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99549:42"/>
them behind. And so far they were in the right: this was an Inference ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and natural enough. But when they began to reason about the means how the Sea got thither, and a way back again, there they were perfectly in the dark; and, both Tradition and Philosophy failing them, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Shifts, and to the best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures they could think of; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was either forced forth, as in particular Inundations, such as those lately mentioned: or that those <hi>Parts,</hi> where they found the Shells, had been formerly in the Possession of the Sea, and the place of its natural Residence, which it had since quitted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</p>
               <p>Upon this they began to seek out by what means, most probably, the Sea might have been dispossest of those Parts, and constrained to move into other Quarters. And if 'twas an Island where they found the Shells, they straitways concluded that the whole Island lay originally at the bottom of the Sea: and that 'twas either hoisted up by some Vapour from beneath: or that the Water of the Sea, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cover'd it, was in time exhaled,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99549:43"/>
and dryed up by the Sun, the Land thereby laid bare, and these Shells brought to light. But if 'twas in any part of the Continent where they found the Shells, they concluded that the Sea had been extruded and driven off by the Mud that was continually brought down by the Rivers of those parts.</p>
               <p>That I may not be over-tedious here, I will only add, that I shall clearly shew, from plain Passages of their own Writings yet extant, that 'twas meerly the finding these Sea-shells at Land that occasioned this Stir, and raised all this Dust amongst the Ancients; and upon which principally they grounded their Belief of the Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Changes of Sea and Land, wherewith their Writings are so filled. But how little reason they had for it: and how far those have been over-seen who have followed them herein, hath been intimated already, and will appear farther from the following part of this Essay, to the Account of which I now hasten.</p>

               <p>THE Consectaries of the former part of this Discourse are all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; <hi>that</hi> being only introductory, and serving but to clear the way to this second part: to free the Enquiry from the Perplexities that some Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers have encumber'd it withall: and to set aside the false Lights they used in quest of the Agent which transposed these Sea-shells to Land.</p>
               <p>Having therefore discharged my hands of that Task, and, from Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the present state of the Earth, and of the site and condition of the Marine Bodies which are lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and upon it, shewn that they could
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99549:44"/>
not possibly be reposed in that manner by particular Inundations: by the Seas receding and shifting from place to place: nor by any of the other means there proposed: I pass next on to search out the true means: and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Agent that did actually bring them forth, and disposed them into the Method and Order wherein we now find them. To which purpose I have recourse again to the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for by their Assistance this Matter may be rightly and fully adjusted. So that I shall only proceed, as hitherto, to make Inferences from them; which Inferences, in this Part are all <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> Of these, the first is,</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>n of the Water back again from off the Earth, they were left behind at Land.</p>
               <p>This is a Proposition of some weight and consequence; upon which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I shall be somewhat prolix and particular in the Establishment of it: careful and exact in conferring every Circumstance of these Marine Bodies, to see how they square with it: and shall not dismiss it till I have evinced
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99549:44"/>
that those which I prest, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Part, as Objections against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways there propounded, all fall in here, and are the clearest and most convincing Arguments of the truth hereof: that this, and this alone, does naturally and easily account for all those Circumstances: and fairly takes off all Difficulties. Which Difficulties I propose at large, and particularly those which have of late been urged, by some Learned Men, as proofs that these Bodies were not left behind by the Deluge; shewing of how little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity they are.</p>
               <p>Which being dispatch'd, I return back to my Observations; and proceed upon them to represent the <hi>Effects</hi> that the Deluge had upon the Earth, and the <hi>Alterations</hi> that it wrought in the Globe; some whereof were indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary. <hi>These</hi> I distribute into two Classes; the <hi>first</hi> of which will contain <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>only</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of which we have some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Intimations, but not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and demonstrative Certainty, the Proofs whereon they depend being more remote. And these I shall whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wave at present, and not crowd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99549:45"/>
this shorter Treatise with the Relation of them, reserving that room for <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>second</hi> Class, which are those whereof we have a plain and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Certainty: those which flow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations: and which are so evident, that 'tis impossible these Marine Bodies could have been any ways lodged in such manner, and to so great depths, in the Beds of Stone, Marble, Chalk, and the rest, had not these Alterations all happened. Namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That during the time of the Deluge, whilst the Water was out upon, and covered the Terrestrial Globe, All the Stone and Marble of the Antediluvian Earth: all the Metalls of it: all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Concretions: and, in a word, all Fossils whatever that had befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In truth the thing, at first, appeared so wonderful and surprizing to me, that I must confess I was for some time at a stand; nor could I bring over my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to assent, untill, by a deliberate and careful Examination of all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of these Marine Bodies, I was abundantly convinced that they could not have come into those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by any other means than such a Dissolution of the Earth, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of things. And were it not that the Observations, made in so many, and those so distant, places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated so often with the most scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and diffident Circumspection, did so establish and ascertain the thing, as not to leave any room for Contest or

Doubt, I could scarcely ever have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited it.</p>
               <p>And though the whole Series of this extraordinary <hi>Turn</hi> may seem at first view to exhibit nothing but Tumult and Disorder: nothing but hurry, jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and distraction of things: though it may carry along with it some slight shew that 'twas managed blindly and at random: yet if we draw somewhat nearer, and take a closer prospect of it: if we look into its retired Movements, and more secret and latent Springs, we may there trace out a steady Hand, producing good out of evil: the most consummate and absolute Order and Beauty, out of the highest Confusion and Deformity: acting with the most exquisite Contrivance and Wisdom: attending vigilantly throughout the whole Course of this grand Affair, and directing all the several Steps and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of it to <hi>an End,</hi> and that a most noble and excellent one; no less than the Happiness of the whole race of Mankind: the Benefit, and universal Good, of all the many Generations of Men which were to come after: which were to inhabit this Earth, thus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duled anew, thus suited to their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99549:50"/>
present Condition and Necessities.</p>
               <p>But the Presidence of that mighty Power in this Revolution: its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Agency and Concern therein: and its Purpose and <hi>Design</hi> in the several Accidents of it, will more evidently appear, when I shall have proved,</p>
               <p>That, altho' one Intention of the Deluge was to inflict a deserved Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon <hi>that Race</hi> of Men, yet it was not solely levelled against Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but principally against the Earth that then was; with design to destroy and alter that Constitution of it, which was apparently calculated and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a state of Innocence: to fashion it afresh, and give it a Constitution more nearly accommodated to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Frailties of its Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>That the said Earth, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and alike fertil in all parts of it, was yet generally much more fertil than <hi>ours</hi> is. That the exteriour <hi>Stratum</hi> or Surface of it, consisted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of a kind of terrestrial Matter proper for the Nourishment and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Plants, and this in great <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi>; being little, or not at all, entangled with an Intermixture of meer Mineral Matter that was unfit
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99549:50"/>
for Vegetation. That its Soil was more luxuriant, and teemed forth its Productions in far greater plenty and abundance than the present Earth does. That the Plough was then of no use, and not invented till after the Deluge; that <hi>Earth</hi> requiring little or no Care or Culture; but yeilding its encrease freely, and without any considerable Labour and Toil, or assistance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Industry; by this means allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind that time, which must otherwise have been spent in Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Plowing, Sowing, and the like, to far more divine and noble Uses: to Purposes more agreeable to the Design of their Creation; there being no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, whilst they continued in that state of Perfection, of their abusing this Plenty, or perverting it to any other end than the sustenance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the necessary support of Life.</p>
               <p>That when Man was <hi>fallen,</hi> and had abandoned his primitive Innocence, the Cafe was much altered, and a far different Scene of Things present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that generous Vertue, masculine Bravery, and prudent Circumspection

which he was before Master of, now deserted him, together with that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which was the Basis and Support of all: and a strange imbecility im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately seized and laid hold of him: he became pusillanimous, and was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily ruffled with every little Passion within: supine, and as openly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to any Temptation or Assault from without. And <hi>now</hi> these exuberant Productions of the Earth became a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Decoy and Snare unto him: they only excited and fomented his Lusts, and ministred plentiful Fewel to his Vices and Luxury; and the Earth requiring little or no Tillage, there was little occasion for Labour; so that almost his whole time lay upon his hands, and gave him leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, and full swing to pursue his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; by which means he was laid open to all manner of Pravity, Corruption, and Enormity; and we need not be much surprized to hear <hi>That the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man was great in the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually</hi>

That by this means, a great part of that time, which the Inhabitants of the former Earth had to spare, and whereof they made so ill use, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and taken up in Digging and Plowing, in making provision for bread, and for the Necessities of Life: and the Excess of Fertility, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed so much to <hi>their</hi> Miscarriages, was retracted and cut off.</p>
               <p>That had the Deluge been aimed <hi>only at Mankind</hi>: and its utmost design meerly to punish that Generation, and thereby to deterr Posterity from the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99549:53"/>
like Offences; this might have been brought about by means much more compendious, and obvious too, and yet equally terrifying and exemplary. Mankind, I say, might have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off at a far cheaper rate: without this ransacking of Nature, and turning all things topsie-turvy: without this battering of the Earth, and unhinging the whole frame of the Globe. The Business might have been done as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by Wars; the Heart of every Man of them was in the hand of God, and he could easily have made them Executioners of his Wrath upon one another. He had the command of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, of Pestilence, and a thousand other Disasters, whereby he could have carried them off by sholes, yea swept them all clear away. Besides, he had the whole Artillery of the Sky in his power, and might presently have Thunder struck them all, or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by Fire from Heaven. But none of all <hi>these</hi> were used, though 'tis most apparent that any of them would have been as fatal and pernicious to Man as the Deluge was, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign lay a great deal deeper, and <hi>these</hi> would have fallen short of it: <hi>these</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99549:54"/>
would never have reach'd the Earth, nor affected <hi>that</hi> in the least: they could never have touch'd the Head, or stop'd the source of these unhappy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, for which the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was sent. <hi>That</hi> was what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Deluge could reach; and as long as the Cause remained: as long as the old Temptation was still behind, every Age would have lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fresh Inducements to the same Crimes: and there would have been a new necessity to punish and reclaim the World: to depopulate the Earth, and reduce it again to a vast Solitude, as constantly as there succeeded a new Age and Race of Men. For the terror of the Calamity would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it self much farther than the Men which suffered under the weight of it: and a few Years would have worn out, in great measure, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions it made. This we see even from the Example of the Deluge it self. As formidable as <hi>this</hi> was to those who lived at, or near, the time of it: who saw the prodigious Devastations it made: the horrible Methods by which 'twas brought about: and the Reason why 'twas inflicted; and to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99549:54"/>
for a few Generations; yet the Fright was not lasting: 'twas not long e're the Sting of it was worn out. And though the Elder Ages knew full well that there had been such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge: and had some Tradition of the cruel Desolation it made; yet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Particulars of it were drop'd, and the most frightful Passages bore the least share in the Relation; being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably so strange as to be hardly credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and carrying rather an appearance of Figment and Invention, in those that handed down the memory of it, than of Truth and Reality. So that upon the whole 'tis very plain that the Deluge was not sent only as an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner to Mankind: but that its prime Errand was to reform and <hi>new-mold the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That therefore as much Harshness and Cruelty as this great Destruction of Mankind seemingly carries along with it: as wild and extravagant a thing as that Dissolution of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Earth appeared at first sight, yet all the Severity lay in the Punishment of that Generation, (which yet was no more than what was highly just, yea and necessary too:) and the <hi>whole</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99549:55"/>
of the Tragedy terminated there. For the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> was not only an Act of the profoundest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Forecast, but the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental proof that could ever possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been, of Goodness, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Tenderness, in the Author of our <hi>Being</hi>; and <hi>this</hi> so liberal too and extensive, as to reach all the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages of Mankind: all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of <hi>Noah</hi>: all that should dwell upon the thus renewed Earth to the End of the World; by this means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the old Charm: the Bait that had so long bewildred and deluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Man: setting him once more upon his Legs: reducing him from the most abject and stupid Ferity, to his Senses, and to sober Reason: from the most deplorable Misery and Slavery, to a Capacity of being happy.</p>
               <p>That notwithstanding that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy struck as deep at the Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as at the Morals of Mankind: that Ignorance and Rudeness would be as necessary a Consequence of it, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Life: and that this so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Employ and Expence of their time would as assuredly curtail and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench the ordinary means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99549:56"/>
to deferr it a while, untill I have first proposed them.</p>
               <p>Thus have I drawn up a <hi>brief Scheme</hi> of what befell the Earth at the <hi>Deluge</hi>: and of the <hi>Change</hi> that it then underwent. I have, by comparing its Antediluvian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conf. Part</hi> 6.</note> with its present state, found where chiefly the <hi>Difference</hi> lay; <hi>viz.</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Fertility. I have endeavour'd also to discover the <hi>Reason</hi> why this Change was made in it. For since that the Process of it was so solemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: that there were so many, and those so strange things done: that the <hi>first Earth</hi> was perfectly unmade again, taken all to pieces, and framed a-new; and indeed, the very same Method that was used in the original Formation of it, used likewise in this Renovation; <hi>our Earth</hi> standing the first step after its Dissolution, in the same posture that the <hi>Primitive Earth</hi> did the first step after its <hi>Rise</hi> out of Nothing; which the Reader will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find by conferring the fifth Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Part with <hi>Gen.</hi> i. v. 2. and 9: since likewise there was so mighty an Hand <note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99549:57"/>
that there was some real and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Cause for the making that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. Nor was such a Cause very hard to be found out. The first Earth was suited to the first state of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; who were the Inhabitants of it, and for whose use 'twas made. But when Humane Nature had, by <hi>the Fall,</hi> suffer'd so great a Change, 'twas but necessary that the Earth should undergo a Change too, the better to accommodate it to the Condition that Mankind was <hi>then</hi> in: and <hi>such</hi> a Change the Deluge brought to pass.</p>

And that the Reader may himself be Judge in the Case, I shall fairly lay down <hi>Moses</hi>'s sense of it in his own words.

               <p>All which may be well reduced to two plain and short Propositions,
<list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Revolt drew down a Curse upon the Earth.</item>
                     <item>2. That there was some sort of Agriculture used before the Deluge.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As to the former, the Curse upon the Earth, I shall not in the least go about to extenuate the Latitude of it: or to stint it only to the Production of Weeds, of <hi>Thorns, Thistles,</hi> and other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99549:58"/>
the less useful kinds of Plants: but shall give it its full scope, and grant that no less than an universal Restraint and Diminution of the primitive Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Earth was intended by it; this indeed seeming to be the plain and genuine meaning of the words. But the Question is, whether this Curse was presently inflicted or not: whether it was succeeded with an universal Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, and the Earth's native and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Exuberance all straitways check'd, and turn'd to as general a Desolation and Barrenness. And here I entreat it may be taken notice, that <hi>this</hi> was but <hi>one,</hi> and that much the lesser, part of the Sentence past upon <hi>Adam.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> was Death <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conf.</hi> Rom. v. 12. <hi>and</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22.</note>; which, 'tis most certain, was not immediately inflicted. And yet <hi>this</hi> was pronounc'd at the same time and with the same breath, that the other was: <hi>Unto dust shalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> Nay and much more emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally a little before <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17.</note>, <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt</hi> surely <hi>dye.</hi> This was exceedingly peremptory: and the very day fix'd likewise. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, through the Clemency and Goodness of God, Execution was delayed for a long time; <hi>Adam</hi> being
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99549:58"/>
reprieved for eight or nine hundred years <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. v. 5.</note>. The Dominion of Death over him commenc'd indeed not only the same day that Sentence was past, but the very minute that he tasted the forbidden Fruit: and Mortality went hand in hand with the Transgression: but 'twas a long time before it had raised any Trophies, or made a final and absolute Conquest.</p>
               <p>Why therefore may we not as well suppose the other part of the Sentence, the Sterilizing the Earth, was also suspended for some time, and deferr'd till the Deluge happened, and became the Executioner of it? 'Tis certainly very hard to imagine that God should destroy the Work of his hands almost as soon as he had finish'd it: that all things should be unhinged again by such time as they were well ranged and put in order: and that the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy and lovely Verdure which then appeared every where, and which had but just shewed it self, should be nip'd in the bud, and blasted all of a sudden. To be short, 'tis, I think, most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that as on the other part Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity did presently enter and take place, but got not full possession of many
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99549:59"/>
Ages after: so here, Thorns, Thistles, and other the like Consequences of this Curse, immediately sprung out of the Ground, and manifested themselves on every side, but it had not its full effect, nor was the Earth impoverish'd, or its Fertility, sensibly curb'd, till the Deluge. And for proof of this I appeal to the Remains of <hi>that Earth</hi>: the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Vegetable Productions of it still preserved; the vast and incredible Numbers whereof notoriously testifie the extreme Luxuriance and Foecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and I need but produce <hi>these</hi> as Evidences that at the time that the Deluge came, the Earth was so loaded with Herbage, and throng'd with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, that such an Expedient was even wanting to ease it of the burden, and to make room for a succession of its Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For this also I appeal to <hi>Moses</hi> himself, who openly acknowledgeth that this Curse did not take place effectually till the Deluge. For he tells us, that, after the Deluge was over, and <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family come forth of the Ark, <hi>He builded an Altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings on the Altar: and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord smelled a sweet savour, and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99549:59"/>
Curse the Ground <hi>any more, neither will I again smite any more every thing living as I have done</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 20, 21.</note>. Wherein he plainly refers to the Curse denounc'd above, at the Apostacy of <hi>Adam</hi>: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that it was not fulfilled till the Deluge. And a little after he as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates, that the fulfilling of it lay in the Destruction of the Earth then wrought. For, speaking again of the same thing, instead of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression [<hi>Curse the Ground</hi>] here used, he makes use of [<hi>Destroy the Earth</hi>] The whole Passage runs thus; <hi>And I will establish my Covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a flood: neither shall there any more be a</hi> Flood to destroy the Earth <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 11.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nor is it indeed in any wise strange that this Curse had not it's Effect soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: especially since 'twas not limited to any time. There are so many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents on Record in Holy Writ of this way of proceeding, that no one can be well ignorant of them; so that I shall not need to charge this place with more than one, and that shall be the Case of <hi>Ham,</hi> for which we are likewise beholden to the same Author,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99549:60"/>
                  <hi>Moses.</hi> This Person, by his indiscreet and unnatural Irrision and exposing of his Father, incurrs his Indignation, and Curse. But, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>Noah</hi> does not lay the Curse upon <hi>Ham,</hi> who was actually guilty of the Crime, whether out of greater Tenderness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he being of the two near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er allied unto him, or for what other reason I shall not here enquire, but transferrs it to Canaan: <hi>Cursed be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, a Servant of Servants shall he be to his Brethren</hi>:<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> ix. 25, 26, 27.</note> to <hi>Shem</hi> and to <hi>Iaphet.</hi> Nay, which is still more, this was never inflicted upon <hi>Canaan</hi> in person, but upon his Posterity; and that not till many Generations afterwards, at such time as the <hi>Israelites</hi> returning out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> possest themselves of the Country of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and made <hi>them</hi> their Servants. The Story is so well known, that I shall not need to point it out to the Reader, who may peruse it at his leisure. 'Twas well on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a thousand Years before ever this Curse began to take effect: before the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were brought under Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from <hi>Shem</hi>: and a great many more before 'twas finally accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>they</hi> subjected unto the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99549:60"/>
of <hi>Iaphet.</hi> To conclude, 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a longer time before <hi>this,</hi> than it was before <hi>the other,</hi> the Curse upon the Earth, was fully brought about.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore to the other Point, the Tillage of the Earth before the Deluge. That there was Tillage bestowed upon it <hi>Moses</hi> does indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate in general and at large: but whether it was bestowed on all, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon some parts of that Earth: as also what sort of Tillage that was, and what Labour it cost, is not exprest; so that for all this we are at liberty, and may use our Discretion. For the present I must pass by the Enquiry: but in due place I hope to give some Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it, and to shew that <hi>their</hi> Agriculture was nothing near so labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and troublesome, nor did it take up so much time as <hi>ours</hi> doth. That's a Consequence of the Proof of the greater Fertility of that Earth; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain that the more it exerted that Fertility, the less need there was of Manure, of Culture, or Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to excite and promote it. Nor can any Man reasonably suspect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this mention of Tillage, that the Curse upon the Ground was come
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99549:61"/>
on, or that the primitive Exuberance of the Earth was lessened and abridged, before the Deluge; for <hi>Moses</hi> makes mention of Tillage before ever <hi>Adam</hi> was created: <hi>There was not,</hi> says he <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> ii.5.</note>, <hi>a man to till the ground</hi>: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there would have been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site such a Tillage as this which he speaks of in these three Chapters, tho' the Curse had never been denounc'd, or Man had not fallen. But 'tis high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable that upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Almighty God chased him out of Paradise, the fairest and most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of that Earth, into some other the most barren and unpleasant of all the whole Globe; the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to signifie his Displeasure, and to convince that unhappy Man how great a Misfortune and Forfeiture he had incurred by his late Offence. And here, above all other Parts of the Earth, there would be Work and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy for him, and for his Son <hi>Cain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much may serve for the present, to shew that my Account of the Antediluvian Earth is so far from interfereing with that which <hi>Moses</hi> hath given us, that it holds forth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unforc'd Interpretation of his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99549:61"/>
Sense on this Subject. There are a few other Passages in the same Author which may require some Explication: but they are none of them such that a Reader of moderate Understanding may not easily clear them, without my Assistance, so that I shall not crowd this Piece with them; for I fear 'twill be thought that I have already taken too great a liberty. The Compass that I am confined unto, by <hi>the Rules</hi> of this kind of Writing, is so narrow, that I am forced to pass over many things in silence, and can but just touch upon others. To lay down every thing at length, and in its full light, so as to obviate all Exceptions, and remove every Difficulty, would carry me out too far beyond the Measures allowed to a Tract of this Nature. That's the Business of the Larger Work, of which this is only the Module or Platform. In that Work I hope to make amends for these Omissions, and particularly shall consider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>What was the Reason that (in case the Terrestrial Globe was entirely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and there be now, and was then, a Space or Cavity, in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral parts of it, so large as to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to that mighty Mass of Water which covered the Earth at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>By what means the <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone, and Marble, acquired such a Solidity, as soon as the Matter, whereof they consist, had subsided, and was well settled to the bottom, as in <hi>Consect.</hi> 4. of this Part.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99549:64"/>
shall weigh their Arguments, detect the Invalidity of them, and prove, against them,</p>
               <p>That the Sand-Stone now in <hi>being</hi> is not as old as the Earth it self: nor hath it been consolidated ever since the Creation of the World, as some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have believed.</p>
               <p>That Sand-Stone does not now grow by <hi>Iuxtaposition,</hi> as they speak; that is by continual Addition of new Matter; in like manner as the Bodies of Animals and of Vegetables grow, and are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; as others were of Opinion.</p>
               <p>That Sand-Stone does not still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidate: <hi>i.e.</hi> that Matter which was, a few Years ago, lax, incoherent, and in form of Earth, or of Sand, does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come daily more hard and consistent, and by little and little acquire a perfect Solidity, and so turn to Stone; as others have asserted.</p>
               <p>That the Mountains of our Earth have not had <hi>being</hi> ever since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and stood as long as the Earth it self; as some Writers have thought.</p>
               <p>That the said Mountains were not raised successively, and at several times, being flung up or elevated by Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, some at one time, and some at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99549:64"/>
another, as those Earthquakes happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

though this Eruption was preceded by several Earthquakes (the Country all round having been frequently shaken for almost the space of two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) as those of <hi>AEtna, Vesuvius,</hi> and <hi>Hecla</hi> usually are, yet this Hill was not elevated or heaved up by any of those Earthquakes, but the Matter, whereof 'tis compiled, discharged out of the <hi>Volcano,</hi> as af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>That there have not been any <hi>Islands</hi> of note, or considerable extent, torn and cast off from the Continent by Earthquakes, or severed from it by the boisterous Allision of the Sea. That <hi>Sicily, Cyprus,</hi> the <hi>Negropont,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, which have been supposed by some to be only dismembered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Main-land, and anciently parted from it by one or other of these means, yet really never were so; but have been Islands ever since the time of the Noetick Deluge.</p>

that they are at this day found very seldom unless in this Peat-Earth, is meerly accidental; this Earth being of a bituminous and mild Nature; so that the Trees lay all this while, as it were, embalmed in it, and were by that means preserved down to our times; whilst those which chanced to be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other Earth, that was more lax and pervious, decayed in tract of time, and rotted at length, and therefore do not now appear at all, when we dig and search into those Earths; or if any thing of them do appear, 'tis only the Ruins, or some slight Remains of them; there being very rarely found any Trunks of Trees, in these laxer Earths, that are intire, or tolerably firm and sound. To conclude, from several of the aforesaid Circumstances I shall evince that these Trees could never possibly have been reposed thus by any other means than the Deluge: neither by Men: nor by Inundations: nor by Deterations<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99549:67"/>
rather, that I may be as brief as possible, and avoid all needless Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, to wave <hi>them</hi> for a while, till I have first offered what I have to say about <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Water</hi> therefore of the Globe, as well that resident in it, as that which floats upon it, is the Subject which I purpose here to prosecute. In order whereunto, I shall sub-divide this third Part into two Sections; the former whereof will comprehend what relates to the present and natural State of the Fluids in and upon the Earth: the other, what concerns that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Change of this State which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the Deluge, and how that Change was wrought.</p>
                  <p>At the Head of the first of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I prefix a new set of <hi>Observations touching the Fluids of the Terraqueous Globe</hi>: the Sea, Rivers, and Springs: the Water of Mines, of Cole-pits: of Caves, Grotts, and the like Recesses: as also concerning Vapours, Rain, Hail, and Snow.</p>
                  <p>And because this is a Subject of that vast Latitude that the Strength of one single Man will scarcely be reckoned sufficient effectually to cultivate and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99549:67"/>
carry it on, I have taken in the joint Assistance of <hi>other Hands,</hi> and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, to my own, all such <hi>Relations</hi> as I could procure from Persons whose Judgment and Fidelity might safely be relyed upon, about the Sea, Lakes, Rivers, Springs, and Rain, not only of this Island, but many other Parts of the World besides. Nor do I neglect those which are already extant in the <hi>Published Discourses</hi> of diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive Men.</p>
                  <p>From all which Observations, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those made by my self, I prove,</p>
                  <p>That there is a mighty <hi>Collection of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Water</hi> inclosed in the <hi>Bowels of the Earth,</hi> constituting an <hi>huge Orb</hi> in the interiour or central Parts of it; upon the Surface of which Orb of Water the terrestrial <hi>Strata</hi> are expanded. That this is the same which <hi>Moses</hi> calls the <hi>Great Deep,</hi> or <hi>Abyss</hi>: the ancient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Writers, <hi>Erebus,</hi> and <hi>Tartarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Water of this Orb <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with that of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> by means of certain Hiatus's or Chasmes passing betwixt it and the bottom of the Ocean. That they have the same common Center, around which the Water of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99549:68"/>
both of them is compiled and arranged; but in such manner, that the ordinary Surface of this Orb is not level with that of the Ocean, nor at so great a distance from the Center as that is, it being for the most part restrained and depressed by the <hi>Strata</hi> of Earth lying upon it; but wherever those <hi>Strata</hi> are broken, or so lax and porose that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can pervade them, there the Water of the said Orb does ascend: fills up all the Fissures whereinto it can get Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or Entrance: and saturates all the Interstices and Pores of the Earth, Stone, or other Matter, all round the Globe, quite up to the <hi>level</hi> of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Ocean.</p>

That tho' the quantity of Water thus rising and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99549:68"/>
falling be nearly certain and constant as to the <hi>whole,</hi> yet it varies in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Parts</hi> of the Globe; by reason that the Vapours float in the Atmosphere, sailing in Clouds from place to place, and are not restored down again in a Perpendicular upon the <hi>same</hi> precise Tract of Land, or Sea, or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from which Originally they arose, but <hi>any other</hi> indifferently; so that some Regions receive back more in Rain than they send up in Vapour: as, on the contrary, others send up more in Vapour than they receive in Rain: nay, the very same Region at <hi>one Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> sends up more in Vapours than it receives in Rain, and at <hi>another</hi> receives more in Rain than it sends up in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour; but the Excesses of one Region and Season compensating the Defects of the others, the quantity <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>falling</hi> upon the <hi>whole</hi> Globe is equal, however different it may be in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Parts</hi> of it.</p>

dense Marble and Sand-stone; for these give Admission to it, though in lesser quantity, and are always found satura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; which is the reason that they are softer, and cut much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, when first taken out of their Beds and Quarries, than afterwards, when they have lain some time exposed to the Air, and that Humidity is evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>

                  <p>That there is sometimes in Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Portion of the Abyss of that <hi>vast Extent,</hi> as to shake the Earth incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon it for so very large a part of the Globe together, that the Shock is felt the same Minute precisely in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that are many hundreds of Miles distant from each other, and this even though they happen to be parted by the Sea lying betwixt them: nay, there want not Instances of such an universal <hi>Concussion of the whole Globe</hi> as must needs imply an Agitation of the <hi>whole Abyss.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That though the Abyss be liable to these Commotions in all parts of it, and therefore no Country can be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exempted from the Effects of them; yet these Effects are no where very remarkable, nor are there usually any great damages done by Earthquakes, except only in those Countries which are <hi>mountainous,</hi> and consequently <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and <hi>cavernous</hi> underneath <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99549:79"/>
therein, is the Cause of the Shock; it naturally steering its course that way where it finds the readiest Reception, which is towards these Caverns; this being indeed much the case of <hi>Damps</hi> in Mines, whereof more by and by. Besides that those Parts of the Earth which abound with <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone, or Marble, making the strongest Opposition to this Effort, are the most furiously shattered, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much more by it than those which consist of Gravel, Sand, and the like laxer Matter, which more easily give way, and make not so great resistance; an Event observable not only in this, but all other Explosions whatever. But, above all, those <hi>Countries,</hi> which yeild great store of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Nitre,</hi> are by far the most injured and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by Earthquakes; these Minerals constituting in the Earth a kind of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Gunpowder, which, taking fire, upon this assembly and approach of it, occasions that murmuring noise, that subterranean Thunder (if I may so speak) which is heard rumbling in the bowels of the Earth during Earthquakes, and, by the assistance of its explosive Power, renders the Shock
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99549:80"/>
much greater, so as sometimes to make miserable Havock and Destruction. And 'tis for this reason that <hi>Italy, Sicily, Anatolia,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Greece</hi> have been <hi>so long</hi> and <hi>so often</hi> alarmed and harassed by Earthquakes; these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries being all Mountainous, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernous, abounding with Stone and Marble, and affording Sulphur and Nitre in great Plenty. But for a more particular History of the several <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> which precede, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and which follow after Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: for the Causes of those <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena:</hi> and for a more exact Account of the Origine, and the Oeconomy of this subterranean Fire, I must beg the Reader's Patience till the larger Work be made publick.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> That <hi>AEtna, Vesavius, Hecla,</hi> and the other <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> are only so many <hi>Spiracles,</hi> serving for the <hi>discharge</hi> of this <hi>subterranean Fire,</hi> when 'tis thus preternaturally assembled. That where there happens to be such a Structure and Conformation of the interiour Parts of the Earth as that the Fire may pass freely and without impediment from the Caverns, wherein it assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, unto these Spiracles, it then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99549:80"/>
and easily gets out, from time to time, without shaking or disturbing the Earth; but where such Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is wanting, or the Passages not sufficiently large and open, so that it cannot come at the said Spiracles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out first forcing and removing all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles, it heaves up and shocks the Earth, with greater or lesser Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, according as the quantity of the Fire thus assembled is greater or less, till it hath made its way to the Mouth of the <hi>Vulcano</hi>; where it rusheth forth, sometimes in mighty Flames, with great Velocity, and a terrible bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noise. That therefore there are scarcely any Countries, that are much annoyed with Earthquakes, that have not one of these Fiery Vents; and <hi>these</hi> are constantly all in Flames when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Earthquake happens; they disgorging that Fire, which, whilst underneath, was the cause of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster; and were it not for these <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula,</hi> whereby it thus gains an <hi>Exit,</hi> 'twould rage in the Bowels of the Earth much more furiously, and make greater havock than now it doth. So that though those Countries, where there are such <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s, are usually,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99549:81"/>
more or less, troubled with Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes; yet, were these <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s wanting, they would be much more troubled with <hi>them</hi> than now they are: yea in all probability to that degree, as to render the Earth, for a vast space around them, perfectly uninhabitable. In one word, so beneficial are <hi>these</hi> to the Territories where they are, that there do not want Instances of <hi>some</hi> which have been rescued and wholly delivered from Earthquakes by the breaking forth of a new <hi>Vulcano</hi> there; this continually discharging that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, being till then barricaded up, and imprisoned in the Bowels of the Earth, was the occasion of very great and frequent Calamities. That most of these Spiracles perpetually and at all Seasons send forth Fire, more or less; and though it be sometimes so little that the Eye cannot discern it, yet even then, by a nearer Approach of the Body, may be discovered a copious and very sensible Heat continually issuing out.</p>

                  <p>I have now finish'd the Account of this Section: and was just going to take off my hand here; but recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the foregoing Part of this Work <note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag. 96.</hi>
                     </note> I promised some further <hi>Proofs</hi> of <hi>Contrivance</hi> in the Structure of the Globe we dwell upon: and such too as may satisfie any fair and unbyass'd Spectator that the framing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:99549:83"/>Now though it were really so, that there were some such Eye-sores in our Earth as are here suggested: and that we could not presently find out all the Gayeities and Embelishments that we might seek for in it, the matter would not be great: and we might very well be contented to take it as we find it. But after all the thing is in truth quite otherwise, and there are none of all these wanting: nor any such Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are here imagined; but, on the contrary, so very many real Graces and Beauties, that 'tis no easie thing to overlook them all. Even this very variety of Sea and Land, of Hill and Dale, which is here reputed so inele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and unbecoming, is indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly charming and agreeable. Nor do I offer this as any private Fancy of my own, but as the common Sense of Mankind, who are the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges in the Case, both the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and Moderns, giving their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages unanimously herein; and even the Heathens themselves, have esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this variety not only ornamental to the Earth, but a Proof of the Wisdom of the Creator of it, and alledged it as such; whereof more in due place.</p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:99549:84"/>And, as I cannot admit that there is any thing unhandsome or irregular: so much less can I grant that there is any thing incommodious and Artless, or useless and Superfluous, in the Globe. Were I at full Liberty to do it here, 'twould be no hard thing to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there are no real Grounds for any such Charge. For how easie were it, by taking a minute and distinct Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Globe, and of the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and various Limbs and Parts of it, to shew that all these are ordered and digested with infinite Exactness and Artifice; each in such manner as may best serve to its own proper End, and to the use of the whole? How easie were it to shew, that the Rocks, the Mountains, and the Caverns, against which these Exceptions are made, are of indispensible Use and Necessity, as well to the Earth, as to Man and other Animals, and even to all the rest of its Productions? That there are no such Blemishes, no Defects: nothing that might have been altered for the better: nothing superfluous: nothing useless, in all the whole Composition? and so finally trace out the numerous Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps and Marks of the Presence and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99549:84"/>Interposition of a most wise and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Architect throughout all this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Fabrick? But I must reserve <hi>this</hi> for the larger Work, and content my self for the present with only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some brief Hints of it in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propositions. Namely,</p>
                  <p>That 'twas absolutely necessary for the well-being both of the Earth it self, and of all terrestrial Bodies, that some of the <hi>Strata</hi> should consolidate, as they did, immediately after the Subsidence of their Matter at the Deluge: that <hi>these</hi> should afterwards be broken in certain places: and lastly, that they should be dislocated, some of them elevated, and others depressed.</p>
                  <p>That had not the <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone and Marble become solid <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>AsPart</hi> 2. <hi>Cons.</hi> 4.</note>, but the Sand, or other Matter whereof they consist, continued lax and incoherent, and they consequently been as previous as those of Marle, Gravel, and the like, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which rises out of the Abyss, for the Supply of Springs and Rivers, would not have stop'd at the Surface of the Earth, but march'd directly, and without impediment, up into the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere, in all parts of the Globe wherever there was Heat enough in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99549:85"/>
the Air to continue its Ascent, and buoy it up; so that there then must needs have been an universal failure and want of Springs and Rivers all the Summer-Season, in the colder Climes: and all the Year round in the hotter and those that are near the <hi>AEquator,</hi> where there is much the greatest need of both the one and the other; and this meerly for want of the Interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such dense and solid <hi>Strata,</hi> to arrest the ascending Vapour to stop it at the Surface of the Earth: and to collect and condense it there.</p>
                  <p>That though the <hi>Strata</hi> had become solid, so as to have condensed the rising Vapour, yet if they had not been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken also, <note n="‖" place="margin">

                     </note> the Water must have lain eternally underneath those <hi>Strata,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever coming forth; so that there then could have been neither Springs nor Rivers for a very considerable part, or indeed, almost the whole Earth; the Water, which supplies these, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out at those Breaches <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cons. 8.</hi> supra.</note>. This Water therefore would have been wholly intercepted, all lock'd up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Earth, and its Egress utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd, had the <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone and Marble remained continuous, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99549:85"/>
without such Fissures and Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That these Fissures have a still further use, and serve for Receptacles of Metalls, and of several sorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; which are arrested by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in its passage thither through the <hi>Strata</hi> wherein the single Corpuscles of those Metalls and Minerals were lodged <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p>That though there had been both <hi>solid Strata</hi> to have condens'd the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Vapour: and <hi>those</hi> so broken too as to have given free Vent and Issue to the Water so condensed; yet had not the said <hi>Strata</hi> been dislocated likewise <note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Cons.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</note>: some of them elevated, and others depress'd, there would have been no Cavity or Chanel to give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the Water of the Sea: no Rocks, Mountains, or other Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Globe; and without these, the Water, which now arises out of it, must have all stagnated at the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and could never possibly have been refunded forth upon the Earth: nor would there have been any Rivers, or running Streams, upon the face of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99549:86"/>
the whole Globe, had not the <hi>Strata</hi> been thus raised up, and the Hills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the neighbouring Valleys and Plains; whereby the Heads and Sources of Rivers, which are in those Hills, were also borne up above the ordinary Level of the Earth, so as that they may flow upon a Descent, or an inclining Plane, without which they could not flow at all <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p>That this Affair was not transacted unadvisedly, casually, or at random: but with due Conduct, and just Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. That the quantity of Matter consolidated: the Number, Capacity, and Distances of the Fissures: the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, Magnitude, and Number of the Hills, for the condensing, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging forth the Water; and, in a word, all other things were so ordered as that they might <hi>best</hi> conduce to the <hi>End</hi> whereunto they were <hi>designed</hi> and ordained: and such provision made that a Country should not want so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Springs and Rivers as were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and requisite for it: nor, on the other hand, be over-run with them, and afford little or nothing else; but a Supply every where ready, suitable to the Necessities and Expences of each

                  <head>SECT. II. Of the Universality of the Deluge. Of the Water which effected it. Together with some further Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars concerning it.</head>
                  <p>IN the precedent Section I consider the present and natural State of the Fluids of the Globe. I ransack the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Caverns of the Earth: and search into the Storehouses of Water; and this principally in order to find out where that mighty Mass of Water which overflowed the whole Earth in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> is now bestowed and concealed: as also which way 'tis at this time useful to the Earth and its Productions, and serviceable to the present Purposes of Almighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>Such a Deluge as that which <hi>Moses</hi> represents, whereby <hi>All the high Hills that were under the whole Heaven were covered</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99549:88"/>
much to seek what was become of it, or where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> could ever find a Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory capable of containing it. 'Tis true there have been several who have gone about to inform them, and set them to rights in this Matter; but for want of that Knowledge of the present System of Nature: and that insight into the Structure and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Terraqueous Globe, which was necessary for such an Undertaking, they have not given the Satisfaction that was expected. So far from it that the <hi>greatest part</hi> of these, seeing no where Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nough to effect a <hi>General</hi> Deluge, were forced at last to mince the Matter, and make only a <hi>Partial</hi> one of it; restraining it to one single Country: to <hi>Asia,</hi> or some lesser por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Land; than which, nothing can be more contrary to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Narrative.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>the rest,</hi> they had recourse to Shifts which were not much better; and rather evaded than solved the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; some of them imagining that a quantity of Water, sufficient to make such a Deluge, was created upon that Occasion, and, when the business was done, all disbanded again and annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99549:88"/>
Others supposed a Conversion of the Air and Atmosphere into Water, to serve the turn. Many of them were for fetching down I know not what supercoelestial Waters for the purpose. Others concluded that the Deluge rose only fifteen Cubits above the Level of the Earth's ordinary Surface, covering the Valleys and Plains, but not the Mountains: all equally wide of Truth, and of the Mind of the Sacred Writer.</p>
                  <p>One of the last Undertakers of all seeing this, began to think the Cause desperate; and therefore, in effect, gives it up. For considering how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful the Attempts of those who were gone before him had proved: and having himself <note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Theory of Earth,</hi> l. 1. c. 2.</note> also <hi>employed his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st and utmost endeavours to find out Waters for the Vulgar Deluge:</hi> having mustered up all the Forces he could think of, and all too little: <hi>The Clouds above, and the Deeps below, and in the bowels of the Earth; and these,</hi> says he, <hi>are all the Stores we have for Water, and Moses directs us to no other for the Causes of the Deluge:</hi> he prepares for a Surrender, asserting, from a mistaken and defective Computation, that <hi>all these</hi> will not come up to near the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99549:89"/>
quantity requisite: and that <hi>in any known parts of the Vniverse, to find Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficient for this effect, as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally explained and understood, is,</hi> he thinks, <hi>impossible:</hi> that is, sufficient to cause <hi>a Deluge,</hi> to use his own Words, <hi>overflowing the whole Earth, the whole Circuit, and whole Extent of it, burying all in Water, even the greatest Mountains:</hi> which is, in plain terms, such a one as was <hi>explained and understood</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Generality of Writers since.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore thus over-hastily concluded that such a Deluge was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: and that all Nature could not afford Water enough to drown the whole Globe, if of the Circuit and Extent that now it is: he flies to a new Expedient to solve the Matter, and supposes an Earth of a Make and Frame much like that imaginary one of the Famous Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> 
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Princ. Pbilos.</hi> 1. 4.</note> which he makes to fall all to pieces, at the Deluge, and to contract it self into a lesser room, that the Water might the better surround and encompass it.</p>
                  <p>The sober and better sort of the Standers-by, and those who were Well-wishers to <hi>Moses,</hi> began to be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99549:89"/>
under some Concern and Uneasiness to see him thus set aside only to make way for a new Hypothesis: and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and weighty a Matter, as is this Tradition of the Universal Deluge, plac'd after all upon so very unsteady a Bottom. But that Concern encreas'd when they further heard him so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously decrying all former Notions of a Deluge: refusing to grant one upon any Terms but his own: and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily declaring, <hi>That all other ways assigned for the Explication of Noah's Flood are false or impossible.</hi> This was to reduce the Thing to a very great Streight: and surely an exposing and venturing of it a little too far. For if all the other Ways be false and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, should this, the only one left, prove at last so likewise, the Opinion of a Deluge would be left very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and defenceless, and we might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe or disbelieve it at pleasure; nay the negative part would of the two have much the Advantage, there being no reasonable Foundation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Deluge did come to pass this way.</p>
                  <p>Some Men there are who have made a very untoward use of <hi>this,</hi> and such
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99549:90"/>
a one that I am willing to persuade my self he never intended they should; yet it were to have been wish'd that he had been somewhat more wary. These cryed up this Computation of the Water as indisputable and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and then boldly gave out that such a Deluge as that described by <hi>Moses</hi> was altogether incredible, and that there never was nor could be any such Thing. Nothing was talk'd of amongst them under Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Falshood of it; which they vented with all imaginable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and would needs have it that they had here sprung a fresh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Argument against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickness of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Writings; which indeed is what they drive at, and a Point they very fain would gain.</p>
                  <p>For my part, my Subject does not necessarily oblige me to look after this Water: or to point forth the place whereinto 'tis now retreated. For when, from the Sea-shells, and other Remains of the Deluge, I shall have given undeniable Evidence that it did actually cover all Parts of the Earth, it must needs follow that there was then Water enough to do it, wherever it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99549:90"/>
may be now hid, or whether it be still in being or not. Yet the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to put a stop to the Insults and Detractions of these vain Men, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to enter a little farther into the Examination of this Matter; and that produced the former Section of this 3d Part; wherein I enquire what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Water of the Globe bears to the Earthy Matter of it; and upon a moderate Estimate and Calculation of the Quantity of Water now actually contained in the Abyss, I found that this alone was full enough, if brought out upon the Surface of the Earth, to cover the whole Globe to the height assigned by <hi>Moses</hi>; which is, fifteen Cubits above the Tops of the highest Mountains <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> vii. 20.</note>; the Particulars of which Calculation, shall be laid before the Reader at length in the <hi>Larger Work</hi>; for any one will easily see that there is so great an <hi>Apparatus</hi> of Things only Previous, which must needs be adjusted before I can come to the Calculation it self, that to descend to Particulars <hi>here,</hi> further than I have already <note n="‖" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>This done, I again set aside the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations about the Fluids of the Globe, introduced upon this Occasion in the other Section, as now of no further use: and reassume the Thread of the other Observations which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at the Beginning of this Work; and from them I shew,</p>

That they had not only a Memory and Tradition of it in general and at large: but even of several the most remarkable parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Accidents of it likewise; which they handed downwards, to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, for some time, with Notes of the greatest Terror, Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Consternation expressible.

That at length the Tradition, for want of Letters,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99549:93"/>
which were not then invented, or some other like means to preserve it, wearing out, and the reason of the Institution of this Worship being by degrees forgot, the After-Ages per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it to a somewhat different Sense and Intention: supposing that this was only a reverential Duty and Gratitude paid to the Earth as the Common <hi>Parent</hi> of Mankind, and because both Man, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures proceed out of it; by which means the true Notion of the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being lost, the Tradition of the Deluge, which was couched under it, was also thereupon at length suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lost; none of all these many Nations, in the latter Ages of the World, having any Memory or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, besides what they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recovered from the Jews and ancient Christians, who had it from the Writings of <hi>Moses.</hi> In <hi>Greece</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there were some other Accidents which perplex'd and impeded the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it in that Country, whereof I have already <note n="†" place="margin">

               <head>PART IV. Of the Origin and Formation of Metalls and Minerals.</head>
               <p>WHat I can advance, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Certainty, about the Fluids of the Globe: the Sea, Springs, Rivers, and Rain, I propose in the immediately foregoing, or Third Part of this Essay: As in the Second Part of it I dispatch the Solids: Stone, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Gravel, and all the other Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Matter of it, which is digested into <hi>Strata.</hi> That Part therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the far greater share of that Matter; and indeed all, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Metalls</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi>; which are found much more sparingly and in lesser Parcels; being either enclosed in those <hi>Strata</hi> (lying amongst the Sand, Earth, or other Matter whereof they consist) or contained in their perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Fissures. And <hi>these</hi> remaining
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99549:94"/>
still to be considered, I have allotted this Fourth Part to that Purpose.</p>
               <p>To write of Metalls and Minerals intelligibly and with tolerable p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, is a Task much more difficult than to write of either Animals or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables. For these carry along with them such plain and evident Notes and Characters either of Disagreement, or Affinity with one another, that the several Kinds of them, and the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Species of each, are easily known and distinguish'd, even at first sight; the Eye alone being fully capable of judging and determining their mutual Relations, as well as their Differences.</p>
               <p>But in the Mineral Kingdom the Matter is quite otherwise. Here is nothing <hi>regular,</hi> whatever some may have pretended: nothing <hi>constant</hi> or <hi>certain</hi>: insomuch that a Man had need to have all his Senses about him: to use repeated Tryals and Inspections, and that with all imaginable Care and Wariness, truly and rightly to discern and distinguish Things, and all little enough too. Here is such a vast va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> and those, many of them, so delusive, that 'tis very hard to escape Imposition and Mistake.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99549:95"/>
                  <hi>Colour,</hi> or outward Appearance, is not at all to be trusted. A common <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casite</hi> or <hi>Pyrites</hi> shall have the Colour of Gold most exactly: and shine with all the Brightness of it, and yet upon tryal, after all, yield nothing of worth, but Vitriol, and a little Sulphur: whilst another Body, that hath only the Resemblance of an ordinary Peble, shall yield a considerable quantity of Metallick and valuable Matter. So likewise a Mass, which, to the Eye, appears to be nothing but meer simple Earth, shall, to the Smell or Taste, discover a plentiful Admixture of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Alum, or some other Mineral.</p>
               <p>Nor may we with much better Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity rely upon <hi>Figure,</hi> or external Form. Nothing more uncertain and varying. 'Tis usual to meet with the very same Metall or Mineral, naturally shot into quite different Figures: as 'tis to find quite different kinds of them all of the same Figure.

'Tis the same also in Minerals; Nitre with Vitriol: Common Salt with Alum: Sulphur with Vitriol: and sometimes all five together. Nor do Metalls on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sort and herd with Metalls in the Earth: and Minerals with Minerals: but both indifferently and in common together: Iron with Vitriol, with Alum, with Sulphur: Copper with Sulphur, with Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea Iron, Copper, Lead, Nitre, Sulphur, Vitriol, and perhaps some more in one and the same Mass.

of any Metall or Mineral must be sought for in the constituent Matter of it: and it must be first brought down to <hi>that</hi> before any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judgment can be given.

               <p>
                  <hi>Metalls</hi> being so very useful and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Mankind, great Care and Pains hath been taken, in all Ages, in searching after them, and in separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and refining of them. For which reason 'tis that <hi>these</hi> have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enough <hi>distinguish'd,</hi> and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to six kinds, which are all well enough known. But the like pains hath not been taken in Minerals; and therefore the Knowledge of them is somewhat more confused and obscure. These have not yet been well reduced, or the number of the simple original ones rightly fixt; some, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Compounds, the Matter of two or more kinds being mix'd together, and, by the different Proportion and Modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that Matter, variously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised and diversifyed, having been reputed all different kinds of Minerals, and thereby the Number of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily multiplied.

That some Rivers do thus bring forth Spar, and other mineral Matter in great quantity, so as to cover and incrust the Stones, Sticks, and other Bodies lying therein, to a very considerable Thickness.

forth of the <hi>Strata,</hi> upon the Stones at the bottoms and sides of the said Springs: and affixing it upon Sticks, Straws, and other Bodies, and upon the Moss, or other Plants which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to grow therein, incrusting them over, in like manner as does the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Water of Rivers.</p>
               <p>That when the Heat at, and upon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> the Surface of the Earth is great, it not only mounts up the Water sent from beneath, and, along with it, the lighter Terrestrial Vegetative Matter <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>That wherever there happen to be any extraordinary Discharges of the Subterranean Heat: either <hi>Vulcano's,</hi> or lesser Spiracles, such as those about

                  <hi>Naples, Pozzuolo,</hi> and in other Parts of the World: <hi>Thermae,</hi> or <hi>Hot-springs</hi>: or fiery Eructations, such as burst forth of the Earth during Earthquakes: I say wherever there are such or the like Discharges of this Subterranean Fire, there likewise is mineral Matter, more or less, hurried up along with it. That even the Heat of the Sun, and indeed any other, though but an accidental Heat, hath the same Effect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the raising of mineral Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Earth.</p>
               <p>That <hi>AEtna, Vesuvius,</hi> and the other <hi>Vulcano's</hi> discharge forth, together with the Fire, not only metallick and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Matter in great quantity, but Sand likewise, and huge Stones, tossing them up sometimes to a very great height in the Air.</p>
               <p>That the Heat, which arises out of the <hi>lesser Spiracles,</hi> also brings forth along with it mineral Matter, and particularly Nitre, and Sulphur; some of which it affixes to the tops and sides of the Grotto's as it passes, which Grotto's are usually so hot as to serve for natural Stoves, or Sweating-Vaults: some it deposes near unto, and even upon, the Surface of the Earth; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

That the <hi>Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulae,</hi> or Medical Springs emit <hi>then</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a greater quantity of their Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals than usual: and even the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Springs, which were before clear, fresh, and limpid, become thick and turbid, and are impregnated with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur

and other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Minerals as long as the Earthquake lasts. That these Minerals do not issue out only at these larger <hi>Exits,</hi> but steam forth likewise through the Pores of the Earth, occasioning those sulphureous and other offensive Stenches which usually attend Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, and are the Cause of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and other <hi>malignant Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That these mineral Eructations arise in such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity up into the Atmosphere as to thicken, discolour, and darken it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a very great degree.</p>
               <p>That <hi>any Heat</hi> whatsoever, even an accidental one, such as is that which proceeds from the Bodies of <hi>Animals,</hi> and from their Excrements, promotes the Ascent of mineral Matter, but more especially of that which is subtile, light, and active, and is consequently move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able more easily, and with a lesser Power. That by this means <hi>Nitre</hi> (wherever there happens to be any in the Earth underneath) is raised in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Pigeon-Houses, and other like Receptacles of Animals: and in those
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99549:111"/>
places where their Dung lyes heap'd up. That 'twas this which occasioned, in some, an Opinion that Nitre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds forth of those Animals, and their Excrements; whereas it is found rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up, and convened or collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and as well in Buildings where Animals rarely or never come, as in those they ordinarily frequent; not to mention <hi>that</hi> which is found sometimes in considerable plenty at great depths in the Earth: in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Springs, of Rivers, of Lakes, and, in some Parts, even of the Sea it self; whereof more largely hereafter. That, in such places where the Earth contains Nitre within it, though there be no such adventitious Heat, if that Heat which is almost continually steaming out of the Earth be but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, its Dissipation prevented, and the Cold kept off by some Building or other like Coverture, <hi>this</hi> alone is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily sufficient to raise up the Nitre, and bear it out at the Surface of the Earth, (unless its Egress be impeded by Pavements, or the like Obstructions) and mount it up into the Air, as far as those Buildings will permit. For, the Cielings and Walls stopping it in its
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99549:111"/>
Ascent, it usually affixes, unto them, and settles there. And accordingly 'tis frequently found thus affix'd to the Walls and Cielings of Ground-Rooms, Cellars, and Vaults; and this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in such quantities as to form ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose <hi>Stalactitae</hi>

               <p>That the Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seasons being very intense, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating the exteriour or superficial parts of the Earth, it thereby-excites and stirs up those mineral Exhalations, in subterraneous Caverns, in Mines, and in Cole-pits, which are commonly called <hi>Damps.</hi> That it is for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that <hi>these</hi> seldom or never happen but in the Summer time; when, the hotter the Weather is, the greater and more frequent are the Damps. That besides <hi>this</hi> of the Sun, they are also sometimes raised by the Accession of <hi>other Heat,</hi> and particularly by the Fires which the <hi>Miners</hi> use in the Grooves, for breaking the Rocks, and for other Ends. That the Quantity of mineral Matter thus raised is according as there is more or less of it in those Mines,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99549:112"/>
especially of Sulphur, Nitre, and the like subtile and easily moveable Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: and as the Heat is <hi>there</hi> more or less intense. That this mineral Matter being sustained in the Air there, and floating about in the Mines, and Pits, it hits upon, and affixes it self unto, the Workmens Tools, to their Cloaths, Candles, or any other bodies that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr. That where there is any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of Sulphur in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation thus floating too and again, it takes fire at the Candles, burns with a blue Flame, and emits a strong sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Smell. That these Damps differ in their Effects according to the different Minerals that are the Cause of them; ours in <hi>England</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reducible to two kinds; whereof one is called the <hi>Suffocating,</hi> the other the <hi>Fulminating Damp.</hi> That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these extinguisheth the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, makes the Workmen faint, and vertiginous, and, when very great, suffocates, and kills them. The Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Damp will take fire at a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or other Flame, and, upon its Accension, gives a Crack or Report like the Discharge of a Gun, and makes likewise an Explosion so forcible as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99549:112"/>
sometimes to kill the Miners, break their Limbs, shake the Earth, and force Coles, Stones, and other Bodies, even though they be of very great Weight and Bulk, from the bottom of the Pit or Mine, up through the Shaft, discharging them out at the Top or Mouth of it, sometimes striking off the <hi>Turn</hi> which stands thereon, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all up to a great height in the Air; this being succeeded by a Smoak, which both in Smell, and all other respects, resembles that of fired Gunpowder; and is, as may appear from these and other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of it, nothing but an Exhalation of Nitre and Sulphur, which are the principal Ingredients of that Composition we call Gunpowder. That as these Damps are caused by Heat, so they are remedied by withdrawing that Heat, and by conveying forth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Steams; which the Miners effect by Perflations with large Bellows: by letting down Tubes, and sinking new Shafts; whereby they give free passage and motion to the Air, which venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and cools the Mines, purges and frees them from these mineral Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

That <hi>these</hi> mingling with, and being disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in, the Air, and passing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it into the Lungs in Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are by them transmitted into the Body, where they infect the Mass of Blood, create Perturbations and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Motions therein, and lay the Foundation of <hi>Pestilential Fevers,</hi> and other malignant <hi>Distempers.</hi> That 'tis for this reason that the Southern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are more frequently molested and incommoded by these Distempers than the Northern are: and that they are more rise and stirring in the hotter Months, in <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> than in the colder, <hi>December, Ianuary,</hi> and the rest. That 'tis indeed true, that in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> which are none of the hottest Months, these Diseases are oftentimes as epidemical as in the precedent and warmer Season: and do not abate and remit in proportion to the remission of the Sun's Heat in those Months; but this is purely accidental, and happens meerly because the Heat
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99549:114"/>
within the Surface of the Earth is not liable to so sudden Vicissitudes, or so quickly spent and dispersed, as is that which is upon it, and in the Air. <hi>This</hi> therefore, the Pores of the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still as free, and open, as ever, continues to send out the mineral <hi>Steams</hi> as before, but in lesser and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser quantity, answerably to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Diminution of this Heat. Which Steams, though now sent up to the Surface of the Earth only in lesser plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be much more offensive and mischievous than in the hotter Months when it came forth in far greater. For the Sun's power being in those Months also greater, it then straitways hurries these Steams up into the Atmosphere: whereas in the colder, its power being lessened, it cannot bear it up so fast; so that it stays and stagnates near the Surface of the Earth, swimming and floating about in that Region of the Air wherein we breath; where it must needs be much more pernicious than when born up to a greater height, and so farther out of the way. And this is indeed much the <hi>Case of Foggs</hi>: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of those which we frequently observe after Sun-setting, even in our
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99549:115"/>
hottest Months. These being nothing but a Vapour, consisting of Water, and of such mineral Matter as this met with in its passage, and could well bring up along with it. Which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour was sent up in greater quantity all the foregoing Day, than now in the Evening; but the Sun, <hi>then</hi> being above the Horizon, taking it at the Surface of the Earth, and rapidly mounting it up into the Atmosphere, it was not discernible, as <hi>now</hi> it is; because, the Sun being now gone off, the Vapour stagnates at and near the Earth, and saturates the Air till 'tis so thick as to be easily visible therein. And when at length the Heat there is somewhat further spent, which is usually about the middle of the Night, it falls down again in a <hi>Dew,</hi> alighting upon Herbs and other Vegetables, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if it happens, as sometimes it does, that this Vapour bears up along with it any noxious mineral Steams, it then <hi>blasts Vegetables,</hi> especially those which are more young and tender: blights Corn and Fruits: and is sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious even to <hi>Men</hi> who chance to be

So likewise for Rain; we learn from Experiment that there commonly falls in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and some other Countries, more Rain in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly,</hi> than in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi>; but it makes a much greater <hi>Shew</hi> upon the Earth in <hi>these</hi> Months than in <hi>those,</hi> because it lyes longer upon it; the Sun now wanting power to exhale and bear it up so quickly and plentifully as then it did. 'Tis also the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Halitus</hi> emitted forth of the <hi>Lungs</hi> of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99549:116"/>
Men and other Animals. In a <hi>Physio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Treatise,</hi> which I have by me, concerning the <hi>Structure and Vse of the Parts of Animals,</hi> discoursing of the Lungs, I shew that they are the grand Emunctory of the Body: that the main End of <hi>Respiration</hi> is continually to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and expell an excrementitious Fluid out of the Mass of Blood: and prove from several Experiments that there passes out of the Body a greater quantity of Fluid Matter this way, I mean upwards, and through the Lungs, than there does of Urine, by the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, downwards. Now the Fluid, which is thus secreted, and expired forth along with the Air, goes off with it in insensible parcels, in the Summer Season, when the ambient Air contains Heat enough to bear it quickly away, and so disperse it. But in the Winter, when the Heat without is less, it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becomes so far condensed as to be visible, flowing out of the Mouth in form of a Fume, or crasser Vapour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may, by proper Vessels, set in a strong freezing Mixture, the better to condense this Vapour, be collected in considerable quantity. But to return. That 'tis not without a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

Providence that there so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly happens, in the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> (the time when chiefly these mineral Steams stagnate thus at and near the Surface of the Earth) a very nipping and severe Season of <hi>Cold,</hi> far beyond what might, from the Sun's height and power, be then expected: beyond that of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November</hi>: and sometimes equal to that of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and the coldest Months: as also that there then so constantly happens very blustering and turbulent <hi>Winds</hi>; the Cold serving to check and put a stop to the Ascent of this mineral Matter: and the Wind to dissipate and convey away that which was before raised out of the Earth; which, was it not thus carried off, would be infinitely more fatal and pernicious to Man and other Animals than now it is. But I must be contented here to give only short Hints of these, as of other, Things: and to write but obscurely and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, untill I have opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my Sentiments of them with greater Copiousness, Freedom, and Perspicuity.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Scheme of my Design in this Part have I run over:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99549:117"/>
and lead my Reader a long and tedious Jaunt in tracing out these metallick and mineral Bodies: in pursuing them through their several Mazes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats: through the Earth, the Water, and the Air. And yet, long as it is, we are not got much further than the Borders of the Mineral Kingdom, and have done little more yet than settled and adjusted Preliminaries; so very ample is this Kingdom, so various and manifold its Productions. For the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conclusions relate only to the <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>Growth</hi> of these Bodies; the <hi>Natural History</hi> of each <hi>particular</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and Mineral, with the <hi>Observations</hi> whereon that History is grounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still to come. But I must be forced wholly to wave and supersede the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of these; for I perceive, do what I can, this Abstract will swell much beyond the bounds which I at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
               <p>This Fourth Part will be followed by several <hi>Treatises,</hi> serving to confirm, and to illustrate some Passages in it: whereof I shall at present only mention the <hi>four</hi> following.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Observations</hi> concerning English <hi>Amber:</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> from abroad, about the Amber of <hi>Prussia</hi> and other distant Places: with a <hi>Discourse</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, proving that Amber is not a <hi>gummons</hi> or resinous Substance drawn out of Trees by the Sun's Heat; and coagulated and hardened by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into Rivers, or the Sea, as the Ancients generally believed: but is a <hi>Natural Fossil,</hi> as Pebles, Flints, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritae,</hi> and the like, are: formed at the same time, and by the same means that they were: and all of it original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reposed in the <hi>Strata</hi> of Earth, Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with them. That
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99549:118"/>
it is indeed found in some places lying upon the Shores of the Sea, and of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: but 'tis also found at Land, and dug up (sometimes at very great depths) in the Earth; and this as well in Places very remote from any Sea, or River, as in those which are nearer unto them. That 'tis digged out of even the highest Mountains, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all other Parts of the Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently and indifferently, as the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritae,</hi> Agates, Jaspers, Pebles, and the rest, are. That wherever 'tis found upon the Sea-Shores, there also is it as certainly found at Land, up in the neighbouring Country: and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>Prussia,</hi> upon whose Shores so great a quantity of Amber is yearly collected, 'tis dug up almost all over the Country. That even that which now lyes loose upon the Sea-Shores, was all of it originally lodged in the Earth: in the <hi>Strata</hi> of Sand, Marle, Clay, and the like, whereof the neighbouring Land, and the Cliffs adjacent to those Shores, do consist; and wherever 'tis so found scattered upon the Shores, there is it as constantly found lodged in the Cliffs thereabouts. That when the Sea, at High-water, comes up unto,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99549:119"/>
and bears hard upon, the said Cliffs, and is agitated by Winds and Storms, it frequently beats down huge pieces of Earth from them; which Earth, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Water, is, by its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Agitation and Motion dissolved, and borne by degrees down into the Sea, being loose, and light, and so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily reduced into lesser Parcels, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and wash'd away: but the Pebles, <hi>Pyritae,</hi> Amber, or other like Nodules, which happened to be reposed in those Cliffs, amongst the Earth so beaten down, being hard, and not so dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and likewise more bulky and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, are left behind upon the Shores, being impeded, and secured, by that their bulk and weight, from being born along with the Terrestrial Matter into the Sea. That therefore the Sea is no ways concerned in the Formation of these Bodies: no more in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Amber, than of the <hi>Pyritae,</hi> Flints, and other mineral Masses that are found together with it: but only dislodges and discovers them, bears away the Earth wherein they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, washes off the Soil and <hi>Sordes</hi> wherein they were involved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and thereby renders them more
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99549:119"/>
conspicuous, apparent, and easie to be found. That this is so known and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced amongst the People who are employed to gather the Amber, that they always run down to the Sea-side after a Storm, for that purpose; and, if it hath been so great as to beat down part of the Cliffs there, they assuredly find Amber, more or less, upon the Seas Ebb and Retirement, and after every Retreat of the Sea for some Tides after; the Sea not bearing down the Earth immediately and all at once, but washing it off by little and little, and so discovering the Amber by degrees, some after one Tide, and some after another. That particularly the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Vitriolick <hi>Pyritae,</hi> and other like Bodies, that are found upon the Shores of <hi>Kent, Essex, Hampshire,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, all came first from the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cliffs, and were dislodged by this means; and are found in the Earth, as well as upon the Shores, whenever 'tis laid open, as in sinking Wells, Pits, and the like. That not only the Sea, but Rivers and Rains also, are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Detection of Amber; and other Fossils, by washing away the Earth and Dirt that before covered
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99549:120"/>
and concealed them. Thus the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Pyritae,</hi> or, as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, Gold-grains, Amethystine Pebles, Amber, and other Stones of Worth, are uncovered by such Rivers as chance to run through the Grounds which contain those Bodies in them. Thus likewise Rains, by their wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth down from off the Hills <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>. That although Amber be most commonly of a yellowish Colour, and therefore not unlike some kinds of Gums, yet there is found of it also of several other Colours, as black, white, brown, green, blue, and purple, to name no more. Yea the very same Lump is frequently of different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. That these Colours are all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, even the yellow it self, and owing to the Intermixture of foreign Matter, which concreted into the same Mass with the proper Matter of this Stone, and with the heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous

               <head>PART V. Of the <hi>Alterations</hi> which the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous Globe hath undergone since the time of the Deluge.</head>
               <p>IT now remains that we take a view of the <hi>Postdiluvian State</hi> of this our Globe: that we examine how it hath stood for this last four thousand years: that we enquire what Accidents have befallen it, and what <hi>Alterations</hi> it hath suffered since that wonderful Change it underwent at the Deluge.</p>
               <p>There have been some who have made a mighty Outcry about Changes and Alterations in the Terraqueous Globe. The Pretences and Pleas of each I consider in the first Part of this Essay: shewing that they are without any just ground: and that there are no Signs or Footsteps, in all the whole Globe, of any such Alterations. And indeed 'tis well for the World that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99549:122"/>
there are not; for the Alterations which they have fancied are such as turn all the wrong way: such as are without use, and have no end at all, or, which is worse than none, a bad one: and tend to the <hi>damage</hi> and <hi>detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> and its <hi>Productions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, some Alterations there are which it hath, and doth still undergo. This is what we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with Certainty: and there want not Instances enough sufficiently to vouch and attest it. But these Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations are of a quite different Strain: these are as <hi>amicable</hi> and <hi>benificent</hi> to the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial Bodies,</hi> as the other, were there really any such, would be pernicious and destructive to both. I have already <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 4. <hi>Cons.</hi> 4.</note> given some Intimations of the Changes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the <hi>interiour</hi> parts of the Earth, I mean the Transitions and Removes of Metalls and Minerals there: and shewn of what <hi>use</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> those Changes are to the <hi>World</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. Cons.</hi> 9.</note>. So that I may now pass freely on to consider those which befall the <hi>exteriour</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of it. And <hi>these</hi> are brought about silently and insensibly; and, which is the constant Method of Nature, with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99549:123"/>
all imaginable Benignity and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Here is none of the Hurry and Precipitation: none of the Blustering and Violence: no more than any of the direful and ruinous Effects, which must needs have attended those <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sititious</hi> Changes. And as these Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are not <hi>great,</hi> so neither are they <hi>numerous.</hi> I have made careful search on all hands, and canvass'd the Matter with all possible Diligence, and yet there are none that I can advance from my own Observations, but</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That the upper or outermost <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of Earth: that <hi>Stratum</hi> whereon Men and other Animals tread, and Vegetables grow, is in a perpetual Flux and Change; this being the common Fund and Promptuary that supplies and sends forth Matter for the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies upon the face of the Earth. That all Animals, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Mankind, as well as all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, which have had <hi>Being</hi> since the Creation of the World, derived all the constituent Matter of their Bodies, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, in all Ages, out of this Fund.</p>
               <p>That the Matter which is thus <hi>drawn</hi> out of this <hi>Stratum</hi> for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of these Bodies, is at length
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99549:123"/>
laid down again in it, and <hi>restored back</hi> unto it, upon the Dissolution of them; where it lies ready to be again assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and educed thence for the fitting forth of other like Bodies in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Succession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the constituent Matter of any one Body being proper, and turning thus naturally, when again refunded into this <hi>Stratum,</hi> to the Constitution of another like Body, there is a kind of Revolution or <hi>Circulation</hi> of it; so that the Stock or Fund can never pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be exhausted, nor the Flux and Alteration sensible.</p>
               <p>That as the Bodies which arise out of this Fund are <hi>various,</hi> differing very much, not only from one another, but the Members, Organs, or Parts of each individual amongst themselves: so likewise is the Matter of this Fund whereof they all consist. For though when confusedly blended and mingled, as it is whilst lying in this <hi>Stratum,</hi> it may put on a Face never so uniform and alike, yet it is in reality very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and consists of <hi>several Ranks, Sets,</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Corpuscles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the Corpuscles that are of the <hi>same Set,</hi> or <hi>Kind, agree</hi> in every
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99549:124"/>
thing, and are most exactly like unto each other in all respects: but those that are of <hi>diverse kinds, differ</hi> from one another, as well in Matter or Substance, in Specifick Gravity, in Hardness, in Flexibility, and several other ways, as in Bigness and Figure. That from the various <hi>Composures</hi> and Combinations of these Corpusoles together, happen all the Varieties of the Bodies formed out of them: all their Differences in Colour and outward Appearance, in Taste, in Smell, in Hardness, in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Gravity, and all other Regards; in much the same manner as that vast variety we see of Words arises from the various Order and Composition of the twenty four Letters of the Alphabet. But of this Matter, and of the Process and Method of Nature in the Formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bodies out of it, I shall treat more at large in the <hi>Discourse it self:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I shall also consider the Opinions of <hi>Others,</hi> particularly the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and, amongst the rest, of <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> about the <hi>Elements</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> of Natural Things: for I now hasten to propose the other Alterations that happen in the Terraqueous Globe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:99549:124"/>That <hi>Rocks, Mountains,</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> other Elevations of the Earth (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those whose Surfaces are yearly stirr'd and disturbed by digging, plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the like) suffer a continual Decrement, and <hi>grow lower</hi> and lower; the superficial parts of them being by little and little wash'd away by <hi>Rains,</hi> and <hi>born down</hi> upon the subjacent Plains and Valleys.

Yet something I have to offer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these, and the Causes of them, from the Observations of others. Not that the Thing is so very material, or that they make such havock of, and Alterations in, the Globe as some Men fancy. We have assurance from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, that <hi>AEtna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius</hi> have sent forth Flames, by fits, for this two or three thousand years, and no doubt but they have done so much longer; and yet we see both <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the Countries wherein those two Mountains stand, are still where they were: nay the very Mountains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are yet in Being, and have not suffered any considerable Diminution or Consumption, but are at this day the two highest Mountains in those Countries. What they have really suffered: by what means both <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> are occasioned: and what are their <hi>Effects</hi> upon the <hi>Globe,</hi> shall be fully and carefully considered in due place; from which Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

it will appear, that even <hi>these</hi> have their uses: and that, although they do make some lesser Alterations in some few Parts of the Earth, and sometimes molest and incommode the Inhabitants of those Parts, yet the Agent, whereby both the one and the other is effected, is of that indispensible <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> both to the Earth it self, to Mankind, and to all other the Productions of it, that they could not subsist without it.

So far from this, that it is very highly beneficial and serviceable to both; which will further appear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
               <p>That in the first Ages after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, when the number of Mankind, of Quadrupeds, and of the other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals was but small, the Vallies and Plains were more than sufficient for their Habitation and Use. And, by such time as that Stock of them was enlarged, that they were further spread and multiplied, and thereby the Earth so far peopled and replenish'd that the Hills and higher Grounds began to be needed; those Rocks and Mountains which in the first Ages were high, steep, and craggy, and consequently then inconvenient and unfit for Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; were by this continual Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration brought to a lower pitch, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99549:128"/>
more plain and even, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nearer to the ordinary Level of the Earth; by which means they were made habitable by such time as there was occasion for them, fit for Tillage, for the Production of Vegetables, of Corn, and other Necessaries, for the use of their Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>That although the <hi>Principal Intention</hi> in the Precipitation of the Vegetative Terrestrial Matter <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 89, 90.</note>, at the Deluge, and the burying it in the <hi>Strata</hi> underneath amongst the Sand, and other mineral Matter, was to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench</hi> and abridge the <hi>Luxury</hi> and Superabundance of the Productions of the Earth, which had been so ingratefully and scandalously abused by its former Inhabitants, and to cause it to deal them forth for the future more frugally and sparingly; yet there was a still <hi>further Design</hi> in that Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation: and the Matter so buried was to be brought up upon the Stage once more; being only reserved in store for the benefit of Posterity, and to be, by this Deterration, fetch'd out to light again to supply the Wants of the latter Ages of the World. For had these <hi>Strata</hi> of Stone, and other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

                  </note>; I say, had it not been for this, when the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Vegetative <hi>Stratum</hi> was once wash'd off, and born down by Rains, the Hills would have become all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly barren, the <hi>Strata</hi> below yielding only meer steril and mineral Matter, such as was wholly inept and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Formation of Vegetables. Nay, the Inconvenience would not have stop'd there, but have spread it self much further. For, the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Stratum</hi> being carried off, and the Devolution still continuing, the Matter of the lower or mineral <hi>Strata</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:99549:129"/>
being likewise by degrees borne down successively to the Roots and Bottoms of the Hills, and upon the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the Valleys and Plains, it would, as far as it reach'd, have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and buried the upper and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Stratum</hi> that was expanded over those Valleys and Plains, and render'd as much of them as it so covered also frustrate, steril, and unfruitful. So that by this means, in the latter Ages of the World, when the Earth should be fully peopled, and all Quarters and Corners of it stock'd with Inhabitants, and when consequently there would be the greatest need and occasion for its Productions every where, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Necessities of these its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Inhabitants, there would have been then much less than ever, a great part of the Earth being rendered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely barren; so that they might have e'en starved, had it not been for this Providential <hi>Reserve</hi>: this Hoord, if I may so say, that was stowed in the <hi>Strata</hi> underneath, and now season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably disclosed and brought forth.</p>

               <head>PART VI. Concerning the State of the Earth, and the Productions of it, before the Deluge.</head>
               <p>THE Thread of this Discourse draws now near to an End; and I have reason to fear that, by this time, the Reader, as well as my self, thinks it high time that it were quite spun out. For which reason I shall not any longer presume upon his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence farther than needs I must.</p>
               <p>In the five foregoing Parts of this Essay I lay down what I have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose relating to the Condition of the Earth during the time of the Deluge, and ever since that time. And here I am to make a Stand: to look a great way back: and make some Reflections upon the Posture of Things before the Deluge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99549:130"/>The Method I take may perhaps be censured by some as preposterous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thus treat last of the <hi>Antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Earth, which was first in order of Nature. But they will, I hope, let fall that Censure, when they are acquainted that 'tis a thing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and not of Choice: and that 'twas for want of Footing, and good ground to go upon, that I did not take that Earth under Consideration sooner. The truth is, there was no way for me to come to any competent Knowledge of it, or to give any sure Judgment concerning it, but meerly by Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and by Contemplation of the Shells, Bones, and other Remains of it, which are still in being. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could inferr any thing from <hi>these,</hi> it lay upon me to make out that they all belonged to the Earth, and were the genuine Products of it: to shew likewise how they became bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and disposed in the manner we now find them: and by what means they were preserved till now. And that is what I have been hitherto about; so that this is indeed but the proper place for this Disquisition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Earth: and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99549:131"/>
it could not well have been brought in before.</p>
               <p>Had there not been still remaining a great many Animal and Vegetable Bodies that were the legitimate Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springs of that Earth, 'twould have been an extravagant and impracticable Undertaking to have gone about to have determined any thing concerning it; and the more so because the Earth it self was dissolved and destroyed <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Cons.</hi> 2.</note>. But I prove that there are such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it, enclosed in great plenty in the Marble, Stone, and the other compacter <hi>Strata</hi> of the present Earth; whereby they have been preserved, through so many Ages, quite down to our Times: and are like to endure, many of them, much longer; even as long as the <hi>Strata</hi> themselves continue in the Condition they now are; and so will be a sure and lasting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Witness of the Truth of that extraordinary Accident (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Earth and of Mankind by the Deluge) to Posterity, quite down to the End of the World.</p>
               <p>Now because the Observations which I make use of in the former Parts of this Work give an Account of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99549:131"/>
the said Productions thus preserved, I proceed upon those Observations, as hitherto, and, by Inferences which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, clearly, and naturally flow from them, shew what was the Condition and State of <hi>that</hi> Earth, and wherein it differ'd from <hi>this</hi> we now inhabit.</p>
               <p>And in regard that, from a <hi>Theory</hi> which, how much soever it may relish of Wit and Invention, hath no real Foundation either in Nature or Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Author so often mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath set forth an imaginary and fictitious Earth: whose Posture to the Sun he supposes to have been much different from <hi>that</hi> which the Earth at present obtains, and <hi>such</hi> that there could be no Alteration of Heat and Cold, Summer and Winter, as now there is, but a constant Uniformity of Weather and Equality of Seasons <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That the Face of the Earth, before the Deluge, was <hi>not smooth,</hi> eaven, and uniform: but <hi>unequal,</hi> and distinguish'd with <hi>Mountains, Valleys,</hi> and <hi>Plains</hi>: also with <hi>Sea, Lakes,</hi> and <hi>Rivers.</hi>

But the Case was really much otherwise: and we have as good proof as could be wish'd that there were not any of all these wanting. The things many of them yet extant speak aloud for themselves: and are back'd with an early and general Tradition. For <hi>Moses</hi> is so far from being singular in thus relating that the Sea is of as old a <hi>Date</hi> and <hi>Standing</hi> as the Earth it self is, that he hath all, even the first and remotest Antiquity of his side; the <hi>Gentil Account</hi> of the Creation making the <hi>Ocean</hi> to arise out of the <hi>Chaos</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as soon as any thing besides.

               <p>Then for the Dimensions of the Sea; that it was as <hi>large,</hi> and of as great <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> as now it is, may be inferr'd from the vast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Multitudes of those Marine Bodies which are still found in all Parts of the known World <note n="†" place="margin">

Had <hi>these</hi> been found in only one or two places: or did we meet with but some few Species of them, and such as are the Products of one Climate or Country, it might have been suspected that the Sea was then, what the <hi>Caspian</hi> is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great Pond or Lake, and confined to one part of the Globe.

                  </gap> at least as great variety and plenty as they are observed at Sea: since likewise the fossil Shells are <hi>many of them</hi> of the same kinds with those that now appear upon the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shores, and <hi>the rest</hi> such as may well be presumed to be living at the bottom, or in the interiour and deeper

But of this more by and by.</p>
               <p>That the Water of the Sea was <hi>salt,</hi> as now it is, may be made out like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from those Shells and other the Productions of it; they being of the same constitution, and consisting of

the same sort of Matter that do the Shells at this day found upon our Shores <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>. Now the Salt wherewith the Sea-water is saturated, is part of the Food of the Shell-fish residing therein, and a main Ingredient in the Make of their Bodies; they living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, and upon the Mud and other Earthy Matter there.</p>
               <p>And that the Sea <hi>Ebbed and Flowed</hi> before the Deluge, may be inferr'd, not so moch from the Necessity of that Motion, and the many and great Uses of it in the Natural World <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conf. pag.</hi> 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 156.</note>, as from certain Effects that it had upon the Shells, and other like Bodies yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. 'Tis known that the Sea, by this Access and Recess, shuffling the empty Shells, or whatever else lies exposed upon the Shores, and bearing them along with it backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon the Sand there, frets and wears them away by little and little, in tract of time reducing those that are concave and gibbose to a flat, and at length grinding them away almost to nothing. And there are, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly, found Shells so worn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, amongst others, in Stone.</p>

of a Sea, so do the River-ones of <hi>Rivers</hi> in the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Earth. And if there were Rivers, there must needs also have been <hi>Mountains</hi>; for they will not flow unless upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity, and their Sources be raised above the Earth's ordinary Surface, so that they may run upon a Descent <note n="‖" rend="inter">Part 3. Sect. 1. Pag. 153. &amp; 154. <hi>The</hi> Theorist, <hi>I know, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses both the Antediluvian and the present Earth to be of an Oval Figure, and protended towards the Poles, as thinking that such a Figure would afford him a Plane so much inclined towards the AEquator, that the Rivers might flow upon it though there were no Mountains. But 'tis plain they could not. Nor are there any the least Grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the first Earth was of that Figure. If he had had any thing that had look'd like a Proof of it, he had done well to have produced it. But 'tis manifest though we imagine the Earth formed that way he proposes, it would not have fallen into any such Figure. And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Earth, 'tis of a Figure as different from that which he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs as it well could be; it being a</hi> Sphaeroides Prolatus, <hi>as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the late Discoveries concerning it.</hi>

Which yet cannot be; for the Historian here plainly makes these Mountains the Standards and Measures of the <hi>Rise</hi> of the Water; which they could never have been had they not been standing when it did so rise and overpour the Earth. His Intention in the whole is to acquaint us that all Land-Creatures whatever, both Men, Quadrupeds, Birds, and Insects, perish'd and were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Water, <hi>Noah</hi> only excepted, <hi>and they that were with him in the Ark.</hi> And at the same time, to let us see the Truth and Probability of the Thing: to convince us that there was no way for any to escape, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99549:137"/>
that none could save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by climbing up to the tops of the Mountains that then were, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us that <hi>they,</hi> even the highest of them, were all covered and buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water. Now to say that there were then no Mountains: and that <hi>this</hi> is meant of Mountains that were not formed till afterwards, makes it not intelligible, and indeed hardly common Sense.</p>
               <p>The extreme <hi>Fertility</hi> of both Sea and Land before the Deluge, appears sufficiently from the vast and almost incredible Numbers of their Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons yet extant <note n="*" place="margin">

clear from what hath been delivered in the Fourth Part of this Essay, which need not be repeated here. Nor is <hi>Moses</hi> defective in this Point <note n="†" place="margin">

For the truth of the Theory I am in no wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: the Composer of it must look to that; but that there were really both Metalls and Minerals before the Deluge, is most certain.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99549:139"/>
another for which we are also obliged to the same Author, that acquaints us there were <hi>both</hi> even in <hi>Paradise</hi> it self. 'Tis in his second Chapter <note n="*" place="margin">

The Water of the Abyss indeed changed its Place, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time: So did the Sea, and bore the Bodies it contained, many of them, out along with it. But for the Terrestrial Parts of the Globe, Metalls, Minerals, Marble, Stone, and the rest, they, though dissolved, and assumed up into the Water, did not flitt or move far, but, at the general Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, settled down again in or near the same Place from which they were before taken up. For the Water was all out upon the Face of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever <hi>these</hi> stirr'd, or were fetch'd up out of their native Beds: and they were all sunk down into the same Beds again, before the Water began to shift away back to its old Quarters; so that it could not contribute any thing to the Removal of them. Even the very Vegetables, and their Seeds, which were many of them naturally lighter than the Water, assisted by the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99549:140"/>
heavier Terrestrial Matter that had in this Jumble and Confusion fasten'd and stuck to them, fell all to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: and the Water was in great measure clear, and disengaged from the Earthy Mass, before it went off. And 'twas well it was so; for had the Mineral Matter of the Globe not been held to its former Station, but hurried about and transposed from place to place, 'tis scarcely to be conceived how many and great Inconveniences it would have occasioned. The same likewise for Vegetables.

Accordingly we now find of these Trees in Islands, and the other bleaker and colder Parts of the Earth, where none now do, or perhaps ever did, grow <note n="*" place="margin">

And there they are of mighty use to the Inhabitants, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a Supply of Timber which their own Country doth not yield, and which they employ not only for Fewel, which yet is much needed in those cold Countries, but for Building likewise, and many other Purposes; whereas in the Places whence they were thus dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they would have been useless, yea but an Incumberance, and might be easily spared, for as long as the <hi>Seeds</hi>

remained behind, lodged in a natural and agreeable Soil, all was safe enough: <hi>they</hi> would soon vegetate, and send forth a <hi>new</hi> Sett of Trees there, so that 'twas not much matter what became of the Old ones. But to the Parts whereunto they were thus removed, they are of great advantage. And, which is in truth very remarkable, and an Argument that there was something more than meer Chance in this Affair, there are hardly any Countries that are destitute of Timber of their own growth, which have not a very large Supply of these Stray-Trees, if I may so call them. But to proceed. After that the Terrestrial Matter was once sunk down into its several Beds, and well settled there, the Mountains were cast up, and the Springs and Rivers burst forth, in such Numbers, and at such Distances from one another, in all Parts of the Globe, as best answered the Necessities and Expences of <hi>each</hi>: and therefore undoubtedly in much the same Places that they were before the Deluge. All Things were so contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ordered in the re-sitting up the Globe at this time, that they might best execute and perform each their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99549:141"/>
several Ends and Offices. There were the same Measures taken, and the same Process used in this Re-formation of it, that were when 'twas first built: and much such an Earth arose out of the <hi>Deluge,</hi> as at the Creation, sprung out of Nothing <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. pag.</hi> 97. <hi>supra.</hi>
                  </note>. But the Reader will more clearly discover all this, with the Reasons of it, if he give but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the trouble to compare <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>Cons.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; seq.

This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, 'twould be, I think, not strange should we find <hi>Paradise</hi> at this Day where <hi>Adam</hi> left it: the same Rivers: the same Face of the Ground: the same <hi>Metalls</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> that then there were. And I the rather Note this, because I see there are some so earnest in quest of it. Learned Men have been now a long time a search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the happy Country from which our first Parents were exiled. If they can find it, with all my heart: and there have been some that have sought it with that Industry that I think they deserve it for their pains whenever they make the Discovery.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99549:142"/>
To deal freely, I am of opinion there's no part of the present Earth that does come up fully to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Paradise. The Country about <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Bagdet,</hi> bids fairest for it: and I am persuaded that it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. But if so, whoever shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this Country, as now it stands, with <hi>that</hi> Description, will find that it sustained some Alterations from the Deluge, perhaps more than any Part of the Earth besides. And there's an obvious Reason why it should. There was a Paradise before, but was to be none after the Deluge. The Case was altered, and the Reason of the thing ceased. So that <hi>all</hi> that denominated it Paradise, and that distinguish'd it from the rest of the Globe, was lop'd off by the Deluge, and <hi>that</hi> only left which it enjoyed in common with its neighbour Countries. Upon the whole, 'tis, I think, apparent that what I offer in this Discourse is so far from doing any Diskindness to the Cause these Gentlemen are, and have been so long, engaged in, that it does them a real Service, and helps them out with the main thing whereat they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99549:142"/>
stuck: fairly solving all Difficulties in the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Relation of Paradise. Wherefore now to proceed to the last Head to be discuss'd, the Vicissitude of Seasons, Summer and Winter, Hot and Cold, in the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> World.</p>
               <p>And that there really was such a <hi>Vicissitude</hi> we need not go any further for proof than to the aforesaid Animal and Vegetable Bodies still preserved; the general Tenour of them speaking it out so plainly as to leave no room for doubt. There are, we know, some sorts of Vegetables which consist of Particles very fine, light, and active: and which therefore require only a smaller degree of Heat to raise them <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that for the raising of <hi>these,</hi> the Suns Power, when only lesser, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. And therefore they begin to appear in the earlyer Months, in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> and <hi>March</hi>; when they first peep forth of the Ground: after a while they display themselves, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their whole Tire of Leaves: then their Flowers: next their Seeds: and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99549:143"/>
lastly when, in the following Months, <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> the Sun is further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and (to speak in the Phrase of the Vulgar, which I choose all along for the sake of plainness) hath gained a greater strength, the Heat becomes too powerful and boisterous for them; it now mounting up the Terrestrial Matter with such force and rapidity, that the Plants cannot assume that part of it which is proper for their Nourishment, as it passeth through them, nor incorporate it with them, as before they were wont when it pass'd more gently and leisurely. Nay the Heat at length grows so great, that it again dissipates and bears off those very Corpuscles which before it brought; the Parts of these Plants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very tender, as consisting of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles which are extremely small and light, and therefore the more easily dissipable. So that then these Plants dye away, shrink down again into the Earth, and all, save only their Roots and Seeds, vanish and disappear. But when the Sun's Heat is thus far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, 'tis but just come up to the pitch of another Sett of Vegetables;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99549:143"/>
and but great enough to excite and bear up the Terrestrial Particles, which are more crass and ponderous. And therefore those Plants which consist of <hi>such,</hi> begin then to shoot forth, and display themselves. So that the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> present us with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crop and <hi>Order</hi> of Plants. For the same reason also, <hi>Iune, Iuly,</hi> and <hi>August</hi> go farther, and exhibit a still different Shew of Vegetables, and Face of Things. But when, in the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> the Sun's Power is again diminish'd, and its Heat but about equivalent to <hi>that</hi> of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> it again suits the Plants which were <hi>then</hi> in season, so that they many of them spring up afresh in <hi>these</hi> Months, and flourish over a-new, in like manner as before they did in <hi>those</hi>; till being check'd by the Cold of the succeeding Winter, the Sun being gone0off, and having now no longer Power great enough to bring up and supply them with fresh Matter, they presently begin to decline for want thereof, and at length quite dwindle away and disappear, untill the Arrival of the Spring Season, when they take
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99549:144"/>
their <hi>Turns</hi> over again as formerly. Yea the more tender and frigitive Parts, the Leaves, and the like, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the more sturdy and vigorous Vegetables, Shrubs, and Trees, suffer the same Fate, and fall off for want of the Supply from beneath; those only which are more tenacious, consistent, and hardy, enduring the Brunt, and making a shift to subsist for the time without such Recruit and Reparation. 'Tis therefore, we see, most apparent that this Succession of <hi>Things</hi> upon the Face of the Earth, is purely the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and Effect of the Vicissitude of Seasons: and is as constant and certain as is the Cause of that Vicissitude, the Sun's Declination: so certain, that were a Man kept for some time blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, in such manner that he could have no Notice how the Year pass'd on, and were at length turn'd forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next Field or Garden, he would not need any other Almanack to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him what Season of the Year it then was.</p>
               <p>But if instead of this <hi>Variation</hi> of Heat, we suppose that there was an <hi>Equality</hi> or constant Temperature of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99549:144"/>
it before the Deluge, which is what the <hi>Theorist</hi> contends for, the Case would be very much altered, and <hi>that</hi> altogether for the worse. A Man can hardly at first imagine what a Train of ill Consequences would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from such a Condition and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Things; of which 'twould not be the least that such a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heat would deprive the World of the most beautiful and the most useful Parts of all the whole Creation: and would be so far from exalting the Earth to a more happy and Paradisia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State, which is what he brought it in for, that 'twould turn it to a general Desolation, and a meer barren Wilderness, to say no worse. Such an Heat would be too little for some sorts of Vegetables, and too great for others. The more fine and tender Plants, those which will not bear a degree of Heat beyond that of <hi>April,</hi> would be all burnt up, and destroyed by it: whilst it could never reach the more lofty and robust, nor would there be near Heat enough to ripen their Fruits and bring them to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nothing would suit and hit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:99549:145"/>
                  <hi>all,</hi> and answer every End of Nature, but such a gradual Increase and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Heat as now there is. I must not descend to the <hi>Animal</hi> World, where the Inconveniences would be as many and as great as in the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:</hi> and such a Situation of the Sun and Earth as that which the <hi>Theorist</hi> supposes, is so far from being prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>this</hi> which at present obtains, that this hath infinitely the Advantage of it in all respects.</p>
               <p>Be that how it will, for I have no need to insist upon it, but may take the thing in his way, and suppose that such a Temperature would have all the happy Effects that he expects from it; yet there is one very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Vegetable Remains of <hi>that Earth,</hi> which affords us a sure and plain Indication that there was not then any such Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. From <hi>these</hi> it clearly appears that there was the same Order and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Things upon the Face of the Earth that there is at this time. Now this Succession being, as we have seen, caused meerly by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the Sun's Heat, it must needs
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99549:145"/>
follow, that there was <hi>then</hi> the same Variations of it, and consequently the same Alternations of Seasons, that <hi>now</hi> there is. Had there been an Equality of Heat, if we grant that it could have produced all the Plants in Nature, which 'tis impossible it ever should, it must have done it indifferently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly. There could be no reason why they should flourish at any one set time rather than another; that's peculiarly the Effect of the Sun's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation. So that they must needs have been all in Confusion, and this Succession of Things would have been quite overturned. The Plants which now appear in the most different and distant Seasons, would have been all in Prime, and flourishing together at the same time: so that they would have had <hi>February</hi> and <hi>May, Iuly</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> all in one Scene. Nay, the several Individuals of the same kind must have been as greatly at odds: one arrived to Seed, and that fully ripe, and ready to shed, whilst ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not so much as come to Flower, but in as differing a State and Hue as can be. In brief, there
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99549:146"/>
would have been all the Diversity, Uncertainty, and Disorder, in the Vegetable Kingdom that can well be conceived. Which indeed is no more than what he freely owns: telling us that then <hi>Every Season was a Seed-time to Nature, and every Season an Harvest.</hi> This is what he does, and must grant: and this is as much as is needful for the overturning his Hypothesis. For the Vegetable Remains of that Earth say no such thing: they give not any the least Countenance to these Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but the quite contrary: and <hi>these,</hi> being many of them enclosed in very fine and close Stone, are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this day very curiously and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to Admiration. By <hi>them</hi> we may easily judge how Things then stood. And there is so great an Uniformity, and general Consent amongst them, that from it I was enabled to discover what time of the year it was that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi> began<note n="†" rend="inter">

There are some <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Animal Remains of <hi>that Earth</hi> which afford us more Arguments to the same purpose, and those not less concluding than the others; but these I shall wholly wave for the present, there being indeed no occasion to make use of them here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:99549:147"/>I shall now only look a little into the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Archives, to observe what they furnish us with upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and I have done; for I perceive I have, before I am aware, much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Measures I design'd, which on so copious a Subject 'twas hard not to do. Gen. 1.14. <hi>And God said, let there be LIGHTS in the Firmament of the Heaven, to divide the Day from the Night: and let them be for Signs, and for SEASONS, and for Days and Years.</hi> This Passage, we see, does not at all favour the Opinion that there was no Variation of Seasons before the Deluge: so far from it, that should a Man go about with never so set Study and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to describe such a Natural Form of the Year as is that which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent establish'd, he could scarcely ever do it in so few Words again that were so fit and proper, so full and express; especially if, by <hi>Signs,</hi> in this place, <hi>Months</hi> are intended, for then we have here first the <hi>Year:</hi> and that subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into its usual Parts, the four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or <hi>Seasons,</hi> the twelve <hi>Signs</hi> or Months, and <hi>Days</hi>; nay at the same time, from the 19th Verse, we learn that this Establishment is, within four
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99549:147"/>
days, as old as the World. But further, Gen. viii. 21, 22. <hi>And the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground, — neither will I again smite any more every thing living as I have done. While the Earth remaineth, Seed-time and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and Cold and Heat, and Summer and Winter, and Day and Night, shall not cease.</hi> This was pronounc'd upon <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrificing, at his coming forth of the Ark, after the Deluge was over: and implies, that there had indeed then lately been a mighty Confusion of Things, for the time: an Interruption and Perturbation of the ordinary Course of them: and a Cessation and Suspension of the Laws of Nature: but withall gives Security and Assurance that there should never be the like any more to the End of the World: that for the future they should all run again in their old Chanel: and that particularly there should be the same <hi>Vicissitudes of Seasons,</hi> and <hi>Alternations of Heat and Cold</hi> that were <hi>before the Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
