            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ABout the tenth hour in the morning, as I was at my Employments, the glory of the Lord God ſhin'd round about me, and I was taken ſo with the glory of God, that I beheld no other thing, and in that I laid me down a little while flat upon the floor, and after a little time, I ſaw beneath this, a great Pit, out of which there aroſe a mighty great ſmoak, and all the Inhabitants of the earth was even ready to joyne hand in hand together, and out of the Pit aroſe a mighty great power, after which power the Inhabitants of the earth went forth, and followed it to their deſtruction: So this is a great day that the glory of the Lord doth ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly appear, that it even covereth the whole earth, and as this day is great and the glory of it is greater, ſo as no mortal eyes can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, ſo will the daies be that is coming upon the earth, when this glory ſhall be hid in God from the eies of all men: then ſhall woe, lamentations and wailings be upon all people who refuſeth to receive the Lord of glory in this his day, for this is a day that he profers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to dwell with the Sons and daughters of men, and this is to all you who refuſe to receive the Lord of life and glory, a great day of gloomineſs and thick darkneſs is ready to come over you, then O your wailing, O your mourning, and O your lamentations, that you had made better uſe of the daies and time that you had upon the earth, when the Lord Chriſt Jeſus preached himſelf in your ſtreets, and in your high-waies in and through his Servants and handmaids, whom he had made choice of to preach the everlaſting Goſpel of glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; but you would not beleive though the noiſe of wiſdome was oft heard in your ſtreets, Market places and Steeple houſes, now what pitty and compaſſion ſhall I take over you O you Sons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> Oh my bowels within me is filled with pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that you would yet return whiles there is a little ſpace and a little time before the glory withdraw it ſelf from you.</p>
