            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and patronage, I know there will be as much to doe in

the conquest of the Golden Fleece, the Apples of the Hesperides, or the
sauing of <hi>Andromeda</hi> by <hi>Perseus:</hi> &amp; but that your valiant atchieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

are knowne and approued, I would neuer haue put my Goose to
your inuincible Guard, the enemies that will assault you, or attempt to
take her from you, are many, whom in duteous courtesie I will describe
vnto you: First, the Powlters will assaile you with a terrible battry of
rotten Eg-shot, to surrender the innocent Goose, that they may murder,
embowell, pull, plucke, and prostitute her to the sale of who giues most.
Secondly, the Vpholsters will come vpon you with a fresh Alarum for
her feathers, to stuffe the empty paunches of their Bolsters, Pillowes,
and hungry Bed-tikes. Thirdly, the Crokes in squadrons, arm'd with
Dripping-pannes and Spits in stead of Speares, before they will loose
their Fees, (and the luking of their fingers to boote) will fight hotly
for the Goose till all smoke againe. Fourthly, the Apothecaries (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they will want the sweetnesse of the pinguidity or fecundious
fat of the Gooses auxungia (vulgarly called greace) they will so pelt
you with pills in stead of pellets, that they will make all stinke againe.
Fiftly, the Kitchin-mayde will throw scalding water at you, but shee
will haue one of her wings to sweepe downe Cobwebs, and dispossesse
Spiders of the habitations they haue built out of their owne bowels.
Sixtly, the Fletchers, and Archers, sweare they will pinke your skinne
sull of Ilot-holes, but they will haue her pynions to make them flye swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dead then the Goose could liuing. Seauenthly, the Poets for her
Quils will call another penny-lesse threed-bare Parliament, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
Satiricall Statutes, and Tragicall Acts against you, and with
their scattered imaginations they will scale the skyes as high as sullen
<hi>Saturnes</hi> Altitude, and rake into the lowest profundity of Barra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum,
forraging through the earth, ayre and seas; but they will stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
cauterize, Epigramatize, and Annagramatize you, till you make
a surrender. Eightly, the Lawyers will firke and firret you, tossing
you betwixt hard fortune and ill lucke, that you will be almost mad, or
be in great danger to haue very little wit left. Ninthly, the Scriueners,
publike Notaries, or notorious Publicans, will not onely ioyne with the
Lawyers and the Poets against you: but they will neuer procure you any
<pb facs="tcp:26363:2"/>
money when you neede, without excessiue brokage, great eredit, or good
security. Tenthly, Shop-keepers (if you hold the Gooses Quils from
them) haue sworne that they will euer keepe you cut of their bookes.
And lastly, Schoole-boyes will throw whole voleyes of stones at you,
where euer they see you, if you alow them not Pennes, though it be but
to scrible or make Iewes letters.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing laide open to your Herculean view, the labours and
dangers that you are like to suffer in protecting the Goose, Now I
thinke it fit (vnder correction) to closevp my Dedication with some
dutifull counsell, that though your enemies are mighty and many, and
that they doe preuaile against you, and with their multitude take from
you both the flesh and feathers of the Goose, (which indeede belongs
not to you, nor doe I dedicate them to you) yet here is your true honour,
and that which makes all men admire you, that her better part, her
genious, her intellectuall vnderstanding, her capacity; and reuerend
grauity, her wisedome, and her very spirit; neither man, deuill or
Dragon, is able to bereaue you of, as long as you haue a sword to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it. I haue dedicated a Booke of a <hi>Begger</hi> at this time to <hi>Archy,</hi>
but most noble Sir, onely to you my Goose, so leauing you. Not doubting
of your acceptance, and protection: I wish you such encrease of honor
as is suteable to your Heroick endeuours, and vnimitable wisedome.</p>

            <l>Away the melancholly Goose return'd,</l>
            <l>And in a banke of Reede she sate and mourn'd,</l>
            <l>Complaining 'gainst the hatefull multitude,</l>

            <l>To value her with any other Bird,</l>
            <l>Comparisons are weake and meere absurd:</l>
            <l>First for her flesh, she is mans dayly fare;</l>
            <l>She's good, she's cheape, she's plenty, and she's rare:</l>
            <l>Bake her, or rost her, vse her as you will,</l>
            <l>And Cooke her as she should be,<note place="margin">A good Goose.</note> she's good still:</l>
            <l>But as great summes are made with little driblets,</l>
            <l>So put the Hares head 'gainst the Gooses giblets;</l>
            <l>And men may peice a dinner vp (perhaps)</l>
            <l>Which otherwise would rise with hungry chaps:</l>
            <l>For the olde Prouerbe, I must here apply,</l>
            <l>Good meate men may picke from a Gooses eye.</l>

            <l>THen there's a Goose that breeds at <hi>Winchester,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And of all Geese, my minde is least to her:</l>
            <l>For three or foure weekes after she is Rost,</l>
            <l>She keepes her heate more hotter then a tost.</l>
            <l>She's seldome got or hatch'd with honesty,</l>
            <l>From Fornication and Adultery,</l>
            <l>From reaking Lust, foule Incest, beastly Rape,</l>
            <l>She hath her birth, her breeding, and her shape.</l>
            <l>Besides Whoremongers, Panders, Bawdes and Pimpes,</l>
            <l>Whores, Harlots, Curtezans, and such base Impes,</l>
            <l>Luxurious, leacherous Goates, that hunt in Flockes,</l>
            <l>To catch the Glangore, Grinkums, or the Pockes.</l>
            <l>Thus is she got with pleasure, bred with paine,</l>
            <l>And scarce ere comes where honest men remaine.</l>
            <l>This Goose is worst of all, yet is most deare,</l>
            <l>And may be had (or heard of) any where.</l>
            <l>A Pander is the Cater, to the Feast,</l>
            <l>A Bawde the Kitchin Clerke, to see her drest.</l>
            <l>A Whore the Cooke, that in a pockey heate,</l>
            <l>Can dresse a dish fit for the Deuill to eate.</l>
            <l>The hot whore-hunter for the Goose doth serue,</l>
            <l>The whilst the Surgeon, and Physitian carue.</l>
            <l>The Apothecary giues attendance still,</l>
            <l>For why the sauce lyes onely in his Bill.</l>

            <l>Their like; that's but a payre of sheeres betweene.</l>
            <l>And one of them (to set them truely forth)</l>

            <l>This Goose is no way to be tollerated,</l>

            <l>For one of these, if it be let alone,</l>
            <l>Will eate the owner to the very bone,</l>
            <l>Moreouer, it from Nature is contrary,</l>
            <l>And from all other Creatures quite doth vary:</l>
            <l>For of all breeding thinges that I could heare,</l>
            <l>The Males doe still beget, and Females beare.</l>
            <l>But this hath euer a Dam masculine</l>
            <l>Engendred by a Father Feminine.</l>
            <l>Quite kim kam, wiw waw, differing from all other,</l>
            <l>The Sire's a Female, and a Male the Mother.</l>
            <l>But cease my Muse soyle not thy purer straine,</l>
            <l>With such contagious mud, rowze rowze againe</l>

            <l>ANd thus for Shooters hauing shew'd my skill,</l>

            <l>Great <hi>Mars</hi> his Trayne of Millitary men</l>

            <l>Many diuine and heauenly mysteries,</l>

            <l>But that the Gooses Quill with full consent,</l>
            <l>Was found to be the fittest Instrument</l>
            <l>To be their <hi>Nuntius,</hi> and to disperse</l>
            <l>Their glory through the spacious Vniuerse.</l>

            <l>Through the Goose Quill distils it's Quintessence:</l>
            <l>Logick with difinitions (I am sure)</l>
            <l>Were nothing, or else very much obscure:</l>

            <l>And Musick in poore case would be o're-throwne,</l>

            <l>Her Quill is all his onely working toole:</l>
            <l>And sure a Goose is of a wondrous nature,</l>

            <l>Doth bite most dangerously with her quill,</l>
            <l>Yet is she free from prodigality,</l>
            <l>And most of all bites partiality:</l>

            <l>And rankle to a begger,<note place="margin">A shrewd biting beast</note> little better.</l>
            <l>She oft hath bit a Gallant from his land</l>
            <l>With quick conueyance, and by slight of hand</l>
            <l>Sometimes her biting is as durable</l>
            <l>As is a Gangren, most incureable,</l>
            <l>And many that into her fangs doe fall,</l>

            <l>A Forger, or a Villaine that forsweares,</l>

            <l>On me her power she many times hath showne,</l>
            <l>And made me pay more debts then were mine owne.</l>
            <l>Thus doth her Quill bite more then doth her chaps,</l>

            <l>They say in Latine that a Gooses name</l>

            <l>The Sauce is onely somewhat sharpe and deare,</l>
            <l>There (e're they scarce haue feathers on their backe)</l>
            <l>By hundreds and by heapes they goe to wracke,</l>
            <l>There is such Baking, rosting, broyling, boyling,</l>
            <l>Such swearing, drabbing, dancing, dicing toyling,</l>
            <l>Such shifting, sharking, Cheating, smoaking, stinking,</l>
            <l>Such Gormondizing, Cramming, Guzling, Drinking:</l>
            <l>As if the world did runne on wheeles away,</l>
            <l>Or all the Deuils in hell kept Holiday.</l>
            <l>And as Hearbes, Flowers and Weedes together grow,</l>
            <l>So people are that day at <hi>Stratford Bowe.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>There sits a Cheater with a simple Gull,</l>
            <l>And there an Honest woman, there a Trull,</l>
            <l>Yonder a Fidler dawb'd with greace and Ale,</l>
            <l>And there an Asse telling an Idle tale.</l>
            <l>There's one a Rosting, yonders one a Stewing,</l>
            <l>And yon's one drinkes vntill he fall a spewing:</l>
            <l>There's a kinde Cuckold with his Wife doth wander,</l>
            <l>To exercise the office of a Pander,</l>
            <l>His Pimship with his Punke despight the horne,</l>
            <l>Eate Gosling giblets in a fort of Corne.</l>
            <l>There is ran tan Tom Tinker and his Tib,</l>
            <l>And there's a Iugler with his fingers glib.</l>
            <l>There throngs a Cutpurse, with his working toole</l>
            <l>And there's a gallant Coxcombe, there's a Foole.</l>
            <l>There's foure or fiue together by the eares,</l>
            <l>And tumble in the Dirt like Dogs and Beares.</l>
            <l>One staggering there hath got the Drunken yox,</l>
            <l>And there's one swaggering's fast within the Stocks.</l>
            <l>Thus with these Galleymaufry humours still,</l>
            <l>These Linsey wolsey posteres, Good and Ill,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:26363:14"/>These mingle mangle, motly toyes they spend</l>
            <l>The time, till night doth make them homeward wend.</l>
            <l>Then they returne as wise as Geese away,</l>
            <l>For whom so many Geese were slaine that day.</l>
            <l>They brought both wit and money with them thither,</l>
            <l>But with the Geese 'tis all deuour'd together.</l>
            <l>And if they were but taught as well as fed,</l>
            <l>More Coyne were sau'd, and man a wiser head.</l>
            <l>Thus (as my Muse is able) I haue told</l>
            <l>How that a Gooses vse is manifold.</l>

            </l>
            <l>How from her Flesh and entrailes, it is plaine,</l>

            </l>
            <l>How freely she doth play the true vpholster,</l>
            <l>And fill with Feathers, pillowes, bed and bolster.</l>
            <l>And how in many an honorable War,</l>
            <l>The Gray Goose wing hath bin the vanquisher.</l>
            <l>The necessary vses of her Quill,</l>
            <l>How to the good 'tis good, Ill to the ill.</l>
            <l>And Shooting heere (according to my loue)</l>
            <l>To bee a noble Exercise I proue.</l>
            <l>And how the Goose <hi>Romes</hi> Capitoll did faue,</l>
            <l>(As sayes the Story) I described haue.</l>
            <l>And now let men examine well and try</l>
            <l>If any Bird in water, earth or Sky,</l>
            <l>Or all in generall together are,</l>
            <l>With the good Goose (forworth) to make Compare.</l>
            <l>Many absurdly, Idle, foolish, base,</l>
            <l>Will call a man a Goose in foule disgrace:</l>
            <l>When if men rightly vnderstood the same,</l>
            <l>A man is honour'd with a Gooses name.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:26363:14"/>For though the Eagle be of Birdes the King,</l>
            <l>Yet 'tis a Rauenous, greedy hurtfull thing.</l>
            <l>And he that with that tytle me should call,</l>
            <l>I had as leiue he call'd me Theefe withall.</l>
            <l>Shee while she liues doth yeeld reliefe to many,</l>
            <l>And aliue or dead, beholding not to any.</l>
            <l>She hath maintain'd ten thousand men,</l>
            <l>With food, and Physicke, Lodging, Shafts and Pen,</l>
            <l>And lastly (not to charge them any wayes)</l>
            <l>Her owne Quill heere, writes her owne worthy praise.</l>
            <l>Because a Goose is Common, and not Deere,</l>
            <l>She amongst fooles is small esteemed heere.</l>
            <l>So Blackberryes, that grow on euery bryer,</l>
            <l>Because th'are plenty few men doe desire:</l>
            <l>Spanish Potatoes are accounted dainty,</l>
            <l>And English Persneps are course meate though plenty.</l>
            <l>But if those Berryes or those Rootes were scant,</l>
            <l>They would be thought as rare, through little want,</l>
            <l>That we should eate them, and a price allow</l>
            <l>As much as Strawberryes, and Potatoes now.</l>
            <l>Why Bread is common, hauing still our fill</l>
            <l>We thinke not on, because we haue it still:</l>
            <l>But if we want Bread then we doe remember,</l>
            <l>We want the Groundworke of our belly timber.</l>
            <l>The Light is common, which few thinke vpon,</l>
            <l>Till Night doth put her blindfold mufler on,</l>
            <l>And all attyr'd in mourning blacke as pitch,</l>
            <l>Then men misselight, and tumble in the Ditch.</l>
            <l>So should we want a Gooses Flesh and Feather,</l>
            <l>The quantity of fiue yeares but together:</l>
            <l>We then should all confesse with one consent,</l>
            <l>How that a Goose were superexcellent.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:26363:15"/>Many good blessings we too much forget,</l>
            <l>Cause they are neere and Cheape, not farre to fet.</l>
            <l>Me thinkes I heare some Cuckow, or some Iay,</l>
            <l>Some Daw, some Pye, some Gull, or Buzzard say,</l>
            <l>That I haue giuen the Goose her worthy stile,</l>
            <l>But haue forgot the Gander all this while.</l>
            <l>Ile giue them Answer (though they merit none)</l>
            <l>I doe Include both sexes vnder one,</l>
            <l>Tis knowue to euery perfit vnderstander,</l>
            <l>A Goose is much superiour to a Gander.</l>
            <l>For though a man, a Mare or Gelding stride,</l>
            <l>VVe briefly say, he doth on Horsebacke ride:</l>
            <l>And though a Gelding be the beast that bare</l>
            <l>VVe call't a Horse, that's neither Horse or Mare.</l>
            <l>So Ganders vnder name of Geese doe goe,</l>
            <l>The Gooses worthynes deserues it so.</l>
            <l>Once I remember, Riding on my way</l>
            <l>In <hi>Barkshire,</hi> neere vnto a Towne call'd <hi>Bray,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I on my Iourney as I past along,</l>
            <l>Rode by a Goose, a Gander, and their young.</l>
            <l>(I neither minding them nor yet their Crew)</l>
            <l>The Gander in my face with fury flew,</l>
            <l>Who in his fierce encounter was more hot,</l>
            <l>Then if he had bin Spanish <hi>Don Quixot.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But sure himselfe so brauely he did beare,</l>
            <l>Because his Loue and Lady Goose was there:</l>
            <l>And 'twas a spur his Chiualry vnto,</l>
            <l>To haue his sweet heart see what he did doe,</l>
            <l>My Horse he started, to the ground I went,</l>
            <l>Dismounted in that (Ganderous) tournament.</l>
            <l>I should say Dangerous, but sure I am</l>
            <l>That GANDEROVS is a DANGEROVS Anagram.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:26363:15"/>The Gander was mine enemy, what tho,</l>
            <l>Ile honour worthy Valour in my foe.</l>
            <l>He Tilted brauely, and in Liewe of it</l>
            <l>The Gooses Quill, the Ganders praise hath writ.</l>
            <l>Thus for the Goose I hauing done my best,</l>
            <l>My toyled Muse retires vnto her Rest:</l>
            <l>Ile shut my Inckhorne, and put vp my Pen,</l>
            <l>So take my Goose amongst you Gentlemen.</l>
