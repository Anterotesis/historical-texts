            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen first I Translated this small
<hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Arnalte</hi> and <hi>Lucenda,</hi>
I was Resolv'd to have tender'd it
to Your Honour'd view, fairely
written in a well-pen'd Manuscript:
but since that time my Resolutions
are alter'd, yet not somuch through
my owne desires, as by the perswasion of some well-wishing
friends; who earnest to have some Copies of
(I must confesse) these my weake Endeavours, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
me to send it to the Presse, thereby to avoyde
the tediousnesse of writing: To these their motions
I was easily perswaded, and that the rather, 'cause
my Subject had formerly beene a Printed Object:
(though in another tongue) Yet I protest no vaine am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
no phantastique desire, to be perspicuous to
the transparent eye of the world incited me, but onely
the importunity of friends: this I hope will excuse
my forwardnesse, either to Your worthy selfe, or any
indifferent Reader; the ingenious I am sure will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
my resolutions; and as for the <hi>Hidra</hi>-headed
<pb facs="tcp:335:3"/>
multitude, let them spit the venome of their malicious
Envy, and spare not; for I have already prevented the
operation of their poyson, with an Antidote of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
worth, which is, my neglect of such Criticall
dispositions: and if this be not sufficient, why the two
Capitall Letters of Your ever-honour'd name, is of
force enough to confound them with amazement. For
which reason, I knowing it to be customary to such as
write Bookes, to Dedicate their Labours to some one
or other; some tendring their Workes to the view of
Grand-Personages, (I will not say in hope of reward)
others to their speciall friends, (perhaps in respect
of love and familiarity) yet both (I am confident (with
intent, that they may be set forth to the perspicuous
eye of the world; have chose Your most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
Selfe, to Patronize my post-ensuing Lines;
not knowing any so worthy, or more judicious,
or to whom I am more oblieg'd. Or have I dar'd
to tender them to the acceptance of any other, sith
they are Yours, and You may justly claime them,
I having Devoted all my Services to Your Candid
selfe. These if You daigne to protect, I'le not
care for Carping <hi>Momus,</hi> or Barking <hi>Zoylus,</hi>
though they should taxe me with a <hi>Westminsterian</hi>
Epitaph: albeit I confesse I was never such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to Learning (though I know not much)
as to steale whole Verses, though it bee lawfull
to Quacke-salve Lame Lines with helping words,
and two Physitians use one and the selfe-same
Simples (though differently Compounded) but
to write <hi>Verbatim,</hi> I'de not affront any mans inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
so ignobly, or dishonour my selfe so basely,
though thousands know it not: one may come
<pb facs="tcp:335:3"/>
with <hi>Virgils</hi> Verse in his mouth, and say,
<q>
                  <l>Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.</l>
               </q>
But's no matter, such Censurers may use their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
I will not say of ignorance or envy, if
of either I care not: It's Your Honour'd selfe,
whom I observe: so you be pleased, it imports not
who's offended.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Genius</hi> having prompt me to present these
unpolisht Lines to Your judicious Censure; I shall
intreate You'ld pardon the faults my English Stile
affords; and attribute them to my unskilfulnesse;
I must confesse (and believe) there bee many, yet
since more sublimer Wits have had some, mine
may bee the more excusable; for if the finest
Lawne have an Iron-mould, (witnesse Your selfe)
it may bee borne withall in a courser piece.</p>
            <p>But what neede I direct the freenesse of Your
Noble Disposition, or the generosity of your su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-excellent
minde, since the Transcendency of
Your judgement, manifests that you'le have this
consideration; that a small haire cannot give so great
a shadow as a bigge Cable, nor a Needles poynt,
so large a circumference as a wide Circle. I neede
not unfold th'<hi>aenigma</hi> of my meaning, <hi>Car, au, bon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeur
ne fault que demy parolle.</hi> As Painters draw
a Counter-Figies by a living Object; so have I
enterpriz'd to translate a Booke, being a Printed
Subject; yet if I give not a true resemblance, or
lay my shadowes right, representing th'<hi>Idea</hi> of
my <hi>Prose,</hi> though Metamorphis'd into <hi>Verse,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to my want of Art, not of Desire:
Thus, if you please to protect these my imployments,
which kept my Wits busie for some spare houres, from
<pb facs="tcp:335:4"/>
the taxations of false-opinionate men, whose Criticall
Censures I may compare to <hi>Paris</hi> Darts, or <hi>Cephalus</hi>
Shafts, which transpierce the best Armour of proofe,
though of <hi>Vulcans</hi> owne forging. I'le promise, when as
I am growne more cunning, and can mixe my colours
better, to Present You with some more serious Piece:
In the interim I, tendring these to Your protection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend

            <l>He hath but once his Annuall course o're-run,</l>
            <l>And lodg'd his fire-breathing Steeds within</l>
            <l>The lofty Stables of cold <hi>Pisces</hi> Inne:</l>
            <l>And fragrant <hi>Flora,</hi> dewie-breasted Queene</l>

            <l>Be-spread with Grasse-greene Carpets, intermixt</l>
            <l>With pleasing Flowers, which no Art had fixt.</l>
            <l>For by their spreadings and their disperst show,</l>
            <l>One might perceive that <hi>Nature</hi> caus'd them grow:</l>
            <l>Attended on with Troopes of lovely <hi>Roses,</hi>

            <l>Since I a Journey, to my selfe no gaine,</l>
            <l>Did undertake; for, for my Friend the paine,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:335:12"/>
I freely did embrace, for certainely,</l>
            <l>The place at distance farre remote did lye,</l>
            <l>Whereto I was add rest: but with my Steed,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Pegasus</hi> I did intend to speed.</l>
            <l>But having some dayes spent in this my race,</l>
            <l>My fortunes brought me to a desart place,</l>
            <l>Set thick with Trees, whose lofty tops aspire</l>
            <l>To kisse the Clouds; nay yet to reach more higher,</l>
            <l>Spreading their branches with that large extent,</l>
            <l>That from my eyes they hid the Firmament;</l>
            <l>Joyning so close, that they did <hi>Phoebus</hi> shrowd,</l>
            <l>As he had beene behinde some watry cloud;</l>
            <l>And interpos'd his glorious beames, that he</l>
            <l>Was forc't to peepe to spy his <hi>Daphnean</hi> Tree.</l>
            <l>Under their shades the Vallies prostrate lay,</l>
            <l>Where Wolves and Foxes did their gamboiles play:</l>
            <l>No silly Sheepe, or Lambes were ever seene</l>
            <l>To browse or feed upon those Plaines, though greene:</l>
            <l>The labouring Oxe, nor the Milke-giving Cow</l>
            <l>Did e're graze there, or hath the sharpe-edg'd Plough</l>
            <l>Beene ever knowne to furrow up that Land:</l>
            <l>No House or Cottage on that ground did stand,</l>
            <l>'Twas unfrequented, not a tract was seene</l>
            <l>Of man or beast, 'twas all o're-growne with greene,</l>
            <l>With <hi>Thistles, Thornes,</hi> and the scratching <hi>Brier:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Boxe</hi> and <hi>Holly</hi> which withstand the ire</l>
            <l>Of Winters rage, for they are alwayes seene</l>
            <l>For to survive, clad in their robes of Greene.</l>
            <l>No noise I heard, no cry of coupl'd Hounds,</l>
            <l>Whose bawling throats doe make the Woods resound</l>
            <l>Their yelping clamour, all was quiet there:</l>
            <l>No lusty Keeper hollow'd in his <hi>Deere;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Twas hush and silent lesse some pretty Rill</l>
            <l>Which murmuring ran at foote of some tall Hill,</l>
            <l>Or else the whistlings that the Winde did breath,</l>
            <l>Which made a rushling 'mongst the trembling leafes.</l>
            <l>No Shepheard pip't the whilst his Flocks did graize:</l>
            <l>No pretty Birds did warble out sweet Layes,</l>

Vnlesse 'twere such whose chirping Notes did sound</l>
            <l>Anthems of sorrow to the listning ground:</l>
            <l>It seem'd to be the seate of pensive care,</l>
            <l>Of melancholy, and of grim dispaire.</l>
            <l>There mourning sate the harmelesse <hi>Turtle Dove,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And sung sad Dirges on her lifelesse Love:</l>
            <l>And sweet-tongu'd <hi>Casta,</hi> pretty <hi>Philomel,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In mourning Layes, <hi>Tereus</hi> foule lust did tell,</l>
            <l>And in sweet straines though sadly did relate</l>
            <l>Her sad disasters, and most cruell Rape.</l>
            <l>Here did I finde that I was gone astray,</l>
            <l>And that unwitting I had lost my way;</l>
            <l>Then solid care and passion did possesse</l>
            <l>My wearied thoughts; since that no redresse</l>
            <l>I could rescounter, for that spacious Field</l>
            <l>No guide, no Shepheard, not a man did yeeld:</l>
            <l>Nor this alone my vexed minde did trouble,</l>
            <l>The craggy wayes my cares did likewise double.</l>
            <l>The Continent it was to me unknowne,</l>
            <l>Nor no addresse could unto me be showne;</l>
            <l>Which forc't me wander, till at length I found</l>
            <l>My selfe quite lost, I erring in that ground,</l>
            <l>Then being streightned, finding no reliefe,</l>
            <l>The uncouthnesse I did exceed with griefe,</l>
            <l>'Twixt feare and hope, I there did musing stand,</l>
            <l>And with my heavy eyes beheld the Land,</l>
            <l>And here, and there, and every where I spye</l>
            <l>To ease my heart; at length my curious eye</l>
            <l>The Heavens being faire, discern'd a distance off</l>
            <l>From forth a Grove, the smoake ascend a loffe,</l>
            <l>So by that signe I did conjecture then,</l>
            <l>That in that place I should rescounter men.</l>
            <l>This hope reviv'd me, and then wearied I</l>
            <l>'Gan trace the path which to the Grove might lye,</l>
            <l>And through the thickest of the Wood with speed</l>
            <l>I did direct my almost tyred Steed,</l>
            <l>But as I traverst through the Wood, to finde</l>
            <l>Some quiet harbour to relieve my minde,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:335:13"/>
The pathlesse passage I so tedious found,</l>
            <l>That I repented that my selfe I'de bound</l>
            <l>To enterprise it; for the raged shrubs</l>
            <l>O're-threw my Steed, and dasht me 'gainst the stubs:</l>
            <l>The catching, scratching thorny briars then</l>
            <l>Entangled me as they had angry been.</l>
            <l>Th'untrodden paths with them did eke conspire,</l>
            <l>And tript me up, and laid me in the mire;</l>
            <l>When straight recov'ring, I re-falling found</l>
            <l>There was no pitty in that desart ground:</l>
            <l>And thus perplex't I did not onely grieve,</l>
            <l>For I did wish that Fate an end would give</l>
            <l>Unto my Travells, and so wishing I</l>
            <l>Vnto my wisht for end a pace did hye:</l>
            <l>For though my fortunes had me strangely crest,</l>
            <l>That by dispaire my selfe was well-nigh lost,</l>
            <l>I onward went, I would not quench the fire</l>
            <l>That Hope had kindled, with my friend Desire.</l>
            <l>I still did journey, but about the time</l>
            <l>That golden <hi>Phoebus</hi> in the West doth shine,</l>
            <l>I gain'd a Hill, from whence I might descry</l>
            <l>With ease the place, from whence the smoake did fly,</l>
            <l>It was a Mansion, which Report did tell,</l>
            <l>Belong'd unto a man that there did dwell,</l>
            <l>Who by his Birth was Gentle, and his fame</l>
            <l>Vnto the World did testifie the same:</l>
            <l>This Fabricke he of late caus'd to be built,</l>
            <l>Yet was the Front-piece not like others, gilt;</l>
            <l>There were no Pillars hew'd by curious Art,</l>
            <l>Nor did the Marble-stones there beare a part:</l>
            <l>No open Walkes, no Arched Galleries,</l>
            <l>As any past, with prospect pleas'd their eyes,</l>
            <l>But sable blacke did onely make the show,</l>
            <l>For as darke Night it seem'd from top to toe:</l>
            <l>Which when I saw, it did me so affright,</l>
            <l>That I abashed, stood at that black sight,</l>
            <l>And there my wondring thoughts with rests desire,</l>
            <l>Of all my former griefes did quench the fire.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:335:13"/>
But drawing nigher, Fate did me conduct</l>
            <l>Hard by a place, and as my Fortunes luckt,</l>
            <l>Where men were walking, 'twas; who when I found</l>
            <l>Their sad aspects, and their lamenting sound,</l>
            <l>Their mourning habits, and their sorrowing hearts</l>
            <l>Did testifie, that they did act their parts</l>
            <l>In some sad Sceane: for by their outward show,</l>
            <l>As men possest with griefe, they all did goe:</l>
            <l>But one amongst the rest, who formost went,</l>
            <l>Whose sorrowing sighes and groans the aire did rent,</l>
            <l>Who with sad griefe bewailing spent the day,</l>
            <l>Him did the rest as Lord and Sir obey.</l>
            <l>And howbeit, that care had quite and cleane</l>
            <l>Dri'd up those Ruby streames, the which were seene</l>
            <l>His manly face to staine; and though the Rose,</l>
            <l>In striving with the Lilly, there did lose,</l>
            <l>Her blushing Colour: yet, I pittying, say,</l>
            <l>His gentle vertues still did beare their sway;</l>
            <l>Nor did his, Face, that likned <hi>Cinthias</hi> waine,</l>
            <l>Vnto his Noble parts proove any staine:</l>
            <l>And well he shew'd it; for he no sooner spy'd</l>
            <l>My wearied selfe, brought there by Fortunes guide,</l>
            <l>But did mee friendly greete, although that he</l>
            <l>Astonish'd was, my wondring selfe to see;</l>
            <l>But that past o're, and by his courteous show</l>
            <l>He did declare, that Roses doe not grow</l>
            <l>On raggy Thistles: for, oh, Noble he,</l>
            <l>For to descend my Horse intreated me:</l>
            <l>And then the passage of my travels past</l>
            <l>He having heard, himselfe did cause with haste,</l>
            <l>For to provide, that Fatigated I,</l>
            <l>With carelesse sleepe may ease my drowsie eyes:</l>
            <l>Then stretching forth to me his gentle hand,</l>
            <l>He did me bring where his sad house did stand,</l>
            <l>Which with amazement did afresh renew</l>
            <l>My wondring eyes, and my abashed view;</l>
            <l>Which I enforc'd with heede there to observe</l>
            <l>The speciall markes that notice did deserve;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:335:14"/>
Observing which, unto the Gate we came,</l>
            <l>Where neither Love, nor Fate, or flying Fame</l>
            <l>Did carved stand; or could I ought else spye,</l>
            <l>Vnlesse 'twere three white scroules on which my eies</l>
            <l>Did prying glance; and there I reading found</l>
            <l>This sad Inscription, on that Argent ground.</l>
            <q>
               <l>This is the Mansion</l>
               <l>Of him that living, dyes,</l>
               <l>Though death consent not</l>
               <l>To close up his eyes.</l>
            </q>
            <l>These Lines I having read deliberately,</l>
            <l>We farther went, and my observing eye</l>
            <l>Perceiv'd, that all things in that house so sad,</l>
            <l>Of mourning griefe a representment had:</l>
            <l>But though I sadnesse every where did see,</l>
            <l>At that same time I would not curious bee</l>
            <l>To aske the reason, I omitted it,</l>
            <l>Till I should finde the time and place more fit.</l>
            <l>Onward we walk't, and so we enter'd in</l>
            <l>A spacious Hall, where when a while w'had bin,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with their plenteous traine.</l>
            <l>The Tables deck'd, and then went out againe;</l>
            <l>But long they stay'd not, for they usher'd in</l>
            <l>Plenty of Viands, which their Traines did bring,</l>
            <l>Whereon we fed: then Supper being past,</l>
            <l>The grieving Knight he caus'd me for to haste</l>
            <l>Vnto my rest, and this kinde he did doe,</l>
            <l>Because my Travailes and my paines he knew:</l>
            <l>Which to refresh most courteously he lead</l>
            <l>Me to a Chamber, where a sable bed</l>
            <l>Did stand erected; where when I was brought,</l>
            <l>He sighing left me, asking if that ought</l>
            <l>I wanted; and sadly then retiring,</l>
            <l>At these strange wonders left me there admiring:</l>
            <l>Being alone, the bedde it standing nigh,</l>
            <l>Vpon the Swanny Doune, I downe did lye:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:335:14"/>
And as I thought my quiet rest to take,</l>
            <l>When silent Night doth suffer few to wake:</l>
            <l>About the houre, when as the watchfull Cocke,</l>
            <l>The nights shrill Bell-man, and the Pesants clock,</l>
            <l>Doth give the signall by his early crowing,</l>
            <l>That mid-night's past, the cheerefull day is growing.</l>
            <l>I then did heare sad sorrow breath such groanes,</l>
            <l>And sob such sighes, and utter forth such moanes,</l>
            <l>That the strange noyse with wonder did confound,</l>
            <l>M'amazed sence, but listning then I found</l>
            <l>That 'twas the Knight, with his attendants, who</l>
            <l>Breath forth those groans, and made that strange adoe,</l>
            <l>For with sad Musicke they did shreeking plaine</l>
            <l>Of their afflictions, and their smarting paine,</l>
            <l>Wailing, their forrowes in nights darkest shade,</l>
            <l>'Cause it to sadnesse some resemblance had;</l>
            <l>The direfull Screetch-Owle, beare with them apart:</l>
            <l>And from her screeking throat did shew her Art,</l>
            <l>In keeping time with their sad strained moanes,</l>
            <l>Or eccho like, in answering to their groanes:</l>
            <l>Hearing this noyse, and in the dead of Night,</l>
            <l>I doe protest, it did me sore affright:</l>
            <l>And then I wonder'd more than e're before,</l>
            <l>For strange it seem'd to heare them so deplore:</l>
            <l>Imagination seiz'd on sleepe, caus'd <hi>Morpheus</hi> flye,</l>
            <l>And wip'd his Leaden slumbers from my eyes,</l>
            <l>And did unlose those silken bands, wherein</l>
            <l>The drowsie god had chain'd my eye-lids in:</l>

            <l>That ev'ry night the Knight did usually</l>
            <l>Renew with passion his lamenting moanes,</l>

            <l>Who now will doubt but that disturbed I,</l>
            <l>Lay fraught with wonder, since their pittious cry</l>
            <l>Chast sleepe away: for with their teares they past</l>
            <l>The nights sad houres, grieving whilst they last:</l>
            <l>But when the East 'gan vest himselfe with gray,</l>
            <l>Which is the ensuing of a golden day,</l>
            <l>All was in silence husht, they did lay by</l>
            <l>Their dolefull tones, and their distracted cryes.</l>
            <l>Rose-cheek'd <hi>Anrora,</hi> usher to the day,</l>

            <l>Guilded the mountaines, and the silyer streames:</l>
            <l>When stately riding through the Christall skye,</l>
            <l>Vested in Gold, from forth a Church hard by</l>
            <l>I heard a Saints-bell sound, whose Tones did call</l>
            <l>The circumjacent dwellers (great and small)</l>
            <l>Vnto that Service, which is styl'd the Masse,</l>
            <l>Or Mattins either: (well we'le let that passe,</l>
            <l>And to the purpose) then I did espye</l>
            <l>My Noble Host, the Knight, with weeping eyes</l>
            <l>Enter my Chamber, where he did expresse</l>
            <l>The selfe same Honour and true Noblenesse,</l>
            <l>Which he vouchsaf'd me, the last passed Night,</l>
            <l>When Fortune brought me to his courteous sight:</l>
            <l>For friendly grasping of my hand, he lead</l>
            <l>Me to the place where Service then was read:</l>
            <l>Where when arriv'd, my over-curious eye</l>
            <l>Roving about, I chanc'd for to espye</l>
            <l>A Monument, with sable blacke be-deck'd,</l>
            <l>Which sorrowing griefe had caus'd the Knight erect:</l>
            <l>And as I since have heard, he doth intend</l>
            <l>Therein to rest, when Death shall give an end</l>

To all his cares: observing it I found</l>
            <l>This sad Inscription which engrav'd was round,</l>
            <q>
               <l>See here the Memory</l>
               <l>Of one that grieves with paine,</l>
               <l>Since tha the sight of him nor her</l>
               <l>With ease he cannot gaine,</l>
            </q>
            <l>Although the Masse, a Service that's divine,</l>
            <l>Was celebrated at that present time,</l>
            <l>Which claim'd attention with a due respect,</l>
            <l>Yet Masse and Service did I then neglect,</l>
            <l>And there my thoughts, which should have bin divine</l>
            <l>Did poise the meaning of each severall Line:</l>
            <l>And having pois'd them, yet I did not spare</l>
            <l>To note the sorrow that they did declare.</l>
            <l>Yet though I those things saw, I troubled was,</l>
            <l>Since of th' effects I could not judge the cause.</l>
            <l>But then from Church, Service being done,</l>
            <l>We homeward went, where whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we were come,</l>
            <l>Wee free-fac'd Plenty found, who from her store</l>
            <l>Had spread the Table with the Cates all-o're,</l>
            <l>Then downe we sate, refresh't our appetite;</l>
            <l>And dinner past, the sad lamenting Knight</l>
            <l>Striving to glad me with some recreation,</l>
            <l>The which might keepe me in some agitation;</l>
            <l>He 'gan discourse, and in's discourse did show</l>
            <l>That he the King and Queene full well did know,</l>
            <l>Requiring me most friendly to relate</l>
            <l>If they attended were with Courtlike state,</l>
            <l>Honour'd and serv'd with true magnificence</l>
            <l>As did belong unto their Excellence:</l>
            <l>These his demands I well could satisfie,</l>
            <l>But let them passe, for with my judging eye</l>
            <l>I did perceive that he discourse did frame,</l>
            <l>Me for to pleasure and to entertaine:</l>
            <l>Not from desire that he had to know,</l>
            <l>How it with King or Queene or Court did goe:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:335:16"/>
And this I judg'd because he was so sad,</l>
            <l>For he his sorrow alwayes present had;</l>
            <l>For, for the most part he both sigh'd and sorrow'd,</l>
            <l>But sometimes listning, then a smile he borrow'd;</l>
            <l>And so concluding he me to requite,</l>
            <l>Did render thankes, and this he did recite:</l>
            <l>Know worthy friend, that not without good reason</l>
            <l>Our past discourse was fram'd, nor out of season:</l>
            <l>For I to thee the true effects will show,</l>

            <l>As modesty are grac't, oh let such know,</l>
            <l>How one doth cause me suffer smart and woe</l>
            <l>Without just cause, how her obdurate minde</l>
            <l>No teares will soften, no intreats make kinde:</l>
            <l>That from her sexe she varies, and despight</l>

               <l>Our Sexes glory, for there's none so faire:</l>
               <l>Oh let thy goodnesse as transparent be,</l>
               <l>As those bright beames which in your eyes we see:</l>
               <l>Thy wonted prudence and thy wisedome use,</l>
               <l>Be not offended, all distaste refuse;</l>
               <l>Oh taxe me not, although I should offend</l>
               <l>Thee with my words, my dearest, dearest friend.</l>
               <l>Deare taxe me not of indiscretion,</l>
               <l>For any word the which my trembling tongue</l>
               <l>Shall utter to thee, if you apprehend</l>
               <l>Aright my meaning, I shall be esteem'd</l>
               <l>And prais'd, I hope rather, then to be told</l>
               <l>That I presume, offend, or am too bold:</l>
               <l>And that the rather, 'cause anothers griefe</l>
               <l>Emboldneth me to plead for his reliefe.</l>
               <l>Give eare <hi>Lucenda,</hi> and you then shall know,</l>
               <l>That it's long since that sorrow, paine, and woe</l>
               <l>Thrives with my brother, and the sacred Lampe</l>
               <l>Of his rich health, burnes smothering in a dampe:</l>
               <l>So that all helpe which we to him apply</l>
               <l>Effects no cure, it proveth contrary.</l>
               <l>Now knowing this, and seeing that the date</l>
               <l>Of his sicke life was e'ne exterminate</l>
               <l>Through vehement paine, and cruell killing smart,</l>
               <l>Which rents his breast, and teares in two his heart;</l>
               <l>Him I besought with sighes, and teares, and cryes,</l>
               <l>For to reveale, discover to my eyes</l>
               <l>His hidden passions, which did e'ne exhale</l>
               <l>His fainting breath (to puffe up <hi>Charons</hi> saile)</l>
               <l>But all I did could not, alacke, prevaile;</l>
               <l>He still was silent, though I weepe or waile.</l>
               <l>But I at length through slye suspition found,</l>
               <l>Of all his cares the true and perfect ground:</l>
               <l>And still inquiring, I did finde this out,</l>
               <l>(Conjecture, aiding, and distrustfull doubt)</l>
               <l>

That thou the motive art which doth atract</l>
               <l>His dying heart, with blinde loves torments rackt:</l>

               <l>Now to assure your selfe that all is true</l>
               <l>Which I expresse, declare, and tell to you,</l>
               <l>No other proofe you neede, but the complaints</l>
               <l>I move, of him whose soule with sorrow faints.</l>
               <l>Had I not seene the dang'rous storme wherein</l>
               <l>His life's nigh ship-wrack't, I would not have bin</l>
               <l>So unadvised rash, for to complaine</l>
               <l>Of the afflictions which he doth sustaine.</l>
               <l>A great desire I moreover have</l>
               <l>To doe him service, and his life to save;</l>
               <l>For if my will resist, why straight I finde</l>
               <l>His sad disasters to divert my minde,</l>
               <l>And my true love, and unfeign'd affection,</l>
               <l>If that I erre grants me a true direction:</l>

               <l>As full of horrour, to the utter ruine</l>

               <l>Yet if so cruell you your selfe expresse,</l>
               <l>You will receive small praise, you must confesse.</l>
               <l>Avouch I can, and this affirme indeed,</l>
               <l>If you deny to helpe him now in need,</l>
               <l>Care-freeing death will to his paine give rest,</l>
               <l>And ease his life, which now is but opprest.</l>
               <l>Consider but how deepely you are bound</l>
               <l>Vnto his love, which is most pure and sound:</l>
               <l>For though you him disdaine, his suit neglect,</l>

               <l>You are beholding, in a high degree,</l>

               <l>Nor is this all, for it doth plaine appeare</l>
               <l>He doth respect your honour, truely feare</l>
               <l>To taxe your worth, for he with pleasure fain's</l>
               <l>To undergoe his sorrowes and his paines:</l>

               <l>For she did bring me what <hi>Lucenda</hi> had</l>
               <l>Concluded of them, thus bid me be glad.</l>
               <l>Wherefore she 'gan for to recite at last,</l>
               <l>What 'twixt <hi>Lucenda</hi> and her selfe had past;</l>
               <l>And from her bosome she drew forth the Letter,</l>
               <l>Which did reprieve my life, and made me debter</l>
               <l>Still unto death; then holding 't in my hand,</l>
               <l>I did along while pausing with it stand.</l>
               <l>Nor could I be perswaded it could be,</l>
               <l>That such good hap should happen unto me.</l>
               <l>Then kissing sweetely with a true respect</l>
               <l>That blessed Paper, and the snow-white necke,</l>
               <l>And Swan-like hands of my most dearest sister,</l>
               <l>I broke it open having often kist her:</l>
               <l>And then I read it, but who then had seene</l>
               <l>Me, would have judg'd I had surprized beene</l>
               <l>With sweete delight, and easily have sed</l>
               <l>That pleasing pleasure had me ravished.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:335:46"/>
The vertue of that Letter did inflame</l>
               <l>More bright my fire, and I deem'd the same</l>
               <l>Beyond esteeme, and with excesse of joy,</l>
               <l>My soule was rapt in such an extasie,</l>
               <l>That it well nigh my body did forsake,</l>
               <l>For to give way that it more roome might make</l>
               <l>For these new joyes, and to entertaine</l>
               <l>Delight and pleasure in liew of my paine.</l>
               <l>But having read it, and re-read it, I</l>
               <l>Then found contentment and alacrity;</l>
               <l>Not too predominate, for grim dispaire</l>
               <l>As well as joy, claim'd an equall share:</l>
               <l>For when I thought my drooping selfe to glad,</l>
               <l>I lost my courage, for no hope I had.</l>
               <l>And if I would lament, why the good will</l>
               <l>Which she profest me, did oppose me still:</l>
               <l>So what to doe, alas I could not tell,</l>
               <l>My counsaile left me, doubt did with me dwell.</l>
               <l>But 'cause my griefes were farre more vehement</l>
               <l>Than all the joy, or the sweete content</l>
               <l>Her Letter brought me, I did then indite</l>
               <l>This answer to her, which I thus recite.</l>

            <div type="letter">
               <head>The Letter of Arnalte to Lucenda.</head>
               <l>THose well-pen'd Lines that were compos'd by thee,</l>
               <l>Divine <hi>Lucenda,</hi> and addrest to me,</l>
               <l>I have receiv'd, but I must confesse</l>
               <l>With more content than now I can expresse;</l>
               <l>For when they were presented to me, then</l>
               <l>I deem'd my selfe the happiest of men:</l>
               <l>But when <hi>I</hi> read them sorrow did affright</l>
               <l>All ioy from me, and all sweete delight:</l>
               <l>For being clos'd they promis'd me redresse,</l>
               <l>But being open'd, nothing else exprest,</l>
               <l>Vnlesse unkindnesse, which did overthrow</l>
               <l>My expectations, throb my heart with woe,</l>
               <l>By which <hi>I</hi> iudge there is more likely-hood</l>

So that I cannot really expresse</l>
               <l>Such true delight as <hi>I</hi> ought to confesse;</l>
               <l>For if <hi>I</hi> thinke thy favour to obtaine,</l>
               <l>My torments thrive, and <hi>I</hi> grow rich in paine:</l>
               <l>For by your writing you doe quite destroy</l>
               <l>All hope of comfort, or delight some ioy.</l>
               <l>My ills you say doe grieve you, wherefore then</l>
               <l>Doe you expresse that which you doe not meane?</l>
               <l>Why doe you publish, or with words proclaime,</l>
               <l>What with your will you meane not to maintaine?</l>
               <l>If so it were, that my afflictions they</l>
               <l>Displeasing were, then might you truely say</l>
               <l>What you maintain'd; and then you would retract</l>
               <l>What you commit now both in word and fact.</l>
               <l>Ah deare <hi>Lucenda,</hi> why doe you pretend</l>
               <l>Not truely with your truely loving friend.</l>

                  <hi>I</hi> have the name, but you commit the act;</l>

                  <hi>I</hi> gaine the honour, you expresse the fact.</l>
               <l>Truely I'de rather that my suff'rings were</l>

               <l>MY Letter ended, I did then implore</l>

               <l>Faire, bright, and calme, straight-wayes did appeare</l>
               <l>Tempestuous, cloudy, winde and raine did flye</l>
               <l>With stormy rage, and darknesse vail'd the skie:</l>
               <l>Also a Grey-hound, which I much did prise,</l>
               <l>Ranne 'twixt my leggs, &amp; there yelpt forth such cries</l>
               <l>And horrid howlings, that they did confound</l>
               <l>M'amazed sences with their bawling sound.</l>
               <l>Yet I alas, who made but small account</l>
               <l>Of such predictions, on my Steed did mount:</l>
               <l>Nor all those lets could not my purpose stay,</l>
               <l>But with my Hawke upon my fist away</l>
               <l>Into the fields I rod, where scarsely I</l>
               <l>Had 'gun my quest, but then immediately</l>
               <l>I call'd to minde that it was long agone</l>
               <l>Since I had seene the Gentleman, of whom</l>
               <l>I have already spoke; and that since I</l>
               <l>Had shewn to him the love and loyalty.</l>
               <l>And deare affection which I alwayes beare</l>
               <l>Vnto <hi>Lucenda,</hi> he no more did care</l>
               <l>T' associate me, but by degrees did shun</l>
               <l>My company, or where I us'd to come;</l>
               <l>Nor ne're came nigh me where I us'd to dwell,</l>
               <l>Or once inquir'd, were I ill or well,</l>
               <l>Ceasing to be so courteous, or so kind,</l>
               <l>As formerly I did his friendship finde.</l>
               <l>No sparke of goodnesse in his breast did shine,</l>
               <l>Towards me all friendship did in him decline:</l>
               <l>But 'cause I knew it was the proper kind</l>
               <l>Of divers men who have a wavering minde,</l>
               <l>Not to be constant to their friends, but sickle,</l>
               <l>For as they please, they can love much or little;</l>
               <l>It mov'd me thinke that he had gain'd a touch</l>
               <l>Of that infection, poison'd with too much</l>
               <l>Ignoblenesse, which was the speciall cause</l>
               <l>Of his non-servance of kind friendships Lawes.</l>
               <l>And then againe I thought 'tmight sooner be</l>

Than that he'd suffer that I should endure</l>
               <l>The least of torments, if he could me cure.</l>
               <l>Whilst thus I mus'd the depth of truth to sound,</l>
               <l>My Hawke fell downe starke dead unto the ground;</l>
               <l>Which sudden chance did straight wayes multiply</l>
               <l>The doubts I had of <hi>Yerso's</hi> loyalty:</l>
               <l>For suddenly my heart it was surpris'd</l>
               <l>With grievous startings, and assaults: beside,</l>
               <l>I did remember how my well-shap'd Hownd</l>
               <l>Had whin'd that morning, grovelling on the ground.</l>
               <l>Then thus disturb'd, I did resolve to speed</l>
               <l>Backe to my Sister, mounted on my Steed;</l>
               <l>But as I rode, I found my selfe to be</l>
               <l>Vpon a Mount, whence I might plainely see</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lucenda's</hi> Mansion, which did fairely lye</l>
               <l>Vnto the prospect of my roaving eye;</l>
               <l>And also heard the noise and perfect sound</l>
               <l>Of Drummes and Haubois, which did there rebound</l>
               <l>Their pleasant Echoes 'gainst the Mountaines, and</l>
               <l>The neighbouring Hills, that there did proudly stand,</l>
               <l>Rearing their heads in such a lofty wise,</l>
               <l>As if they meant to parley with the skies.</l>
               <l>This seemed strange unto my listning eare,</l>
               <l>For it agree'd not with the time of yeare</l>
               <l>To use such pastime: thus I wax't farre more</l>
               <l>Pensive, and sad, than e're I was afore,</l>
               <l>Growing most jealous of my future losse,</l>
               <l>Since that my fortunes prov'd to be so crosse.</l>
               <l>Well, there I stay'd so long for to discry</l>
               <l>The house, from whence those merry Tones did flye,</l>
               <l>That Night o're-tooke me in her Ebon-Coach,</l>
               <l>E're to my Sister I could then approach,</l>
               <l>Who was accustom'd dayly for to waite</l>
               <l>My comming, at the entrance of her gate,</l>
               <l>There to embrace me; but at that same Tide</l>
               <l>My dearest Sister did not for me bide,</l>
               <l>Which did renew againe my past distrust,</l>
               <l>And then alas, this of all was worst:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:335:53"/>
I being enter'd, to the Chamber come</l>
               <l>Where she did sit, she seem'd to me as dumbe;</l>
               <l>A word she spake not, but did sadly looke,</l>
               <l>As if all joy had her heart forsooke.</l>
               <l>This did amaze me, and I marvail'd much:</l>
               <l>For since her silence unto me was such,</l>
               <l>I durst not aske her ought, doubting to heare</l>
               <l>By her discourse the news I much did feare.</l>
               <l>But yet at length I could not so containe</l>
               <l>My selfe with silence, or from words refraine,</l>
               <l>But that I ask't her whence it did arise</l>
               <l>That she sate drooping in that mournfull wise:</l>
               <l>At this the flood-gates of her teare-drown'd eyes</l>
               <l>Burst ope through fury of her weeping cryes:</l>
               <l>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence such streames of chrystal-teares did flow,</l>
               <l>That to a deluge they began to grow;</l>
               <l>Whose inundations did o're-flow so high,</l>
               <l>That they did stop her passage of reply,</l>
               <l>So that she could not answer me, untill</l>
               <l>Those floods were sunke, that then amaine did swell;</l>
               <l>But drying up those teares which trickled downe,</l>
               <l>Whose gushing Torrents did her eyes e'ne drowne,</l>
               <l>She did declare, how at that present tide,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lucenda</hi> was the faire espoused Bride</l>
               <l>Of youthfull <hi>Yerso,</hi> who I ever deem'd</l>
               <l>My faithfull friend, for so he alwayes seem'd.</l>
               <l>And that as then she did to me relate</l>
               <l>As she did heare, they still did celebrate</l>
               <l>The Nuptiall Banquets, and the custom'd Rites</l>
               <l>With Maskes, with Revells, and such us'd delights.</l>
               <l>When this I heard, I doe protest my friend,</l>
               <l>I thought my life would straight have ta'ne an end:</l>
               <l>For my poore heart was suddenly assail'd</l>
               <l>By woes Armado, that my spirits fail'd;</l>
               <l>Which so amaz'd me, that a long while I</l>
               <l>Stood mute, and dumbe, nor could a word reply.</l>
               <l>Thus were the signes presig'd unto me showne,</l>
               <l>And eke the noise I heard unto me knowne;</l>
               <l>

Which so disturbe me, that I in the place</l>
               <l>So rudely fell, grovelling on my face;</l>
               <l>That those who then were present, did esteeme</l>
               <l>I was intranst, for so I then did seeme.</l>
               <l>But then as soone as I could breath againe,</l>
               <l>I tooke all Letters, subscribed with the name</l>
               <l>Of faire <hi>Lucenda;</hi> nay, I did not leave</l>
               <l>One single line which I of her receiv'd,</l>
               <l>But tore them all in that same raging vaine:</l>
               <l>Then growing wild, through fury of my paine,</l>
               <l>I being lost, and voyd of further hope,</l>
               <l>Dispaire I welcom'd, who did soone take scope</l>
               <l>For to inflame me with tenne thousand thoughts,</l>
               <l>Which in my braines a strange distraction wrought,</l>
               <l>So that I did unroote my Beard, and tare</l>
               <l>From off my head whole handfulls of my haire:</l>
               <l>Although such actions (friend) I must confesse</l>
               <l>Seeme womanish, and weakness'e doe expresse;</l>
               <l>Yet blind-fold Love doth by his Lawes confine</l>
               <l>To such extreames his servants many times:</l>
               <l>Then some daies past, and that the consolation</l>
               <l>Of my deare sister, with her milde perswasion</l>
               <l>Had in some sort asswag'd my anxious griefe,</l>
               <l>And by her care had tender'd me reliefe,</l>
               <l>I gave a speciall order unto those</l>

               <l>It was the maid in whom she did repose</l>
               <l>Great confidence, and durst to her disclose</l>
               <l>Her private secrets, and moreover rest</l>
               <l>Her inward thoughts within her trusty breast;</l>
               <l>Who certifi'd me in her Mistris name,</l>

               <l>Alas, alas, <hi>I</hi> know thou art so sad,</l>

               <l>Which if you grant, I soone shall feele m' offence</l>
               <l>To be remitted with large recompence.</l>
               <l>Thy deceas'd husband hath so wounded me,</l>

               <l>Yet spight of Fortune, or her utmost hate,</l>
               <l>Or all th' afflictions of my cruell fate,</l>
               <l>I dread no danger, for my outward smart</l>
               <l>Is farre unlike the suff'rings of my heart:</l>
               <l>For 'tis long since (deare love) that <hi>Cupids</hi> dart,</l>

               <l>And made so large an Orifice, that those</l>
               <l>Grand wounds I suffer'd from the smarting blowes</l>
               <l>Of vanquish'd <hi>Yerso,</hi> seeme, alas, to be</l>

               <l>Thus I doe muster daily in my braine</l>
               <l>Ten thousand thoughts; I also entertaine</l>
               <l>As many fancies, which my thoughts controule,</l>

               <l>For what death seizes with his mortall hand,</l>
               <l>It's meerely lost, no force can him withstand:</l>
               <l>For 'tis most certaine, neither art or skill,</l>
               <l>Honour, or goodnesse, can prevent the ill</l>

                  <hi>Yerso,</hi> to whom thou lately wert a wife,</l>

                  <hi>Yerso's</hi> sad chance hath chac'd all reason out:</l>

               <l>And power to vanquish him, who had the name</l>

               <l>Then at her comming I did straight repeate</l>
               <l>My resolution, and I did intreate</l>
               <l>Her to advise me; then did she reply,</l>

               <l>At those same Nuptials that were caus'd by me.</l>
               <l>My Sister then she knew not what she meant,</l>

               <l>My faithfull Sister in a rage she flung,</l>
               <l>Calling the Abbesse, to whom she did relate,</l>
               <l>She was not enter'd through her arched gate</l>

All other torments I can lightly beare;</l>

               <l>Since in this hap, the happy meanes doth lye,</l>
               <l>Tho which alone can gaine my liberty.</l>
               <l>Thus I will cease to entertaine your eares</l>

               <l>With urgent treaties importun'd my stay,</l>
               <l>And disadvis'd me from so strange a way;</l>
               <l>Preposing to me that it was ill done,</l>
               <l>On this my course so rashly for to runne,</l>

               <l>My goods, my sister, to court desolation:</l>

               <l>On the same key, with mine they did not found;</l>
               <l>Thus, diff'ring both in our opinions, I</l>

               <l>Sufficiently assured, that my will</l>
               <l>I would accomplish, and my mind fulfill.</l>
               <l>At which the King was so displeas'd, that he</l>
               <l>Would not vouchsafe his gracious leave to me:</l>
               <l>Yet ne'rethelesse, casting all things aside</l>

               <l>I weigh'd it not, or did I heed the cryes</l>
               <l>Which ran like Rivers from the swolne eyes</l>
               <l>Of my sweet sister, intermixt with groanes</l>
               <l>And sad laments, of force to soften stones.</l>
               <l>But after many loving Ceremonies,</l>

               <l>For the ill-usage and the wretchednesse</l>
               <l>Of our sad Lover, may perhaps invade</l>

               <l>Taxing th'unkindnesse of this new-made Nun,</l>
               <l>The cruell Authresse of his Martyrdome;</l>
               <l>Who through her desp'ratenes hath caus'd our Knight</l>
               <l>Who most intirely lov'd her, to delight</l>

Him from his passions which torment his heart</l>
               <l>With endlesse tortures, and unheard of smart.</l>
               <l>Now if's strange chance have not sufficient force</l>
               <l>T'infuse some pitty, or so me sad remorse</l>

               <l>(Yee all by me) to harbour this conceite,</l>
               <l>That he doth rather cherish and maintaine</l>
               <l>His immense torments and extreamest paine,</l>
               <l>Since faire <hi>Lucenda</hi> therein doth delight;</l>
               <l>Than for to live in the most happiest plight,</l>
               <l>That ever any mortall man possest,</l>
               <l>Since she deny'd him this true happinesse.</l>
               <l>But yet he hopes through processe of fleet time,</l>
               <l>Or through her vertues which most brightly shine,</l>
               <l>That shee'l forget the too fond foolish love</l>
               <l>Of her dead Husband, and at length remove</l>
               <l>All thought of him, and in the end confesse</l>
               <l>That she hath wrong'd me with her churlishnesse.</l>
               <l>Now if this happy turne shall chance to fall,</l>
               <l>Ere Destiny for his faint breath shall call,</l>
               <l>He will remaine content; or if it come</l>
               <l>When he possesses his time-lasting home,</l>
               <l>His spirit will rejoyce, his joynt-falne bones</l>
               <l>Repose more softer, though inhum'd 'mongst stones:</l>
               <l>Thus you may see the hope with which I left</l>
               <l>The mournfull Knight, of joy quite bereft:</l>

               <l>Yet pray accept it; it may serve for want</l>
               <l>Of better matter, (which I know's not scant)</l>
               <l>To entertaine your Suitors, when they be</l>
