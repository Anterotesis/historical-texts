            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF in any part of the Christian Religion an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Certainty and most firm Assurance may justly be required; if a scrupulous Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and curious Enquiry may ever be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Matters of Religion; certainly an exact Knowledge of the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> will deserve as our first, so our chief, Consideration. For since the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Christianity are not in themselves self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; nor can be found out by the sole principles of Reason; since all revealed Religions are no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther credible, than as they can demonstrate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to have been true and real, some Rule was necessary, which might propose to Mankind those Articles of Faith which Reason could not suggest, and propose them also with such evidence, as that the denial of assent should in all become irrational.</p>
            <p>What this determinate Rule is, hath been the great Controversie of this and all preceding Ages. However, all parties agree in affixing some certain properties to it, whereby it may be distinguished; and indeed without which it can never supply the Office, or serve the ends of a true Rule. These may be reduced to four Heads, That it be able safely and inviolably to convey down all revealed necessary Truths: That it be fitted to propose them clearly and invariably to all Mankind: That it be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on all other revealed Articles: And lastly, that it be assigned as a Rule by God, the Author of all
<pb facs="tcp:63588:3"/>
revealed Religion. If either of the two first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be deficient, the Rule will be unuseful; if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the latter, uncertain and without authority.</p>
            <p>The Scripture enjoys all these properties in so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a manner, that no reasonable Doubt can be made of the Truth of it. For if we consider, that whatsoever is revealed, may be pronounced; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is pronounced, may be written down; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is committed to Writing may be preserved safe, while those Writings are preserved unaltered; we must conclude, that any revealed Religion may be intirely, and without danger of mistake, proposed from written Books to the universal Belief of Mankind, since these will afford a standing Rule both to Pastors of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their People, and to the People of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of their Pastors, in case of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The independence of Scripture from all other revealed Articles is no less evident. For that these Books were indeed written by those persons whose names they bear, and these persons highly credible, is known by the same evidences whereby the Authors, and Credibility of any other Books are known; I mean by the concurrent testimony and consent of all succeeding Ages, considered not as a Collection of Men professing the Christian Faith, but as persons devoid neither of common sense, nor integrity, as they must have been, if they had mistaken themselves, or deluded us in believing, and then testifying a matter of fact so easie to be known, and more easie to be remembred. Being thus assured of the Credibility of Scripture, that it was written by such Historians, who really, either performed, or saw those Miracles which they do attest, we cannot but believe these Miracles; and consequently, that the Authors and
<pb facs="tcp:63588:3"/>
Founders of the Christian Religion acted by a Divine Commission, and may reasonably command our assent to their Revelations. Being thus assured of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures, we may probably conclude from the nature and end of them, but most certainly from their own Testimony, that they contain all things necessary to Salvation, and are the only Rule of Faith: and all this although we did not yet believe any other Article of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Tradition wants every one of those Conditions which are necessarily required to a Rule of Faith. For first we can never be assured, that any Articles were invariably and intirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any addition or diminution conveyed down to us by Tradition; since it hath been in all Times and Ages observed, that Matters of Fact, much more of Belief, not immediately committed to Writing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently degenerated into Fables, and were corrupted by the capricious Malice or Ignorance of Men. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can exempt the Tradition of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from this Fate, at least from our reasonable suspicions of it, but the Infallibility of that Society of Men which conveys down this Tradition. But the latter can never be known till this certainty of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be first cleared and presupposed, since the Belief of this supposed Infallibility, must at last be resolved into the sole truth and certainty of Tradition.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Tradition cannot certainly and invariably propose the Belief of Christianity to all private persons. For from whence shall this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be received? from a Pope, or a Council, or both, or from none of these, but only the Universal Church?
<pb facs="tcp:63588:4"/>
In every one of these Cases infinite difficulties will occur, which will singly appear insuperable: As, who is a true Pope, what his intentions in defining were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he acted Canonically, in what sense he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined? What Councils, whether Oecumenical, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal or Provincial may be securely trusted? What are the necessary Conditions and Qualifications of a General Council? Whether all these Conditions were ever observed in any Council? What these Councils are, what they have defined, what is the true sense and intention of their Definitions? From whom must we learn the Belief of the Universal Church, if Popes and Councils be rejected? From all Christians, or only from the Clergy? If from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whether the assent of every member of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy be required? If not, how great a part may safely dissent from the rest? From whom the opinion of the major part is to be received? Whether from the Writings of Doctors, or the teaching of living Pastors? If from the latter, whether it be sufficient to hear one or a few Parish Priests, or all, or at least the major number are personally to be consulted? All these Difficulties may be branched out into many more, and others, no less insuperable, be found out; which will render the Proposal of Religion by way of Tradition, if not utterly impracticable, at least, infinitely unsafe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Tradition is so far from being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on other Articles of the Christian Faith, that the Belief of all other Articles must be presupposed to it. For since all Sects propose different Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the truth of none of them is self-evident, it must first be known which is the true Church,
<pb facs="tcp:63588:4"/>
before it can be determined which is the true Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now the knowledge of the true Church can be obtained only two ways, either from the Truth of her Doctrines, or from the external Notes of a true Church. If the first way, then it must first be known what are the true and genuine Doctrines of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the stedfast belief of which causeth this Society to become the true Church. But if the true Church be known only from some external Notes, these Notes are either taught by Scripture, or found out by the light of Reason. If taught by Scripture, then the knowledge of the Divine Authority of Scripture is antecedent to the knowledge of the true Church, and consequently independent on it. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Scripture will be believed for the Authority of the Church, and the Church for the Authority of Scripture: which is a manifest Circle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, in this case that grand Article of Belief in the Holy Catholick Church will be received not from Tradition, but from the Scripture: and consequently Scripture, not Tradition, will be the primary Rule of Faith. Lastly, if the Notes of the Church may be found out by Natural Reason, then to pass by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Contradictions which would arise from such a Proposition, these Notes can be no other than Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Universality, Perpetuity, and such like; every one of which doth some way or other presuppose the knowledge of the true Doctrines of Christianity, as well as those of the present Church. For the end of these Notes is to compare the former with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and consequently both of them must be first known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63588:5"/>Lastly, It can never be proved that Tradition was assigned by God as a Rule of Faith. For this proof must be taken either from the Scriptures, or from Tradition. Not from the first, for not to say, that Scripture is wholly silent in this matter, such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position would destroy it self, and involves a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Contradiction. For if it be a Point of Faith that Tradition is the Rule of Faith, and this Article is deduced and received only from Scripture; then Scripture is the immediate Rule of one Article of Faith, and the mediate Rule of all other Articles; and consequently Tradition cannot be the Rule of Faith. No less absurd is it to imagine any Proof of this Article can be drawn from Tradition. For we can never be assured, the Tradition of this very Article is of Divine Authority, and consequently infallible, until we be first satisfied, that God, by assigning Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for a Rule of Faith, conferred Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon it, which is the matter now in question.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly pointed out some Arguments, which prove that Tradition neither is, nor can be the Rule of Faith. And indeed all Ages of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have been so far satisfied of the truth of this, that in all Controversies the Catholicks no less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly appealed to Scripture, than the Hereticks recurred to Tradition. The pretence of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so easie, and impossible to be refuted by the meaner Christians, that, no wonder if Hereticks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took this more compendious way, when to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Authority of Scripture, would have been too palpable and too gross an impudence. The Standard of written Truths continued always the same, and could not be universally corrupted. Whereas Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb facs="tcp:63588:5"/>
might securely be adapted to the most absurd and contrary Opinions; since to effect that Design no more was required, than the confidence or mistake of Hereticks, pretending to have received their own Dreams and Errors, as necessary Articles of Faith, from their Forefathers. Thus all the Hereticks of the three first Centuries, when the true and genuine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church might much more easily be known, than it can be at this day, proposed their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies under the venerable name of <hi>Apostolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>; which pretence they carried on so far, that they published the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Traditions of almost every Apostle and Apostolick Man, wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Writing those revealed Truths, which they believed the Apostles to have preached, and have left unwritten. In vain should the Fathers and Writers of the Church have recurred to the true and genuine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of unwritten Revelations, since they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver demonstrate, that this true Tradition was rather to be found among them, than among those Hereticks. For many of these Heretical Sects were contemporary with, or began immediately after the Apostles, were vastly numerous, and scattered through the whole Church; and consequently could put in so fair a claim for Tradition, that no human wit could ever have determined the Question, if the Scripture had not been called in, and opposed to such unreasonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions. Accordingly Scripture was ever pleaded by the Catholicks, and the pretence of unwritten Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations derived down by oral Tradition was then esteemed as a Characteristick Note of Hereticks. Thus S. <hi>Augustin</hi>

               </note> assures us, it was the usual evasion of Hereticks,
<pb facs="tcp:63588:6"/>
to decline the Scriptures, and flee to Tradition, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Apostles published not the Gospel to all People, nor committed all revealed Truths to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but delivered many Articles of Faith secretly to approved Men; which Articles were no other than their own Heresies. In the same manner the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, opposed by S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>

               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:63588:6"/>This then was the Artifice and Practice of the ancient Hereticks. What the Practice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers was in opposing these Hereticks, or establishing any necessary Article of Faith; that they accounted Scripture to be the only adequate Rule of Faith, and to contain in express and plain words all things necessary to be believed; that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all Articles, which could not be thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as spurious and false, or at least uncertain and unnecessary; and always asserted the Sufficiency of Scripture, I will not here insist to prove; since that Point hath been so often handled and cleared by the Writers of our Church, more particularly by Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi>

            <p>My Design and the Age of that Treatise which I now publish, require me to descend lower, and demonstrate, that even in latter Ages it was the commonly received Opinion of the Church, that Scripture is the Rule of Faith. And this alone will as evidently overthrow the Plea of Tradition, as if the Consent of all Ages herein were demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated. For since Tradition is the perpetual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of any Doctrine conveyed down in the Church by word of mouth from the Apostles to this present time; if this Succession were in any Age whatsoever interrupted, it can no more claim the Title of Tradition than if it had never been believed. So that if it can be proved, the Doctrine of Tradition, being the Rule of Faith, was in any Age of the Church disbelieved, not only the proof of this Article from Tradition will fail; but even the Article it self will appear to be evidently false. For it is not possible that Tradition should be the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:63588:7"/>
Rule of Faith, if that very Article, that Tradition is the Rule of Faith, were not delivered down by an uninterrupted succession of Belief: for then it would not be the Rule of that very Article. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is absurd, that the Church of any Age should have power of declaring what the Tradition of Faith is, and consequently of fixing the Rule of Faith, and yet be so far from being conscious of any such power inherent in her, that she disbelieved it. Not to say, that if at any time Tradition was not believed by the Church to be the Rule of Faith, and yet at the same time divers Articles of Faith were defined by the Church, Tradition must necessarily ever since have ceased to be the Rule of Faith; since otherwise all Definitions of the Church must indifferently be admitted, made by her both when she followed, and when she deviated from the Rule of Faith; and consequently the Faith of all private Christians must be subjected to infinite uncertainty.</p>
            <p>Now to prove that the Tradition of this Article was in any Age of the Church interrupted and discontinued, it is not necessary, that all members of the Church should then agree in the disbelief of it, that no Doctors should believe Tradition to be the Rule of Faith, or none maintain the Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Scripture. It is sufficient, that some Divines of great name, who lived and died in the Communion of the Church, were ever held in great esteem both for Piety and Learning, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver censured by the Church for any erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, much less for Hereticks, that some such, I say, disbelieved this Article, and maintained
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:63588:7"/>
Scripture to be the Rule of Faith. For if any such were, then the contrary Opinion could not be the belief of the universal Church, much less an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. That there were such Doctors I shall immediately prove, by producing their own Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereby demonstrate my intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And not only so, but farther shall therewith render it highly probable, that it was the generally received Opinion of the Church at that time, that Scripture, not Tradition, is the Rule of Faith, by all those Arguments, which a question of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will admit, I mean by the authority of the most eminent Writers, and publick practice of the Church in Councils. For it cannot be imagined, that so many Learned Persons, esteemed, as it were, the Oracles of their Times, and Pillars of the Church, should either be ignorant of the Doctrine of the Church, touching the Fundamental Principle of Faith, or if willfully opposing it, should obtain, or conserve to themselves so great a Reputation; or that the General Councils of that time should, in their Sessions and Disputations, permit the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture to be laid down as an uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Principle, without giving some check to so grand an Error.</p>
            <p>That the Church therefore in the fifteenth Age did generally believe the Scripture to be the Rule of Faith, and contain all things necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be evidently demonstrated from this Treatise which I now publish. The Author of which was far the most Eminent and Learned Bishop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his time; a person, who, as himself assures us, had spent more
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:63588:8"/>
than twenty years in writing Controversial Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lollards, when he composed this Treatise; and who every where giveth manifest proof of his great Learning. So eminent a person cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have been ignorant of the general Belief of the Church in his time, concerning the Rule of Faith; nor will his apparent zeal for the Interest of the Church, permit us to believe, that he wilfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Doctrine of the Church, in whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he employed the greatest part of his life; or that when he so zealously pleaded the Cause of the Church against the Lollards, he should himself depart from the Church in her principal Article, and therein become a Lollard. Since therefore he plainly asserts and teacheth, that Scripture is the Rule of Faith, this undeniably proves, that the belief of this Proposition, was not, in the time of our Author, accounted any part of Lollardism, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Heresie; but rather esteemed an Article of Catholick Belief, at least, an Article which might be freely disputed, without violating the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, or dissenting from the universal Belief of the Church. And indeed our Author in the beginning of this Discourse assureth us, that the Doctors of his time disagreed in determining, whether the Church or Scripture were chiefly to be respected in the resolution of Faith.</p>
            <p>One thing may be objected against the Authority of our Author; That he was forced, by the ruling Clergy, to recant several Opinions and Doctrines taught by him, as erroneous; and consequently, that he cannot be esteemed a Doctor of the Church. But here not to say, that the sentence of two or
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:63588:8"/>
three partial Bishops (for no more condemned him) is not to be accounted the Judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> this very Recantation addeth no small strength to our Argument. For when the malice of his Enemies obliged him to recant all those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they esteemed to be erroneous, they took no notice of his having asserted Scripture to be the only Rule of Faith, nor obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant that Proposition; a manifest Argument that it was not then accounted either heretical or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or contrary to the received Doctrine of the Church; since otherwise they would not have failed to place it in the front of his Recantation, as an Error of an higher degree, and greater contagion, than any of those for which he stood condemned; which, in truth, were so far from being Heresies, that they were all at that time maintained by many eminent Divines, who never were censured by the Church, and some of them so far true, that no Learned Man of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will at this day deny them. And this also fully clears our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from any suspicion of <hi>Lollardism,</hi> or secret inclination to it.</p>
            <p>That he was not singular herein, defended no Paradox, nor opposed any Doctrine of the Church; I come next to prove: The School Divinity was at that time universally received in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taught in all Universities and Schools, and by long use become in great measure the Doctrine of the Church. The most famous and celebrated Author of this Divinity was S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were then in all Mens hands, universally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, and religiously embraced. Some few Divines
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:63588:9"/>
indeed dissented from him, and followed the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of <hi>Scotus</hi>; but this Disagreement respected not the Rule of Faith, nor indeed any material point of Divinity, but only some abstracted Notions and Scholastick Niceties of Divinity. The Doctrine therefore of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is to be esteemed the general opinion of the Divines and Writers of those times. It cannot be here objected against the force of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the same Divinity is yet retained and taught in most Popish Countries, although the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures Sufficiency be rejected. The Method of Reasoning and Disputing is now infinitely altered among the Writers of the Roman Church from what it was before the Reformation. Before that time they made no difficulty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and even urge the necessity of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; whereas now the Honour of their Church obligeth them to declare it both unnecessary and unlawful. While Scripture was yet looked up in an unknown Tongue, and removed from the knowledge of the Laity, (who were then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very ignorant) they were not ashamed to make confident Appeals, for the Truth of their Doctrine to the Holy Scriptures. When that Veil was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Scriptures translated, and the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more intelligent and inquisitive, some other Artifice was to be found out, which might preserve the Credit of antient Errors, and defend them from the silence and opposition of Scripture. To this end no stratagem could conduce more than the constant Artifice of all Innovators in Religion, the Plea of Tradition. Before that, lesser Artifices could hide the Deformity of their Errors, and while ignorant Christians could be securely misled with false, and
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:63588:9"/>
sometimes foolish Interpretations of Scripture, while <hi>Ecce duos gladios</hi> was thought sufficient to evince the coercive Power of the Pope over temporal Princes; and <hi>Arabant boves, juxta comedebant asini,</hi> could effectually perswade the Laity intirely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign up their Judgments to the Direction of the Clergy, there was no need of any desperate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but when persons became so far inquisitive, as to inquire into Reasons of Things, and demand some better Authority for the belief of Articles imposed on them; nothing less than the arrogant pretence of an infallible Tradition could secure and palliate the contradiction of impossible Propositions.</p>
            <p>To prove therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rule of Faith, to have been intirely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of our Author, I will go no farther than his Sum of Divinity, the most famous and best known of all his Works.

Epistle to S.</hi> Hierom, <hi>To the Books of Scripture only, which are called Canonical, have I learned to pay this honour, that I should most firmly believe none of their Authors to have erred in any thing in composing them.</hi> In the two next Articles it is inquired, whether Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture may use Metaphors, and contain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse senses under one and the same Letter.

                  <hi>Art.</hi> 2.</note> of the nature and properties of the New Law or Covenant, he inquires whether it be a written Law. in resolving of this Question he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not the written Law to Tradition, but to the Law written in the Hearts of Men, by the virtue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghost; and at last concludeth thus: <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <hi>The New Law is principally that very Grace of the Holy Ghost which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Hearts of the Faithful; but secondarily it is the written Law, in as much as those things are delivered in it which either dispose to Grace, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the use of that Grace.</hi> Here the very nature of this Question, and comparison of the Written with the New Law, supposeth that the whole System of revealed Truths is contained in the written Law: and lest we should doubt of this supposition, the latter part of the Passage now cited plainly determines it. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>Aquinas</hi> often reneweth this supposition; and at last comparing the Old with the New Testament, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines thus: <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Omnia quae credenda traduntur in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo Testamento explicitè &amp; apertè, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur credenda in Veteri Testamento, sed implicitè &amp; sub figurâ, &amp; secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm hoc etiam quantùm ad credenda lex nova continetur in veteri.

               <hi>All things which are plainly and explicitely delivered to be believed in the New Testament, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered also to be believed in the Old Testament, but implicitely and obscurely. And in this respect also as to matters of Belief, the new Law is contained in the old.</hi> But if all matters of Belief in the new Law be contained in the
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:63588:11"/>
Old Testament; and whatsoever is contained in the Old Testament, is plainly and explicitly taught in the New Testament: then the New Testament doth not only contain all matters of Belief in the New Law, but also, which is more considerable, proposeth them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and explicitly. He intimates the same no less mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, when he teacheth, That <note n="†" place="margin">

Otherwise he was obliged by all the Laws of Reason to conclude, that an implicit Belief, not of all things delivered by Scripture, but of all delivered by Tradition is required.</p>
            <p>But the most considerable Testimony of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is yet behind. For inquiring whether the Articles of Faith be conveniently disposed in the Creed, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this Objection against it. <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <hi>It should seem that the Articles of Faith are inconveniently disposed in the Creed. For Holy Scripture is the Rule of Faith; to which it is unlawful either to add, or to take away.

But <hi>Aquinas</hi> is so far from doing it, that he allows it, and endeavours to prove, that the Composure of a Creed doth not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily include either any Addition to, or diminution from Scripture.

               <hi>To this Objection it is to be answered, that the truth of Faith is diffusively contained

<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:63588:14"/>
Christ, and must necessarily submit to the Holy Scriptures. Well therefore did S.</hi> Thomas (Aquinas) <hi>allegorize, when he introduced the Samaritan Woman to represent the universal Church: which Woman, when the Citizens of</hi> Samaria <hi>heard preaching Christ, they were induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, &amp;c.</hi> This Passage clearly represents to us the Opinion of <hi>Waldensis</hi> to have been, that by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of the Church, the Divine Authority of the Scripture is known: which being once known, all matters of Belief, and Articles of Faith are to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scripture; just as <hi>Philip</hi> induced <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael,</hi> and the Samaritan Woman her Neighbours to believe Christ to be a Divine Person: of the truth of which, when once satisfied, they learned not the Rules of Life, or Articles of Faith from <hi>Philip,</hi> or the Woman, but received both from Christ himself. And therefore <hi>Waldensis</hi> subjoyns, That <hi>the Authority of the Scripture is far superior to the Authority of all Doctors, even of the whole Catholick Church; and that although the Catholick Church should attest and confirm their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; that the Authority of all latter Men</hi> (following the Apostles) <hi>and Churches ought to be submitted to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the holy Canon, even to its Footstool:</hi> That <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>the former is subjected to the latter, as a Witness to a Iudge, and a testimony to the truth; as a promulgation to a Law, and as an Herald to a King.</hi> As a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony therefore is no farther to be regarded than as it is true, a promulgation invalid, when it either increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth or mutilates the Law; and an Herald not to be obeyed when he exceeds the Commission of the King: so the Decrees, Definitions and Doctrines of the Church are no longer to be respected, than as they are exactly conformable to the Scripture, and deduced from it.

Lastly, shewing how many ways the Knowledge of the Catholick Truth may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he saith, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>It may be obtained best of all, and most certainly from the Canonical Scripture.</hi> He proceeds to prove this from the Authority of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and then concludes; <hi>See four ways of coming to the undoubted Truth, but more or less certain: of which the first and most certain is by the Holy Scriptures:</hi> the rest begetting only an Historical and uncertain knowledge of the Articles of Religion,</p>
            <p>However these Doctors already mentioned were of great authority, and sufficiently declare the common Doctrine of the Church in their time; yet the practice and judgment of General Councils will give us greater assurance of it. Two General Councils were held at the same time in this Age, the one at <hi>Basil,</hi> the other at <hi>Florence.</hi> In both together the whole Western Church was present by its Representatives; and in that of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> the Eastern also. These two Councils indeed thundered out Excommunications one against the other; yet both agreed in using Scripture as the Rule of their Definitions, and in all Disputations laid that down as a common uncontroverted Principle. I begin with the Council of <hi>Basil</hi>; wherein <hi>Iohannes de Ragusio,</hi> a
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:63588:15"/>
Learned Dominican, by the appointment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, disputed publickly in the year 1433. against the <hi>Bohemians</hi> about Communion under both kinds. Here magnifying the Authority of the Church, he urgeth this Argument chiefly, that without the Attestation of the Church, the Divine Authority of the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known; and consequently, that the Authority of the Church is antecedent to the knowledge even of the Rule of Faith, and therefore the first Principle of the Christian Religion. For thus he argues: <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quòd autem praedictus articulus sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alios omnes primus, in quem omnes alii resolvuntur, manifestum est: quia si du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatio circa alios articulos contingit, statim ad sacram Scripturam veluti ad certissimam &amp; inobliquabilem regulam communiter recurritur; &amp; secundùm te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonium veritatis ejusdem sublatis du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biis veritas elucescit.— Nisi autem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae existentia sciatur; nulla est Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae authoritas.

               <hi>But that the aforesaid Article</hi> (the existence of one holy Catholick Church) <hi>is the first of all others, into which all others are resolved, is manifest. For if any doubt arise concerning any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, recourse is immediately made by common consent to the Holy Scripture, as to a most certain and invariable Rule; and according to the Testimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the Truth is cleared, and all Doubts removed.— For unless the Existence of the Church be known, Scripture hath no Authority.</hi> Whether this Argument be valid and conclusive, concerns not my present purpose. It is sufficient, that he assumes this Proposition, <hi>Scripture is the Rule of Faith</hi>; as an undoubted Principle common to both Parties. However, if by a Church in this place he meant no more than a Society of credible Persons, whose unanimous attestation of a matter of Fact ought to be received, the Argument will be good and valid.

all Articles of Faith, saving this one of the Existence of the Church; and attribute to the Church no more than the power of bringing us to the knowledge of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which thenceforward is to be used as our only Rule and Guide. He proceeds to lay down several Suppositions, as Foundations and Postulates of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Determinations. Of these the sixth is conceived in these words: <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sexta Suppositio.

               <hi>Faith and all things necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as well Matters of Belief, as of Practice, are founded in the literal sense (of Holy Scripture) and from thence only may Arguments be drawn to prove those things which are of Faith, and of necessity to Salvation.</hi> The seventh Supposition is this: <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Septima suppositio. S. Scriptura in sensu literali sanè &amp; benè intellecta est infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilis fidei regula &amp; sufficientissima.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Holy Scripture in the literal sense well and soundly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, is the infallible and most sufficient Rule of Faith.</hi> This he doth not only suppose, but also proveth with divers Arguments; of which the second is this: <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Si S. Scriptura non esset sufficiens fidei regula, sequeretur quòd, &amp;c. p.</hi> 1029.</note> 
               <hi>If Holy Scripture were not a sufficient Rule of Faith, it would follow, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, who is the Author of it, had insufficiently delivered it; which is by no means to be thought of God, all whose works are perfect. Besides if Holy Scripture were deficient in some things necessary to Salvation; then those things, which are wanting, might lawfully and meritoriously be superadded from some other Principle: or if any things were superfluous in it, they might lawfully be diminished. But this is forbidden by S.</hi> John <hi>the Evangelist in the last of the Revelations; where he saith,</hi> If any one add to this Book, <hi>&amp;c. From which words of</hi> John <hi>the Evangelist it is clearly proved, that nothing is deficient or superfluous in Holy Scripture: which is also consentaneous to the Author of it, who is the Holy Ghost, as was before said, to whose Omnipotence it agreeth, that he give us a System of Wisdom neither deficient,
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:63588:16"/>
nor superfluous; and that he should deliver it in a method agreeable to our necessity of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> however the Greeks and Latins differed in all other things, till the former were forced into a complyance by the Commands and Threats of their Emperor; yet in this they agreed, in laying down Scripture to be the only Rule and Principle of Faith, although they dissented in determining how far it might be explained by the Church. The Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was occasioned by the addition of <hi>FILIOQVE</hi> to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; this the Greeks maintained to be unlawful, because the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son is not in express Terms taught in Scripture; which they held to be the only Rule of Faith. The Latins denyed not this, but only asserted, that it was sufficient this procession was taught in the Scripture in implicit Terms; the Church having authority by explanation of those obscure Passages, to constitute Articles necessary to be believed, and add them to the Creed, although but implicitly contained in Holy Scripture, the Rule of Faith; and consequently, that to insert <hi>FILIOQVE</hi> in the Creed, was no addition to the Faith, since that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is implicitly contained in Holy Scripture. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Greeks is thus represented by <hi>Bessarion,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Nice,</hi> who was chosen by the Greeks to manage and defend their Cause. <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>that Articles of Faith are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the fountain of Scriptures, which are the Principles of Faith. From this Proposition we infer, that a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Expression and Explication, which is made concerning an Article of Faith, or of the Creed, by the Writings of the Gospel, the Epistles of</hi> Paul, <hi>and the Booke of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by no means to be accounted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous, or a Doctrine of another kind, since it is the Doctrine of God and of the Church. For then only is a proof to be accounted extraneous, when it is made not by the proper Principles of that Doctrine, but by the Principles of some other kind of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As if a Physical Conclusion should be proved by a Mathematical Principle. But according to you the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Old and New Testament are the Principles
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:63588:17"/>
of Faith. Therefore a Proof and Declaration, which is made by these Scriptures, is plainly made by the proper Principles of Faith, and intrinsecal Principles of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.—Yea, this ought not properly to be called an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, this being once granted,</hi> viz. <hi>That it may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deduced from the proper Principles of Faith, that is, from the Holy Scriptures.</hi> This manner of Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in defending the Article then in question, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifests, that the pretence of Oral Tradition, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever entertained by some private Men, had yet gained no general applause in the Western Church.</p>
            <p>From Councils I return to private Writers, but those of so great Repute and Authority, that their Opinion can be esteemed no other than the general Doctrine of the Church at that time. Of these I shall produce only two more, Cardinal <hi>Panormitan,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Florence</hi>; the first, accounted by all, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Canonist of his Age, and by many the greatest of all Ages: and which is more considerable, who had been to the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> what <hi>Gerson</hi> was to that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> an Oracle and Dictator: the second a person of so great Authority in the Church, that in the Judgment of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> he deserved to be Sainted whilst alive, and was really Sainted, when dead. <hi>Panormitan</hi> therefore proposeth his Opinion in these words: <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>In concernentious fidem Concilium est supra Papam.—Puto tamen quòd si Papa moveretur melioribus rationibus, &amp;c.

               <hi>In Matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Faith, a Council is above the Pope.—Yet I suppose, that if the Pope were induced with better Reasons and Authorities than the Council, that his Determination were rather to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For a Council also can err, as it hath sometimes erred. For in matters relating to Faith, even the opinion of one private Man were to be preferred to the Determination of the Pope, if he were induced with better Reasons of the Old and New Testament than the Pope.</hi> Here <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> not only asserteth the Old and New Testament to be

            <p>After so many and so great Authorities, it cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be doubted, what was the general Belief of the Church in that Age touching the Rule of Faith: I mean not, that then the Sufficiency of the Scripture was asserted by all, and denied by none; but only that it was maintained by the greater, and more considerable part of the Church; as the Practice of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Positions of the most famous Writers of that Age do manifestly evince. Many indeed had for some Ages before asserted the existence of some necessary Articles not contained in Scripture, but conveyed down to us by Tradition only; but they equalled not the Followers of the former Opinion, either in number or Reputation. And therefore <hi>Occam</hi>

And of what Repute his Gloss was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> may appear from that vast number of Manuscript Copies of them, which may be found in our ancient Libraries. But I will not any longer insist upon the Writers of this Age, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to confine my Discourse to the fifteenth Age; the general Belief of which, concerning the Rule of Faith, I have already manifested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>It remains, that I say somewhat more particular of the Treatise here published, and of the Author of it. He was born in <hi>Wales,</hi> and bred in <hi>Oriel</hi> College in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; where he was created Doctor of Divinity, and obtained a great esteem for his rare Eloquence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Learning. He was soon taken notice of by that great Patron and Protector of Learning and Virtue, <hi>Humphrey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> at that time Protector of the Kingdom; by whose Favour he was promoted to the Bishoprick of S. <hi>Asaph,</hi> in the year 1444; translated to <hi>Chichester</hi> in the year 1450.</p>
            <p>His singular Learning appears not only from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, which, if put into modern English, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the meanest Reader both rational and elegant: but also from many other plain and manifest Indications. He had read the Works of the Fathers with no small care and diligence; and as it should seem from what he says upon the Article of Christ's Descent into Hell, had made Critical Observations on them, far beyond the Genius and vulgar Learning of that Age. He was not unacquainted with the Genuine Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; and in the first Part of that Work, whereof this Treatise makes the second, citeth the Acts of his Martyrdom, writ by his contemporary <hi>Philo,</hi> and published in this Age by the Learned Bishop <hi>Vsher.</hi> As his Learning ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, so his Zeal prompted him to write divers Books of Controversie in defence of the Church against the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:63588:18"/>
Hereticks of that time, the Lollards: whom he endeavoured by all means possible to reduce into the Communion of his Church: to which Work, as it should seem from divers Passages in the first part, he had dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his whole Life. He mentions many of them in this Work, which are these: <hi>The just apprising of holi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The just apprising of Doctours. Of faith in Latyn. Of Presthode. The Donet. The folower to the Donet. The Represser. The forcrier. The book of Cristen Religion. The provoker. The book of signis in the Church clepid also the boke of Worschiping. The boke of Leernyng. The boke of filling the</hi> IV. <hi>Tablis. This present book of Feith. Of the Churche in Latyn.</hi> Beside these already mentioned, <hi>Bale</hi>

Against <hi>Constantines</hi> Donation. Of the equality of Ministers. Of the Laws and Doctrines of Men. Of Communion under both kinds. Against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Begging. An Account of his own Recantation. The greatest part of these Books are lost, being stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously suppressed by his Enemies, and also burnt at his Recantation. However I have seen his Represser in a fair Manuscript, in the publick Library of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>Quarto.</hi> It is intituled, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressour of over much blaming the Clergy:</hi> wherein he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through all points in Controversie between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Lollards; and largely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confute the latter.</p>
            <p>But as his zeal induced him to plead the Cause of the Church so copiously; so his Learning enabled him to discover the Follies and gross Superstitions practised in that Age: which, when once discovered, his Piety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him to detest. Religion had now passed through so many ignorant and barbarous Ages; the means of greaterknowledge had been so studiously hidden from the People, and the ignorance of the Laity was so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:63588:19"/>
to the interest of the Clergy, that the true Spirit of Christianity seemed to be wholly lost, and had degenerated into Shews and Ceremonies, many of which were unlawful, but almost all unuseful. And not only this fatal stupidity and idle Superstition had generally possessed the minds of Men; but all Remedies were detested, and all Artifices made use of to continue the Disease. Many good and Learned Men endeavoured the Reformation of these Abuses, without departing from the Communion of the Church; but were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein with the usual Fate of the Opposers of inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Evils; who seldom escape the Persecution, but never the hatred of those, who are engaged both by zeal and interest in the continuance of those Evils. Our Learned Bishop was of the number of those brave and generous persons; who while he earnestly invited the Lollards into the Communion of his Church, no less ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently opposed the Superstitions of his own Party. Some Footsteps and Marks of this Disposition may be found in this Treatise; which prove his Integrity to have been equal to his Zeal, and neither inferior to his Learning.</p>
            <p>The Authority of the Church, and Infallibility of her Definitions, had of late been set up as the most suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Engine against the prevailing growth of suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Hereticks. To refute the Arguments of <hi>Wicleff,</hi> and convince his Followers with solid Reasons, neither the Ignorance of the Clergy, nor the Badness of their Cause did then permit. It was accounted too great a Condescension in the Governors of the Church to confute the Mistakes, and inform the Judgments of their seduced People. Yet somewhat, at least, was necessary to dazle the eyes of the unthinking multitude, and at once convict all their Adversaries of the Charge of Heresie. Nothing could be more effectual to this end than the pretence of Infallibility; which alone might satisfie the Scruples, and command the assent of credulous persons. For this reason ever
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:63588:19"/>
since Heresie began to be punished with death, it was thought sufficient to oppose the Infallibility of the Church to the Arguments and Reasons of condemned Hereticks; and the maintenance of this pretence was esteemed the great Bulwark of the Church. However, our Bishop easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the vanity of these pretences; and in this followed the Opinion of the most Learned Writers of his Age, that the Representative Church, or General Councils, were not only fallible, but had sometimes actually erred; that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Definitions of the Church ought to be submitted to the Examination of every private person; that no Article of Faith was to be received, which was repugnant to the Principles of Reason; and that not the Belief and Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church caused any Doctrin to be accounted true, and an Article of Faith, but the presupposed Truth of the Doctrine rendred the Belief of it rational and justifiable.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Doctrine of the Churches Infallibility had by some Men in this Age been advanced so far, that nothing less than a fatal credulity, or no less fatal ignorance could excuse the admission of it. Our Author assureth us in the first part of this Book of Faith, that many Divines in his time argued from those words of S. <hi>Paul: If we or an Angel from Heaven should teach any other D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctrine than that which ye have received, let him be anathema,</hi> that if it should happen that the Church militant and the Church triumphant disagreed in an Article of Faith, the Determination of the Church militant were rather to be followed. Such crude Positions might raise the admiration of fools, but deserved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of wiser Men. Our Author chose to do justice unto Truth in owning and asserting the Fallibility of Church and Councils; and yet not to quit the specious pretence of the Churches authority in pleading her Cause, and confuting the Lollards. This therefore he proposed in a more plausible way, confessed the Church might err, and that even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greatest moment: however, that it would be most safe and rational for ignorant Laymen intirely to submit their judgment to the Direction of the Clergy; that by this submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion indeed they might possibly be led into Error and mortal
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:63588:20"/>
Heresie; but that this would be no disadvantage to them, since in that case God would reward their submission and docility, although to them the occasion of most grievous Errors, no less than if they believed the Christian Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and incorrupted; and would even bestow upon them the Crown of Martyrdom, if they laid down their lives in testimony of their Errors. And since in that Age the Laity were generally very ignorant of the true Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and devoid of all sort of Learning; he included them all in the number of those, whose duty and interest it was to pay an implicit submission to the direction of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>But not only did he disown the Infallibility of the Church, but also disallowed and condemned her practice of burning Hereticks. He desired rather to win them to her obedience by gentle methods, and thought it more noble to convince them by Reasons and Arguments, than by Racks and Fires. This moderation could not but displease his Fellow Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who chose rather at that time to satisfie their Malice by the punishment, than serve the Church by the conviction of supposed Hereticks. But our Author was acted with more noble and generous Principles; he endeavoured to remove their Errors, but refused to practise upon their Lives; and which perhaps was no small part of his Crime, neglected to thunder out his Curses against them, and scorned to treat them with opprobrious Titles. Rather in the first part of this Work he giveth to them an honourable Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and confesseth them to have been generally persons of good Lives and exemplary Conversations.</p>
            <p>The incredible Fables of Legends, and incurable itch of Lying for the Honor of their Saints and Patrons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which then reigned among all the Monastick Orders, and was fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by the credulous multitude, were one of the greatest scandals and most pernicious abuses in the Church at that time. The greater and more necessary Articles of Faith, and all genuine and rational knowledge of Religion had generally given place to fabulous Legends, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Stories; Fables which in this respect only differed from those of the ancient Heathen Poets, that they were
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:63588:20"/>
more incredible, and less elegant. These, our Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop feared not to oppose and disesteem; arraigns them of Error, Heresie and Superstition; proclaims their falseness, and derides their folly.</p>
            <p>This denial of Infallibility, moderation towards the Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards, and disesteem of Legends, drew upon him the envy and hatred of the Clergy, to which may be added, his favour with, and faithful adherence to his Patron Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi>; who had always manifested a moderation towards the dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lollards, and aversion from the superstitious practices of the Clergy. No sooner was the Duke oppressed by a contrary State Faction, but his Client the Bishop was attempted, and his ruin designed. Several Passages were taken out of his Writings, which his Enemies accused of Heresie, at least, of Error. Hereupon in the year 1457. he was cited to appear at a Synod held at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by <hi>Thomas Bourchier,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> attended with the Bishops of <hi>Winchester, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> and 24 Divines; by whom, after a short hearing, he was condemned of Heresie, and injoyned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant his heretical and erroneous Opinions publickly at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross. The Recantation he performed on the fourth day of <hi>December,</hi> when his Books were also publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt. His Fortunes after that time are very uncertain. Some relate him to have been made away in prison; others, to have been kept prisoner in his own Episcopal Palace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his natural death; and lastly, some, that he had a small pension assigned to him out of the Revenues of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick, and retired into a Monastery, where he ended his days in a short time.</p>

That human Reason is not to be preferred to the Holy Scripture. III.

<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:63588:21"/>
V. That no man is bound to believe and obey the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> VI. That the Revenues of Bishops are by Inheritance the Goods of the Poor. VII. That the Apostles composed not the vulgar Creed. VIII. That the Article of Christ's Descent into Hell was not formerly in the Creed. IX. That no other sense is to be attributed to Holy Scripture, but the first and genuine sense. X. That it is not necessary to Salvation, to believe the Body of Christ is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially in the Sacrament. XI. That the Universal Church (in a General Council) may err even in Matters of Faith. XII. That it is not necessary to believe in the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. XIII. That it is not necessary to believe the Communion of Saints. XIV. That the voluntary begging of the Mendicant Friars was unprofitable, and no ways merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>It must not be imagined, that these Articles were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that time accounted erroneous and heretical in the Church. For if we examine them, we shall find that many of them were taught and believed by the greatest Divines of the Church at that time: some at this day allowed to be literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true by the Learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: and in fine, that our Author knew the Doctrine of the Church far better than his Judges; and although condemned by them, was no less Orthodox than they. As for the twelfth and thirteenth Articles, which seem to be most odious,, they are meer Calumnies, as appears from this very Treatise, For to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of it he acknowledgeth it to be necessary to believe the existence of the Holy Catholick Church, and of the Communion of Saints; but yet unnecessary to believe on them, that is, as himself explains it, to give a blind assent to all their Determinations. The seventh and eighth Articles are known to be literally true by all Learned Men. For no proof can be brought, that the Apostles composed this Form of Creed, which we now use: and it is most certain, that the Article of Christ's Descent into Hell was found in none of the Ancient Creeds, for the first 400. years, except in that of the Church of <hi>Aquileia.</hi> The first, second, sixth and ninth Articles, if candidly interpreted, cannot be denied to
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:63588:21"/>
be true by any sober Romanist; and whosoever considers the gross Ignorance and Superstition of those times, will not deny the third. The fourth Article may be justified by the Opinion of many great Canonists, who define all such pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be Symony; and the Church of <hi>France</hi> hath all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long decried and disapproved them.

            <p>That Treatise which I here publish, and which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the present Discourse, was by me transcribed out of a Manuscript extant in <hi>Trinity</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; which seemeth to have been written with Bishop <hi>Peacock</hi>'s own hand, as may be conjectured from the frequent Emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Additions inserted in the Margin, and bottom of the Pages by the same hand. The whole Work was intituled by the Author, <hi>A Treatise of Faith</hi>; however, in the Front of it this Title is affixed by a later hand, Reginald Peacock, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Chichester<hi>'s Sermons, in English</hi>: whereas the whole Treatise is a Dialogue between the Father and the Son, divided into two Books: whereof the first proposeth to treat of the most probable means of reducing the Lollards to the Church, which he assigns to be an intire submission of Judgment to the Decrees of the Church, although supposed fallible. The second treateth of the Rule of Faith. The first Part is chiefly taken up with a long Digression, proving that Faith is only probable, not sciential, or that the Truth of the Christian Religion cannot be proved by demonstrative, but only by probable Arguments. This Dispute is managed in a Scholastick Way, full of Subtleties and Niceties of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and School Divinity, and very obscure: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:63588:22"/>
I thought not worthy either my transcribing, or the Readers perusal. However, I transcribed some considerable Fragments or <hi>Excerpta,</hi> which seemed to me more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy of notice; which I here present to the Reader. The second Book or Treatise of the Rule of Faith, I have published intire, as far as the Manuscript Copy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me. For, which is much to be lamented, some few Leaves were wanting in the end.</p>
            <p>Besides what I have already mentioned, many things may be here found worthy a particular Observation; as with how great ardor he impugns the refusal of submitting the Decrees and Doctrine of the Church to the examination of every private man; how strongly he contends, that God can reveal nothing contrary to our reason, or oblige us to the belief of it: that he rejecteth the authority of <hi>Tobit</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,</hi> as being Apocryphal Books; that a Divorce and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Clergy from their Wives, after Marriage once contracted, in unlawful; that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that Separation, and consequently prohibited not to the Clergy the use of Marriage in the third Canon; that the Church hath no more authority of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and proposing it to the faithful, than hath every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Housholder of proposing it to his Family, every Divine to his Hearers, every Learned Man to ignorant persons; or no more than a Judge hath of expounding the Laws,, or a Grammarian the Rules of Grammar.</p>
            <p>I will not so far presume upon the Judgment of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as to make an Apology for the old and obsolete stile of our Author. If it wanteth the Elegance and Beauties of our modern Language, that must be imputed to the fault of the Age, not any deficience of the Author. I had once intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to represent his Arguments in our modern Language, and publish both together in distinct Columns, but the fear of inlarging these Papers too much, deterred me from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing that design. However, I have drawn up an Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Catalogue of the more obsolete and unusual words, and affixed their significations to them: which the Reader will find at the end of the Book, and may consult upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>

               <p>Fadir ye hau seide in the <hi>X.</hi> Chapter of the first parti of this present Book to alle tho lay men whiche ben obstinat to the feith of the Church, that holi Writt is the chief princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ground of all the feith which is conteined in holi Writt. And treuli fadir y can not undirstonde as yitt but that nedis ye must have so seid to them, yf it mygt be holde for trew in eny wise; nameliehe sithen ye hau seid to them, as ye musten nedis seie to them, and it mygten not be left unseid, that the dewe and rigt literal undirstond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holi Writ for trewe feith to be had. laymen musten fetche at the Churche: that is toseie, that the al hool Clergie of Dyvynite or of the more and wittier party thereof. And redily y know so moche of her wittis and of her counseilis, that ellis if ye hadde not so seid to them, ye schulden la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain; as for to bringe them into the obedience, into which ye ben about by writing of this present Book. Also resoun thereto money thus. The Churche or the Clergie in delyvering to peple feith which is in holi Writt alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gith for thilk delyverance holi Writt, and expowneth holi Writt into thilk feith so delyvered. Wherefore the Churche in that biknows that he hath thilk feith of holi Writ, and so not of him silf principali. Forwhi not of him silf originali or groundeli, but of the seid holi Writ eer and bifore; and therefore of holi Writ originali and groundeli. And so as anentis al feyth conteynyd in holi Scripture the same Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture schulde be principal bifore the Churche. Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionn to the same may be this. If the Churche hadde of him silf principali, groundeli and foundamentali al the feith which is conteynyd in holi Writt, the Churche wolde not and ougte not for to leene to holi Writt as for grounding and foundamental teching of thilke feith: neither wolde sende eny askers into holi Writt, or wolde labore to expowne holi Writt to them into thilk feith. But the Church wolde and ougte to seie to such askers of rigt feith: Bileeve ye to me, for that I seie this to be rigt bileeve. And the Churche wolde not fetche to such askers auctorite of a thing longer and of lasse auctorite to the purpos than
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:63588:25"/>
the Church is. Wherfore the Church, as it seemeth bi his owne pretencioun or interesse to expowne holi Writt in to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which is trewe feith, must nedis knowleche that he takith holi Scripture for his better, worthier, higer and groundier foundament of the Feith, which Feith the Churche techith by holi Writt, and bi the exposicioun of the same holi Writt. And therfore opene it is that ye have not seid amys in this youre now spoken seiyng to laymen. Into the othre contrarie side Fadir manye skilis now be maad, that the Churche is principalier and cheefer than is holi Writt, anentis eny feith taugt by holi Writt, and that for <hi>VIII.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis, which y can make thereto. Wherefore y donte not but that trouble and discencioun schulen be bitiwixe Lay Men and Clerkis, yhe and bitwixe summe Clerkis and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre Clerkis upon this, whether holi Writt or the Churche is chefir and of more power havyng anentis feith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyd in holy Writ: ni lasse thanne ye Fadir answer to thilke <hi>VIII.</hi> Argumentis; and so y can not se but that the mater of this discencioun muste nedis be brougte forth in utteraunce and conicacioun.</p>
               <p>Sone y am redi to heere thi <hi>VIII.</hi> Argumentis, and for to answere to them yf I can. Peraventure in the answering to them schal growe in sum thing, wherebi schal be clerid what comparisoun is to be hadde bitwixe holi Writt and the Churche anentis al feith conteynyd in holi Writt. And bi so moche y am the leefir for to heere thi Argumentis and for to answere to them, bi hou moche thou hast now seid and trouthe is, that the treuthe which is now occasioun of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risoun making bitwixe holi Writte and the Churche mygte not be left unseid and untoold to the Lay Peple neither to Clerkis. And that cause bifore bi thee alleggid.</p>
               <p>Fadir agens this which ye hau allowid bifore in the <hi>X.</hi> Chapter to be trewe, that holi Writt is such a ground and foundement of oure Cristen general Feith, that noon gretter or bettir or surer to us ground or foundament is for oure Cristen general Feith written in holi Writt, y may argue by <hi>VIII</hi> principal Argumentis, of which this is the first. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be seid ground to us of oure feith without which thing oure feith mygte have be sufficientli groundid and witnissid. But without Holi Scripture now had Feith mygte habe be to us sufficiently groundid. Wherfore
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:63588:25"/>
holi Scripture is not to be seid ground of another thing, without which the othre thing may be: and the seconde premysse is to be proved thus. Thoug the Apostlis hadde not write eny word, yet thei mygten have taugt to othre Clerkis and lay folke the al ful hool feith sufficientli to th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihove of the peple as to ther therof the leerning, reporting and remembring; whithe Clerkis and lay folke so taugt of the Apostlis and outlyving to the Apostlis mygten have taugten othere Clerkis and lay folke the same al hool feith sufficientli, which surviving and outlyvyng her Techers mygte have taugte othere folke bothe of the Clergie and of the Layte the same hool feith sufficientli; whiche folke so taugt also surviving and outlyvyng her Techers mygten have taugt the same al hool feith sufficientli to othere; and so forth into this present dai without eny writing maad delivered to folke upon the same feith so taugt. And if this had be doon, thanne the feith of ech Leerners hadde be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientli ynoug groundid in her Techers, and in no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture therupon maad. Wherfore it folowith that Scripture is not, ne was not the ground of feith to eny persoonys bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. That this be trewe which is bifore takun in the profe of the seconde premysse, that thoug the Apostlis hadde not written eny word, thei mygten have taugt the al hool ful feith to peple sufficiently, y may argue thus.

Ferthemore into prof or into confirmacioun of the same seid seconde premysse availith this, that we seen in summe Monasteries the kunnyng and the fulfilling of certeyn usagis and customes be had forth in persoones of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestarie, and be continued bothe in knowing and in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sufficientli fro the first Fadirs of the Monestaries unto this present day, and that without eny writyng maad upon the same usagis, but bi discente of word oonli fro persoone into persoone.

The seconde Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this: If it had be done in dede as is next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove argued, that it mygte so have be doon, that is to seie, if it had be so doon that the Apostlis hadden taugt bi word manye Clerkis and manye of the lay folke the hool al ful

Thoug therwith a Scripture hadde be maad and delyvered forth bi the Apostlis upon the same feith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o bi word taugt to othere. But so it was indede that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlis taugten othre Clerkis the ful al hool feith bi word suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientli, and the Clerkis so taugt of the Apostlis sufficientli taugten othere Clerkis succeding aftir them the same al hool feith, and that bi word sufficientli, and so forth continuali in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this present day. Wherfore the al hool ful feith bothe in the tyme of the Apostlis and alwey ever sithen was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did sufficientli in the Clergie for the tyme beyng and lyvyng, and bi the maner now seid teching and delyveryng. And thanne ferth it folowith thus. If the Clergie for the tyme being bi ther such now seid teching and delyvering was and is sufficient ground for our feith for al tyme sithen the daies of the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lis: it folowith at the leest that for to loke aftir or sette eny othere thing as is Scripture, every othere thing to be ground of the same feith after Cristis teching bi word, and sithen the teching of the Apostlis bi word is no nede. The first premysse of this secunde principal argument is open ynoug to be trewe, and the <hi>II.</hi> Premysse of the same argument schal be proved thus. Crist bade to hise Apostlis <hi>Matth.</hi> the last Ch. thus, <hi>Go ye therefore and teche ye alle folkis, baptizing them in the name of the Fadir and of the Sone and of the Holi Goost: teching them to keep alle thingis whatever thingis y have comaundid to you;</hi> and also <hi>Mark</hi> the last Chap. Crist bede to hise Apostlis thus, <hi>Go ye into al the World, and preche ye the Gospel to every creature:</hi> and anoon aftir it is seid there thus, <hi>Thei forsothe goyng forth prechiden every where.</hi> But so it is, that the Apostlis hadden not fulfilled this now seid Comaundement maad to them bi Crist, in lasse than thei hadden prechid bi word of mouthe sufficientli al the hool feith necessarie to be had of the peple. For whi al the hool feith necessarie to be had is included in the Gospel of God, that is to seie, in the message of God, which message God sent
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:63588:27"/>
into the world. Wherfore sothe it is that the Apostlis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiden bi word of mouthe to othere Clerkis and folkis al the hool ful feith sufficientl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and so the secunde bifore maad prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal premysse to be proved is trewe. The <hi>III.</hi> principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this, If the Apostlis hadden taugt manye Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis and manye of the laifolk the hool al ful feith bi word of mouthe principali; and these Clerkis and laifolk survyvyng and outlyvyng to the Apostlis hadden taugt bi word prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipali the same hool feith to othere Clerkis, and to othere folk aftir the deeth of the Apostlis, and so forth into this day: thanne the al hool feith so taugt bi word of mouthe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pali and descending bi word principali fro persoonys into persoonys unto this present day hadde be principali groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in the Clergie whilis the Clergie so taugt othere, thoug therwith had be a Scripture maad and delyvered forth bi the Apostlis to othere upon the same feith. But so it was in dede that the Apostlis taugten othere Clerkis the hool ful feith bi word principali, and tho clerkis so taugt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlis bi word principali taugten othere clerkis succeding to them the same al hool feith, and that bi word principali, and so forth contynueli into this present day. Wherefore the al hool feith bothe in the tyme of the Apostlis and alwey sithen was groundid principali in the Clergie for the tyme beyng and lyvyng; and bi maner nowe seid teching and delyver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. And thanne ferth it folowith thus, If the Clergie for the tyme veyng bi ther nowe seid such teching and delyver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng was and is the principal ground for our feith for al tyme aftir the daies of the Apostolis; it folowith at the fulle that to loke aftir or seche aftir or seie Scripture to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ground of our feith, or that Scripture schulde be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ground thereof, or more necessarie and better grounding of the same feith, thanne is the Clergie of the Church aftir the daies of the Apostlis, is waast ydel vanite and untrewe. The first Premysse of this <hi>III.</hi> principal argument is pleyn ynoug to be trewe. And for profe of the <hi>II.</hi> premysse of this <hi>III.</hi> principal argument may be maad the same argument, which bifore is maad for profe of the <hi>II.</hi> premysse of the <hi>II.</hi> principal argument, and that bi the rehercid Textis of <hi>Matt.</hi> the last chapter, and <hi>Mark</hi> the last chapter. The <hi>IV.</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal argument is this, The Church of Crist which be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did on erthe, and of which he is the heed, is alwey and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:63588:27"/>
oon and the same, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witnessith, where he seith that to man to have by the lawe oon Wyf undeptabili signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Crist to have oon Church for his spouse. And the same witnessith the Clergie bi the profis or sequencis, whiche he singith in the Masse of Dedicacioun Feest day, and in the <hi>VIII.</hi> day of the same Feest, and this same is comounli alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goriesed upon thilk Text <hi>Cant. Oon is mi Dove.</hi> But so it was that in the tyme of the Apostolis the Churche of Crist in erthe bi his principal partly, which was the Clergie, was of so greet worthinesse and auctorite and dignite, that he thanne more groundid the Feith of Crist, than Scripture groundid feith of Crist thanne. For whi the Apostlis thanne beyng the Clergie of Cristis Church groundid more Cristis Feith than ther writyng maad and writen bi them groundid as thanne the same Feith: in as moche as the effect of a cause dooth not so moche in to another effect as doith the cause of the same effect into the same other effect aftir good Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie. Wherfore it seemeth folowe that the Church of Crist nowe being, and at al tyme a this side the Apostlis for the tyme being is and was of great worthinesse, auctorite and dignite, that he now more groundith the Feith of Crist than Scripture groundith now the same Feith. Sithen oon and the same Churche is nowe and thanne, and therfore bi like skile the same Clergie of the Churche is now which was thanne. The <hi>V.</hi> principal argument is this, The Clergie of the Churche dispensith with the thing which holi Scripture forbedith. For whi the Pope geveth leeve to a Bigam, that is to seie to a man that hath be twies weddid, to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kene and a Prest, notwithstonding that holi Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedith it. <hi>1 Thi. 3.</hi> c. <hi>But so it is that the lesse worthi refreyneth not the worthier, neither lowseth the buidingis of the worthier.</hi> Wherfore the Clergie of holi Churche is worthier mygtier and of gretter auctorite than is holi Scripture, or at the leest the Clergie is of evene worthinesse, even power, and mygte and of auctorite with holi Scripture of the newe Testament. The <hi>VI.</hi> principal argument is this, The Chirche of Crist bi his cheef party the Clergie now and al tymes hath power to expowne, declare and interprete holi Scripture, thoug holi Scripture oweth to be undirstonde in the sense and undirstond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God. But so it is that even peer hath power into his eeve peer aftir the comoun wel allowid proverbe; neither the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:63588:28"/>
lesse worthi hath power on his worthier, as may be takin of <hi>Paul, Heb. 7.</hi> chap. where he seith, <hi>That the lesse worthi is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid of the more worthi.</hi> Wherfore it seemeth that the Clergie and the Chirche bi his party, which is the Clergie is more worthi than is holi Scripture. The <hi>VII.</hi> principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this, What ever thing nedith to have upon him silf an interpreter or a declarer, nedith to have the same thing as his overseer and worthier. But so it is, that holi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nedith to have of him silf an interpreter and a declarer, which is the Clergie in erthe, as for to schewe which is the dewe understonding of holi Scripture. Wherfore holi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nedith to have the Clergie is to be to holi Scripture an overseer and to him as a worthier. The <hi>VIII.</hi> Argument is this, What ever thing the Apostlis settiden in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moune Crede is to be bileeved and to be holden and usid of alle Cristen. But the Apostlis settiden in the comune Crede this Article, that is, for to bileeve to the general holi Chirche in erthe. Wherfore nedis it is to bileeve to the universal or general holi Chirche in erthe. And we mowe in noon othere wise bileeve to holi Chirche in erthe than we bileeven to the Clergie of the general Chirche in erthe, for as myche as the Clergie is the principal parti of holi Chirche in erthe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it folowith that nedis we must bileeve to the Clergie of the general Chirche in erthe. And if the Clergie ougten in eny dede be bileeved, he ougte be bileeved in his dede whanne he determyneth eny Article to be taken as feith. For as myche as this dede is oon of the grettist aviseable dedis, which the Clergie dooth. Wherfore alle Cristen owen for to bileeve to the determynacioun of the Clergie thoug he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne agens holi Scripture.

The <hi>II.</hi> premysse of the same first principal Argument, whanne it is seid thus, Without holi Scripture our nowe had feith mygte have be to us suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientli groundid is fals, for to speke of kindeli mygte in our side and in our Soulis without greet singular myracle of

God above kind to have be doon in oure resouns and mynde. And it is moost convenient in this purpos to speke. And whanne for prof of this <hi>II.</hi> premysse it is argued thus, Thoug the Apostlis hadden not write eny word, yitt thei mygten have taugt to othere Clerkis and layfolk the hool al ful feith sufficientli, so theli this is fals. For whi a Feith is not taugt to a peple sufficientli, but if it be taugt so that bi thilk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thei mowe cleerli undirstonde al it, and esili reporte al it, and remembre al it perfitli and currauntli, and kunne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herce it and talk it in a stable foorm of wordis without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaunce maad in wordis and processis whanne it is at dyverse tymes rehercid. And but if thei mowe have recours therto and to ech poynt therof redeli whanne eny nede schal aske. And sotheli for to speke of al the hool ful Feith written in the Gospels and Epistlis it may not in this seid wise be taugt, without that it be write, and but if the writing therof be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyvered to the Clergie. Wherfore oure al hool Feith which is now bitaken to us in Scripture, mygte never bi kinde have be taugt sufficientli to eny peple without therof the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and thoug ful manye a processe withynne the boondis of the Gospels ben lawe of resoun and of kinde, yitt this that Crist taugt it and rehercid it is Feith: and so the al hool Feith writen in the Gospels is oon long a tale for to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientli learned without therof the writyng. And therfore si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then neither the Apostlis neither eny othere Clerkis mygten have taugt sufficientli the seid Feith without Scripture, and the peple mygte not bi studiyng in the Scripture have leerned without techers; it folowith nedis that holi Scripture is more worthi ground of our Feith than is eny congregacioun of the Clergie. O my Sone, if thou woldist take hede hou a tale or a tiding bi the tyme that it hath runne thoroug <hi>IV.</hi> or <hi>V.</hi> mennys mouthis, takith pacchis and cloutis, and is chaunged in divers parties, and turned into lesingis, and al for defaute of therof the writing: and hou that langagis whos reulis ben not writen, as ben englisch, freensch and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye othere ben chaungid withynne yeeris and cuntrees, that oon man of the oon cuntree and of the oon tyme mygte not and schulde not kunne undirstonde a man of the othere kuntre and of the othere tyme, and al for this, that he seid langagis ben not stabili and foundamentali writen: thou schuldist ful soone and ful sikirli deeme, and so schulde ech wel avisid man deeme,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:63588:29"/>
that the long tale of the Gospels mygte never bi eny long tyme be truli and aftir oon maner toolde and reportid and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brid of dyvers folke without therof the writing: but manye a cloute schulde therto be sette, and maney a good pece therof be takin awey, and moche strys schulde ther be about the trewe rehercel therof, as which were trewe rehercel therof and whiche were not so: but if the same long tale of the Gospels were write. And therfore there may no teching of the Clergie ground weel &amp; sufficientli to us oure seid Feith. And yitt the writyng maad and purveied bi God and bi the Apostlis, and bi the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlis heerers of thilke same long tale may grounde suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ientli the same Feith in ech Clerk or Lay-man notabili resoned for to understonde what he redith in the newe Testament, though he not leerne the same Feith bi eny general Counseil, or eny multitude of Clerkis tokider to be gaderid, thoug peraventure he schal have nede at some while and in some textis of the seid Scripture seche to have expositioun hadde bi the eldist party of the Churche joyned to the Apostlis and lyvyng in tyme of the Apostlis, as soschal be taugt in the book of Feith in Latyn and in the book of the Chirche. Verily as y may trowe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roug al the tyme of werre during these <hi>XL.</hi> yeer bitwixe <hi>Ynglond</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> wiste y not scant <hi>III.</hi> or <hi>IV.</hi> men, whiche wolden accorde thorug our in telling hou a toun or a castel was wonne in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or hou a batel was doon, the though thilk men were holden rigt feithful men and trewe, and thoug ech of them wolde habe swore that it was trewe what he tolde, and that he was present and sawe it. Wherfore bi all resoun in-lyk maner it wolde have be and was in dede of the report of the dedis and wordis of Christ, eer thei were writen bi the Evangelistis. And that in dede it was so therynne witnessith <hi>Luk</hi> in the prolog of his Gospel, and seith that therfore he was movid for to write the Gospel which he wrote. And so bi lyk skile for the same cause the othere Evangelistes gave them to writing. Hou ever therfore mygte it have be wel and trewe of oure Feith, if it schulde have come to us bi reporte of heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bi mouth speking without therof the writing. Also what that ever eny counseil of Clergie, or eny Clergie without gadering into counseil techith as Feith, even the Clergie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrith his so maad teching of Feith into holi Scripture. And therfore needis the holi Scripture is more worthi ground for oure Feith, than is the Clergie of the hool chirche on erthe.

               </gap>ertis it is the writing of the oold Testament and of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For it witnessith al the Feith or ellis at the lest wel nigh al the Feith, which Crist sechith of us. Yhe and the writing of the newe Testament confeermeth al the oold Testament in that, that the writyng of the newe Testament referrith us oft into the writyng of the oold Testament; as <hi>Matt. XXVI.</hi> ch. <hi>Mark XII.</hi> and <hi>Mark XIV. Johne I. Luke XXIV. Johne V.XVII.XIX.</hi> and <hi>XX.</hi> and in manye placis of the Epistlis of the newe Testament. Ferthemore sone not oonli the writyng of the al hool Feith in the Gospels is so necessarie to the peple being a this side the Apostlis, but also the same writyng maad and writen of the Apostlis were rigt necessarie as bi wey of kinde and of resoun to the same Apostlis, that bi the writyng of the Apostlis whiche thei wroten, thei himsilf migten holde in mynde the multitude of tho trouthis there writen. And that bi recurse to be maad of them into the seid writyng left that therof the perfigt mynde schulde bi kinde falle away from them, whilis thei were so moche in dyverse troublis occupied. And so therfore ful opene it is, that the writyng of oure Feith is more necessarie ground to us for oure Feith, than is eny congregacioun of Clerkis biganne sithen the deeth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlis. For answer to the Textis bifore alleggid of the oold Testament in the first argument it is to be seid that thoug bi tho Textis it is had fadris schulden teche bi mouth ther sones and ther sones sones the lawis of God and the benefits of God. Yitt bi tho Textis it is not hadde that thilk to be doone bi mouthe schulde have be sufficient teching to tho sones and sones sones without writing: and therfore tho textis maken not into the entent, into which the first argument them alleggith. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lich sithen in the processis of the same Textis it is had among that it is bede with al this that the fadris schulden teche ther sones bi mouthe, it is had in the last of tho Textis that is to seie <hi>Deutron.

And this is ynoug for answere to tho Textis. More thing according to this answer and confeermyng it thou maist see soone in the booke of leernyng in thi vulgar tunge. But thanne fadir if it was so necessarie writyng to be had upon Christen Feith, whi was writyng of oure Feith so long tyme

deferrid eer it was maad by the Apostlis, as that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote his Gospel in the <hi>VII.</hi> peer aftir Cristis ascencioun, and <hi>Mark</hi> wrote in the <hi>X.</hi> yere aftir Cristis ascencioun, as may be had bi croniclis of <hi>Martyn</hi>; and <hi>Luk</hi> wrote aftir othere writers of the Gospelis, as he seith him silf in the prolog of his Gospel. And <hi>Jon</hi> wrote aftir alle the othere, as manye men trowen. Also whi wrote not ech Apostle as wel as summe? Also whi wroten not thei to ech Cuntre? Sone an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to thi first questioun may be this. Our Lord is wisist, and he is for to lede us into oure kunnyng to be had in profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilist maner alwey rediest. And for as myche as peple to know bi experience hou necessarie it was to them for to have their Feith writen was to them more profitable than for to knowe it without experience: therfore God so schope that the Feith schulde bi a notable time be prechid oonli bi word to the peple, that thei mygten therbi take experience, that preching of the al hool Feith bi word oonli were not sufficient without therof the writyng, and thanne that therfore the peple schulde desire to have the Feith writen, and the Apostlis schulden se the same treuthe bi experience, and schulden consente for to write to the peple the same Feith, which bifore bi parcellis thei prechiden bi word. An othere cause mygte have be this. A preciouse thing whanne it is ligtli and soone gotten without long bifore goyng desrie to have it, schal be the lesse sette bi, whanne it is receyved. For as myche as the writyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning oure al hool Feith is preciose, and ougte not be sette litil bi, neither be feyntli and unworthili receyved, therfore God so schope that it was long of the peple desirid eer thei it receyveden: as for lyk skile God differreth ful holi mennys boonys, for that bither long desiring and priyng and abiding aftir it thei schulden the more joie have, and the more thanke God, whanne thei it receyveden. An othere cause rennyng herwith mygte be that the Apostlis hadden not grettist leisers for persecuciouns, that thei mygten anoon in the bigynnyng have writen, and peraventure longe tyme in the biginnyng the Apostlis prechiden not, neither mynystriden to the peple but a fewe articles of Feith: as were these of Crists comyng, and of his incarnacioun, and of the cause whi he came. And longe tyme minethis mygte suffice for to bringe the peple into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and bileeve of these fewe Feithis. Also scolers in ech kinde of scole schulden not be oppressid in the bigynnyng of

ther scole with overmanye maters to be mynistrid to them at oonys or suddenli or oversoone. And therfore a good while bi yeeris scolers in the scole of cristendoom herden peces mele the Feith prechid eer the hool summe and birden therof was delyvered to them bi writing. And thus myche for answer to thi first questioun. If it be trewe that <hi>Joon</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list wrote his Gospel eer than it is seid that he wrote; and so that he wrote his Gospel bifore his comyng from exile, as therto may be hadde greet motyve bi the writyng is of Seynt <hi>Denis</hi> Areopagite, bi cause <hi>Joon</hi> hadde writen his Gospels eer <hi>Denys</hi> wrote hise bookis. Thanne answere to the secunde questioun may be this. Right as what is necessarie to a comonute is to be purveid fore: so what is waast and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berose and chargeose to a comonute is to be left of, and to be avoidid. And for as much as whanne <hi>Mathew, Mark, Luk,</hi> and <hi>Joon</hi> haden writen, the othere Apostlis sithen these wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingis, and sithen these writingis were sufficient to expresse the comyng of Crist, the birth of Crist, the lyvyng of Crist, the teching of Crist: and therfore the othere Apostlis wolden not as for the same maters combre the peplis wittis with eny more writingis therupon. And that what oon Apostle or a Disciple wrote, alle the othere Apostlis and Disciplis knewen. We mowe take mark bi this, that <hi>Petir</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil the laste knowlechith that he wiste of <hi>Poulis</hi> writing; and bi a greet liklihode he knewe what the othere writers wroten: and bi as myche greet liklihood <hi>Poul</hi> wist what <hi>Petir</hi> wrote, and what ech othere writer wrote; and therfore he himsilf wrote noon Gospel, but helde him content with the Gospels writen of othere. Namelich siithen <hi>Luk</hi> was felowe to <hi>Poul</hi> in mych of alle <hi>Poulis</hi> labouris, and therfore to <hi>Poul</hi> mygte not be straunge and unwist the writing of <hi>Luk.</hi> And also that it was not to <hi>Poul</hi> unknown, it seemeth wel herbi. For in the first Epistle to <hi>Corinthies</hi> the <hi>XI.</hi> ch. <hi>Poul</hi> rehercith the processe of <hi>Luk</hi> the <hi>XXII.</hi> ch. wel nyg word bi word. And thus myche Sone for answere to thi <hi>II.</hi> questioun. To thi <hi>III.</hi> questioun y answere thus, The Apostlis knewe weel as thei mygten wel knowe bi resoun, that the writyng of oure general Feith wole serve like wele to peple of each cuntre, as to peple of oon cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: and thei wisten that the oon same writyng mygte and schulde renne from oon cuntre into anothere cuntre, like as <hi>Poul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Colociens</hi> biddith that thilk same
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:63588:31"/>
Epistle schulde be radde to the peple which ben callid <hi>Laodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes.</hi> And therfore it was no nede to make to dyverse cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees dyverse writingis in this wise dyvers; that thei schul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den conceyve dyverse maters, thoug the writing of oon and the same mater mygte be writen or translatid into dyverse langagis.

Fadir y perceyve wel hou ye hav declarid ful wel that what was taken to prove the seid <hi>II.</hi> premysse in the first principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is untrewe, and therfore it is to be denyed. But ye hav not answerid to the argumentis for the prof of it what was so taken in to the prof of the same seid <hi>II.</hi> premysse. Therfore Fadir answere ye to them.

For whi tho textis wole no more than this, that God wolde the oold Lawe and the oold Feith be leerned bi heering of word. But certis herof folowith not that God wolde or meened it to be leerned so and in lyk maner sufficientli. And therfore the textis hurten not myn entent, neither thei proven the entent wherfore thou brougtist them forth into thin argument.

Therfore in this case it is not to renne into myracle, thoug divers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctouris in this case, and in special <hi>Gregory</hi> upon <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> without myche avisement, and soon moved bi devocioun so doon. Also of sum thing doon bifore the flood of <hi>Noe,</hi> wherof
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:63588:32"/>
no mensioun is maad in the writing of <hi>Moyses,</hi> we have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in stories, as of this, that <hi>Lameth</hi> was an hunter and dymme of sigt, and that he was lad bi a yong man in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that he schotte <hi>Cayn</hi> bi dressing of the seid leder. Of this thing so untaugt in <hi>Moyses</hi> writing we mygte not have had knowing, if there had not be eny writing bifore <hi>Noes</hi> flood of thingis which bifelle bifore the same flood. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such writing of stories was bifore <hi>Noes</hi> flood. And thanne ferthe if such storying of worldli chauncis was writen bifore <hi>Noes</hi> flood: moche rather storying of worthi goostli thingis was writen bifore the same flood. And if this be trewe, thanne suche writen stories weren kept saaf bi <hi>Noe</hi> in his schippe for skile bifore maad: and so thei came aftirwarde into the knowing of <hi>Moyses,</hi> as is bifore argued: and <hi>Moyses</hi> compiled the book <hi>Genesis</hi> out of them: and whanne the bokis of <hi>Moyses</hi> were hadde, the othere bokis fallen out of use, as it is likli to bifall; for so it fallith in othere lyk casis. O Fadir me thenketh ye holden a ful reasonable wey in this mater, and such a wey, which hath more likli evyden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis for it, than hath the contrari party.

But certis out of this folowith, as semeth to me, that we schulde holde this party, that <hi>Esdras</hi> renewid not the oold Testament in writing bi gift of inspiracioun, as is comounli holde: but that he renewid the oold Testament in this wise, that he maad be writen and multiplied manye bookis of the oold Testament manye mo than there were bifore, and that for zele which that he hadde to this that Goddis Lawe schulde be wel knowe, thoug of ech kinde of tho Bookis sum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie was bifore. For whi like evydencis ben that <hi>Esdras</hi> hadde Copies of the oold Lawe, as ben evydencis that <hi>Moyses</hi> hadde Copies for to write or compile bi them the Book of <hi>Genesis.</hi> Yhe gretter evydencis to holde this now seid affirmative party, thanne ben evydencis for to holde the contrarie negative party. Sone y holde wel with thi conceyt in this mater, and the evidencis therto ben these. Hou ever yvel the Peple of Iewis at eny tyme was, yitt thei were never without summe holi lovers and keepers of the same among them. Forwhi whanne grettist ydolatrie was
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:63588:33"/>
usid in <hi>Jewri</hi> in the daies of King <hi>Achab</hi> so fer forth, that the Prophete <hi>Hely</hi> weved and seid to God, <hi>That of alle the Jewis there was noon but he al oon left alyve which lovyd and kept the Lawe.</hi> The Lord answerid to <hi>Hely</hi> and seid, (that it was not so, for he kept to him he seide) <hi>More than five hundrid in Israel, whiche never bowid ther knees to Baal.</hi> That is to seie, to the fals God, which in tho daies was worschipid openli thorug al <hi>Israel.</hi> And if this was trewe in tho daies of grettist ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that there was manye privey lovers and kepers of the Lawe; bi like skile it schulde be trowid, that in ech othere tyme there weren suche lovers and kepers of the Lawe. And in lyk it was in ech tyme whanne <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was in traldom bi enemyes withoutforth, and whanne the <hi>Jewis</hi> weren tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatid into <hi>Babilonye,</hi> and whilis thei dwelliden there. But so it is, that no man lettrid wolde caste him to be urri knower of the Lawe, and therfore an urri keper therof, but that he wolde caste him to have the same lawe in writing. Wherfore in alle tymes of the <hi>Jewis,</hi> both whilis thei were in the lond of <hi>Israel,</hi> and whilis thei were in the lond of <hi>Babilonye,</hi> there were among summe of them bokis writen of the lawe and usid of them: thoug the lawe writen in summe bokis was brent in the brennyng of the Temple. Also <hi>Jeremye</hi> lyvede and abode in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whilis the last and grettist captivite of the citee was maad, and whilis the <hi>Jewis</hi> weren laste translatid, and the temple was distroied, and herof he proficied, and wrote his Prophecie a litil before eer this grettist and last captivite was doon. And aftir that this captivite was doon, he abiding in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with the releef and rescail of the <hi>Jewis,</hi> wrote his book clepid the Trenys. But al this was not likeli to be, if <hi>Jeremye</hi> schulde not have had with him the Book of the Lawe, into the keping of which lawe he so often preachid and stirid the peple. Wherfore it is to be trowid that <hi>Jeremye</hi> had with him alwey writen a book of the lawe; thoug sum book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning the same lawe was brent in the temple. And for lyk skile it is to be trowid that <hi>Ezechiel</hi> hadde also the lawe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which <hi>Ezechiel</hi> lyved in tyme of this grettist and last thraldom, and was caried into <hi>Babylonye</hi> fro <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with the greet route. And in <hi>Babilonie</hi> the fifth yere of this thraldom he bigan to prophecie there in <hi>Babilonie.</hi> Also sumwhat bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thraldoms of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the King of <hi>Joas</hi> maad the book of of the lawe be knowun, and be publischid ful myche, which
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:63588:33"/>
long bifore was unknown as to the Prestis and to the more multitude of the peple. Wherfore it is lyk that in this Kingis daies there were writen in greet noumbre manye bokis of the lawe. Nameli sithen the peple were thanne brougt into a greet devocioun anentis the lawe, as it is open. Also in ech tyme of <hi>Jewis</hi> there weren summe Prophetis, as may be takun bi the prologgis of <hi>Jerom</hi> into the bokis of Prophetis, and also bi the text: and to them it longid to not be unknowers of the lawe, in as moche as God comaundid his lawe to be of his peple knowun. And without writing such so long a law mygte not be knowun. Wherfore at alle daies of the <hi>Jewis</hi> both in <hi>Israel</hi> and in <hi>Babilonie</hi> there were bokis al redi of the same writen. And herto wolde serve ful openli the storie of <hi>Thobie,</hi> and the story of <hi>Susanne, Daniel</hi> 13. ch. ne were that thei ben Apocrisis. Also <hi>Daniel, Esdras, Neomyas, Zorobabel, Mardoche, Hester,</hi> and othere were kepers of the lawe, whilis thei weren freeli in <hi>Babylonie</hi> inhabiting, as the storie of the Bible makith mencioun. Wherfore it is like that thei had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the lawe writen, namelich sithen thei mygten sende and have messages to and fro <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Babylonie.</hi> And if al this be trewe, certis it is likli ynoug, that whanne <hi>Esdras</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel</hi> came fro <hi>Babylonie</hi> into <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for to bilde agen the citee and the temple: thei hadden bokis al redi writen of the lawe: and thanne hereof folowingli this that <hi>Esdras</hi> renewid the five bokis of <hi>Moyses</hi> and alle the stories in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hise daies, is to be undirstonde thus: that he wrote or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokid or ordeynyde to be writen and multiplied manye bokis of the same lawe in great noumbre, wherof was not but fewe bifore. And if this be trewe, as it hath more likeli eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis to be trowid for trewe than hath his contrarie party: it folewith that for to seie this whiche summe Doctouris co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounli holden with the Maistir of stories, that <hi>Esdras</hi> bi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracioun wrote without eny copi alle the five Bokis of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and alle the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Forwhi sithen bi answer maad to the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal argument it is declarid that the Apostlis mygten not without writing teche sufficientli oure al hool ful feith, wherof nowe is the newe Testament writen, it folewith that thei taugten not without writing sufficientli the same seid al hool ful feith, whiche is agens and contrarie to the second premysse of the second principal argument.

Ferthemore thoug Christ bede as thou allegist <hi>Matt.</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> the last chapitris, hise Aposilis to preche al the hool Gospel, and so al the hool feith to ech creature by parcel mel in word speking of dyvers tymes, and thoug thei fulfillid this Comaundement, yitt herof fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowith not that Crist has herynne bade them preche the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and the al hool feith as sufficientli or principali to be doon. For Crist wolde that a good preching not sufficient neither principal schulde go bifore the teching ful and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and principal: which principal and sufficient teching aftir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward schulde be doon bi writing oonli, or ellis bi word and writing togidere.

But certis open it is to ech mannys resoun that thoug the Chirche nowe lyvyng be in this seid maner of reputacioun the same Chirche whiche the Apostlis weren, yitt it nedith not to folowe that this Chirche nowe lyvyng hath like moche kunnyng and power for to witnes oure feith as hadde the

Chirche, which the Apostlis weren. Neither it folowith that this Chirche now lyvyng hath more kunning and power forto witnesse than hath the writing of the newe testament forto so witnesse: thoug it were so that the Chirche of the Apostlis hadde kunnyng and power forto so more witnesse. And al herfore. For this Chirche is not the same Chirche in kinde, in being, and in substaunce with the othere seid Chirch, rigt as these pesoonys be not tho persoonys. And thilk Chirche had informacioun of the feith bi heering the Apostlis and the Evaungelistis, whiche the Chirche now being hath not, but so sechith aftir forto have bi reding in the writing of the Apostlis and Evangelistis. And so, Sone, if thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dist this argument if it were maad to thee: this Chirche now lyvyng, and the Chirche of the Apostlis weren oon in the seid reputacioun. Therefore as the Apostlis weren in this degree of holi lyvyng and mygten do myraclis, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eke with dyvers tungis and write a new testament, and witnesse that thei sawe Crist do and suffre, and herd him teche; so this Chirche now being is lyk holi, and may do lyk greet myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clis, may speke with dyverse tungis, and write a newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and witnesse that he sige Crist do and suffre and herde him teche. Even so in lyk maner thou schalt be moved forto deme thin owne fourth principal argument that it make no folowing: which argument is this. The present Chirche is alwey oon and the same with the Chirche of the Apostlis. Wherfore as the Chirche of the Apostlis groundid the feith more than Scripture it groundith; therfore the Chirche, which now is, groundith more our feith than Scripture it groundith. Hou ever it be of the conclusioun or of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the argument, which conclusioun or consequent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be trewe or no schal be tretid in the boke of the Chirche in Latin. And ferthemore, Sone, thoug thou woldist putte a successive aggregate of alle the Apostlis and of alle Cristen Men, whiche ever weren ben and schulen be, to be the Chirche of Crist, and therfore that there is alwey thoroug al tymes oon, and the same Chirche in aggregate being kinde and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce: yitt herof folowith not that hou ever kunnyng holi mygti and worthi this aggregat was in eny time bifore in hise parties passid, so kunnyng holi mygti and worthi this aggregat is now in hise parties now being: no more than fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowith if the successive aggregate mygte as he was thanne in
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:63588:35"/>
hise parties passid do myraclis, that the same aggregat may do now as he is in hise parties now being: no more than it folowith, if <hi>Ynglond</hi> sumtyme mygte make such a conquest, therfore he schal be ever a power forto make lyke greet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. And therfore, Sone, if thi fourth argument be maad in this wise, the hool successive aggregat of Clerkis is now which was in the tyme of the Apostlis; but in thilk this aggregat was a worthier witnesser of oure feith than was Scripture: therfore so is this aggregat now. Certis this argument is not worth. For he concludith and makith no folowing. Nevertheles, Sone, for to putte and holde such a successive aggregate in kinde in propirte without figurative speche is agens good Philosophie, and therfore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agens good resoun, and agens trouthe, as ful wel mygte be provyd, if this place were according to trete such mater. But whilis the putting and the holding therof hurtith not my present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, y wole here lete the treting therof passe undir suffraunce. For answere to thi fifth principal argument thou schalt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirstonde that scripture of the newe testament is not thorug ech party of him lyk in auctorite in worthines and in dignite. For whi summe parties of Scripture techen to us feith, summe techen to us lawe of kinde and of natural resoun, as the text in it silf wel schewith, and <hi>Austyn</hi> witnessith the same. Nevertheles this that Crist taugt thilk lawe of kinde and of resoun, wherof it is writen in holi writte that Crist them taugte, is feith. For whi, this that he so taugt them cannot be leerned and found bi mannys resoun without therof a teller and a denouncer. Summe parties of the seid scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture techen to us positive ordinauncis of Crist, as ben the sacramentis, and sum partie therof techen to us ordinauncis of sum Apostle, as the lawe of bigamie, and that a woman vowe not chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, Sone, thoug the Clergie that now is, and thoug the Pope that now is, may dispense with it that the Scripture techith us the ordinaunre of an Apostle and may revoke it, as he may dispense with this that <hi>Poul</hi> ordeynyd a bigam to not be Deken or Prest: 1 <hi>Thim.

<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:63588:36"/>
with ech or with the grettist of the Apostlis: yitt herof folowith not, that the Clergie now lyvyng or the Pope now lyvyng may dispense with this that Scripture techith as the positive ordinaunce of Crist; and that he may revoke eny of tho ordinauncis. Forwhi so revoke and dispense mygte noon of the Apostlis. And so thoug the Chirche now lyvyng be evene in auctorite and power with sum parti of Scripture, as with ful few parties of Scripture, as in this forto make positive ordinaunces lyk as holi Scripture bi power of the Apostle maad, and for to revoke thilk positive ordinaunce of holi Scripture maad by the Apostle: yitt he is not evene in auctorite and power with al the Scripture of the Newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither with manye othere parties therof. To thi sixth argument y answere, graunting the first premysse, that the Chirche now lyvyng hath power forto expowne and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete and declare the trewe undirstonding of holi Scripture. And y deny the second premysse that even peer hath no power into his even peer. Forwhi the sugget hath some power upon his Sovereyn as for to loke upon him, forto speke to him, and forto warne him of hise harms, and forto defend him, and such othere. And so the Chirche now being, yhe and ech thrifty wel sped studient in Divinite hath power forto declare and expowne holi Scripture: yhe and ech good Grammarien hath power to construe Scripture, so that as the urri dewe literal undirstonding we schulden aske and leerne of a greet leerned sad Divine, rather than of anothir youngir and lasse leernyd Divine: so we schulde aske and leerne it of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal or general hool Clergie rather than of eny perticuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone or persoonys save in the execeptioun spokun of in the first parti of this book in the seventh ch. and in othere chap. aftir there folowing. And therfore as it folowith not herof that ech thrifti Divine and ech Gramarien is more worthi for to grounde Feith than is holi Scripture, so it folewith not that the Chirche now lyvyng or the Clergie now lyvyg are more worthi forto grounde feith than is holi Scripture. Sone, manye kindis of Powers ther ben. The even Peer hath no power of constreynyng upon his even Peer: that is to seie forto make his even peer to do what he wold not do in thilk kind of werk, in which thei ben evene peers: and yitt oon evene Peer may revoke and relese that the othere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene Peer ordeynyth or biddith to be do or doith indede: as we
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:63588:36"/>
seen that oon executour revokith and relesith what the othere ioined to him executour ordeyneth, biddith or doith, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lich bi the Lawe of <hi>Ynglond,</hi> and in this case is ech Pope with ech of the Apostlis. As for answere to thi <hi>VII.</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Argument, y seie that power forto interprete, expoune and declare which is the rigt sense of Scripture is not but a ful litil power upon Scripture: as power forto construe Scripture aftir rulis of gramer is a ful litil power upon Scripture; but yitt moche lasse than the othere power now spokun. Forwhi so bi these powers no thing is takun awey fro Scripture what he had bifore, neither eny thing is sette of the newe to Scripture, what Scripture hadde not bifore, neither eny thing is commaundid to be or not to be agens the comaunding the or nylling of Scripture. And that bicause this seid power of interpreting, expownyng, declaring and construyng is not but a power of kunnyng oonli for to schewe and make open the thing of Scripture which is in Scripture al redi bifore thoug priveli and hid: rigt as the Prest in Lent tyme drawith the Lent veil, and therbi makith open to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what was bifore in the Auter alredi, thoug not seen of the peple. Wherfore the first Premysse in thi <hi>VII.</hi> principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is untrewe and to be denyed, whanne it is seid thus: Whatever thing nedith to have upon him an Interpreter or Expowner or a Declarer, nedith to have the same thing as his overer and worthier. And whi this is untrewe it is now seid. Forwhi ellis a Deltene yhe the Perisch Clerk were worthier than the Prest stonding at the auter, whanne the Clerk drawith aside the Lent veil. And also if the seid first Premysse were trewe, thanne Scripture were worthier than sche her silf is, and sche were overer to hir silf, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunce. For whi Scripture ful oft expowneth hir silf bi as moche as bi the reding of Scripture in oon parti a man schal leerne which is the trewe undirstonding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in al othere parti wherynne he doutid or unknewe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Also Sone the Iugis which the King makith in his rewine for to juge alle cause aftir the Lawe which he and his Parlament malten, ben not so worthi forto grounde rigt wisnes in causis as the seid Lawe is. Forwhi al that thei han to juge rigt wisnes in causis thei han of thilk Lawe: and yitt the same seid Iugis han power bi ther greet kun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng for to declare what is the trewe entent of the Lawe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:63588:37"/>
or not writen, whanne othere not so kunnyng persoonys in the Lawe as thei ben dougten therynne or not so fer seen therynne. And therfore bi lyk maner in this present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos it is that thoug the Clergie or sum of the Clergie bi ther greet leernyng have power or kunnyng forto declare to sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler folk which is the urri sense and undirstonding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: yitt herof folowith not the Clergie or thilk persoone of the Clergie so declaring is worthier in wei of grounding what Scripture was ordeyned to grounde bi his dewe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirstonding of treuthe, than is the same Scripture in him silf for so to grounde. For certis it may be that sum oon sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple persoon as in Fame or in State is wiser forto knowe juge and declare what is the trewe sense of a certeyn portioun of Scripture, and what is the treuthe of sum Article, and that for his long studying, laboring, and avising therupon, than is a greet general Conceil. For whi ful of it is seen that oon persoon in a general Conceil redressith al the Conceil fro that, that thei wolden ordeyne, as y have rad. If oon symple persoone had not agenstonde bi hise resounis a general Counceil wolde have ordeyned that Prestis schulde have be weddid to Wyves if thei wolden. And also y have rad in the tre departid storie that if <hi>Finucius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> hadde not recleimed in the greet Counceil of <hi>Nice</hi> there hadde be ordeynyde that tho Prestis which have had Wyves schulden have left ther Wyves and schulden have be divorced fro hem. For answere to thi <hi>VIII.</hi> argument thou schalt undirstonde that it is not oon and the same forto trowe a thing to be, and forto trowe the same thing for whi y may trowe the Sowdan of <hi>Babylonye</hi> to be, yitt it nedith not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that y trowe to him. And in lyk maner it is not oon and the same forto bileeve a thing to be, and forto bileeve to thilk thing. For whi y may and ougte bileeve the feend to be, and yitt y ougte not therbi forto bileeve to the Feende. Wherfore it is not oon and the same forto bileeve oon univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Chirche of God in erthe to be, and forto biléeve to thilk oon universal Chirche. And sithen it is so that bi thilk Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle putte into the comoun vulgar Crede y bileeve the holi universal Chirche, we ben not taughte as bi strengthe of thilk wordis forto bileeve othere than this that oon holi uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Chirche is, and what folowith therof.

to be, everlastyng lyf to be; and not bi tho Articlis forto bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to oon Baptim, and forto bileeve to forgevenes of Synnys, and forto bileeve to everlastyng Lyf, as schal be schewid bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir her aftir in this same <hi>II.</hi> partie the <hi>VIII.</hi> Ch. Wherfore fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowith that bi the tenour of thilk Article in the comoun Crede in which and bi which we ben taugt for to bileeve oon holi uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Chirche, we ben not taught forto bileeve to the holi uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Chirche, that is to seie to bileeve that the holi univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Chirche seith and techith treuthe. So that if we be bounde forto bileeve to the holi universal Chirche in this now seid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirstonding, it must rise bi sum othere fundament than bi thilk Argument in the comoun vulgar Crede, which in thi <hi>VIII.</hi> Argument thou alleggist. Whi the Article to be bileeved that oon universal Chirche of God is, was putte into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moun Crede, schal be sumwhat tretid here aftir in this same <hi>II.</hi> Parti the <hi>VII.</hi> Ch. and more sumwhere ellis in Latyn. Nevertheles schortli to seie here. Soon aftir the Apostlis ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Heretikis, and summe of them helden that there were dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Chirchis of God on erthe, and that thei were a Chirche of God bi hem silf. And for as myche as the grete Fadris in the Chirche hadden abomynacioun herof, thei puttiden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the comoun Crede forto bileeve oon hool universal Chirche to be with hise parties not discording oon fro the othere in Feith of God. And this is fer fro this for to bileeve nedis to thilk universal Chirche in alle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>asis. This is ynow o my Sone here for an answere to thin <hi>VIII.</hi> principal Argument. Also it is to be undirstonde that Catholik is as myche to seie as General, and therfore the Catholik Feith is as myche to seie as General and Vniversal Feith, and Catholik Chirche is as myche to seie as General or Vniversal Chirche. This wole good and trewe, grammer, and this wolen oold Doctou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris of dunte as <hi>Ysidir</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> in ther writingis.

Now manye of the symple peple mowe leerne these <hi>II.</hi> Trouthis of the Clergie, that is to seie, thei mowe leerne and knowe that this day is to be fastid, and this day is to be holowid: which thei witen not whi save for this that the Clergie seien so and affeermen so to them. And therfore it is in the power of the Clergie to make into them such Feith as is now seid. Fadir, this maner of Feith whiche the Chirche may make is of noon othere kind, but as is the credence or Feith which ech housholder may make to hise yong Children and hise rude and symple Hyves and to his Hondmaydens, and Boond Men not myche witti to resone: and therfore these Feithis whiche the Clergie may make ben fer fro the hignes and worthines of Feithis, whiche God to us makith. And therfore Fadir lete us speke her aftir, as we hav spoken bifore of tho Feithis, which we hav bi affermyng of God: for suche ben algatis necessarie to oure helpe. Sone y assente wel that we schulen so speke, and therfore aske therof what thou wolte. Fadir y aske this: owith the Clergie or the Chirche bileeve as Feith eny Article which is not expressid in the litteral sense or undirstonding of holi Scripture; and which is not folowing out of eny Article in holi Scripture; but if he have forto it bileeve and trowe bi this Argument: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God affeermed or schewid or revelid is trewe. This Article God affeermyd or revelid. Wherfore this Article is trewe. And but if he have sufficient evydence for Treuthe of the <hi>II.</hi> Premysse, as bi such a Premysse: whatever the Apostlis or othere undoutabili trewe heerers of God, or sum

So it is that the Apostlis or sum other undouta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table credible heerer of God or sum undoutable myracle or sum undoutable inspiracioun, or sum undoutable appeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withynne forthe or without forth, or sum seid longe uce of bileeving in the Chirche, witnessid that God affeermyd or revelid this Article. Wherfore treuthe is that God affeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myd thilk same Article. And yitt fer ther upon the <hi>II.</hi> now seid Premysse he muste have notabili likli evydencis in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and so likli that to the contrarie is not hadde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopid to be hadde eny evydence so likli.

And if the Clergie have such a preef as now is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sampled upon sum Article not writen openli in holi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, neither folowingli out of eny Article so writen, (the Chirche so hath upon these trouthis that this holi lyver af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir his deeth is acceptid into salvacioun and to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and worschipid and folowid as for a savyd Soule and moche lovyd and worschipid of God, and so of many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiris, Confessouris and Virgins othere and dyverse fro the persoonys of the Apostlis: the Chirche hath the now seid prof, and that bi help of Myraclis wel tried and examyned bi sufficient trewe witnessing, or bi open at fulle schewing.

But yitt that the Apostlis bitoken not, out and bisidis holi Scripture eny Articlis unwriten to be bileeved for necessarie Feithis, thoug summe men so comounli holden, y may argue bi rigt notable evydencis, of whiche the first is this. The Apostlis bitoken not to cristen men eny Articlis to be bileeved as such seid Feith bi eny such wey, which the Apostlis knowen to be no spede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and sufficient wey forto in it bitake eny Articlis to be bileeved as so greet Feith. But so it is that the Apostlis knewen wel that to bitake to the heering and mynde of the peple oonli without writing eny such Articlis forto be of them bileeved was no spedeful and sufficient wey. Wherfore the. Apostlis not so bitoken. The <hi>II.</hi> Premysse of this Argument may in this wise be proved. Thilk wey was wel knowen considered and aspied to be insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and unspedful, which was bi the Apostlis reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and left and leid aside. But so it was that this seid wey for to belyvere eny Articlis as such feith to the peple bi heering and mynde oonli without writing was left and leid
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:63588:40"/>
aside and remedied bi this that thei wroten the Gospels and Epistlis to the peple. Forwhi ellis thei hadden no sufficient cause for to so write. And <hi>Luk</hi> in his prolog unto hise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel meneth the same. Wherfore it folowith, that the seid wey was weel knowin and considered and aspied to be insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the seid entent to be sufficientli sped. Also the seid second premysse mygte be proved thus: The Apostlis maad so wise bi the holi Goost forto overse and knowe Scripturis of the oold testament, mygte soon knowe and remembre hou that manye trouthis <hi>Adam</hi> seide and taugte to hise sones and hise ofspring over it that is writen in the Bible. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no man in the tyme of the Apostlis coude eny thing seie: and thilk maner it was knowun of the Apostlis to be trewe that <hi>Noe</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> seiden and taugten manye treuthis to ther heres not writen, whiche no man coude reherce in tyme of the Apostlis, and al for that thei were not writen. And in lyk maner it was trewe of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Solomon</hi> auentis ther heerers, so that noon of ther wordis be knowun, than tho ben writen. And if we wolen come neer hoom, <hi>Joon</hi> the Evangelist seithen the last ch. of his Gospel, that <hi>mo my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclis Crist dide, than be writen in this Book, which if thei weren
writen, al the world, thoug it were turned into bokis, schulde not take and comprehendo.</hi> And that of al tho myraclis not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Gospels not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on is of us now knowun. Wherfore it folowith that so wyse men as weren the Apostlis in goostli necessarie maters, and so fulfilled with the holi goost, and also wel putte into good avi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is bi ful witti Clerkis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertid into Cristen Feith knewn well that this wey forto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyver necessarie feith to peplis bi word and heering and mynde oonli without that of the writing was insufficient to the peple. The second evydence is this. If the Apostlis hadden lete renne eny Articlis undir necessarie feith to be bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved without prof of the Scripture; this entent and dede of the Apostlis schulde have be better knowen and holden of the Chirche, which was in tyme of grete <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn</hi> the Emperor, than of eny Chirche being aftir tho seid daies. For so it was the Chirche in the daies of <hi>Constantyn</hi> holde not, trowid not, and considerid not, that the Apostlis so left without writing eny Articlis to be takun as necessarie feith. Wherfore no Chirche aftir the daies of <hi>Constantyn</hi> owith so holde. The second premysse y may prove thus. In
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:63588:41"/>
the daies of the greet and first <hi>Constantyn</hi> Emperour there was maad an universal Counceil of all Cristen in <hi>Nice</hi> of <hi>Bityne,</hi> in which universal Counceil was gaderid the Latyn Clerkis and the Greek Clerkis togider for this entent principali to declare the trewe feith in the article upon which <hi>Ari</hi> errid, and folowingli forto putte out in an expresse Crede the substauncial pointis and articlis of oure feith, as is opene in the stories clepid ecclisiastick storie and tripartid storie, or ellis thus. The Churchis storie and the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partid storie: which stories ben the worthiest and moste cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible of eny othere save the Bible. And therfore so thei dide and maad a Crede, which in the seid second book is writen. But so it muste nedis have be that if the Chirche in tho daies hadde knowen or trowid that the Apostlis had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyvered to the peple eny articlis undir heering and mynde oonli; the Chirche in thilk seid general Counseil gaderid for to point and articlee maters of our feith wolden rather have sette forth in writing of the Crede than maad tho seid articlis, which the Apostlis left out of writing, than tho of whom expresse mencioun is maad in the writing of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlis. And that fer as myche as to the mo n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de remedie is rather to be goven than to the lasse nede. And the nede to putte tho Articlis undir writing was ful greet as soone aftir appere. Wherfore the Chirche then gaderid hadde no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite that the Apostlis leften eny suche Articlis of necessarie feith, which the Apostlis not wroten. And in lyk maner as it was in the first seid general Counseil of <hi>Nice</hi> that thei pointiden out Articlis of bileeve to alle Cristen peple into a foorm of a Crede, so dide anothere greet general Counseil aftir at <hi>Constantynopil,</hi> and manye othere provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seils, as apperith in the book clepid Decrees of Counseils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hercen the <hi>II.</hi> now seid Credis; and in noon of them so making and pointing Articlis of oure feith in ther credis is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioun maad of eny articlis taugt bi the Apostlis out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The <hi>III.</hi> evydence is this. If eny Article schulde be left to peple fro the Apostlis undir heering and mynde to be holde and bileeved of the peple greet as feith, these pointis and articlis schulde be tho rather than othere, or as soon as othere; that is to seie: we schulen prie toward the Eest, we schulen blesse us with a cros, Prestis schulen make tre foold crossis upon the brede and wyne offride in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore it is not to be holde that eny othere observaciouns or articlis dyvers fro these now rehercid the Apostlis bitoke without writing to be kept and to be bileeved as such seid greet feith. Also holi <hi>Basile</hi> the now bifore alleggid c. in the summe of <hi>Gracian, c. XI.

Wherfore holi <hi>Basile</hi> conceyved no mo mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris than these <hi>III.</hi> to be nedis takun and kept of Cristen peple: and thanne folowith that he conceyvyd not such a fourth membre to be takun and kept of the peple, that is to seie, whiche the Apostlis taugten and leften and bitoken for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauncial feith without writing. And that bi the first nowe rehercid membre <hi>Basile</hi> undirstood Popis ordinauncis it is likli therfore: Forwhi the ordinauncis of Popis ben ful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mose and more famose and more reverente attendaunce in the comoun peple than is the custom and usage of the comoun peple, or at the leest of and even so myche. Wherfore it is likli that <hi>Basile</hi> left not Popis ordinauncis unspokun of in his particioun bifore seid.
