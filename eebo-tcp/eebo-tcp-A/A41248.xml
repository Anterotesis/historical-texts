            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

rest of the Spheres have contrary motions, every

&amp; the motions are contrary from the west to the

Isthmos, and a Promontory. A peninsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

to the firm land by some little Isthmus, as
<hi>Peloponesus, Taurica, Cymbrica</hi> and <hi>Pervana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Isthmus is a little narrow neck of land which

<hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Promontory is some high mountain which

            <p>Thus much of the real parts of the earth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>The compass of the whole earth is cast by our
latest learned Geographers, twenty one thousand
six hundred English miles, which we thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
We see by continued experience, that the
Sun for every degree in the heavens, gaines sixty
miles upon the earth towards his circuit round,
and after three hundred sixty degrees returneth
to the same point in respect of us as before it
was. Add the number of sixty so oft, and you
will find the account the same, and so by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the circumference to the Diameter,
which is, <hi>tripla sesqui septima.</hi> the same which
twenty two hath to seven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52918:5"/>
We may count likewise the earths thickness to
the center: The whole Diameter by rule being less
then a third part of the circuit. That in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to twenty one thousand six hundred, will be
six thousand eight hundred seventy two, halfe the
number will reach the middle of the world, and
that is, three thousand four hundred thirty six,
being considered with great exactness, as the
measure of such a great bulk as the earth is, can
easily be taken and comprehended.</p>
            <p>Geographers attribute unto the earth five
circles.</p>
            <p>The first is the Equinoctial, when the Sun in his
course is come thereunto; about the eleventh of
<hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> the day and the night are
of equal length through the whole earth. It is
also termed the Equator, and by the sea-faring
men the middle Line; because it divideth the
earth into two equal parts, of which the one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
towards the north, the other towards the
south. And because it is in the middest between
the two poles of the world, one in the north, the
other in the south. The second circle is called
the Tropick of the Crabb, because when the
sun is come thither about the tenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> it
returneth by little and little unto the Equator.
And then unto them that dwell on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Equator, is the day longest; and shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to them that dwell on the southside
thereof. This circle is distinct from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
twenty three degrees, three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52918:6"/>
and an halfe, Northward.</p>
            <p>The third is called the Tropick of Capricorn,
because the sun being come thereto on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>December,</hi> turneth his course backward
to the Equator; and then contrariwise, to
them who live on the north of the Equator is
the day shortest, and longest to them on the
south thereof; it is distant from the Equinoctial
southward twenty three degrees, thirty one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
and an half.</p>
            <p>The fourth is called the Arctick circle; the fifth
the Antartick; of which the one is distant twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
three degrees, thirty one minutes and an half
from the no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th pole; the other just so many from
the south pole. And are described by the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heaven from the Poles of the Zodiack,
which is the sun. <hi>Mercator</hi> the ancient Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
understood by the Arctick circle not onely
that aforesaid, but also every circle whose half
Diameter answereth to the pole in any place
whatsoever, and containeth, according to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of every countrey, certain starrs, which
never set, but alwaies are above the earth; so
that in all regions differing in Latitude, this circle
is diverse, as also is the Antarctick. Now the four
lesser circles, the two Tropicks and Polar circles,
do fitly part the earth into five Zones, that is to
say girdles, because they compass like bands, the
round Globe of the earth. The first of these
Zones lyeth under the Artick or north circle,
and is called the cold north Zone; the second
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52918:6"/>
lyeth under the Antartick or sourth circle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the cold south Zone; the third is situate in
the middle between the two Tropicks called the
scorched Zone; the fourth lyeth under that
which is between the north circle and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and is called the temperate north
Zone; the fifth also is under that space which is
between the Tropick of Capricorn, and the south
circle, and is called the temperate south Zone.</p>
            <p>Now to understand rightly the situation of
countries, their Longitude and Latitude accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the mind of Geographers is to be known.
The Latitude of places which with the height
of the pole is alwayes one, beginning at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial,
is taken two manner of wayes; either
towards the south, or towards the north, unto
the number ninety. The Longitude is returned
from the Meridian circle, and about the west I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands
called <hi>Carva</hi> and <hi>Flores,</hi> beginning right at
the Equator easterly, and running forwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the number three hundred sixty. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>London</hi> lyeth from the Equinoctial north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
fifty one decrees and a half, which is the
Latitude; and the Longitude thereof is twenty
degrees answering unto that degree of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,
reckoning from the Meridian.</p>
            <p>And now that I have briefly touched upon the
Longitude and Latitude of countries, and having
often spoke of the Meridian and Horizon: I shall
I hope not unprofitably take time in a word or
two, to tell you what each of them are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52918:7"/>
The Meridian is a great circle rounding the
earth from pole to pole. There are many Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
according to the divers places in which a
man liveth. But the chief and first Meridian pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
through the islands Saint <hi>Michael</hi> and of the
<hi>Azores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Horizon is a great circle designing so great
a space of the earth as a quick sight can ken in
an open field: the use of it is to discern the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
risings and settings of the starrs.</p>
            <p>I shall now speak a little of the Climates, and
Parallels, and then I hope I have done with
things generally concerning the earth.</p>
            <p>A climate is a space of the earth included
within the space of two parallels.</p>
            <p>The use of them is to shew the difference of
length and shortness of daies over all the world,
as you may see in the midst of every climate,
the number of the longest day in the year, under
that climate; the longest day in one climate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
half an hour from the longest of another,
so that there are twenty four climates, consisting
of forty eight parallels, ere the day come to be
twenty four houres of length, which is twelve
houres longer then the Equinoctiall day is. Now
under the Equinoctial line, and thirteen degrees,
that is, three parallels on either side thereof,
the dayes exceed not the length of twelve
houres, but after in every clime encrease the
length of half an hour; and when they come to
forty eight parallels and twenty fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r climates
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52918:7"/>
(as I said before) the dayes being then twenty
four houres long, their encrease is then by whole
weeks and moneths, till in the twenty fourth
clime about the pole, the day is full half a year
long; and it is thus between the Equator and the
north pole. So it is between the said Equator and
the south pole: wherefore there are two sorts of
climes, that is, twenty four northern, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
southern, touching the names of which and
other circumstances, I shall say nothing here, but
leave the readers to other more long discourses,
thinking this enough in a tract of this nature to
have spoken of things generally concerning the
whole earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole earth is now divided into four parts.</hi>

               <hi>Europe,</hi> though the least of the three first parts
of the world, nevertheless excelleth all other
parts in worthiness, power, renown, multitudes
of well-builded cities, and of people skilful in all

knowledge of God, better then all the riches of
the world.</p>

Through the Grecian and Romane Empire

            <p>It hath plenty of grain, plants, fruits, coles,

nothing but what may be well spared, as hot
spices, not so fit for our temper, precious jewels,
the nourishers of vain and soul-destroying pride,

Eleventhly, they reach the reasonable soul of

Twelfthly, that infants dying unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
are sanctified in the womb by vertue of

her conception. And finally, they shew a book
of eight volumes, writ as they say by the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
assembled at Jerusalem for that purpose, the

into the country shod their horses both with
gold and silver, as Historians testifie. <hi>Peruana</hi> is
divided now adaies into three several parts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the situation of the land, to wit, in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52918:34"/>
plain land, in mountains, and in lands which are
hilly grounds without them. Out of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are brought over into <hi>Europe,</hi> gold, silver,
Beza, and other precious stones, salsaparilla,
sugar in abundance, Brasil wood, cotton, costly
plumes, jackanapses, several sorts of curiously fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
birds, and many more druggs, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise;
and thus much for the fourth part of
the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Magellanica,</hi> which some Geographers would
have now the fifth part of the world, is since found
out to be a very little part, as consisting onely
of some few Islands, and the southern side of the
Magellanick Straits so called, by <hi>Fredericus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanicus,</hi>
who discovered it in the year one
thousand five hundred and twenty, writing
moreover that there he had seen tall men about
nine, and ten foot high; and he saw many fires
which the inhabitants had kindled, doubtless by
reason of the coldness of the weather, he named
it the land of fire, or smoky, whereby he presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the more, that it must needs be a very vast
great country reaching east and westwards unto
new <hi>Guinney,</hi> according to which guessing it hath
hitherto been delineated by the maps of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers;
but since hath there in stead thereof a
large and wide Sea been found both by <hi>Iacob
Le Mair,</hi> who in the year one thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sixteen, sayling about the southern coast of
these islands entred into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and by <hi>Iohn
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52918:34"/>
Davis</hi> in the year one thousand six hundred forty
two, who sayling toward the north, about one
thousand 6 hundred forty further then <hi>Guinny</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
divers lands, and passing on the southside
sayled about the east coast of new <hi>Guinny,</hi> and so
going on westward, he came to the <hi>Indies;</hi>
whence we may certainly gather that all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
descriptions and definitions of the Magella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
and unknown lands, are but meer abuses
and certain devised fables.</p>
            <p>And thus now God enabling me, I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the description of the world, and the four
parts thereof: and leave my endeavours herein
to the judgement of the Reader.</p>
