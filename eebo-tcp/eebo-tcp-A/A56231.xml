            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No place is mentioned by the Prisoner where the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should be, nor are they named who they are, nor any particular thing that they should testifie: but the proof lies cleere on our part; there's no justification in Treason, if we prove that this Lord hath committed Treason, there's no justification of that, by any Witnesses he can produce.</p>

                  <p>To desire, that an whole Jury may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such a question upon their oath, is that that hath not been known: if my Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> have cause now against any, he hath run out the liberty which the Law gave him, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>We have troubled you with a long relation of the actions of the Confederates with the L. <hi>Macguire,</hi> though not done in his own person, and his own perticular Act; but for this that was done by the Generality, I heard my Lord say at the Bar, Whats that to me? Yes my Lord: This is to you, you were one of the Conspirators in the first plot, and you contrived the businesse. And that had been Treason alone, to send the Priest to fetch <hi>Owen Oneal</hi> into Ireland, with Armes and Souldiers, but you contrived this, and conspired it, and you are as guilty in Law in all these cruell murthers, and burnings in every place: For the Law of England is, in Treason you are all principles, no Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; your Son was there, your Lady is Rtewarded: For the supream Councell they have taken care of you: Why! Because you were one of the first complotters of it, and this will light upon you and fall very heavie: And for your Exchange it was propounded for the L. <hi>Calfield,</hi> but when they could not have that greed upon, then what becomes of the poor Lord <hi>Calfield?</hi> murthered too: And you see what incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement you have from the Complotters, and from the Divell too, for they were both together in it. And now you have seen the Indictment fully made good.</p>
                     <p>Then the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> proceeded to make his defence, wherein he first of all denied his Examination (although testified as before by so many credible witnesses) and said that he knew no such Examination.</p>
                     <p>That at the time of his apprehension at Dublin, he came about his own particular occasions, as his Estate was in danger if he did no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: That because he was found about the City, he was therefore apprehended; That his lodging was not within the City, but he lodged without the City; that he did lodge at Mr. <hi>Nevils</hi> House formerly, but not at this time: That for some of the places mentioned, where he should be about the Conspiracy, he had not been there a year before, he was certain of it. For the number of Protestants that were mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be slain, he said he did not think there were so many Protestants in the whole Kingdome. That he was continually either at his owne House, or at Dublin, and knew nothing of the Plot but by hear-say.</p>

                     <p>Well if you have nothing to say for your selfe, I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence as I am a Minister of Iustice: you have been Indited here for severall Treasons contained in your inditement as was here of late read unto you, and you have had a fair proceeding &amp; very delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately: for your inditement came in about <hi>Alhallowmas</hi> last, three weekes or a Moneth before the end of the last Terme, three weeks at least; you then made a question whether you ought to be tried by your Peers in Ireland, or a Jury here, the Court did so far delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in it as to allow you Counsell to plead with the best advantage you could. And afterwards this Terme, there hath been two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Barre on each side, where hath been said as much for you as can be.

                        </gap>, great destruction hath followed upon your plot which the Jury have found you guilty of? What a mighty cruel war and great devastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Kingdome, most horrid to speak or rehearse: It is sitter for you now to be thinke your selfe, what your offences are, and prepare your selfe for death rather then seek to mask or put colours upon those things which are so manifestly proved to all the world: And now you are found guilty, and therefore there is no contradiction or gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will avail you, you ought to repent and pray to God to forgive that offence wheof you are guilty. The judgement that I am by the Law to pronounce against you is this: <hi>Connor Maguire</hi> Esquire, You being found guilty of the Treasons whereof you are indicted, your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is; That you shall bee carried from hence to the place from whence you came, that is the Tower, and from thence to Tiburne the place of execution, and there you shall be hanged by the neck, and cut downe alive, your bowels taken out and burnt before your face, your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four quarters, and the head of your body to be set up and disposed of as the State shal appoint. And the Lord have mercy upon your soule.</p>
                     <p>After judgment pronounced, the Kings Councell demanded of him, whether he would have any Ministers come to him, to prepare him for his end, and to advise him for the good of his soul?</p>
