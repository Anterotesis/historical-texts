            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A goodly day if men were as good: The Sunne I sée riseth vpon many, but not to their amendment. Good God what a Citie <hi>Athens</hi> is? Here are faire houses, but false hearts: Many teneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fit to make Temples for the Gods, but fewe owners in them that tempt not the Gods: I sée here goodly Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; rich, that spue out their Maisters for Riot; A faire market place to encertain much mischiefe. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when our great Maisters rise, how many sinnes shal rise with them? <hi>Damocles</hi> lately acquainted with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautia</hi> in speaking hir faire spendeth hir much, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a bolde face hath gotten bountifull fortune, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stippus</hi> though old yet liues he by the flatterie of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and whether is it better (my <hi>Genius)</hi> to be flea-bitten, or flout-bitten? There are so manie faces now in maske, that the World runnes all a masking: and so manie bad men thriue by countenance, that necessitie is the best mans cognisaunce. <hi>Athens</hi> hath manie men that will spend a treasure for a title, yet hauing gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the worldly title of happines, (alas) how is it tickle? Is it not a gay world? I sawe <hi>Lais</hi> iest with <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> last night, and he endured it: But when <hi>Phocion</hi> the last day tolde him he was proud <hi>(Iupiter</hi> helpe me) how was he peeuish? Our Signiors are seuere, our
<pb facs="tcp:10096:4"/>
Ladies austeare. It fareth in <hi>Athens</hi> as among the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barites,</hi> who chace away Cocks fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Cities, because they are too watchfull: and our <hi>Athenians</hi> counsaile from them, for feare they should become honest. What should <hi>Diogenes</hi> then doo but be singular, to sée the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort so sensuall? I thinke it rather better to weare patches on my cloake, than to beare the patch on my head: &amp; rather to féede on rootes, than to be defiled with royot: to serue Nature in want, than Fortune in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. But why speake I of want? Breathe I not aire with the King? Is not sufficiencie a sumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, warmth a worthie raiment, and a good thought a true kingdome? Tut, <hi>Diogenes</hi> is rich: who loytereth not on downe, whilest others lack deuotion: who sléepeth (with <hi>Aristotle)</hi> to wake, and studieth (with <hi>Cleanthes)</hi> to watch. But soft, <hi>Cosmosophos</hi> doore is opened, and <hi>Philoplutos</hi> is stirring: shrowde thée <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the one hath a stinking breath that corrupteth manie complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the other a far reach which (excéeding the compasse of the Moone) maketh some men sicke for want of the Sunne. Soe, sée, how they prease foorth: O <hi>Mercurie,</hi> what God so euer hath a Temple, I am assured thou hast a plentifull Altare. In former ages Deuotion was thy father, now Dooblenesse is thy furtherer: thou haddest wings in thy hat, but they are moulten, and from their dust wickednes is sprung in thy followers hearts. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on him, how grauely looketh <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> nodding on his Mule as <hi>Silenus</hi> on his Asse, pretending much grauitie, but not a graine of honestie. Now shall our Notaries get some coyne: but note this, there is some roosenage: the still streame is déepest, &amp; the stearne looke doublest. Ah Foxe, are ye walking? But sée, they are in conference: the rot consume them, for they consume the world. Hide thée Cinick: it is better to be Lord in thy tub, than a lackey in their triumphes. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, I would my curses could driue them from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10096:4"/>
me. They cleaue like burres to woollie garments, and draw fléeces of wit from Philosophers: applying it as craftie Phisitians doo their corosiues, smothering much paine vnder pleasant perswasion, and making the world beléeue that <hi>Venus</hi> is all wanton, in that (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port runneth) shee was bred of the fome of the water. Husht <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the vultures are at hande: silence in these dayes is a trim safeconduit.</p>

I cannot admit in these sorts any mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for lukewarme professors in these things are lost professors: heare my tale <hi>Cosmosophos,</hi> The Hare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10096:11"/>
went to <hi>Athens</hi> to schoole, and in processe of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a good Lawyer, furnished therefore with Artes, &amp; fully stuffed with argumentes, he repaired to the Lyon the soueraigne of beasts, and the sole patterne of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and after a Schollers curtesie, with his round cap in his right hand, his pen and iuke at his girdle, and his hood on his shoulders, he began thus: My good Lord, I haue spent my goods in following goodnes, and my liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods to attaine literature: since therefore I haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the fulnes of the one through the default of the other, I beséech your Maiestie that I may be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that hauing deserued worthely, I may liue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfully, vnder your Maiesticall protection, and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of your bountie. The Lyon séeing his graue lookes, his vnkembed lockes (like <hi>Senecaes</hi> Philosopher) repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus: Friend, I will first make a proofe of thy wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and cunning, and afterward puruey thee of wealth and content: goe therefore with me to sée diuers things, that I may prooue thy learning and relieue thy lacke. And as they went both by a wood side, there passed by a hunter with his bow and arrowes, who setled himself to shoote at a Beare and a Foxe: but the Foxe was wylie, and when she espied the bow and arrow, shee lept aside, and escaped from the stroke: the Beare (contrariwise) was proud, and trusted to his owne strength, and ranne so hastely against the man who intended to wound him, that the Hunter loosed his arrowe, and smote the Beare and killed him. The Lyon beholding this, said vnto the Hare, Make me a prouerb of this, that I may know thy science, whereby I may with more will admit thée to thy sallarie. The Hare (after a draft of merrie goe downe) wrote this,
<q>
                     <l>Against death it preuaileth much the life to prolong,</l>
                     <l>To haue ripe wit rather than ribbes strong.</l>
                  </q>
The Lyon hearing this conceipt, commended the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, and led the Hare with him to a Citie, where they
<pb facs="tcp:10096:12"/>
found a Lord rebuking his seruants, of which the one patiently endured the seuere reprehensions of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the other was impatient, and full of froward aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres: for which cause, the Lord in his yre all to beate him, and spoyled him, and expulsed him out of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and kept still the patient seruant, &amp; promoted him to honour. Uppon which occasion the Hare wrote this:
<q>
                     <l>Farre better it is manie times to be still,</l>
                     <l>Than to speake bitterly, and to haue ill will.</l>
                  </q>
The Lyon was no lesse delighted with this second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe than he was with the first: for which cause he lead the Hare into another towne, in which they found a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer yoking his Oxen, assigning them to their iournie to eare twelue acres of land, deliuering vnto each of them for their féeding a bottle of hay. One of these beasts went foorth, and bare his hay without grutching: but the other began to speake boldly and proudly, &amp; said, What should it suffice vs to beare hay with vs, he shall not féed vs so: and vsing these contumelious words, he would not carie hay to féede himselfe. But when they came to their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and had eared whilst the euening, hee that had the bottle of hay refreshed himselfe: the other was wearie, &amp; hauing nothing whereby he might be comforted, he dyed for great hunger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherevpon the Hare wrote to the Lyon, saying in this wise:
<q>
                     <l>Better is it in need a small thing to haue,</l>
                     <l>Than vtterly nothing the life for to saue.</l>
                  </q>
The Lyon considering all this, said vnto the Hare, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (my sonne) thou hast studied well, &amp; canst decide wise questions. This said, the Lyon promoted him, to what I knowe not, but somewhat hee had, and well he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>

They buzze in rich mens eares till they be lords of poore mens ernings. And then comes Sir Iohn slitpen to a Bailifes office, or else to kéepe a Leece, where he will so hunt poore mens titles with the slender countenance of <hi>Littletons Tenures,</hi> as they shall sooner catch a louse than kéepe their liuing. They write so much <hi>ad opus &amp; vsum eiusdem Iohannis,</hi> that they inuert all good vses: When as all controuersies in <hi>Athens</hi> were wont to be decided among curteous neighbors, and the gang tooth was a seale of more truth, then the best bunch of seales in the subtillest Scriueners shop in this Citie. Oh what swarmes of them sée I in this Land, they iet vp and downe the stréetes grasping a paper in their hands for feare a man should spie a true finger in the fist, carrying a pen in their eares to note that which they deserue not, their gowne is carried sidelong by the wind like a misne saile, shewing they are fit to turne to all subtilties, their thumbes are goodly Alcumistes that with the very touch translate a fée of ten groats to a signet of thrée poundes.

The Capon sitting on the roust began to giue great regard, and tickled like a

Heare an other pretty fable: There was a fat Churle that had a fruitfull hen which laide euery day an egge, whereupon hee gathered many and solde them, and increased to his owne aduantage. At last he thought (as couetousnesse still hatcheth newe mischiefe) that if this hen were killed and opened, hee shoulde haue many egs in hir, for which cause he commaunded the hen to be slaine: which done he found hir void of egs, and to his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter losse failed both of the fowle and the fruit, according to the common prouerbe, Hee that coueteth all, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looseth much. Merchants and Chapmen ought therefore to beware lest they get any thing wrongfully, for vniust mens goods shall be soone destroyed, according to the opinion of the Philosopher: who saith, that riches lightly gotten may not last long.

Harke thée <hi>Cosmosophos</hi> a true tale, a fit note for all Marchants, When a certaine Merchant on the sea vppon a time had sold his wines which were mixed halfe with water, for as much money as if it had béene pure wine, hee fortuned to open his bag to cast in the money, when as an Ape at that time playing aboue the batches, espied the place where he buried it, and in secrete wise comming and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bagge with the whole money, he fled to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor &amp; began to verefie the old prouerbe, ill gotten goods neuer prosper: for sitting thereupon, and beholding the playing of the billowes against the barke side, he played the vpright dealer, for he opened the bag and threwe one piece into the sea, the other into the ship, and thus deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe in his Apish vprightnes, (being ordained to punish the Merchants dissembling) ceased not but cast

For as hee that is stung by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the foote, with small paine falleth a sléepe, and in his slumbers (the poyson beeing dispearsed) suffereth death: so the biting of Usurie makes but a little wound at the first, vntill such time as it hath growen to fulnes, it consumeth a poore mans whole estate, and substaunce. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> in their Theologie, call it <hi>Habuliah,</hi> that is to say, perdition and corruption: for it destroyeth and ouerthroweth men according to the saying of S. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> who following the Etymologie of the Hebrue, compareth Usurie with the venome procéeding from the biting of a certaine Serpent, whose wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and sting is so swéete at the beginning, that it engendreth a desire of sléepe, and then in the end the sléepe killeth him which is wounded, at such time as the venome spreadeth it selfe through all the members of the bodie: so hee which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained in Usurers debts, thinketh in the beginning to receaue some profit, but he doth but cast himselfe a sléepe, and not acquitting himselfe at any time of the principal, in the end he consumeth himselfe altogether. There are Lawyers and Legists, who (according to the opinion of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10096:17"/>
Saint <hi>Hierome)</hi> compare vsurie vnto a certain worme, who naturally is so malignant, that after he hath so long gnawen the wood that he may turn him in the hole which he hath made, he engendreth another worme of the same mallice: so the Usurie with the debtor that maketh sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vpon the dayes of paiment, hatcheth vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vsurie: &amp; poore borrowers hatch wormes <hi>ad infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> to their vtter wrack. And in that the vsurer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a worme, he shall haue in recompence of his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, a worme which shal incessantly féede vpon him, and tyre vpon his conscience, as the Uultures that gnaw the poore liuer of <hi>Titius,</hi> according to <hi>Homers</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; this is my opinion. This is the worme that shall not die as a Prophet spoke, more famous than <hi>Plato</hi> for a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. The Usurer likewise is compared vnto fire, an actuall and insatiable element: for as it burneth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth all such wood as is cast vppon it, so the vsurer the more he hath in his purse, the more he gnaweth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth, resembling in this poynt hell mouth. But I I may say to thée <hi>Cosmosophos,</hi> I must now laugh har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie.</p>

               <p>Because this their fire of Couetousnesse shall burne the Author, not only in this world where the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked begin their hell: but in the other world, where the fire of hell is vnquenchable. In briefe, these vsurers (as <hi>Barnard</hi> saith) are Master burgesse théeues, who as the Pyke in the pond deuoureth all other fish, so doth the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer the poore people in Cities, Townes and Uillages, till some wilde fire cut them short. <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compteth them for homicides, &amp; <hi>Ausonius</hi> the Poet saith Usurie killeth sodainly. We Gréekes cal Usurie <hi>Tocos,</hi> which is a name deriued from <hi>Ticto,</hi> which signifieth as much as to bring forth, in such manner as infants are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: for with losse of time it bringeth foorth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth much money: a plague on the fathers of such
<pb facs="tcp:10096:18"/>
monsters. <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth this cursed lucre, an infant begotten against Nature. To speake in a word, this Usurie is against the lawes both naturall, diuine, &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. That it is against the lawes naturall, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers haue sufficiently testified, who haue detested the gaine of Usurie: <hi>Plato</hi> in his lawes hath forbidden the vsage of Usurie, and hath commaunded to punish the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer with the losse of his principall, and the forfeiture of the arrearage. <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath also made an expresse Treatise vpon the same, where he prooueth that by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ought not to vse feneration and vsurie: and for this cause al Nations haue it in horror, as the Turkes, Moores, Saracens, Tartares and other Infidels. The first proofe is taken from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who saith, that money cannot ingender money, for it is against Nature, that a thing beeing of it selfe barraine, should be are frute. Hee then that séeketh frute from his money, which is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the number of natural genetrices, how sinneth he against the right naturall? The second reason, It is iniustice to séeke to draw profite from that which is not his owne: but it is certaine, that siluer lent, is not his own that hath lent it, but both in the propertie and vsage is his for the time to whom it is lent, and therfore such a loane in Latine is called <hi>Mutuum,</hi> of mine it is made thine, and if it be mine, it cannot at that instant be thine. The third reason, To take anie thing twice, is Larceny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Usurer doth the same. And how? First he receiueth and taketh the principall summe, and secondly the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xest of the same, which is most gret iniustice. The fourth, He that selleth one thing twice, committeth Larcenie &amp; iniustice: but the Usurer dooth so. For in receiuing his money, he receiueth siluer for siluer in the same equalitie, and then in exacting the ouer-plus he selleth the vse, and that is (in effect) to sell twice, considering that the vsage cannot be seperated from the thing. I could yéeld exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all these, but it were vaine, since the examples be

               <p>O Sir, that is to take toward a decent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your liuing, not to the hurt of your neighbor. But that Usurie is against the Lawes diuine, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both in the olde and new Testament, which though I haue neuer read, yet as inspired I will preache them foorth: for I am assured of the trueth thereof. First, God who commaundeth in <hi>Athens</hi> and in all places, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in these especiall words, that he is displeased with U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie: <hi>Si pecuniam tuam dederis</hi> (saith he) <hi>populo meo pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peri, qui habitat tecum: non vrgebis eum quasi exactor, nec vsura opprimes.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Si attenuatus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tuus fuerit, ne vsuras accipias ab eo.</hi> Marke what the Psalmist saith, <hi>Lord, who shall dwell in thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? who shall rest vpon thy holy hill? He that hath not giuen his money to vsurie. Ezechiel</hi> writeth (as hauing the reuelation from God, that <hi>That man is iust, and shall liue eternally, which hath not lent vnto V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, and hath taken no ouer-plus: and he who shall doo the contrarie, shall die, and his bloud shall bee vpon him.</hi> Hearke what <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith in the xxix. chapter, and Iesus Christ in the Gospell likewise sayth openly, <hi>Date mutuum, nihil inde sperantes, lend willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, looking for nothing againe.</hi> As touching humane Lawes, are not all Usuries streightly forbidden? These are diuided into Ecclesiastical lawes and Politique: the Ecclesiasticall Lawes abhorre and detest it, as you may read in the facred Chronicles and reuerend Councells, as well generall as particular, in the volumes of the Cannon Lawe, in the Decretalls, in the worthie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable writings of the auncient Fathers and Doctors, as well Grecians as Latins, whose large Treatises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this vnmercifull sinne, if <hi>Diogenes</hi> should recite,
<pb facs="tcp:10096:19"/>
it would cost him a whole volume, for which cause I wonder at <hi>Bodinus</hi> an old friend of all these vsuring fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which holds some vsuries lawful with Christians. But if his mastership, or doctorship shall please to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the lawes politique in generall, he shall finde that in all ages in all times and seasons, they haue forbidden them, principally the excessiue vsuries themselues. The Lawes of the most greatest Politicians, as of <hi>Solon,</hi> of <hi>Licurgus,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and likewise of the tenne Commissaries deputed to correct the customes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make choice of the most profitable lawes: These men and Magistrates would not admit that vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie should excéed the compasse of one pennie for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the yeare, which they call <hi>vnciare,</hi> for that the vsurie of euery moneth, amounted not but to an Ounce, which was the twelfth part of the hundred Crowne or Denier which a man had lent: in such sort as the vsurer who sought more great profite, was punished seuerely. The same lawe was afterwardes published vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Tribune <hi>Duilius</hi> the yeare after the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome</hi> 396, and tenne yeres after, vnder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulate of <hi>Torquatus</hi> and <hi>Plantius,</hi> it was reduced vnto halfe an ounce by the moneth, and halfe a Denier in the hundred for a yere, in such sort as the surplusage should not egall the principal, but in the space of two hundred yeares. The yeare after, vsurie was forbidden by the lawe <hi>Gemetia,</hi> afterwardes by the lawe <hi>Gabinia</hi> which chasticed the vsurer which had imployed his money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the permission of the law, with the losse of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall. Likewise the lawes of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> commaunded to punish the vsurer which practised grieuous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vsuries. And <hi>Plato</hi> saith that the auncients were accustomed to punish the vsurer with the fourth part, and to drawe the thiefe to the paiment of the double: and not without cause, for the Usurer (saith the said <hi>Plato)</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Homicide. And saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> compareth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10096:19"/>
them to the thiefe and the Robber: as much saith saint <hi>Chrisostome</hi> and saint <hi>Barnard. Valentinian,</hi> afterward <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> commaunded that all they should be punished with a quadruple paine, which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the vsury of a hundreth. The prolixity would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe if I would séeke further into the Ciuill law.</p>

               <p>Approued it? I denie your assertion, but it may be they haue permitted it, should I say they haue permitted it? I must then say they haue permitted it as a necessary euill, so as <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to say of women: you will tell me that the Ciuill law withstandeth not the contracts of vsury with a certaine moderation, neither punisheth them; &amp; approoueth them then; I deny the consequence. For he which approoueth giueth fauour and license to execute that which he approoueth: but so it is that there is not any imperiall Lawe whatsoeuer which hath fauoured Usurers, for if so it were, they should both inuert the diuine Lawe, and intort the lawes of Nature, and therefore the Emperor commaunded an inuiolable obseruation of the Counsaile of <hi>Nice,</hi> by which all vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue béene prohibited. But inough of Emperours, let vs containe our selues in the walles of this Citie, which I woonder it sincketh not for sin, there is so much extortion, craft, and vsury exercised in it. The <hi>Romanes</hi> excéeded but in ounces, but we in pounds: their lawes admitted them some sufferance in the compasse of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, but we excéede in thousandes, we lacke but some wise wag like <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to burne the Usurers bonds, bils and contractes in the market place, which if they were set on fire, the bonfire would be so big, as I feare me would consume the whole Citie: poore men cry out daily, widdowes waile, all exclaime, there is none to comfort
<pb facs="tcp:10096:20"/>
them, and how may it be possible whereas all men study their owne gaine? Oh <hi>Philoplutos</hi> thou hast many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers vnder thée, let one iust man haue a fée, who honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring equity from his heart may relieue the fatherlesse, and comfort the desolate, for surely such as forsake the poore in néede, will at last be themselues forsaken: such as leaue their neighbours and deny them helpe when dangers shall oppresse them, shall themselues be denied, for no one man by worldly pollicy can warrant a peace without change, neither is there any place so fortified that may not endure a change or name of estate: As I will teach thée <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> with this thy friend <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosophos,</hi> in a pretty tale if you will heare me. <hi>Isodore</hi> in his twenty two of Etymologies describeth the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon after this manner: The Griphon (saith hee) is a feathered bird and fewer footed, and these kind of birdes be engendred among the Hiperbore mounts, that is, in <hi>Scithia, Asiatica:</hi> This bird is like vnto an Eagle both in head and wings, and in all other parts of his body hee is like vnto a Lyon, and he destroyeth both men and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and putteth a Smaragdine stone in his nest, against venemous beastes of the mountaines, hee slayeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth all men that dwell néere about him, neither is his insatiable couetousnes euer satisfied: This Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon tooke a great prouince to rule, and the more to show his tyranny &amp; couetousnes hee commanded thrée things: First, that no stranger should be entertained in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try either to buy or to sell: Secondly, that no manner of creature should come thither from other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that none of all his people should be so hardy to trauel into other countries. All which thrée commaundements were obserued by his subiects, and he liued in delicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pleasures, and gathered goods and no wonder: For whatsoeuer came into his possession hee parted with no man, but kept it straightly to his owne proper vse: But so it fortuned vpon a time by the rightful iudgment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10096:20"/>
of God: that thunder, tempest and lightninges destroyed all the country: For which cause the Comprouincials and inhabiters thereof ran altogether to the Griphon crying and saying: Let vs hence oh king lest we die for hunger. And he sent forth Legats to other Nations that were next adioyning vnto him, that they should send of their goods and graine vnto him, and sell them at their owne price. To whom they answered and saide: Thou wouldst neuer sell vs any of thy goods, neither now in thy néede will we sell thée any. Grieued with this answere hee sent againe other messengers desiring them to come with merchandize and to haue frée passage at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure but they answered, thou wouldst neuer receiue vs before this time, neither shalt thou now receiue vs: The third time he sent vnto them, and praied them to receiue him and his people. But they said, Thou neuer camest vnto vs till now at this time necessity inforceth thée, and for that cause we will not receiue thée, but rather driue thée from vs if thou come vnto vs: and so forsaken of all in great wretchednes both he &amp; his people were famished.</p>

It is therefore good to be curious and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue forraines and strangers, and to vse merchandize with other Nations, and to depart our worldly goods with other, and employ them for common profite: For our Sauiour saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>All things that you will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men do vnto you, doe you the same vnto them,</hi> so biddeth the Law and the Prophets in generall. It is read that when <hi>Alexander</hi> marched by the way with his Host, and both hee and all his traine were well nigh lost with thirst, one came and presented vnto him a cup of faire water for a precious gift, and he with great speede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

it to be powred out, neither would he once drink himselfe in that hee coulde not giue part to his Knights. Such a minde shoulde <hi>Philoplutos</hi> carry in respect of well deseruing students, poore fatherlesse children, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and the aged, such minde shoulde the Usurer car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in respect of those whome hee hath suppressed, such should <hi>Cosmosophos</hi> bee, in regarde of those whom hee hath seduced: but the couetous man saith contrary. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 10. I haue found rest vnto mee, and I will eate of mine owne goods alone. Such couetous men as these should be detested: wherefore in old time such as loued Auarice should not be preferred in the common weale, as <hi>Valerius</hi> in his sixth booke telleth vs, that when two Consuls of <hi>Rome</hi> should haue béene sent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> tooke counsaile and deliberation thereupon; one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest (the famous <hi>Scipio)</hi> said thus: Neither of them liketh me, for the one of them hath nothing, and the other will be satisfied with nothing, iudging equally po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and auarice in malicious people. Also <hi>Valerius</hi> telleth that <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor changed his Officers very seldome, because they which were newe ordained, were very prompt and ready to receiue. An example hereof is shewed by a man who was wounded, whose déepe stripes a swarme of flies couered, at which time it fortuned that one came by and saw them and droue them away to whom the other said: Thou hast done me wrong, for these were full and repleat, now shal other come that be more hungry, and do me more grief. In like sort Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges when they bee néedy or couetous, they bee gréedy to catch, and desirous to haue. It is read in one fable of Poetry, that <hi>Midas</hi> desired of <hi>Apollo</hi> that whatsoeuer he toucht might be turned into gold and it was granted him, so when hee shoulde touch meate or drinke with his hands or his lips it was turned into gold, and he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hungry and perished for sustenance, so abundance of riches maketh a couetous man hungry &amp; destroyeth him.

It is read in the Chronicles of <hi>Persia,</hi> how <hi>Tomyris</hi> the Queene of <hi>Scythia</hi> (after shee had taken <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia)</hi> caused his head to be smitten off, and put into a boale full of bloud, saying after this manner, <hi>Thou hast euer thirsted after bloud, now drinke bloud thy fill:</hi> so shall it fall out in after-dayes with couetous men and cursed tyrants, who desire the bloud of the poore people, and the spoiles of the fatherles, that is to say, their goods and sore labours. Couetous men in hell shal drinke mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten golde, as a Philosopher telleth, that <hi>Nero</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was séene in hel bathing himself in séething gold: and when he saw a great number of commers by, he said vnto them, Come hether you wretches that be sellers of your neighbours, and bath you here with me, for I haue reserued the better part for you.</p>

Now as touching luxurie, I neede not much define vpon it in generall, since in particular signification, it is a voluntarie effusion of humane séede, and a disordinate carnall copulation without marriage: and this is one of the seuen mortall and deadly sinnes, called a capitall vice, for that there are eight infernall daughters sprong from it, and all these <hi>(Philoplutos)</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10096:22"/>

I will therefore onely discourse vpon her infernall daughters, who haue cursed qualities euen in them, to discouer their mothers imperfections, and first as touching her daughter <hi>Cecitie</hi> or blindnes of spirite, shée wil proue a prettie blindfold mischieuous childe I warrant you.</p>

                  <p>This cursed daughter of a lecherous mother extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth the naturall light of his vnderstanding that tyreth himselfe in the sports of <hi>Venus:</hi> so that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dutie whereunto he is called. He pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the seruice of God: the hearing of his worde: the exercise of prayer, wherin euery good <hi>Athenian</hi> ought to be exercised: In which he committeth two sinnes, the one of letcherie: the other of carelesse idlenes. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sinneth herein, who casteth aside the spirituall giftes, to haue a taste of the carnall. Here we sée, that letcherie blindeth the inwarde humaine eyes, as it is read of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which were blinded interiourly &amp; exteriourly: and the two old falsewitnesses of <hi>Susanna</hi> to one of which <hi>Daniel</hi> said: Beautie hath bewitched thée, and concupiscence hath subuerted thy heart: that is to say, hath blinded thy spirite. Also, before it is said: <hi>That they had turned their eyes aside, lest they should see heauen, &amp; remember the iust iudgement of God.</hi> For which cause Antiquitie depainting the god of loue <hi>Cupide,</hi> haue giuen him no eyes, for because loue is blinde, and maketh them blinde that followe it. And it séemeth, that the wise-man speaketh of them when he sayeth: <hi>Their malice hath blinded them.</hi> And before

him the Psalmist speaking of the wicked: <hi>Hee would not vnderstand to go well.</hi> This vice is contrarie to one of the seuen gifts of the Holie Spirite, and likewise it blindeth the eye of the soule, which we ought to kéepe more charily than ten thousand corporall eyes, as <hi>Plato</hi> sayeth: The reason is, for because that by the same we behold and contemplate the essence of God, according to the doctrine which Iesus Christ our master hath taught vs, who saith, that they are happie who are clean in heart, for they shall sée the face of God. The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents likewise do verie well manifest that luxurie blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cléerenes of the spirite. But the poore slaues of <hi>Venus</hi> prefer the bodily sight before that of the spirite, and being in that sort blinded they know not what to do, neither wot they how to sauour the celestiall delightes, which without comparison are farre more great &amp; more swéete than those delightes of the world. These are they that haue drunke of the cup of whoredom which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sawe in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> that is to saye, of lecherie: which maketh those drunke with the wine of her wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which inhabite the earth, &amp; causeth them to forget the beginning of their birth &amp; their celestiall countrey. This in my opinion was <hi>Homors animi,</hi> who writ that that the companions of <hi>Ulisses</hi> after they had eaten of certaine sweet &amp; wonderous pleasant fruites in <hi>Aphrica</hi> called <hi>Lopothages</hi> forgot their natural countrey &amp; would haue continued alwaies there where those fruites were: so that the valiant Captaine <hi>Vlisses,</hi> who representeth vnto vs reason hauing brought them backe againe by force was constrained to tye them to the mast of the ship for feare they should returne to their voluptuousnes. From hence the <hi>Greekes</hi> deriue a prouerb which saieth: That hee which hath tasted of any dishonest pleasure, hath eaten Leates. And whence (I praye you) is sprung this dissolutenes among all sortes in <hi>Athens,</hi> and the withdrawing from vertue of so many wan<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

wits, but from the taste of this voluptuousnesse? And for that they haue dronken of the cup of this diuelish singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie in thought, blinding their vnderstanding. It is carnall libertie that hath opened their studies, and hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the big voyced exclaimers to high places: but it is behoouefull for those that are consecrated to God, and the other which would attaine to his strickt seruice, to take héede least we taste thereof, and so fall into this blindnes of spirite, which maketh vs forget our celestiall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, wherevnto we tend: neither néede wee but one taste thereof to make vs forget all. It is for that they erre (saith a good Doctor) in that they deliberate to enter the lysts of <hi>Venus</hi> for one time onely, to the ende they might be wholy satisfied, and afterwards they déeme that they may the better obserue abstinence: for one act engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the desire of two, and two the desire of foure, and ten the desire of twentie, in such sort, as the more thou shalt commit this vice, by so much the more thy desire shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: for so farre is such a fire from being extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this meanes, that more and more it inflameth. And for that cause, <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogues compareth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence vnto a sieue, whereinto the more we powre of water, the more it runneth out, being vnable at any time to be filled: so a man that thinketh to content himselfe with this securitie, he fareth like him that thinketh to fill a sieue with water. And the Doctor <hi>Gershon</hi> speaking on this matter, bringeth in the example of him who is seazed with some hot feuer, (and not without cause may lecherie be called a hot burning feuer) who if hee drinke one glasse of fresh water, he déemeth that he is well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but a quarter of an houre afterward hee is more altered than euer. This is the craft of the diuell, which tickleth him in the head to perpetrate this sinne vnder coulor of mitigating his affections, and hope to auoyde his temptations: but in sooth it is to no other purpose, but to deliuer him ouer afterwardes to a more furious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10096:23"/>
assault. And the same doctor auerreth, that it fareth with him that would approue this pleasure, as with him who is full of itch, who the more he scratcheth, the more mangie he becommeth: Where if he had but a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, he should be presently recouered. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without cause, that the Apostle saith vnto vs: flie foruication: whence our fathers draw a <hi>maxime</hi> to this purpose, which sayeth: that the sinne of letcherie sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth it selfe rather in flight than in resistance. A man may likewise drawe another <hi>maxime</hi> and say: that it is farre more easie for a Maide to be continent, than for a Widdowe: more easie for a Widdowe, than shee that is married and hath her husbande absent: more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for him which hath neuer experienced the pleasure, than for those that are exercised in it: and why? Because the experience of such an act, augmenteth both the desire and the temptation. This being well considered, it ought to yéeld good men more consolation to augment their courage in abstinence, which is to liue with cleane bodies and cleane hearts: as I will proue you by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie tale.</p>

                  <p>Inconsideration is a sinne which hindereth reason and iudgement thorough carnall voluptuousnes, as we haue alledged by the two old Iudges of <hi>Susanna,</hi> who turned away their spirites least they should beholde heauen, and remember the iust iudgements: so Letche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie withdraweth the vnderstanding of a man, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him from the consideration of that which hee ought to doo, and the searching out of the meanes to attaine the soueraigne goodnesse.

                  <p>Who so is transported with voluptuousnes, desisting from dooing of that which is necessarie for his saluation, committeth the sinne of Inconstancie. Likewise, he that is ouercome with that passion, pretermitteth to perform that which he had deliberated to doo, as to intend the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, the vse of prayer, or the déedes of charitie, &amp; other good workes, as it is said in the chapter of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. From these foure braunches of Letcherie, Kings, Princes, Iudges, Prelates, and all sorts that haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Estates or soules and bodies, ought to gard themselues to the ende that being beautified with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, sapience, counsaile, and constancie, they may well know how to discharge their duties &amp; gouerne those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their estate &amp; charge. And from whence commeth ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, inconstancy, inconsideration, and precipitation: whence commeth the want of vnderstanding, iudgement &amp; counsaile in great men &amp; superiors, but for that they are swallowed vp in the sinke of this stinking lust which makes them walke like blind men as the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth? O God, how is it possible they might giue any good sentence, execute any iustice, decrée any good ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the policie of a Common weale, since <hi>Venus</hi> hath rauished their vnderstanding?

                     <hi>Itobeus</hi> accordeth hereunto, taking his president from <hi>Archilocus,</hi> who sayd: that the force of loue stealeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the tender spirites of men. And the morall Poet sayeth: that lust forceth the most faire and diuine parte of the soule on the earth: for it maketh it terrestrial, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and dull: which is a dreadfull thing for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, who penetrate and contemplate the verie beautie of soules. This vice (that more is) rauisheth a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rage and furie, as <hi>Plato</hi> proueth in his <hi>Timaeo,</hi> where he sayeth: that voluptuousnes is the bait of all euils, by which a man becommeth (as it were) phreneticall, the which <hi>Cicero</hi> teacheth in diuers places of his writings, where he saith: that the soule hath no greater enimie than carnall voluptuousnes. And <hi>Philon</hi> nameth it a dangerous Palliard which deceiueth and deludeth the spirite: This is (saith he) the Serpent, vpon which Sathan is borne. <hi>Socrates</hi> proueth wel, that they which follow the same are nothing different from brute beasts, which also is confirmed by many other Philosophers, according to the recitall of the saide <hi>Stobeus</hi> alledged before time: who replyeth and proueth, that it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than a furie which seazeth on poore mankind and other mortall creatures. He taketh it from <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> who said: that <hi>Venus</hi> is all that which is foolish in this worlde, and for that cause the name of follie best fitteth her. Will you finde her more brauely set foorth than by the Poet <hi>Virgil,</hi> speaking of the loue of <hi>Dido,</hi> if he speake according to his conscience?</p>

Who so flieth not the occasions of this sinne, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pursueth them, sinneth mortally: and what are the occasions of this sinne?

The first is idlenes which hath béene the destruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the ruine of <hi>Aegistus, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore the Poet saith,
<q>
                        <l>Otia si tollas periere Cupidinis arcus,</l>
                        <l>Contemptaeque iacent &amp; sine luce faces.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second, too great repose, as they which sléepe at their ease in their downe beds (as you doe <hi>Philoplutos)</hi> against the counsaile of the Apostles. The third, the belly cherishing. The fourth, abundance of wine which is a most luxurious thing (as saith the wise man) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saint <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth vs to take héede thereof, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Be not drunke with wine, in which luxuriousnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth. The fifth, too great curiosity of the fine gifts of nature, against which the Scripture sayth: <hi>Auerte faciem tuam à nuliere compta.</hi> The sixth, pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, as <hi>Oseas</hi> speaketh of <hi>Israel.</hi> The last and most dangerous, is too great familiarity &amp; conuersation with women, which hath béene the ruine of diuers men: For as the Poet saith,
<q>
                        <l>Urit videndo Foemina,</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is to be vnderstood actiuely and passiuely, that is to say, shée burneth hir selfe and burneth others in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, and other burne in séeing hir. For this occasion sage <hi>Sidiach</hi> admonisheth vs, not to bee daily conuersant among women: For their wordes (saith hee) are more slipper than oile, but in the ende they are stéeled arrowes to destroy, as <hi>Dauid</hi> testifieth. The auncient <hi>Hebrewes</hi> were not ignorant hereof, among whom one called <hi>Rabi Iose,</hi> the son of <hi>Rabi Iochanan</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> said, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply not too many wordes with a woman, for the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sages haue taught vs, that as often as a man talketh long time with a woman, hee procureth his ruine and withdraweth himselfe from the contemplation of celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10096:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things, and finally falleth into hell: so heare the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that follow the great pleasure we take in iybing and iesting with women, be they good or euill, and I thinke it is the same which the Ecclesiasticall paradoxe would conclude, which sayeth, that the iniquity of a man is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the good of a woman, that is to say, that there is no so dangerous habitation with an euill man, as with the wife of his neighbour, for the perill is not so great. For which cause saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath aduertised his <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotian</hi> not to suffer young women to enter his chamber: <hi>Stay not thee with a woman in one and the selfe same house in trusting to thy chastity: Art thou more strong than <hi>Sampson?</hi> more holy than <hi>Dauid?</hi> More sage than <hi>Salomon?</hi>
                     </hi> And as touching the religious man named <hi>Rustinus</hi> he wrote him backe an epistle, in which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised him that he very seldome times visiteth his own mother because he would not be tempted by the regarde of those who came with hir, &amp; for feare the smoke should lie couered in his heart, which hee might not extinguish when he would: For this cause the holy auncient <hi>Hermits</hi> fled from the acquaintance of women although holy. So then if the holy fathers admonish vs to flie from the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of those that are vertuous, how carefull should we be to fly the conuersation of those which are both wicked, wanton and light fingred? These are the Sirens who by their melodious and attractiue song inchaunt meu, and finally cast them headlong into terrible and dangerous shipwracke, that which the <hi>Mithologia</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs, who saith that the valiant Captaine <hi>Vlisses</hi> hauing stopped the eares of his companions for feare they should heare the Sirens voice, he caused them to bee tied to the Mast, to the ende that their melodious song should not cast them headlong into the sea. The same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was intended in the history of the harlot <hi>Circes,</hi> who (as <hi>Homer</hi> saith, and after him <hi>Virgill</hi> (chaunged men into swine, Lions, Beares, and other sauage beasts, that

is to say, that lubricitie chaunged the men into brute beasts.

                  <p>I will performe your request, and before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish my discourse, chop one thrust further in, and talke of the remedies of luxurie: by which, as with a preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue and antidote, some of our vnreclaymed <hi>Athenian</hi> yongsters, may (following the example of those happie soules and good Christians, which pretend their part in heauen) keépe and preserue themselues from this conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. First of all, we ought to call to minde, that sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie and lust destroyeth and dissipateth a mans goods, in such sort as it handled the prodigall Childe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed all his substance with harlots.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10096:29"/>
The goods of a man are of three sorts, the goods of the spirite, the goods of the bodie, and the goods of fortune, that is to say, golde, siluer, lands, and possessions: and finally, all that which a man may haue in this mortall life, either concerning pleasure or profite: Therefore the same it is which <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, he that nourisheth a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot looseth his substance. It is not requisite to discourse hereupon any further, since experience daily declareth vs by one an other howe many prodigall men fall in the pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. As touching the goods of the body, it causeth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand maladies, as the Surgians may testifie, who heale the poxe, the sicknes of <hi>Naples,</hi> cankers, and other villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which come thereby, it consumeth the vital humour, and weakeneth the braine, and consequently the nerues of the whole body, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and after him <hi>Galen,</hi> which also naturall reason sufficiently teacheth vs: for the act of lasciuiousnes after it hath consumed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat, maketh all the hote body chill: nay more, cooleth the braine, which according to some Philosophers is the siege of humane séed, which is cold of it self. From thence oftentimes procéedeth the Epelepsie and falling sicknes, to which diuers sorts of men are subiect. I beléeue this was the reason that mooued <hi>Auicen</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> to say, that the exercise of palliardise is more permcious to the body of man, than if hee had diuers time indured letting of bloud. In briefe Lechery weakeneth the forces, infée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the member, depriueth the body of his beauty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth the crimson taint of the visage, furroweth the browes, maketh the eies dim and heauy, causeth the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gout, and finally abridgeth mans life. By reason whereof the Philosopher said, that they which are luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, liue not so long time as those that are chast and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. All this being well considered, by the great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he said vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he which addieteth himselfe to fornication and vncleannesse of the body, beside the offence that is committed against
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10096:29"/>
the diuine Maiestie of God, sinneth against his owne flesh, in abbridging his dayes, and by consequence is a homicide of himselfe. If there néede anie question to speake of the goods of the spirite, it is most certain, that Iubricitie consumeth them farre more than any other sin. First of all it destroyeth the infused vertues, which are the grace of God, and the seuen gifts of the holy spirite, which are incompatible with luxuriousnes, and of which one onely ounce out valueth all the goods and benefites of this flattering world. Secondly, it consumeth the foure Cardinall vertues, to wit, <hi>Prudence, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> so famous among the Philosophers: it obscureth the vnderstanding, blindeth the memorie, dulleth frée will, and in most taketh awaye humane iudgement, and maketh him blinde and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in matters aswell moderne, as necessarie to his saluation. If all this were well considered, our picked yongsters hauing their peakes starched for feare of stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, their coates perfumed, their garments iagged, would leaue to iybe with this cursed letcherie, for feare they Iigg them selues out of heauen: and our pretie mistresses that set no foote on the ground, but as if they tread on Mosse: and trauerse more on the héele than they trip on the toe, they would finde here a good bridell for them to drawe them from the loue of this infected letcherie. Secondly, they ought to consider how much this filthie follie is both dishonest and vndecent for a soule which is created according to the image of God: Nay more, how detestable it is to a man to showe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this licentious act like vnto brute beastes, to loose the vse of reason, and to make himselfe the slaue of iniquitie, which also the Philosophers themselues haue helde in horror. Moreouer, we ought to regarde how vaine this pleasure is, and of how small continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that it is but as a winde that passeth, which is followed with a thousand and a thousand remorses:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10096:30"/>
For the Prouerb lyeth not which sayeth, <hi>Pour vn plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir mille doleurs.</hi> The frute also of lasciuiousnes is but repentance, as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> declared to that great harlot <hi>Lais.</hi> It is (I saye) a true repentance to a sinning soule, which séeth, that the pleasure is goue and the sinne and shame remaineth with him. Ah las, said the Apostle, what frute haue you receiued of these things of which you are ashamed? Knowe, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of sinne is death. Now little contentment this pleasure yéeldeth, it sufficiently apeareth, since al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but a Cocke, as the Philosopher saith, <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantur post coitum:</hi> as that féeling alreadie the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and blot that remaineth, men and reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures séeing themselues reduced by one so villanous an act to the life of brute beasts, which is a great shame for them.</p>
                  <p>The third remedie, is to flie the occasions, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding amorous bookes, nor estéeming vaine thinges, nor hearing immodest purposes, nor frequenting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, except vnder the title of vertue, and in summe, to auoyde the other occasions which are incident to incite vs to this cursed errour.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, we ought to fast, watch and pray, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all good meanes to subdue the flesh vnto the spirite, which is a singular remedie, so as in times past the auncient Fathers haue experimented oftentimes in the solitarie Desarts, where they mortified their bodies. <hi>Benet</hi> and <hi>Frauncis,</hi> two myrrors of chastitie, whereof the first on a time being stirred with fleshly motions, hee cast off his cloathes, and all naked layd him downe vpon sharpe pricking thornes, til being at last ouer-bloudied, he ouercame the temptation. The other being agitated with this passion, laid him downe naked in depth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a pit of snowe: and another time séeing himselfe tempted by a woman, hee set his naked féete (O incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing) vpon the burning coales, rather desirous to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10096:30"/>
be burned with materiall fire, than with that fire which is inextinguible.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, is oftentimes to thinke on the day of death, at which time we ought to enter into count with the iust Iudge, who shall cast all fornicatours into perpetuall darknes, stored with inquenchable fire: so as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Poet <hi>Dante</hi> most eloquently describeth. It is a remedie (saith <hi>Athanasius)</hi> which saint <hi>Anthonie</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to thinke on the paines of hell, when he thought to exclude out his filthie and dissolute thoughtes: Which also the great doctor <hi>Iherome</hi> was accustomed to do as he himselfe witnesseth of him selfe.</p>
                  <p>The sixth, when a man is tempted to commit that vice, he ought to consider, that God which is present in all places is at hand, and beholdeth vs: and our good Angel which séeth vs, before whom we ought to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to perpetrate so villanous an act, since we durst not auowe the doing thereof before the poorest man of the worlde. By this meditation, the Hermit <hi>Pasnacus</hi> conuerted a sinfull woman called <hi>Thais,</hi> giuing her to vnderstand that in no place of the earth, how secrete so euer it bee, shée could so couertly hide her selfe, that God would not both espie &amp; behold her, and therfore said he: you ought not to be so impudent &amp; shameles, as to commit so villanous a sinne in the presence of so great a Signior: and although God did not sée, vs, yet ought we not to commit the sinne, it is so filthie &amp; dishonest of it selfe. The Pagans themselues, by a natural light, knewe well to saye this, as <hi>Cicero</hi> who writeth, that a chaste and vertuous person ought neuer to commit the foule offence of lust, although neither Gods nor men were priuie thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The seuenth, wée ought to consider, that there is nothing that more hindreth the humane spirite from Philosophie and true contemplation of heauenly things, than the delectation of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10096:31"/>
The same is that which <hi>Orpheus, Trimigistus, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Socrates, Plato, Empedocles, Plotinus, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiques, Simplicius, Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> &amp; other lights of morall Philosophie haue left vs in writing, saying the soule is tyed to terrestriall things by pleasure, as it were with nayles, in such sort as it cannot mount on high and contemplate diuine things: and they hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annex, that they who dispoyle themselues of these pleasures, went vnto the heauens in the companie of celestiall spirites, and dwell with God, where they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment a pleasure incomprehensible to the humaine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. But to the accomplishment hereof, they ought first of all to hate their bodies, &amp; chase away their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: for as <hi>Orpheus</hi> sayeth: <hi>If thou hatest not thy bodie thou canst not loue thy selfe well.</hi> Is it not the true <hi>Orpheus</hi> Iesus Christ that saieth vnto vs: <hi>He that loueth</hi> (saith he) <hi>his soule in this worlde,</hi> that is to say his bodie, <hi>he shall lose it in another: And he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in this worlde, shall keepe it in the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> The same is it that <hi>Cicero</hi> intimateth when he writeth: that the sensuall sort, who haue giuen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ouer for a praye to the pleasures and delightes of this world, and haue violated both deuine and humane lawes, are depriued of life in the other world, and abide beneath in the earth, agitated and tormented from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ages to ages vntill such time as they returne: that is, they shall be tormented world without end.</p>
                  <p>The eight remedie, which is the most soueraigne of all is: that we ought (when we féele our selues vrged by the inticements of the flesh) to haue recourse vnto God by prayer and teares, and to implore his ayde with an ardent affection, as they that sée themselues sodainly surprised with a huge tempest in the midst of the <hi>Ocean</hi> sea: For in sooth, the combate of the flesh is a true tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest and storme, and to this ende it shall be good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto God some good and short Prayers, such as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10096:31"/>
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> in his temptations, and the Hern it <hi>Isaac</hi> (as <hi>Cassianus</hi> writeth) were wont to vse. In summe, in taking these courses we shall haue fewer Lechers in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and more religious.</p>

                  <p>Truely <hi>Diogenes</hi> thy plaine method of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in this point, argueth thy ability both to correct bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and to perswade blessedly: So that thou séemest to be no <hi>Grecian</hi> tied to earthly contemplations, but a man inspired with more than <hi>Apolloes</hi> wisedome: for to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne matters incident to the sense and subiect to reason, is the part of a prudent man and a searching wit, but to enter thus profoundly into the nature of sinne, and the workinges of God, argueth that thy inspiration is from God: wee therefore bide thy reprehensions with more patience, and attend thy counsailes with more perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

                  <p>Your conformity pleaseth mee: haue you not read that <hi>Diogenes</hi> is a dogge that biteth men but for their amendment, and not for enuy: then heare me and I will heale woundes. <hi>Philoplutos</hi> thou art in authority, wherein thou canst not so liue, but thou must be subiect to euill language, thou must haue a serpents eare to preuent the charmes of the flatterer, and <hi>Linx</hi> his eie to spie out contempts ere they attempt thée. If thou art reprooued of the iust for a good cause mend thy selfe, for their second as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault is seasoned with shame, if wrongfully beware to stir too much lest being not guilty, thy stirring make some suppose that thou stinkest. It is a trim thing to be silent, a wisedome to be silent: thou maist kill with thy eie when thou listest, but kéepe thine eie from lusting after other mens blame, lest thou proue blind in thine enuy, and thine enuy cause thy death. An enuious man (in <hi>Virgils</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) may bee compared to a Uiper that gnaweth the boanes and sucketh the bloude and beareth his owne tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in himselfe: In briefe, if thou be enuious thou shalt liue <hi>Titius</hi> life, and be so wounded in heart, as neither
<pb facs="tcp:10096:32"/>
the sonne of <hi>Saturne,</hi> nor the god <hi>Phoebus,</hi> nor <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> the cunning shalbe able to cure thée. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great said often: that the enuious were their owne hangmen; And the wise Gréeke <hi>Periander,</hi> that euen as rust eateth the Iron, so enuie deuoureth his Master. <hi>Plutarch</hi> detesteth this vice. And <hi>Horace</hi> saith:
<q>
                        <l>Inuidia Siculi non in venere tiranni</l>
                        <l>Maius tormentum.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it which <hi>Martial</hi> condemneth, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that caused <hi>Socrates</hi> to wish that all enuious men were nought throughout euerie part but eares and eies to the ende that séeing and hearing other mens prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, they might be the more tormented, and receiue their punishment which they deserue. Flye this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> and with this, flie insatiable coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, which thou shalt effect if thou haue a constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to liue to Fame and not to Fortune. It is better thou die with <hi>Phocion</hi> than liue like <hi>Demades.</hi> Husband not for manie Winters, for thou art old. Care not for to morrowe, let to morrowe care for it self. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue well this day and lay thy hopes on heauen, and he that prouideth for the little birds will not sée thée want. Looke on me <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> my ioyntes are not stiffe, my face without furrowes, my body without sicknes, my life without hate: and why? I satisfie Nature without sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet, I am not carefull of worldly things which bewitch men. I am not curious of delicates to increase disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: neither enuying any man, am I enuied by any man? Is not this a trim felicitie in this life to be lorde both ouer himself and his affections? Now heare me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> thou must bee liberall: they that haue full handes must haue frée hearts, who distributeth his store in earth, heapeth vp store in heauen. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nicknameth the mighty more than niggardise. It is one of the vanities most vaine vnder the sunne as the wiseman teacheth, to heape vp without reason, to kéepe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10096:32"/>
with care, and to die in contempt. All the victories of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> made him not so famous as his bounty to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle:</hi> Neither liueth <hi>Scipio</hi> so much in his conquestes as in his liberalitie to the learned. What auaileth it to build rich Towers which are subiect to wind, fire, force and engines? to erect huge <hi>Piramides,</hi> to plant faire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyards? these are but the scabs of superfluite, which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity perhaps become more continent, will blame as the ruines of the great buildings of <hi>Constantine,</hi> before him <hi>Vaspatian,</hi> and diuers other <hi>Romanes.</hi> Ah <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> if thou wilt build a Pallace of eternity, entertaine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers about thée, in whose lines thou and thy poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity shall liue, when the Rauen shall builde in thy brauest habitation. I know thou art in the way to honour, &amp; by reading and practising the liues of the auncients thou hast become a great staffe to the state: Séeke therefore as carefull of thy common weale after thy death, to raise vp by thy liberality those ripe wittes who may when thou wantest, profit the commonweale, so shalt thou in time to come be thoght a <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> els now pointed at for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. And next to the learned with the pen, forget not those who deserue with the Pike: they are members which while the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarks kept in maintenance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, they became Masters of the whole world. <hi>Seso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> had hee not had these helpes, and restrained them in continence, and maintained them in credit, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had lost all before he had wonne anie thing. It was an old custome of <hi>Philip</hi> to loue <hi>Parmenio,</hi> in that he was a good Leader, &amp; <hi>Aiax</hi> had his place in the <hi>Grecian</hi> wars as well as <hi>Nestor,</hi> and souldiers must be considered of, as well in peace as in warre. I know <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> thou bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a warme gowne against Winter and linest it well, thou tylest thy house against stormes and lymest it well, thou fencest thy grounds against cattell and kéepest them well, and wilt thou not in like care prouide against the winter of enuy, some able soldiers to preuent the enemie?
<pb facs="tcp:10096:33"/>
But thou wilt say souldiers are euery where to be gotten for money, <hi>Athens</hi> is full of men, wee haue store of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, why then should we care? But what said <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who demanded if his huge Armie armed in golde were not sufficient to ouercome the <hi>Romanes?</hi> Yes said <hi>Hannibal</hi> smiling, this were sufficient to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the patientest and dastardest hart that liueth, much more the <hi>Romaines,</hi> meaning hereby that pompe is not the terrifying, neither the multitude the amating of the enimy: But resolute courages séeing great prises before them, behaue themselues as those at the games of <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> they stretch strings and heart strings in expectation of reward. Had not <hi>Darius</hi> a huge Host brauely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? A milion of horsemen to attende on him: and what then? <hi>Alexander</hi> with thirty thousand experienced <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons</hi> ouerthrew him: Then what is a multitude? We sée by experience, that the olde Oxe trained to the yoake draweth better than the yongest Heighfer, and that vse and experience hauing the Maistery in al things, cannot be outfaced in military discipline. Stretch pollicie to the highest point: in <hi>Salomons</hi> daies (beeing the wisest prince that liued, maintaining as great peace as euer was) the Captaines and the Officers of the Host were maintained, so were they in his fathers daies, in all good states, the maintenance of souldiers is the planting of peace: for the exercise and value of the souldier bréedeth feare in the enemie. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> that inuaded <hi>Asia</hi> and some part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and whose conquests are famous in <hi>India,</hi> at first were a contemptible Nation: But when <hi>Clangius</hi> the Smith had first brought them in exercise, then beautified them with honours, what Nation either heathen or Christian durst looke vpon them? The <hi>Spanish</hi> haue as hot courages as we, the <hi>Almaines</hi> are as bigge boand men, the <hi>French</hi> as pollitique, all these more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised then we be, as populous and more, what want they then to be our Maisters, what haue wee but hope and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10096:33"/>
which may deceiue <hi>Athens</hi> as it did <hi>Siracusa,</hi> which was taken by a handfull of men in despight of the whole Iland. Beléeue me <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience more in this Citie than to sée Brokers dining at our Merchants tables, and souldiers begging at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans dore: To sée Tailors well paid for inuenting a new fashion, &amp; soldiers scorned at for presenting a strong fortification. If our <hi>Athenians</hi> will looke for no change, then let them thinke to liue in no world: If they be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there will come change, then let them be prouident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the change of the world. In nature and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall constitution of the body, the hands are as souldiers to execute the resolutions of the heart, and the heart from hir vitall conduites sendeth bloud to warme the hands. Such affinity and alliance ought to be betwéen the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour that ruleth, and the souldier that executeth: there must some swéete shower of gold come out of his Coffers to refresh them, or they waxe dul, they are deuoured with idlenes, so that when they should defende the heart, their fingers are numbde they cannot fight, because they want the vse of féeling. Looke to this <hi>Philoplutos,</hi> bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for this cause, the selfe care they saye suketh all. The faire Lambes are onely reserued for selfe care, the vines drop Nectar for selfe care, the trees yéeld fruit for selfe care: thus selfe care hath the swéete of all things, whilst poore soldiers sweat, fight and fast with care, and all for care. But the prouerbe is, true care preserueth all things, therefore self care is not pollitique in leauing the souldier nothing. But the day passeth, <hi>Cosmosophos</hi> haue at thée: Smooth thou no more left the Gods smite, whose eares since they are open to heare praiers, will stir vp his wrath to reuenge your pernicious cruelties.

these are the steppes to thy sinne. These are the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes that haue incited <hi>Achitophel</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> to hang themselues, who being not able to endure the violence and horror of their miquities, thought it better to kill themselues than to abyde their deadly corment. These are the furies that agitated <hi>Orestes.</hi> These are they which as <hi>Cicero</hi> witnesses, will breake thy sleepes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy conscience beates thy braine and procures thy bane: being therfore worldly wise so long as to extreme age, became godly wise at last Let not worldly occasions detaine thée. Twere better for thée to daunce in thy I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket than to be hanged in thy Iirkin. Thou must not say, I am enforced to deceiue others, in that I must liue: for by this life thou atchieuest death. It is better to be poysoned with <hi>Socrates,</hi> than to flátter with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stippus.</hi> Shut the doore before the stéede be stolne. Looke before thou leap. Feare before thou fall. Repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reuenge come. The day is spent, I am wearie with speaking. The houre of meditation bids me leaue you. Go you to your sumptuous leastes, Leaue <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> to his chaste fast. To morrowe, if you visit mée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I will rip vp nowe griefes. Till when, get you gone: and if you forget good Lessons the diuell go with you; for goodnes is departed from you.</p>
