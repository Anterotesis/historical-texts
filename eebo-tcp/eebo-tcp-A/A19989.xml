            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For prayers at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are vnprofitable, proceeding of custome from the lips, not of zeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart. What we should pray for, the Scripture teacheth plainly. First, for the glory of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>For the peace of Ierusalem. Psal.</hi> 132. <hi>That the word of God may haue free passage.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. <hi>that our flight be not in the winter. Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>For our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinnes.

            <p>Finally, for all such thinges as the vse and want of man doth require, whether they be earthly graces, or spiritual: alwayes framing our petitions to that certayn and iust rule of Gods will, to the which all manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests must be referred: <hi>for we know not what we should pray as becommeth vs. Rom.</hi> 8. And therefore <hi>we aske and haue not.</hi> Why? <hi>Because we aske amisse.

To be short, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the strength and force of prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, nothing prospereth with vs fortunately.</p>
            <p>But yet here remaineth a farther question, how it may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with Gods immutable wil, and decree, that our prayers should be of such strength &amp; force to alter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> threatnings which are decreed, &amp; therfore of force must come to passe. I aunswere God neuer promysed any thing in scripture, for the most part, except it were the absolute promises concerning <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ssias</hi> and such like) but it hath a condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto it, ether expresly, or to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. Likewise, he neuer threatneth (for the




<pb facs="tcp:22666:6"/>
most part) but a conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is added thereunto. As for example. Adam was created of God that he should haue liued continually in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed estate, if he would so remayne: this was the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the decree. Destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was preached to the Niniuites, if they repented not: this was the condition, and the decree. Niniue repented and was not destroyed, but saued: was therfore Gods decree altered? no? For he decreed their destruction, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this condition, if they repented not. Pray therfore (if thou be godly,) that he would geue thee the grace to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue: and if thou be sinful pray that he geue thee the grace to repent. And thus very well our prayers haue strength to stay Gods wrath, his decree remayning im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mutable, because it is threatned but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition, if we repent not.</p>
            <p>But whence hath prayer this strength? of it self? No. <hi>For we being iustified through faith haue peace toward God</hi> (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the fauor of God) <hi>through our Lord Iesus Christ. Rom.</hi> 5. So that Christ is our mouth whereby we speake to the Father: our eyes by which we see the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: our right hand, by which we offer to the Father. Which Christ, except he be our aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, neither we, nor all the saints, can haue a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thing to doe with God. <hi>For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the father but by him. Ioh. 14.</hi> Why then are not our prayers alwayes heard, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually such a spokesman, who hath all pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er both in heauen and earth? Truely because either we aske amisse, not according to Gods will, and that which is not for vs to receaue, or it pleaseth the Lord to defer our requestes,




<pb facs="tcp:22666:7"/>
for tryall of our faith and patience. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was that Dauid sayd: <hi>Expectans expectaui Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minum. With long wayting, I waited for the lord and he inclined vnto me and heard my calling. Psal.</hi> 40. Pray therfore continually, with faith, loue, &amp; vnderstanding, in the name of Iesus Christ: pray for al men, at al times, in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and for al things according to Gods wil. Though thou be a sinner, though God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweth the hart, though his decree be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable yet pray vnto him in Iesus Christ, and he will refresh thee. Of this I thought good to admonish thee (Christian Reader,) because it is an easy thing to pray, but to pray aright, is a thing very difficult. Here are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee zealous, and godly, prayers, some translated out of Latin, &amp; French, some made by the best learned of our time. Use the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I haue taught thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be to good vse. Accuse not mine insufficiency in teaching but amend thine owne imperfection in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: praying that we talke not smoothly, &amp; walk crookedly, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may giue to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father our maker, obedience: faith to Iesus Christ our redemer: and mortification of the flesh to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost, our comfortor. Fare wel in Christ Iesu.</p>
