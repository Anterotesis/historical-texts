            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe continuance of the War obliging Us to Call you together at this time, for your own Safety and Security, as well as for Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and hindering Us to be preſent in Perſon: We have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Our Right Truſtee, and Right well Beloved Couſin and Counſellor, <hi>JOHN</hi> Earl of <hi>Tullibardine</hi> to be Our Commiſſioner, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Our Perſon and Authority in this Seſſion of Parliament. The knowledge We have of his Capacity, as well as of his zealous Affection, and firm Fidelity to Our Perſon and Government, will certainly render him Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. We have fully Inſtructed him in all that may Concern the Good and Welfare of that our Antient Kingdom, and the Intereſt of Our Service; And therefore you are to give him entire Truſt and Credit. He is to Ask nothing of you in Our Name, but what your own Safety makes neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The Delivery that <hi>God Almighty</hi> lately gave Us, from that Imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which both Our Perſon and Kingdoms were Expoſed, by the Crafty and Bloody Deſigns of Our Enemies, is freſh in your Remembrance, and Calls for Our Joint Care and Providence for the future.</p>
            <p>The Supplies Granted in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, are now almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; And you alſo know how much the Funds there to appointed, are ſunk below Expectation.</p>
            <p>The Continuing of the Forces, the Buying of Arms and Ammunition, the Repairing of Forts and Gariſons, and the Proviſions for your Frigats, being all for your own Defence, with the other Charges and Contingencies of the Government, will readily perſwade you to give what is Needful, for thoſe Ends. And that in the moſt effectual and eaſy manner, Recruits during the War muſt alſo be had; which We hope you will provide in ſuch ways as may beſt prevent Abuſes.</p>
            <p>We have Impowered Our Commiſſioner, to Give Our Royal Aſſent, to ſuch Laws as ſhall be judged neceſſary, for the better Securing to Our Subjects their Rights and Properties.</p>
            <p>It hath been, and ſhall ſtill be Our Royal Care, to Preſerve you in Peace and Safety, and to Promove your Welfare and Proſperity: And therefore We expect you will Treat and Conclude all Matters, with that Prudence, Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and concord, as will be moſt to Our Satisfaction, and no leſs to your own Honour and Advantage; And ſo We bid you heartily Farewell.</p>
