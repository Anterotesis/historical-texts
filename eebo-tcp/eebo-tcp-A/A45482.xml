            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat Actions are not enterprised by vulgar
Spirits: without eminent Vertue, man
seldome riseth above private Interests: in this
designe, you have given the World a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of what Latitude your thoughts are, how
not to be circumscribed within the common narrow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
The <hi>Romans,</hi> in that glorious Age (which remaines
an Envy to all succeeding) imployed their most famed
Generals; in discovery of remotest Islands, and our owne
had the Honour to be invaded by the greatest <hi>Caesar:</hi> and
when he made his attempt here, the <hi>Indies</hi> can afford no
people more divided in it selfe then we were; more weake
in fortresses on land or ships at Sea: but time hath refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us to the Excellency we now so much glory in. The
Noblenesse of his Example serves you for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and I am certaine, the largenesse and fertility of
the Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> promiseth you a far more rich
returne: And it may be possible something of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Before you could set saile, you met with a rough
storme at Land, and your Fleet was in danger of Wrack,
before it lanch't forth: but the opposition became your
advantage, and who laboured the ruine of your expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

question. The Parliament after full debate found how Just
and Honourable to the Kingdome was his Majesties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to you, and by their approbation added a second
kind of Seale to your Patent. I here present you with the
Island you aime at, drawne in a little Tablet, the Cloath
course, and the colours poore, and ill laid, but it may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the better reception, in regard it was taken to the life

            <p>NAture imprisons the Natives of our Country within the
Seas: but Art revengeth the injury, and by the Invention
of Shipping, makes us free of the whole World, and joynes
our Island to the remotest continent; The Sun doth neither set nor
rise, but where we are addmitted, or make our selves free denizens;
and farthest Nations acknowledge us either with veneration or
terrour. And however the scornefull folly of our Neighbours reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us with the name of Islanders; yet have we enlarged our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
on the maine Land, and by being immured with the water, gained
the priviledge to be Chief Masters of that Element. Our forefathers
in their discoveries, left us a noble envie of their fortunate attempts:
And Captaine <hi>Bond</hi> (to whom I dedicate this weak Description of
the Island, as I am confident the Island shortly will it selfe) is now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their glorious tracke, and may arrive to be an equall wonder
to after History. For if we value the riches of the Land he is bound
for, either naturall, or to be gained by Industry, It assures the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
the most plentifull return, being furnisht with such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as no other Plantation ever afforded. If we regard the
whole somenesse of the Ayre, and pleasure of the soyle, It promiseth
the Planters health and delight. And if we looke on the nature of the
people we are to deale with, they, how ever not civiliz'd into our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
reteine the first incorrupt innocence of man. An Earth, like
that of <hi>Eden,</hi> pleasant without artifice, and plentifull without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
a people approaching in some degree neere <hi>Adam,</hi> naked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
guilt, and innocent, not by a forc't vertue, but by ignorance of
evill, and the creatures as humble, and serviceable to man as they
were before his transgression. But what particularly perswades us to
this Honourable Expedition, nature hath ingrafted in their soules a
strange affection towards our nation, &amp; by their submisse enterteining
<pb facs="tcp:55670:4"/>
us, seemes to prophesie the easinesse of that victory we are even cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to: But we intend not to betray them to servitude, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
lyes open to us: Religion and the Arts wee shall instruct them
in, will be sufficient gaine to them, for whatsoever riches their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
shall afford us. But how happy soever our fortune may be, they
will share at least with us, and perhaps preceed us: For what will bee
our wealth, will no way impoverish them; and what will enable us at
our returne, cannot make their treasure one graine the lighter.</p>
            <p>Since opinion is the Common judge of Riches, and what in the West
is of highest value, as gold and precious gems, among them are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
trifles, as our beades and other low-prized vanities, are their
riches. But what serves as the most powerfull Adamant to draw us to
this Adventure, we sayle not to this Island to plant, but to reape,
and no sooner shall we arrive but we shall find our harvest, so many
wealthy Commodities there attending onely the leasure of the happie
Adventurer, and perishing for want of the Iudicious, who know how
to distinguish what Nature hath so liberally enlarged.</p>
            <p>In a word, as it was said of <hi>Thebes,</hi> so may I trulier say of this
Island, That the Sun in all his progresse doth not not behold a richer
and sweeter Countrey.</p>

               <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Island.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
it selfe North and South, from 12.
degrees, to 26. degrees of latitude, in length 14. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
that is 280. leagues, or 840. English miles, and
is the greatest knowne Island in the world, having on the
West the main Land of <hi>Africa,</hi> on the North the Islands
of <hi>Comoro,</hi> on the East the Island of the <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and on
the South the maine Ocean.</p>
            <p>Heere in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Augustine Bay.</note> is the place where the
English Ships bound for <hi>India,</hi> doe usually put in both
outward and homeward, to take in their Wood, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and other Provisions; chiefly to refresh and Cure
their sick people, where commonly their longest stay is
but for five or six dayes, in which time they are perfectly
cured. This <hi>Bay</hi> lieth on the West side of the Island, in
the latitude of 23. degrees ½ under the Tropick of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Bay</hi> we arrived in <hi>Anno 1630.</hi> in the <hi>Charles</hi>
and <hi>Ionah,</hi> Captaine <hi>Weddell</hi> Commander, on the first of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> and stayed there till the beginning of <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which time we spent in coasting along the Country,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55670:5"/>
and in observing the customes and qualities of the
people.</p>
            <p>For the Island it selfe, on the East side it sheweth to
be a low Champion Country, with many large creekes
and In-lets, but on the West it is more mountainous and
woody, the Vallies yeelding large plaines for pasture,
full of Navigable Rivers, the soyle is generally a kind of
Red earth.<note place="margin">White Marble.</note> Heere I observed that for the most part all
the Rocks and Stones are white Marble.</p>
            <p>For the Season, when we arrived there, it was in the
depth of Winter, the Sun then being in the Tropick of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> at which time we found the Trees and Plants in
their full verdure,<note place="margin">The whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenes of the Aire,</note> all loaden with greene fruit of severall
kinds, the Aire so temperate and wholesome, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our people as they did oftentimes sleepe on the
bare earth, yet in all the time of our stay there; (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
can justifie) we never had any man sick.</p>
            <p>To particularise of the nature and qualities of the
Trees, fruits, and Plants of the Island, would rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an Herball, then to be Epitomized in my Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and would be impossible for me to performe, seeing
that Almighty God doth dispose to each Country and
climate, their particular plants and fruits, to our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unknowne, yet some of them I will describe as best
knowne of us.</p>
            <p>As for Timber, there is great variety, their whole
Woods consisting of many kinds, fitting both for Mast
and Planck,<note place="margin">Tamarind Tree.</note> the chiefest of them is the Tamarind tree,
whereof there are aboundance of that growth, that wee
saw'd some of them into Planck, that carried foure foot
Diameter.<note place="margin">Ebonie black and white. Redwood.</note> Of Ebony there is great store, both white
and black, Trees of a kind of Red-wood like Brasill, and
as hard, whereof the Natives make their Darts, which I
have to show; other trees there are wherof our men made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55670:5"/>
their Mathematicall Instruments, and by them preferred
before Wall-nut tree or Box,<note place="margin">Box:</note> besides infinite other
kinds serving for Planck, Clap-boord, and Pipe-staves,
whereof we made tryall.</p>
            <p>One thing I observed, that not one tree but bore
fruit, though unknowne to us, yet the Munkeys were
our tasters, for if they did eate of them, we durst boldly
adventure.</p>
            <p>All the Vallies neere the Sea, and along the fresh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">Palmito, or wild Datetree.</note>
are full of Palmito trees, from whence by making
a small incision with a Knife or Hatchet, in a quarter of
an houre and lesse doth issue forth a most pleasant and
wholesome liquor,<note place="margin">Palmito Wine.</note> in taste like white Wine, and will
inebriate as soone, and this being kept, in two dayes
doth become excellent Vinegar.</p>
            <p>Besides the Palmito there is an other kind of them
that can be hardly distinguished, but that it doth beare
a fruit which we called the Sea-Cocus,<note place="margin">The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals cal this Fruit Coco di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mar.</note> whereof I have
some to shew, the Kirnell whereof is esteemed to bee of
equall vertue with the Bezar-stone.</p>
            <p>I may not forget that admirable tree which we named
the Flesh-tree,<note place="margin">The Flesh Tree.</note> whereon I would have all those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to try their blades and to glut their eyes with the
effusion of Humane blood, to be exercised, for it is so
like to materiall Flesh, that if you strike at it and wound
it with your Sword, it sheweth like an incision made in
flesh, and bleedeth forth a Crimson sap like very blood,
we supposed the Sanguis Draconis,<note place="margin">Sanguis Draconis,</note> whereof they
brought us a great quantity, to be made of the juice of

            <p>Oranges and Limons are here in aboundance,<note place="margin">Oranges and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> where
although our Countrymen have knowne and frequented
this Island above 30. yeeres;<note place="margin">George Gosnell Purser.</note> yet we were the first that

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55670:6"/>

the next day we had more brought unto us then we

being so curiously enterlarded, that we esteemed that
part to be the daintiest part of the beast.</p>
            <p>For Sheepe they have likewise in great aboundance,<note place="margin">Sheepe.</note>
which are both larger and fatter then ours, but of a

Cattell they brought them downe to us every day in
whole droves, so that we were compelled to buy more
then we could spend, which we committed to them to
keepe, who at our departure did faithfuly restore them
to us againe.</p>
            <p>Hogs they have wild in the woods,<note place="margin">Hogges.</note> whereof we killed
some, but they nourish none amongst them. As for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">No Lions, or Tigers, nor Woolves.</note>
Tigers, and other ravening beasts, we neither saw
nor heard of any, and I beleeve there are none, for their
Cattell feed abroad day and night in the plaines in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the greatest enemy their Cattell have, is the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile
or Alligator, who being in the fresh rivers, meets
with them sometimes when they come to water, but of
these there are not many, and those might soone be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed

as well of those kinds best knowne to us as of others

Cocks and Hens, Ginney Hens, Peacocks, Parrats of
divers kinds, Patridges both wild and tame, wild Swans,
Geese and Ducks, Herons, Cranes, Passula flemingos,
whereof we have killed a dozen at one shot, Curlewes,
and infinite other kinds to us unknowne.</p>
            <p>For fish their Rivers abound with great store of all
kinds, tedious it were for me to reckon them, we have
taken ordinarily above 500. Mullets at a draught, and

            <p>Now concerning the quality and disposition of the
People,<note place="margin">Nature &amp; dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people.</note> they are generally of a very loving and affable
condition, for in that three moneths that we lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

securely as if the Country had beene our owne,<note place="margin">Their affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> and if at
any time our people by wandring abroad had lost their
way, they would carefully bring them to us in safety
without offering them the least injury.<note place="margin">Their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> They are just in all
their dealings, whereof we had good experience: For
example, during the time of our abode amongst them,
they bringing downe daily such an aboundance of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
which being sold to us for small prices, we bought
every day more then we could spend, to the number of
an hundred head of Cattell,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> which we committed to
one of their owne people to keepe for us, not greatly
caring whether we had them againe or no, yet at our
comming away when we had cleared our selves of the
shore, and all our men and provisions were aboord, our
Grasier brought downe to the Marine all our Cattell
to a hoofe, and did helpe us to get them aboord, and in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55670:7"/>
all our trayding with them we never sustained so much
as the losse of one Bead.<note place="margin">Their Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> For theft they punish it with
death, the father having that power over his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for there we saw the father danc'd his owne child,
a Maiden of some ten yeeres of age, for stealing of some
two or three Beads.</p>
            <p>For their persons,<note place="margin">Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>all people both
Men and Women, the most part exceeding us in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of a browne or Chestnut colour; as well the Men
as the Women weare their haire about a foot long,
which they braid up as we doe an Horses maine. In their
haire and eares the Women chiefly weare Beads, Shels,
or peeces of Copper, also bracelets about their armes,
either of sweet Wood, or of Shels, the better sort of
Copper or Brasse. Every Man for the most part weares
about his neck his Razor, pick-tooth, and Mullets, to
pluck out the haire, (for you must note they weare no
beards) also his sticks to kindle fire, all which I have
to shew. The Women likewise weare neck-laces of
Beads, sweet Wood, or Shels, or what their fancie best
pleases. They go generally all naked as wel the Men as the
Women, except a small peece of Cotton of their owne
making,<note place="margin">Apparell.</note> some two hardfulls broad and ten long, which
comming about their waste they crosse it betwixt their
legs and so make it fast behind them, and this is the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Married, the rest goe naked.</p>
            <p>Nor did their nakednesse any way tempt us to any
uncivill action,<note place="margin">Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse no motive to incivility.</note> at the first our curiosity made our eyes
unchast, but after one weeke they conversed with us,
with the same observation as we behold ordinarily our
Cattel, and I doe beleeve that apparell and the dresse of
Women, alures more then their nakednesse.
They are generally of a lazie condition, for they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plant nor sow,<note place="margin">Their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> for in the Sommer time they feed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55670:7"/>
on those fruits which the earth naturally produceth,
and on milke all the yeere long,<note place="margin">Their diet.</note> which for want of
vessels the most part of them like great Calves suck from
the Cowes, a thing ordinary with them. For bread they
have some <hi>Cuscus</hi> and <hi>gravances</hi> which I beleeve growe
naturally; they kill no Beast without the allowance of
the King or Governour, who divideth to every one his
part according to his family, wherein I noted both
their community and Justice.</p>
            <p>They are in continuall Wars one against another,
which is chiefly for warring places, for whilst we stayd
amongst them we desired them to shew us the manner of
their fight,<note place="margin">Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fight.</note> which they did to make us sport, their Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
are on this manner; They divided themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two Companies, some fifty on a side with Launces
and Darts without heads, and so betwixt running and
leaping with a terrible hubbub or cry, they traverse their
ground and so deliver their Darts, which the adverse par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
either avoydeth or catcheth, and returnes back to
them againe; Their Women and children in the meane
time imploy themselves in gathering up of the enemies
weapons, wherewith they supply their husbands and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> our first comming a shore when they beheld us set
up our Tents and had planted a couple of Fowlers, they
imagined that we came to inhabite there,<note place="margin">Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at our first landing.</note> whereupon
their King <hi>Andrapela</hi> with his Company, to the number
of an hundred came to our Captaine,<note place="margin">Captaine Weddell.</note> submissively lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Launces at his feet and kissed them, offering
himselfe and his people unto his subjection, praying
him to receive them, their Wives, Children, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
under his protection, and to defend them from their
Enemies, which the Captaine accepted; he told us of
the mortall wars they had with the <hi>Massagores</hi>

friends.</p>
            <p>Upon a time, I know not whether upon policy or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
they came to our Captaine with a lamentable
cry,<note place="margin">A policy of Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pela.</note> that the <hi>Massagores</hi> were come downe upon them
and had drove away their Cattel, &amp; that unlesse we came
speedily to rescue them, they should be either all slaine
or Captived. Whereupon in halfe an houres time wee
had at least 200. of our men in armes, with our Drum,
and Colours flying, to look out for this supposed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
having marcht thus a mile or two into the Woods,
they brought us at length unto a place where the King
had provided three or foure fat Sheepe and other things
to feast us, and this was all the Enemy we found.</p>
            <p>When our People first discovered this Island, which
was about 37. yeeres since,<note place="margin">In Anno 1606.</note> we had no Commoditie to
trade with them for their Cattell, Royalls of Eight they
refused,<note place="margin">Our first trade with them.</note> at length having espyed the Boat-swaines whistle
and Chaine they had a great mind to the Chaine, so
that for a foot of Chaine we bought an Oxe, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the next Voyage we carried over silver Chaines on
purpose to trade with them; afterward when our men
shewed them red Agat Beads they became in love with
them, and would trade with us for Chaines no longer,
so that for a few Samsams or round small Beads, wee
bought up all our silver Chaines again. Every morning
during our abode there they brought us downe at least
two or three hundred head of Cattell of all kinds, as
Oxen,<note place="margin">Great plenty of Cattell, and good Cheape.</note> Sheepe, and Goats, of which the largest and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Oxe we bought for five or six long Beads, called by
them <hi>Arango's,</hi> which cost us in <hi>India</hi> not two pence the
Bead, and the smaller Cattell after that rate, and these
are the Jewels they most esteem, for as I said before being
a naked people, and having no settled Habitations, they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55670:8"/>
affect nothing but what they can hang about their necks
and armes, wherein they take a great pride, and is indeed
all the wealth they have. As for their Kine they doe
not willingly part with them but keepe them for
breed, and for their milke for the sustenance of them
and their children.</p>
            <p>When we came first among them we could never see
above foure or five hundred of them,<note place="margin">Not above 500. at the most live together.</note> Men, Women,
and Children, that lived together under one Raiae or
Governour, nor could we see more all the time of our

our President, we bought up all their weapons for a few
Beads and so disarmed them, so that for two monethes
after we could scarsely see twenty Lances amongst them
all, for although all their imployments be about the
making of them, yet for want of Tooles they cannot
make one in a fortnights time.</p>

some foure or five leagues, where we saw the goodliest
Country that ever eyes beheld. We sounded as we went,
and found no lesse then foure or five fadome water, and
therefore Navigable for Ships. The Natives seeing us
(whom they had never seen before) used al the means they
could by calling to us, making wests and using other
gestures to cause us to come on Land, which at the last we
did, being not above twenty of us, every man having his
Musquet, who entertained us with a great deale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

them being our convoy arm'd after their manner, who
brought us first through a great Wood at least halfe a

            <p>Beyond this plaine in a little copse or wood were

us that they were Man-eaters, but when he saw that we
were resolved to trade with them, he gets over to them
before us and deales with them for halfe the profit, as
we knew afterwards.</p>
            <p>In our Voyage back againe, we fell into a deepe Bay

them infinite sums of money, for little or no cause at all. And
then again to consider what a world of Treasure is every year

               </gap> this Island of <hi>Madagas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
were of that worth, wealth, and so commodious as I would
infer, the <hi>Portugals</hi> had long since planted upon it as they
have done on many places both in <hi>Africk</hi> and on the firme
Land of <hi>India.</hi> To this I answer, that when the <hi>Portugals</hi> first
passed the Cape of good Hope; to discover the Kingdomes
of <hi>Cambaia</hi> and <hi>Calicut,</hi> now named the <hi>East-India,</hi> they coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
along the maine Land of <hi>Ethipia,</hi> and fell with <hi>Mosam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi>
where they planted a Colony for the reliefe of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55670:11"/>
ships comming out of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they take in fresh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and their wants supplied they proceed on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Voyages to <hi>India,</hi> where they intended their conquests
and plantations, using that other but as an Hostery or a place
of reliefe for their Ships outward and homeward, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
scarsely within the sight of <hi>Madagascar.</hi> Nor can either
<hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Portugall</hi> here claime any title, having had never
any footing here, much lesse that they should any way op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, they having more Forts in <hi>India</hi> already then they
are able to hold, and are almost beaten off of their Trades
since the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> used those Seas.</p>
            <p>Consider withall, how that a few <hi>Portugalls</hi> have for the
space of neere upon two hundred yeares fortifyed themselves
on the maine Land of <hi>India,</hi> as at <hi>Cambaia, Gogo, Daman, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
Dabull, Goa, Callicut, Mallacca, Macao,</hi> and others; and
doe hold them still in despight of the <hi>Moores,</hi> a warlike and
powerfull Nation. I need not tell you of <hi>Ormus</hi> a barren
Island, or rather a Rock of salt, yet by the industry of the
<hi>Portugalls</hi> in a few yeares; by forcing the <hi>Indian</hi> trade thither,
it became the greatest Mart in the world.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, this Virgin Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> doth
here by me friendly and lovingly invite our Nation to take
some compassion of her Nakednesse, her Poverty, and her
Simplicity, both Corporall, and Spirituall, and doth earnestly
and affectionately, even beg of us to Redeeme her out
of her miserable thraldome, under the Tyranny of Satan,
to be united with us into the fellowship of the Sons of God,
by our Union in Christ Jesus.</p>
