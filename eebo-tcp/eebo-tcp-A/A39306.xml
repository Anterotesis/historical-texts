            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Year <hi>1681.</hi> there was a small Treatise published by a Friend, under the Title of <hi>A Brief Examination of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. The occasion of writing that Treatise was, a sense the Author thereof had, and an Observation he had made, how much the Nature of that true Spiritual Liberty was misunderstood by some, and the Name thereof abused by others in the Profession of the Truth; who, under pretence of being left to that Liberty in themselves, and to their own Freedom therein, both took liberty to do such things as were inconsistent with that true Liberty, and with the Principle of Truth which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed; and, despising those useful, good and necessary Helps and Means which the Lord hath provided, and furnished his Church or People with, for the preventing and keeping out such Disorders, Evils and Scandals, as the unruly Nature of man, through such a mistake of true Liberty, might and would bring in, did reject the Counsel; Admonition or Reproof of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with a <hi>What hast thou to do with me? Leave me to my own Freedom.</hi> To reclaim (if it might be) those that were thus deceived, and prevent others from being so, the Author being pressed in Spirit for <hi>Zion's</hi> sake, and for the Peace of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and having a deep Sense (as himself expresses) of the working of the Enemy of <hi>Zion's</hi> Peace to rend and divide the Heritage of God, did write the fore-mentioned Treatise for the Establishment of the Faithful, Information of the Simple-hearted, and Reproof of the Arrogant and High-minded; as
<pb facs="tcp:45978:3"/>
his Title Page sets forth. As that Treatise had its Service and Acceptance with the Faithful and Simple-hearted: So it has passed hitherto (for between nine and ten Years) free from the Cavils (at least Publick) of the Arrogant and High-minded, till now that of late some of them, who are of a restless Spirit (and to whom it is uneasie to be, or to let others be quiet) have sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out that Book for a fresh Butt to shoot at, make that a new Occasion to renew Contention, and revive the old Controversie. In order to this they have very lately published a Book, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (as is pretended) to several material Passages in that Book. That Answer hath in the Title Page the Letters <hi>J. H.</hi> as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Author's Name. But since I have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge who is meant by those two Letters, and I find the general stile of the Answer, both in the Preface and Book it self, to run in the first Person Plural <hi>[We]</hi> which, by the Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the End of the Preface, I am told may be understood in respect of those of the same mind with the Author of that Book, I chose in my Reply, to entitle the Adverse Party to it, without regard to any particular Person.</p>
            <p>They labour much, throughout their Book, to fasten an ugly Imputation or Charge upon the Author of that Treatise they pretend to Answer, of endeavouring to bring in a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, an implicit Faith, Conformity before and without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, a Dependence on Men instead of a Dependence on God, endeavouring to obtrude or set up Opinion, or the likeness of Truth, instead of Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How far from Truth this Charge is, the following Reply is intended to manifest. How far from true <hi>Christianity</hi> a man must be that could be guilty of all this, is manifest of it self. The Adversaries therefore, that they might not hereby too much disgust such of their Favourers, as have not wholly cast off all good thoughts of him they thus traduce, make as if they would in Charity excuse the Author from doing those
<pb facs="tcp:45978:3"/>
things knowingly; pretending to believe him both a better Man, and more a Christian. But how unlike <hi>Christians</hi> they have dealt with him, in Answering his Book, the following Reply will in part discover. Here in their Preface, for the reason of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things they slanderously tax him with, they assign his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived through the mysterious working of the Enemy; which that it may not seem strange, they wish their Reader to consider how many have been deceived thereby, both great and small, and some at times hurried into things grosly Evil, as killing their fellow-Creatures, and yet at the same time think they did God service. But as no good <hi>Christian</hi> ever did so: So, by the Comparison they have made, they sufficiently shew what a sort of <hi>Christian</hi> they in reality esteem him to be.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Preface</hi> is so much, both for matter and manner, of the same Piece with their Book, that much of what is in the Preface, will be taken notice of in the Reply to the Book; to which therefore, for avoiding needless Repetitions, I refer. Yet because they have loosely scattered through their Preface many unsound Expressions, which perhaps may not so fitly be handled in the Reply, I will briefly touch a few of them here; As</p>
            <p>Their calling the likeness of Truth a Third thing, besides what is Evil and Good, and saying that it stands betwixt Evil and Good (though they bring it in with as [As we may say] will not hold weight, but unsound. For that which is only like Truth, but is not Truth, doth not stand betwixt Evil and Good, but (whatever it seems to be) is really and directly Evil, and stands in and with the Evil.</p>
            <p>So their making the Covering of the Soul, where the likeness of Truth is received for Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be as the Linnen and Wollen-Garment, forbid to be worm under the Law, is an unfit and unsound Comparison: For neither the Linnen nor the Wollen was Evil, though (as a Type of Sincerity and Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:45978:4"/>
of Heart) they were then forbidden to be worn in one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together; but either the Linnen might lawfully be worn by it self, or the Wollen by it self. But the likeness of Truth, that which is only like Truth, but is not Truth, may neither be received together with any thing that is Truth, nor alone by it self without Truth.</p>
            <p>So when they speak of Outward Rules, they say, <hi>Every add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of outward Rules, shews a want of Christ's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his holy Spirit;</hi> They mistake. If it shews a want of any thing, it shews a want of Subjection to his Government by his holy Spirit, not a want of that Government. Neither is Christ's Government by his holy Spirit incompatible with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rules: but whatever outward Rules Christ by his Spirit gives, are consistent with, and agreeable to his Government by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>So again, when they say, <hi>It is certain that no outward Rule, as it concerns a holy Conversation or the worship of God, is of any Service, but until he come:</hi> They err. There are many outward Rules in the Scriptures of Truth, that were given by the Spirit of God, which have been, and are of Service to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, after Christ hath been witnessed come.</p>
            <p>Again, when they say, <hi>Every latter Appearance of God is as death to the former;</hi> The Expression is unsavoury, and not sound. For the Appearance of God or Christ do not kill one another, but agree one with another, and Co-operate to the work he intends thereby. But when to this they add, <hi>And this is our Case, as well as any that did go before us,</hi> &amp;c. They err egregiously: For the Appearance of God in us, did not bring Death to the former Appearance of God in others (though to the false Appearances and Likenesses thereof it did) Neither will any further Appearance of God hereafter, bring Death, or be Death, or be as Death to this Appearance of God,
<pb facs="tcp:45978:4"/>
whereby God hath made known himself in and to his People in this Age.</p>
            <p>Again, they say, <hi>When the Appearance or Conversation must be measured by certain Rules, it follows what is terms of Communion, or is accepted with God, may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with men</hi> This is a loose Expression, and tends to let up Looseness. Are not Sobriety, Temperance, Chastity, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Honesty, &amp;c. certain Rules whereby Conversation ought to be measured? If there must be no certain Rules for measuring Conversation, how shall the most unruly Conversation be blamed, reproved, judged, condemned, and either reformed or rejected? By these few Instances it may appear, how much they are declined from Truth.</p>
            <p>The God of Truth knows, I have no other End in this Reply than to defend Truth, and the Children of it, against the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Suggestions, false Charges, and wicked Insinuations of the Adversaries; to lay Open their deceitful Dealing; and to remove (as the Lord shall enable me) the stumbling-Blocks which they have laid in the way of the Week, whereby they have caused some to fall into Misapprehensions and hard Thoughts of Friends, without cause. And I beseech the God of Mercy to open the Vnderstandings and clear the Sight of all those, whose Simplicity has been betrayed by the Others Subtilty, that they may see and escape the Enemies Snares, and return to the true Fold, from which they have been led astray.</p>

            <head>A Reply to an Answer, lately published to a Book long since written, entituled, A brief Examination and State of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty Spiritual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Author of that Book, called, <hi>A brief Examination,</hi> &amp;c. hath therein truly and soundly defined Spiritual Liberty; declaring it to be two-fold, True &amp; False, according to the true and false Spirit, which respectively leads into each. The true Spiritual Liberty he defines to be
<q>Deliverance from Sin by the perfect Law in the Heart, the perfect Law of Liberty, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. otherwise called, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, that makes free from the Law of Sin and Death; elsewhere stiled The Law of Truth writ in the Heart, which makes free indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as saith Christ, <hi>If the Truth make you free, than are you free indeed.</hi> So that the Liberty of God's People stands in the Truth, and their Communion in it, and in the Perfect Spiritual Law of Christ Jesus, which delivers and preserves them from every Evil Thing that doth or would embondage. In this blessed Liberty it is not the will or wisdom of man, neither the vain Affections and Lusts that rule, or give Law to the Soul; for the minds of all such as are made free by the Truth, are by the Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in doing and suffering through their earthly Pilgrimage.</q>
The false Liberty he defines to be
<q>A departing from this blessed Spirit of Truth, and a Rebelling against this Perfect Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Heart, and being at Liberty to do our own Wills; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which cometh Reproof and Judgment.</q>
This, being the Basis of the work, I thought fit to transcribe at large, that the Reader may plainly see and understand what that Liberty is, both true and false, which was the subject of that Book, and is now of this Controversie.</p>
            <p>Against this Definition of Spiritual Liberty, I do not find the Answerers of that Book (for the Answer runs in the plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45978:6"/>
take any Exception. For, in the entrance of their Answer, they say, <hi>As to the Definition of Liberty Spiritually explained,</hi> page the first, <hi>We agree upon the matter.</hi> But, passing by some Questions and Answers in that Book, tending to shew, in some general Instances, wherein and how far the Members of the Church of Christ may be left to their freedom; They take-hold of a Question and Answer in the second and third pages, which are thus exprest.
<q>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But doth not Freedom extend further than this; for since God hath given me a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, and that I have the Gift of God in my self, should I not be left to act according as I am free and perswaded in my own mind, in the things that relate to God, lest looking upon my self as obliged by what is revealed unto another, though it be not revealed unto me, I should be led out of my own measure, and act upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Motion, and so offer a blind Sacrifice to God? <hi>Answ.</hi> This is true in a sense, that is, if thou art such a one that canst do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth, then mayst thou safely be left to thy freedom in the things of God, and the Reason is plain; Because thy freedom stands in the perfect Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, and in the Truth, which is Christ Jesus, which makes thee free indeed, that is, perfectly free from all that is Bad, and perfectly free to all that is Holy, Just, Lovely, Honest, Comely and of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; But if thou pleadest thy Freedom against such things, yea, obstructest and slightest such good, wholsome and requisit things, Thy Freedom is naught, dark, perverse, out of the Truth, and against the perfect Law of Love and Liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Question, as stated above, the Adversaries find no fault with, but approve and applaud, often calling it a <hi>Weighty Question.</hi> But for all that, they either mistake, or wilfully pervert it. For whereas the plain and express Terms of the Question are these,
<q>[Since God hath given me a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, and that I have the Gift of God in my self, should I not be left, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q>
They, in their Sophistical Glosses upon it, vary the Terms, and instead of [God's having given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] They render it [<hi>where the Gift of God is received to profit withal:</hi>] And instead of [I have the Gift of God in my self] They put [<hi>such as do adhere to it</hi>] As if there were no difference (or They knew, or regarded none)

betwen God's having <hi>given</hi> a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, and man's having <hi>received</hi> this Gift of God <hi>to profit withal</hi>: Betwixt man's <hi>having</hi> the Gift of God in himself, and his <hi>Adhering</hi> (that is, joyning and cleaving close) unto this heavenly Gift. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Spiritually-minded know, not only that <hi>the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. (though too many receive it not, but reject and rebel against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but that, even of those that have professed to have received it, all have not received it to that good end &amp; benefit for which it was given, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to profit thereby. Neither have all who have had the Gift of God in themselves, adhered thereto: But many have wholly kickt against it; and some who have pretended to adhere to it, have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof, adhered to its and their own Enemy, not to their profit, but to their Loss and Ruin, and to the Trouble and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of the Church, of which they held themselves to be Members.</p>
            <p>Now that the Adversaries have thus wrested the Question, shall appear in their own words; for after they have (without much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation) recited the Question and Answer, they in their own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereto, pag. 2. say, <hi>That this Question above is weighty, is clear, for the whole Controversie seems included in it; For where the Gift of God is</hi> Received <hi>to profit withal, they have liberty and freedom to chuse or refuse things, according as they are perswaded, or they have not; and all this</hi> (say they) <hi>is included in the Question.</hi> Here, they have put in the word [<hi>received</hi>] thereby turning the ground of the Question from God's having given, to man's having received the Gift of God to profit withal. Again, say they, <hi>The Question is, whether freedom and Liberty do not extend further than outward things, that is, Whether it doth not reach to the things of God, where the Gift of Gods is Received ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Question</hi>; Whenas the word [<hi>Received</hi>] is not in the Question. Again, taking upon them in a conceited humour, to turn the Question into a Position or Assertion, they say, <hi>It will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thus, or to this effect, that true Liberty and freedom reacheth to the things of God, to all that have received the Gift of God to profit withal; for such, as they do adhere to it, have liberty and freedom in the fear of God to chuse,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now having thus wrested the Question, by varying the Terms in which the Author had laid it down, Their next work is to Cavil at his Answer; which, though it answered his Question, does not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45978:7"/>
answer theirs, at least not to their minds. And first I take notice, as if they had a mind to play the Criticks, and shew some little skill in Pedantry, they fall a Word-pecking, and Carp at his manner of expressing himself. It seems as if they thought him deficient in <hi>Grammer,</hi> and that he understood not Congruity of Speech. The beginning of his Answer was, <hi>This is true in a sense.</hi> For this they take him up. <hi>It seems rather</hi> (say they, pag. 2.) <hi>to take the Question to be an Assertion, than a Question in our Iudgment; for</hi> (say they) <hi>it follows thus, That this Question is true in a sense, which to us is neither clear nor very proper, a Question in some sort being a matter undetermined till affirmed or denyed.</hi> Surely, one would think, they might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Censure on another, unless they had learn'd to speak with more clearness and better sense themselves. How would they be understood, that a Question <hi>in some sort</hi> is a matter undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned till affirmed and denyed? Is it undetermined <hi>in some sort,</hi> and determined <hi>in some other sort,</hi> before it be either affirmed or denyed? Or is a Question, with them, a matter determined so soon as it is affirmed or denyed? They have found out, sure, an easie way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Questions, if either affirming or denying will determin the matter. But to make this pretended <hi>Solaecisme</hi> upon the Author of the Book they pretend to Answer, They abuse his words: for they say, <hi>It follows thus</hi> (meaning, in his Book) <hi>that this Question is true in a sense.</hi> But without Question, They put in the word Question in that place: for it doth not follow so in his Book. His Book doth not say, This <hi>Question</hi> is true in a sense: But, <hi>This is true in a sense.</hi> This; the Matter, Substance, Subject of the Question: not the Question (which is but a form of Speech) but the thing questioned; which if They know not how to distinguish, They are the less fit to take upon them to correct Others, him especially.</p>
            <p>Next, I observe they except against the Answer as insufficient. They say, pag. 2. <hi>The Answer, if worthy of that Name, is slight and evasive, no way deserving to be reputed or accepted as a true Answer to this weighty Question.</hi> Again, <hi>We find no direct Answer, neither directly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or denying the Question.</hi> Again, <hi>We see the Question is rather avoided than answered.</hi> All this in one page. And with such abusive Slights their Book abounds. But in this They do but beat the Air with empty Noise and Clamour, roving in Uncertainties and Self-inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. One while they say, The Answer is <hi>no way</hi> deserving to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45978:7"/>
reputed a <hi>true</hi> Answer, as in pag. 2. Another while they confess, <hi>It is true</hi> in the sense he grants, pag. 4. Now 'tis not a <hi>full</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, pag. 4. Anon, 'tis <hi>Nothing to the purpose,</hi> p. 6. This befalls them, because They go from the plain and simple Truth, from the true Light, to grope in the dark, with their own Guessings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, Conceivings and Suppositions, built upon this [<hi>If</hi>] and to'ther [<hi>If;</hi>] from which They as confidently force Conclusions, as if their Suppositions were the plainest Positions; their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, the clearest Demonstrations. Of this, Instances may be seen in their 3. and 4. pages, where attempting to find out by their [<hi>If's</hi>] whether the Author's Answer be full or nay to the Question, They say, <hi>Either this Question, if affirmed, is true in a larger sense, then he has granted, or it's but true in this sense.</hi> If true in a larger sense, it follows (say They, but not without another [<hi>If</hi>] though) <hi>If his aim and design, as he says, was to assert the Truth, he has missed his mark.</hi> This were to suppose it impossible to hit the mark, if a Question be true in a larger sense than it is answered. Which Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position no man of sense, I suppose, will allow of. So again, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower, <hi>If</hi> (say they) <hi>I must not act as I am perswaded, then I must act as others are perswaded.</hi> What necessity is there for that? Where lies the [must] in this case? Is there no medium between my not acting as I am perswaded, and acting as others are perswaded? What if, in such a Case, I should for a while forbear acting, not act at all, but humbly wait upon God, to receive from him the like Perswasion that my Brethren have, that so I also may act with them upon my own perswasion? Were there any hurt in this? nay, were not this a good sign of a right Christian Mind and Spirit? Again, they say, pag. 3. <hi>Either he believes his Answer is full to the Question, or he believes and knows it is not: If he believes and knows it is not full, then must he not only not have asserted the Truth as above, but also be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious wherefore he did it not; and we conceive</hi> (there's another of their Conceptions?) <hi>that must either be because he wanted ability, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wanted Truth in his way.</hi> Here are a pair of inconclusive Conclusions together, pieced out with a shallow Conceit of their own; which I should not have thought worth taking notice of, but to shew the well-meaning Reader, what false ways of Reasoning they work by, to beguile the simple. Amongst whom though such sort of Reasoning may pass for currant, and perhaps be thought of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45978:8"/>
some force by such as, through yeilding to the Enemies suggestions against the Truth, are become vailed and clouded in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: yet to the opened Eye, the single Eye, the inlightned mind, it appears, as indeed it is, empty, shallow, trivial, weak and false.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Answer it self, after all their vilifying of it, it will appear to the honest-minded to be pertinent, proper and full enough to the Question to which it was given. The Adversaries, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, expected an Answer to consist only in a Yea, or Nay: and they account the Answer not direct, because (as they think) it does not directly affirm or deny. But it is their want of skill (if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence they may be told so) that makes them think an Answer not direct, unless it be exprest by Yea or Nay. As the Answer relates to the Question, so the Question related to (as being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on) the Definition of spiritual Liberty, which the Author had given before. That therefore the Answer they except so much against may appear to be both proper, full and direct enough to the Question, I desire both the Question it self, and the Definition of that Liberty propounded in it, (and on which it is grounded) may be seriously and impartially weighed together. The true spiritual Liberty, on which the Question was grounded, was defined to be <hi>Deliverance from Sin by the Perfect Law in the Heart, the perfect Law of Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. (as is before set down at large.) And this Definition the Adversaries have subscribed to. The Question that follows, and is grounded upon, this Definition of spiritual Liberty or freedom, is this; <hi>Since God hath given me a Manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, and that I have the Gift of God in my self, should I not be left to act according as I am free and perswaded in my own mind, in the things that relate to God,</hi> &amp;c. Now consider; since it is certain, that this <hi>Gift</hi> of God is <hi>universal,</hi> that the Manifestation of the Spirit is given to <hi>every</hi> man to profit withal: and yet no less certain, that <hi>All</hi> who have this Gift in themselves, are <hi>not subject</hi> to it; that <hi>All</hi> to whom the Manifestation of the Spirit is given to profit withal, have <hi>not received</hi> the Gift; nay, that of them who do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to have received it, <hi>All</hi> have <hi>not so received it,</hi> as to <hi>profit</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, to be redeemed thereby into the true Spiritual Liberty: These things, I say, considered, such a positive, absolute, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Answer, as the Adversaries expected and call for, of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45978:8"/>
simple granting or denying the Question, by a positive Yea or Nay, without distinction or explanation, could not in Truth have been given. For that had been to say, that <hi>none</hi> ought to be left to their freedom, no, not They, who by receiving the <hi>divine Gift</hi> in themselves, subjecting to it, and growing up in it, are truly thereby brought to the true Freedom indeed, the Freedom that stands in Truth, the true Spiritual Liberty: Or that <hi>All</hi> ought to be left to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the things relating to Go<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> even they who through their alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God, know nothing of either this true Libety, or the Gift that leads to it; or They that, professing to know it, and to have received it, live not in subjection to it, and so are not brought to the true Spiritual Liberty by it; but have a freedom out of the Truth, a freedom to do such things as the Truth condemns. The Author therefore, rightly distinguishing these different states, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered aptly to the Terms of his Question; granting the Question in a right sense, but not in a wrong sense. For the Question not opening the particular state of the Party demanding this freedom, but being grounded only upon the Gift or Manifestation given (which is applicable not only to all in the Profession of Truth, how disorderly and scandalous so ever, but even to all mankind) and not mentioning the Parties having received the Gift in the love of it, closed with it to an improvement of it to a profiting therewith, and dwelt in a subjection thereunto (which alone brings into the true Spiritual Liberty) therefore the Author, that he might divide his Answer aright, said, <hi>If thou art such an one that canst do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth</hi> (as much as to say, If thou art indeed come by thy subjection to the Heavenly Gift given thee, into the true Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Liberty, and thy freedom stand in that) <hi>then mayst thou safely be left to thy freedom in the things of God, and the Reason</hi> (said He) <hi>is plain: Because thy freedom</hi> (the freedom thou wouldst be left to) <hi>stands in the perfect Law of Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. As much as to say, thy freedom, if this be thy state, is the true spiritual Liberty before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; and therefore thou mayst safely be left to that, both with respect to thy self, and to the Church of Christ, which thou art a Member of, since that freedom will not lead thee to do any thing against the Truth, but all for the Truth. (And herein, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Author had direct Relation to that Definition of true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Liberty which he had given before, and which the Adversary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45978:9"/>
now agree to) But on the other hand, If thou who demandest to be left to thy freedom in the things of God, art not come to this true spiritual Liberty; but notwithstanding God hath given thee a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, and that thou professest in words to have received this Gift, yet thou hast not so closed with, and subjected to this divine Gift, as to have profited therewithal, and so art not come into this true Spiritual Liberty; but by rebelling against the perfect Law of Liberty in thy Heart, thou art gotten into a false Liberty, a false freedom, a freedom to do such things as are out of Truth; then it is not safe, either for thy self, or for the Church of Christ (which thou seemest to joyn with) for thee to be left to this freedom of thine, since that will lead thee to act not for the Truth, but against the Truth, to bring dishonour to the Truth, disturbance to the Church, and destruction to thy self. The Author therefore, having granted that such as are come to the true Spiritual Liberty in and by the Truth, should be left to their Freedom in that; added, <hi>But if thou pleadest thy freedom against such things as are Holy, Iust, Lovely, Honest, Comely, and of good Report, yea, obstructest and slightest such good, wholsome and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit things, thy freedom is naught, dark, perverse, out of the Truth, and against the perfect Law of Love and Liberty.</hi> And thus, to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-minded, who consider the Definition above given of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Liberty, &amp; take the Question, as it was stated by the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I make no doubt but it will appear, that the Answer given by him thereto, was plain, proper, direct and full enough.</p>
            <p>But the Adversaries shew what they would be at: for they say, p. 4. <hi>The Question affirmed as above, is certainly not only true in a part, or in a sense, as he is pleased to say, but it is true in every part, true in the whole and every sense that a Position can be true in; Nay, it is so far true, that if it can be wrong at all, 'tis only in a sense, and that is only when misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</hi> Reply. These few Lines yield much matter to be considered; 1<hi>st.</hi> When they say the Question affirmed as above, they must mean the Question, as it lies in the Author's own Terms and Book, or as they have new modelled it, formed, transformed and deformed it, perverted and wrested it to their own sense in their Book. If they mean the latter, they prevaricate foully. If they intend the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Question, as stated and laid down (or, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their conceit affirmed) in the Author's own Terms, is true
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45978:9"/>
(that is, is to be granted, or held in the affirmative) <hi>in every</hi> part, in the <hi>whole,</hi> and in <hi>every sense</hi> that a Position can be true in: then, since the Question assigns no other Qualification to the Party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to be left to act according to his freedom, but that which is common to the most scandalous Professor, to the vilest Apostate, yea, to all mankind, namely, that God hath given him a manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Spirit to profit withal, and that he hath the Gift of God in himself (which many that have it, rebel against, and are so far from profiting with it, that they do despight unto it, it will follow, according to the Adversaries sense, that All such as God hath given a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, All such as have the Gift of God in themselves, how disobedien<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> soever they are to it, how Heady and High-minded soever, how unruly and turbulent soever, how factious and quarrelsom soever in the Church, must notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be left to act as they are free (though they are free to act what is out of Truth) and the Church be obliged to own and receive them as Brethren and fellow-Members in their so acting. But though this be the Consequence of the Adversaries Arguing, yet it is directly contrary to the Apostle's counsel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Secondly, when They say, The Question is true <hi>in every part,</hi> true in <hi>the whole,</hi> and <hi>every sense</hi> that a Position can be true in; And then add, It is so far true, that <hi>If it can be wrong at all, 'tis only in a sense</hi>; They seem to me to run at once into an Uncertainty and a Contradiction. A contradiction, in admitting it capable of being wrong in <hi>any sense,</hi> after they have so positively affirmed it to be true in <hi>every sense.</hi> An Uncertainty, in saying, <hi>If</hi> it can be wrong at all; which shews They haesitate, They doubt, They are not well assured, They are but in the Uncertainty: And themselves say in the same page, but a few lines lower, <hi>An Vncertainty admitted for the Truth in this case, stands in the nature of a Lye.</hi> To this they add another Paradox; for having said, If the Question be wrong at all, 'tis only in a sense, and that is only when misapplied; They add, <hi>But the misapplication of this weighty Question when affirmed, doth neither destroy it in its self, nor in the least take away the true use.</hi> This, in a Parenthesis, They bid us <hi>Observe.</hi> And truly they must be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant</hi> Readers indeed, that can <hi>observe</hi> any Congruity of Sense or Reason in this Passage; or understand how that can be <hi>misapplied to any one,</hi> which (according to their sense) is <hi>applicable to every one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45978:10"/>But it is very probable, that what They here say of this weighty Question, as they so often call it, is intended rather of the Question, or Position they have made (for they have turn'd it from one to to'ther) than of the Question propounded by that Author: for they here immediately subjoyn their Creed, as if they deduced it from the Question; but in such Terms as are only in their own Question, not in his. Thus they word it. <hi>Therefore we believe, where the Gift of God is received to profit withal, and truly adhered to, there must be a Liberty to chuse and refuse things, according as such are perswaded, even from the Babe in Christ, to the Strong Man, and so to all states</hi>: (in Christ I suppose they mean.) This shews how little they understand the Question, and the ground of it. For the Babe in Christ, <hi>he that is truly in Christ,</hi> though but in a Babish state, <hi>abiding in him,</hi> can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth; though he may not be able to do so much for the Truth, as a Strong Man, or Father in Christ can do. He that hath so received the Gift of God, as to profit therewithal, and doth truly adhere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, be his measure of growth or stature therein what it will, yet, abiding and growing up therein, That will lead him to chuse, and with freedom to embrace, whatsoever is Holy, Just, Lovely, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, Comely, and of good Report. So that such as one in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, wherein (according to the Author's Answer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, concerning being left to act as he is free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he may safely be left to his freedom in the things of God. Thus, after all their Clamour against the Answer to the Question, as no way deserving to be reputed a true Answer, not worthy of that name, of no use or service with respect to the Controversie, worth nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because not large enough, not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive enough (as they think) to take in All; They, with all their stretching and wresting, have brought it but to the same pass, to them only that are in Christ. And they tell us, pag. 7. That <hi>Man must be made a New Creature, and must travel through the whole Mystery of Iniquity, before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can come into Christ</hi>; and that, <hi>though the Enemy, that fallen Angel, can go with Man into every Remove, while man is fitting and preparing, yet into Christ he cannot come.</hi> So that, with them, a man being come to be in Christ, is out of the Enemies reach. Thus, (though, exercising themselves in things too high for them, They utter what they understand not,) yet they bring the matter to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45978:10"/>
same Issue and result, that the Author's own Answer left it in. For they that are thus come through the Travel, beyond the fitting and preparing, beyond the whole Mystery of Iniquity, into Christ, and out of the Enemy's reach, being entred where he cannot come: These are sure in as high an Estate as those can be, who the Author said may safely be left to their freedom in the things of God. The difference then lies not between such as are in different growths in Christ; but between Those that are really in him, and Those that are not in him, though they may profess to believe in him. The danger is not of the Babe, muchless of the strong Man, in Christ: But of the strong Man out of Christ; him that is strong in his own Will, in his own Conceit, being heady, high-minded, Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Quarrelsom, Impatient; who, if he cannot in all things be humoured, and have his own way, flies out into open Opposition, to work Division and Separation, as these Adversaries have done. For however; They now palliate, and in words smooth over the Liberty and freedom They pretend to, as if it were only a Liberty to chuse or refuse things according as they are perswaded: yet their Practice (which in this case is the best Discoverer of Intentions) hath sufficiently manifested what freedom, what Liberty They seek; A Liberty to Oppose Friends in such Things as Friends are satisfied in; A Liberty to reproach, revile, despise, scoff and Jeer at those Things that are conscientiously received and practised by Friends, and which Themselves neither have shewed, nor can shew any Evil to be in, but only pretend They are not Convinced of the Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness or Usefulness of them; A Liberty to revile and vilifie Friends in Print, under the names of Apostates, Innovators, Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of <hi>Popery,</hi> and but one step from it, Idolaters, Setters up of Images, Idol-Prophets, a treacherous Company, possest with the Spirit of <hi>Belial,</hi> Mercinary Judges, Self-seeking slavish Drudges, led by Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Liberty to rend off, divide and separate from Friends, and set up separate-Meetings, in divers parts and places, out of the Unity of Friends, and in direct Opposition to them; And yet after all this, and in the midst of all this, and maintaining all this, to come when and where They please, to Friends Meetings, as pretending to joyn with Friends in Worship, and impose upon Friends their Preaching and Praying, and expect that They (who have given the highest Demonstrations of Their being our greatest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45978:11"/>
Enemies, and persist therein) should notwithstanding be owned and received as Friends, as Brethren, as Preachers, as Ministers of Christ amongst us. This is the Liberty They have taken, this the freedom they plead and press for. And this is such a piece of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and gross Deceit as, I verily believe, cannot be paralleled among all the Pretenders to Christian Religion. This to be sure is a Mystery of Iniquity; And therefore, seeing They pretend not to extend the Liberty, of chusing and refusing things, according as They are perswaded, to any but such as are in Christ, p. 4. And that They must travel through the whole Mystery of Iniquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can come into Christ, p. 7. They must needs travel out of these things before mentioned, before they can pretend to be within the compass of their own Plea.</p>
            <p>In their 4th page, They say, <hi>Forasmuch as he neither hath, nor we believe, can give us any certain undoubted Rule, how to know who these are that are so to be left, all that he hath said by way of affirming this great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, is worth nothing; for as it is altogether unintelligible, 'tis every way impracticable.</hi> Again, <hi>If any certain Rule can be given to know who may be left to their Liberty as above, let us have it</hi> (say they) <hi>and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Rule we shall know who may not be so left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi>; By this They shew themselves to be out of the Truth, in the Uncertainty. If they were in the Truth, they would not be to seek of a certain Rule in this case, the Spirit of Truth giving Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and Assurance to them that are guided by it, though not to them that resist it. Now though they have not explain'd what they mean by Who these are, or how they expect a Description of them, whether by Qualifications, or by Personal Marks; yet each way they are wrong. For if they would have a Rule to know them by Qualifications, they themselves (with sufficient Contradiction to themselves, while they make as if they believed no such Rule can be given) have adventured to give it, assigning them to be such as are in Christ, even from the Babe in Christ to the strong Man, and so to all states (but still in Christ.) Now that this cannot take in (even in their own sense) the whole promiscuous Number of those that go to Friends Meetings, that hear Truth preached, or that by Tongue, or outward Profession only, confess to the Truth of the Principle, their own Description or Explanation of what it is to be in Christ, pag. 7. will manifest: For there they tell us, that <hi>Man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45978:11"/>
must be made a new Creature before he can come into Christ, he must tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through the whole Mystery of Iniquity</hi>; that <hi>the Rest is only by being in Christ, the Travel is while he appears in us to fit us for himself, for 'tis</hi> (say they) <hi>the New Creature that only finds room in him.</hi> (So then the Travel must be over before they come to be in Christ) <hi>For,</hi> say they, <hi>the Enemy, that fallen Angel, can go with Man into every Remove, whilst man is fitting and preparing, but into Christ he cannot come.</hi> These are some of the Qualifications by which they describe who should be left to their freedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if this may pass for a Rule with them, why may not that as well, which the Author of that Book they pretend to answer, laid down therein, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be left to their freedom in the things of God, who are such as can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth; such whose free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom stands in the perfect Law of Liberty? If they ask, <hi>But by what certain or undoubted Rule shall we know who are such</hi>? I Reply; When they have told me, by what certain or undoubted <hi>Rule</hi> they know who are in Christ, according to the Explanation they have given of being in Christ, that is, who they are that are certainly and undoubtedly made New Creatures; who they are that have certainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly travelled through the whole Mystery of Iniquity; who they are that have certainly and undoubtedly gone beyond, where the Enemy can go, into Christ where he cannat come; I will then tell them, who they are whose freedom stands in the perfect Law of Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>They add, <hi>But if no such Rule</hi> (that is, no certain or undoubted Rule) <hi>can be given, it must follow, All must be left free, or None must be left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi>; They are very quick at their Consequences. But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to see that their Consequence contains no more than their Premises. When they say, <hi>All must be left free</hi>; what <hi>All</hi> do they mean? All that are called <hi>Quakers?</hi> or only All that are in Christ, from the Babe in Christ upward? If they say only All that are in Christ, (according to the Description they have given of being in Christ) what more or other is that, than the Author they carp at had said before? If they mean All that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that's more (by their leave) than is in their Premises. For there they say, Therefore we believe, where the Gift of God is received to profit withal, and truly adhered to, there must be a Liberty to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45978:12"/>
chuse and refuse things according as such are perswaded, even <hi>from the Babe in Christ, to the strong Man,</hi> &amp;c. And sure they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that <hi>All</hi> that are called <hi>Quakers</hi> have <hi>so</hi> received the Gift, have <hi>so</hi> adhered to it, have <hi>so</hi> profited with it, as to be really in Christ (and that according to their forecited Description of being in Christ) though but in a Babish state or degree. They were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too hasty in their Conclusion that <hi>All</hi> must be left free, or <hi>None.</hi> They should have remembred, that the Definition of true Spiritual Liberty (to which they say they agree) was, Deliverance from Sin by the perfect Law of Liberty in the Heart, a being made free indeed by Christ the Truth. All have not this freedom. They cannot be left to it, who neither have it, nor know it. Must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore None be left to it, although they know it, and have it? They should have considered, that Spiritual Liberty was declared to be two-fold; True, and False: So that there is a false Liberty, a false freedom, as well as a True; a Liberty to do our own Wills, upon which comes Reproof and Judgment. <hi>Examinat. of Lib. Spir.</hi> p. 1. Would they have All, nay, would they have any left to this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to this Liberty, to do their own Wills, in Opposition to God's Will? That would bring Reproof and Judgment indeed.</p>
            <p>Now because it is a pleasing and desirable thing to man's Nature to be left to its Freedom, to be at Liberty to do, or not do, what it pleases, and how it pleases, in Religious, as well as in Civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whereupon it may sound harsh in the Ears of some, that any should not be absolutely and unquestionably left to their own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to do what they think fit, without being accountable to others: Therefore that I may remove all grounds of Offence and Stumbling on this occasion, out of the way of such as are honest-minded, I am willing here, as briefly as with plainness I can, to open the matter further. First therefore, a little to explain the Terms, and shew what is meant by those words [Not to be left to ones Liberty to act as one is free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I take the meaning thereof to be, that no Person, who doth profess to be a Member of a true Christian Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, ought, or hath right to plead any Exemption, upon the account of his Liberty or Freedom, from being called to an Account by that Society which he professes to be a Member of, in case such Person shall do any thing repugnant to the Principles of that Society, or tending to the Defamation or hurt thereof. But that every such
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45978:12"/>
Society hath power to call any such professed Member to an Account, in order to inform him, and open his understanding, if he be weak and dark; to Reprove, Rebuke, and Exhort him to Repentance, if he prove heady, wilful, contentious and Unruly; And if he obstinatly persist therein, to refuse any further Fellowship with him, until he manifest true Repentance. This is the Power, the utmost Power, that the Church of Christ claims, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Inform, Instruct, Reprove, Admonish, Exhort to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance such of her professed Members as go astray, and (if nothing less will serve) to refuse Communion with the Impenitent, and those that reject her, and declare them not to be of her. Now that it may appear how reasonable as well as needful it is, that there should be such Power in the Church of Christ, I desire the Reader, in the next place, to consider, that in the best Religious Societies of men, there have always been (as to outward Profession) Good and Bad, True and False, Right and Wrong. With <hi>Israel</hi> of old there came up, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a mixt Multitude, or a great mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. Besides which, many of the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselves, when they came to be tryed in the Wilderness, proved to be Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers, Complainers, Gain sayers and Rebellious: So that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle rightly observed, they are not all <hi>Israel,</hi> which are of <hi>Israel, Rom.</hi> 9.6. In the Christian Church, at the first gathering thereof, many that walked a while with Christ, so far as to be reputed his Disciples, wont back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and walked no more with him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.66. How<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was afterward, in the Apostles times, the Epistles of the Apostles sufficiently show. There were in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> some that were carnal, and walked as men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. There were many, the Apostle tells the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that so walked, that they were the Enemies of the Cross of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. There were some in the Church at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> that walked disorderly, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.11. There were some in the Church in <hi>Fergamos,</hi> that held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who taught <hi>Balack</hi> to cast a stumbling-Block before the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit Fornication (for by that name doth the Holy Ghost call those unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Marriages, of Believers with Unbelievers, which <hi>Balaam</hi> taught <hi>Balack</hi> to draw the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> into with the <hi>Midianitish</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.) <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14. There were some also in that Church, as well as in the Church in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that held the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45978:13"/>
ver.</hi> 6. &amp; 15. Which by Ecclesiastical Writers is delivered to have been Community of Wives, as well as of other things. And sure enough it was some great Evil, which Christ exprest his Hatred of. There was in the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> the Woman <hi>Iezabel,</hi> seducing (like <hi>Balaam</hi>) to Fornication, &amp;c. Not to fetch instances out of every Church, there were some that walked after the Flesh, in the Lust of Uncleanness, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. These were presumptuous, self-willed, despised Government, and spake Evil, not only of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, but of things they understood not, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Yet these were great sticklers for Liberty: for <hi>They promised Liberty</hi> to such as they allured, being <hi>themselves</hi> mean while the <hi>Servants of Corruption,</hi> ver. 19. Of whom a more full description may be seen in the rest of that Chapter, and in the Epistle of <hi>Iude.</hi> Thus it was in those times. How it hath been in our time, since the Lord first gathered us to be a peculiar People to himself, they must have had but little Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or made but little Observation, that need to be informed. How many that have walked for a while (some for some years) with Friends in the Profession of Truth, have turned their backs thereon, and gone off, some into the Sea again, some into Nets! What has been the general pretence of these, but want of Liberty? the way of Truth was too strait for them? they wanted a broader way. How many, even of them that retained the Profession of Truth, have slept aside, some into one odd thing, some into another, under pretence that they had Freedom so to do? Did not they that ran out in <hi>I. Perot's</hi> business, plead being left to their Freedom, to their Liberty? They did so: and by that Plea were some, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, betrayed into that snare. Now since it is evident, by the Instances given, that in the true Church in all times, there have been (as to outward Profession) Bad as well as Good, wrong as well as right, what can be more reasonable, than that there should be in the true Church such a Power, as may enable those that are right to acquit themselves, their Principle and Profession from the Disorders, of whatsoever kind, committed by them that are wrong; which they can never do, if those that are wrong may exempt themselves from being called to account, and reproved for their Disorders, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that what they have done, they had Liberty and Freedom in themselves to do.</p>
            <p>Now this hath happened, in a great part, through a misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45978:13"/>
and misapplication of true Spiritual Liberty. For though all that have received, and are indeed guided by the Grace of God and Spirit of Truth, are to be left to it, to act for God in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Freedom that it gives. Yet for any to infer from thence, that every one that pretends to the Grace of God and Spirit of Truth, (though it be too apparent that they are not subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) must be left to that Freedom, which they call (and in one sense rightly enough) their own, to that Liberty which they have set up in and for themselves, though it leads such to thwart, oppose, gain-say and disturb the rest of the same Society; this is not right, but (whatever else may be pretended) is both wrong it self, and an Inlet for that which is wrong. For the meaning of that Plea, that every one ought to be left to his Freedom, &amp;c. Is this, that none should be accountable, or answerable to the Church, or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are reputed to be of, for what they do, (that is not simply Evil, or Evil in it self, as the Adversaries in their Book distinguish) so that, although what they do be disorderly, and that which either directly, or by Consequence, tends to bring scandal, and trouble upon the whole Society; it is enough to stop the Churches Mouth, for such an one to say, I have Liberty and Freedom in my self to do so or so. And thereupon the Church may not judge, may not reprove, may not blame such an One; but must be obliged to own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such an one as a Friend, a Brother in the Truth (though walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Truth) as a member of the Body (though acting against the Body.) This were to set up a false Liberty, to overthrow the true Liberty; to give Liberty to Particulars, and take it from the General: which to do, were contrary to Truth, and to true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For surely, how much Liberty soever a Part may claim, the whole may claim as much. And therefore, if each Particular hath Liberty to choose, or refuse things, according as they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the things are right or wrong (which it is fit they should:) Why should not the whole have like Liberty to receive, or refuse such Persons, with respect to Membership, according as they are perswaded that such Persons, so acting, are in, or out of, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in which the true Membership stands? But this Liberty the Church should be deprived and debarred of, if she were bound (as the Adversaries would bind her) to own and receive for members all such as make any Profession of Truth, though walking and acting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45978:14"/>
contrary to Her, and (as she believes) to Truth, under pretence that they walk and act according to their own Liberty and Freedom. He that would shun the Cross of Christ in any Testimony that Truth leads to, hath scope enough under this Plea to do it. He that, for advantage or fear, will break Christ's Command, and Swear, can say he hath freedom so to do, and is not perswaded in his own mind of the unlawfulness thereof. He that, to shun Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will pay Tythes to the Hireling-Priest; He that will Marry by the Priest, or take in Marriage one that is not in the Profession of Truth, hath the same Plea for his Shelter; and so in other Cases of Evil.</p>
            <p>This the Adversaries saw, but saw not how to Answer: And therefore in their 5th page, having said, There's but one Objection, and that is, that this (leaving all to act according as they are free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is to give Liberty to Evil; they add, <hi>Which we may speak to in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</hi> And so they shift it off in this place. And having thus given it the Go-by here, never give any direct Answer to it (that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) throughout their whole Book. In their 19th page they touch it, but presently start back, and slide off of it again. There they say, <hi>What can hinder the putting this in practice, but the Devil in the likeness of Truth, perswading this was to give Liberty to Evil</hi>? Then add, <hi>'Tis a mistake to think, this is to give Liberty to Evil, while our End, we are sure, bears witness to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They are sure! What Assurance doth their saying, they are sure give to others? Their witness-bearing, as it is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and for themselves, may perhaps reach no further than to themselves. But suppose Charity should extend it further, and on that foot it should be granted, that their End, or Intention, is not to give Liberty to Evil. Doth it therefore follow that that unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Plea, for leaving every one so to act, according as they are free and perswaded in their own minds, as not to be accountable for their actings, may not give Liberty to Evil? May not People have a wrong freedom, a freedom to do Evil, and a false Perswasion in their own minds, that that wrong freedom is a right one, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that God hath given them a manifestation of his Spirit to profit withal, if they do not (and it is too plain that too many do not) obey and follow the leadings of that good Spirit, that they may profit thereby? But what Answer do the Adversaries now give
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45978:14"/>
to that One Objection, which they took notice of in their 5th page, and then made a shew as if they would speak of it in another place? Truly none at all. But instead of answering it (which was reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be expected from them) they excuse themselves, but very poorly, from Answering: for after they have told us, They are sure their End is not to give Liberty to Evil, they add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>But to Answer All the Objections that may be made, as it would take up too much time, so perhaps we may not know all that may be advanced; so we shall Omit that, till we are better informed of them, as also, till more fitting Opportunity do occur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> A dull Come-off! Who, that were shameless, might not, at this rate, avoid Answering any Objection that lies hard upon them, by pretending it would take up too much time to answer all Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that perhaps they may not know all that may be advanced? They told us in their 5th page, There is but one Objection; and that is, That this is to give Liberty to Evil; and they made a kind of Promise to speak to that in another place. (Why did they not answer this One Objection, which themselves had advanced?) Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know not what to say to it, nor how to Answer that One Objection; they pretend it would take up too much time to Answer all the Objections that may be made, and that perhaps they may not know all that may be advanced. Is not this pittiful Shuffling? Is not this mean Trifling for men! for such men! for men so cryed up, as some of them are? <hi>Perhaps,</hi> say they, <hi>we may not know all that may be advanced.</hi> What then? should that hinder them from taking notice of what they did, or might know, of what was advanced? Did not the Book they pretend to Answer enumerate several Particular Evils, which the Enemy by that Plea (of leaving every one to act as he is free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is introducing a Liberty to, as Paying Tythes to Hireling-Priests; Marrying by the Priest, Declining a publick Testimony in suffering times, or hiding in times of Persecution, Worshipping and respecting the Persons of men; and Observing the World's Holy-days and Mass-days (as they call them?) Why did they not Answer these that were advanced, as there phrase is? Did they want to be better inform'd, whether These are Evils or no? They could not but know, that most of these Evils have been closely charged, as the Fruits of that Spirit they are now joyned to. And their so slightly slipping over them now, is no good sign that they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45978:15"/>
clear and free from them. They boast indeed of Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; but distinguish not (that I observe) betwixt Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Civil and Religious, betwixt that which relates to the World, and that which more especially respects the Church of God. 'Tis true, they say in general words, p. 43. with respect to Lives and Conversations, <hi>Place your Iudgment upon what is Evil, and spare not, for there it will stand; for we plead not for Evil in any.</hi> And again, <hi>We grant that any may reporve Evil, and what is Immoral,</hi> &amp;c. p. 46. But their explaining Evil by the terms Immoral, and simply Evil (as in pag. 39. where they say, <hi>If Nothing that is simply Evil or Immoral, can be charged upon your Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. And in p. 44. <hi>Though nothing that is Immoral, or Evil in it self can be proved against them</hi>) shews they mean by Immoral, such open Prophaneness and Debaucheries as Human Laws correct. And so, notwithstanding their pretending Not to plead for Evil in any, their Plea may indulge and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance those Evils before mentioned, of paying Tythes to the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priest, of being married by the Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of marrying such as are out of Truth, yea, out of the Profession of it; yea, and of all the Disorders that heady and unruly Persons are capable of committing against Church-Society, by raising and fomenting Strife and Contention amongst Brethren, by drawing and gathering into Parties, Sides and Factions, by making Schisms, Rents and Breaches, by running into down-right Division, and open Separation. All which are Evils, and such Evils as the Judgment of Truth always was, is and ought to be placed upon. But seeing the Adversaries hide themselves under the Terms [Simply Evil, or Immoral] let me ask them more particularly, Whether it be not an Immoral Act for any one to deprive Another, by force or fraud, of his just Right and Property? They know what of this kind has been done by some of their own Party at <hi>Reading,</hi> and other Places, where they have forcibly kept Friends out of their publick Meeting-Houses, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Friends of their just and lawful Right and Property in those Meeting-Houses, contrary to all Right and Justice. Now though Truth's Judgment hath been placed, and doth stand and abide, upon this Evil, and upon the Authors and Abettors thereof; And though, being so undeniable in fact, and so gross in nature, some of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are ashamed, or afraid to plead for it: Yet which of them all has joyned with Friends in placing the Judgment of Truth upon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45978:15"/>
it, and upon them that are more immediatly guilty of it? Nay, do they not rather own and joyn with such as have been and are most guilty in this case, and receive such of them as are Preachers, to preach and pray amongst them?</p>
            <p>In their 5th page, they take a slight notice of the latter part of the Author's Answer, where he said, But if thou pleadest thy Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against such things, yea, Obstructest and Slightest such Good, Wholsom and Requisit Things (namely such things as are Holy, Just, Lovely, Honest, Comely and of good Report, as he had mentioned just before) thy freedom is naught, dark, perverse, out of the Truth, and against the perfect Law of Love and Liberty. In the reciting of which, I observe, they slip over these words [obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and slightest] as being Conscious perhaps that they have done so, and have no colourable defence to make for their so doing. Their Answer to the rest is this, <hi>This is still to the same Tune; here is a Iudge implied, but not set forth; 'tis not</hi> (say they) <hi>the Spirit of Truth, but some outward thing, whatever it is</hi>; and they add, <hi>We know not where he will fix,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> To the same Tune! They were in a jolly Humour sure, when they borrowed this Phrase from the Ballad-mongers. So pag. 17. they say, <hi>Shall we Pipe to the same Tune for Company.</hi> Truth would have taught them more Gravity: and it is to be hoped their beguiled Proselites will observe and take notice what a frothy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they are guided by. But though they say, The Judge is not set forth, but only implied; and by the<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> saying [Whatever it is] they imply they know not what it is; nay, they confess in plain Terms; they know not where he will fix: yet, in this <hi>tuning</hi> strain they as boldly as blindly (that is confessedly not seeing, or knowing what it is) adventure to affirm, 'Tis not the Spirit of Truth. By which the Children of Truth know, that the Adversaries, in this Judgment, are out of Truth.</p>
            <p>In the same airy Vein they go on thus, <hi>But since we know not where he will fix, to say no more, 'tis dark to be sure</hi>; Then (as if, on a sudden, they would grow very kind) <hi>to help it all we can,</hi> say they, <hi>we shall thus far grant, there are some Outward things so far Essential to true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as those that do contrary to them may be detected of Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> If it was dark before, how much clearer is it now? For they mention not a Syllable what these outward Essentials are. They
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45978:16"/>
complain of want of Certainty in the Book they pretend to answer: yet themselves leave it wholly uncertain what they mean by these outward Essentials. They suggest here, that in that Book things are laid down in a general way, in which (they say) Deceit or Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning often lurks. Yet sure, nothing could be laid down in more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, than they have here mentioned their outward Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; for what to lurk under, let themselves Consider, others judge.</p>
            <p>But they say, <hi>The things suggested as the Ground of Difference, are neither such Principles nor Practices as have been from our beginning, nor yet such things as can be truly said to be Essential to true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> I will not here Descant on their beginning, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness of the Expression would even invite to it. But I would know what things those are, that they say are suggested, as the Ground of Difference, and by whom they are so suggested. Are not these Generals designed for a shelter for something to lurk under? But suppose for the present, that the things they suggest, are sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested as the Ground of Difference, are neither such Principles nor Practices as have been from their beginning; what then? Is their Beginning the Boundary? the <hi>Nil ultra?</hi> Was there a Bar then set, a limitation to the illimitable Holy One, that Nothing, not then in Practice, should thereafter be ever brought into Practice, for the Service of the Church of Christ? But say the Adversaries (and they bid us Observe it) <hi>If the things suggested as the Ground of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, are not Essential things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet such things as have been from our beginning, then they can at best be but Circumstantial, or if you will, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial or Shadowy Things, and such things at best are but accidentaly good, that is</hi> (say they) <hi>as Persons are perswaded of them, and what is but accidentally good, may on the contrary be accidentally not good, and that is</hi> (say they) <hi>as Persons are dissatisfied with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 'Tis fit we should (as they desire) observe this: For I think there are many things observable in it. <hi>First,</hi> when they say, If the things suggested, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not Essential things, not yet such things as have been from our beginning, they can at best be but Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial; They plainly imply, that if those things had been from their beginning, they might have been more than Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, although they had not been Essential things. An Absurdity that, at best, must needs spring from conceited Ignorance. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45978:16"/>
By making the terms Circumstantial, or Ceremonial and Shadowy, <hi>Synonomous,</hi> or of the same signification, They render all outward Performances of Gospel-worship, contrary to the nature of it, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy; since no outward Act of Worship ever was, or ever can be performed without Circumstance. If the other Passage shewed their Ignorance, this, I think, will not commend their knowledge, at least, in divine matters. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> their saying such things are at best but accidentally good, savours of no good understanding or sense. But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In making such things accidentally Good, or not Good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Persons are perswaded of them, or dissatisfied with them, they have exceeded common Weakness; and to speak favourably, draw too near to the borders of <hi>Ranterism.</hi> For it was the grand No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ranters,</hi> and the source of their immodest and unclean Practices, that things were no otherwise Good or Evil, than as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons apprehended or thought them to be so: Only they extended it more generally: These seem to restrain it to such things as they call Circumstantial or Ceremonial, which yet they confound with Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy. But let me ask these Adversaries, Do ye think or hold, that this was always so; or only so now of late, since your Beginning (as ye speak) that is, were all Circumstantial things, or (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your notion) Shadowy things, always, in all times, and places, good, or not good, according as Persons were perswaded of them, or dissatisfied with them? Or are they so now of late only: There were many Circumstantial Things attendant on the Service of God under the Legal Dispensation and Shadowy Things, not a few. Were those things then good, or not good, according as Persons were perswaded of them, or dissatisfied with them? Or would a Persons being dissatisfied with any of those things then, have freed him from the Obligation of them? That had been a ready way indeed to have made void the Commandments of God. But even the Rebellious <hi>Iews,</hi> as bad as they were, never (that I remember) made such a Plea. Will ye rather chuse to say that, though it was not so then under the Law; yet it is so now, under the Gospel? But since ye have resolved Circumstantials into Shadowy things; what will ye do with them under the Gospel? Will ye assert shadowy things to be Good now, under the Gospel, if Persons are perswaded they are so? Be perswaded to consider better of it first. At this rate, the same Act of Religious Worship may, at the same time, and in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45978:17"/>
the same Assembly, be good to one, not good to another of the same Society, according as they differently esteem it. It will, on this ground, be as good for men to offer up publick Prayers to God with their Hats on, if they are so perswaded and satisfied, as to Pray with their Heads uncovered. For ye shall find, if ye look rightly into it, that this Notion of yours is but a fresh Sprout from the old Root of the Hat-Controversie in <hi>Iohn Perot's</hi> time. I have some cause, more perhaps than every one of you, to understand this Wile of the Enemy, having been in some degree beguiled by it then. In humble reverence of Soul, and with thankfulness of Mind, I pay this Acknowledgement to the God of my Deliverance, who was graciously pleased to shew me this Snare, and deliver me out of it. And in tender pity, I warn you of it.</p>
            <p>Another strange Notion the Adversaries have immediatly after these, in their 5th and 6th pages, where speaking of things which they say, They believe concern only the outward Court; They add, <hi>Which God hath left unmeasured, on purpose that Christians might never differ about them.</hi> This they repeat in their 9th page, saying, <hi>We are sure that he hath left such things on purpose unmeasured, that men might agree.</hi> As if what God had measured, he had therefore mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that <hi>Christians</hi> might differ, that men might not agree. For their affirming that God hath left some things unmeasured, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Christians</hi> might never differ about them, implies (by that way of contrary arguing which they so much use) that God hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured some things on purpose that <hi>Christian</hi> might differ about them. But as that were wicked to imagin: So I wish the discovery of so many absurd and false Notions as have here (in a few Lines) dropt from them, may awaken them and others, to consider what Spirit it is they are guided by.</p>
            <p>When they say, they believe, nay, are sure, God hath left such things (as they except against) unmeasured, on purpose that Men might agree, that <hi>Christians</hi> might never differ about them; I take their meaning to be, that God hath therefore left such things free, that some may practice them, others not practice them, according as either sort like or dislike them, without taking offence at each other therefore. Now if this be their meaning, this is of force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves, to clear the things they except against from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Evil or harm in them: for if there were any Evil or harm in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45978:17"/>
them, God would not leave any of his People at liberty to use them. And then all the Clamour and Out-cry, Division and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the Adversaries have made, is against things which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Truth say have any Evil or harm in them.</p>
            <p>In their 10th page, the Adversaries take up another Question out of the forementioned Book, which in that was thus laid down. <hi>But must I conform to things whether I can receive them or no? Ought I not to be left to the Grace and Spirit of God in my own Heart?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, to the <hi>first</hi> part of the Question, <hi>Nay:</hi> to the last, <hi>Yea.</hi> This Answer they seem to like: for they say of it, <hi>This is fairly said we must confess.</hi> But as fairly as it was said, they unfairly alter it, in taking upon them to explain it; for reciting the Author's Answer, <hi>viz.</hi> to the first part of the Question, <hi>Nay</hi>; that is, say they, <hi>Thou ought not to receive things against Truth.</hi> Whereas the first part, nor any part of the Question was not, <hi>Ought I to receive things against Truth</hi>? But it was, <hi>Must I conform to things whether I can receive them or no</hi>? Betwixt which Answer, and their explanatory Gloss, there is no small difference, both in words and matter. For it is one thing, Not to conform to things, because I cannot receive them (which may be, and yet the things be agreeable to Truth, and the fault in me only, that I am not in that which would lead me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.) And it is another thing, Not to receive things against Truth, which none ought to receive, and which it would be Evil in me to receive and conform to, if I could. But though in this they deal not fairly by the Author; yet by his Answer it is evident, that none is put upon Conforming to any thing that they cannot receive: But all are left to the Grace and Spirit of God in their own hearts (which is that that leads into the true Spiritual Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defined) though not to the freedom of their own unruly Wills, to oppose, obstruct, revile and vilifie those things, which they say They cannot receive, and them that have received and do practice them: muchless to rend, divide, separate from them, and yet break in upon them, and force upon them their Preaching and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if they were still of them, though apparent Enemies to them.</p>
            <p>But though they seem to approve his Answer at the first, yet they soon find fault with it again; because they think there is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Provision made by him for withstanding the things, if the fault be in them. <hi>Repl.</hi> How may we suppose he could admit the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45978:18"/>
fault to be in the things, which he prae-suppos'd to be good, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, and requisit? Or how can the fault be in the things, if God has left them, as the Adversaries say, unmeasured; that is (if I reach their meaning) free for his People to practice, or not practice. He would not leave any thing for some of his People to practice, which others of his People could not practice from a fault in the thing it self. And although from the Author's asking, Is the fault in the thing themselves? They would gladly catch an advantage to infer, that <hi>It is fairly implied, if not granted, that the fault may lie on the side of the things brought in</hi>; yet they fall short in that also: for Interrogatvies have sometimes the force of Negatives. The Apostle, when he said, <hi>Is there Vnrighteousness with God</hi>? Rom. 9.14. did not imply, muchless grant, that there might be Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with God. But they add, that <hi>The fault doth lie in the things, for any thing he hath said to prove the contrary.</hi> Repl. It seems they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a proof of Negatives. That were needless. 'Tis enough that they have not proved a Fault in the things they reject and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise. When they attempt that a disproof thereof, I believe, will not be wanting. They say, <hi>We may conclude such as bring them in</hi> (viz. the things they say are suggested as the ground of Difference) <hi>are reputed Leaders.</hi> Repl. I say such as raised the Opposition at first, and made the Division thereby, and led into the Separation thereupon, were reputed, and were, Leaders among them. They add, p. 11. <hi>The Leaders may do more harm in bringing in things that are wrong, than others can do in Opposing some things that may in some sort be right.</hi> Repl. If this be true to any purpose, yet it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpose. The things they complain of for being brought in, they have never proved to be wrong, nor ever can; therefore there has been no harm done, by bringing those things in, as their Phrase is. But the harm has been done by the heady and unruly Opposition they have made against those things that are right. They say, <hi>The Leaders have caused the People to err, and the effect was, that the People led by them was devoured.</hi> Repl. This is rightly applicable to themselves: The Children of Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Light, see it, and lament over them. Their Leaders have caused them to err, and by following them, they have been led into that Separation, which, unless by Repentance they quickly return from, will certainly destroy them. Again, they say, <hi>The way to prevent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45978:18"/>
the danger is, by allowing freely Conviction and Perswasion to precede Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi> Repl. This is an evil Suggestion, by which they would insinuate, that Friends did press Conformity before Conviction and Perswasion: which is utterly false, contrary to our Principle, and contrary to our Practice. That it is contrary to our Principle, the Book and place they here pretend to Answer, evinces: For there the Author, having put the Question, <hi>Must I conform to things whether I can receive them or no?</hi> Answers directly and positively, Nay; And even so they cite his words. In the same place also he says, <hi>Thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly; yet thou art to consider, why thou art ignorant, and what the cause of such Ignorance may be.</hi> What can be plainer! That it is contrary to our Practice also, is matter of Fact. Let the Adversaries therefore prove if they can, that Friends press Conformity before or without Conviction.</p>
            <p>They go on in their 11th page to quarrel with another expression of his, which is this,
<q>It is a dangerous Principle, and pernitious to true Religion, and which is worse, it is the Root of Ranterism to assert, that nothing is a Duty incumbent upon thee, but what thou art perswaded is thy Duty.</q>
Against this they make a great noise. <hi>This,</hi> they cry out, <hi>is as removing a Bounder or Land-mark. 'Tis,</hi> they say; <hi>of the same nature with Conviction or Perswasion; for if</hi> (say they) <hi>Conviction and Perswasion is to go before Conformity in our duty to God and true Religion, then nothing can be a duty incumbent upon us, but what we are perswaded on: But if duty to God and true Religion must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before convinced or perswaded to it, then something may be a duty incumbent upon us, that we know not, or are not perswaded on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here they confound Duty with performance of Duty or Conformity to Duty; which are different things, and ought to be distinguished: and their not distinguishing them has puzzled their heads. Performance follows Duty; not Duty, Performance. Duty, in order of time, as well as in the nature of things, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Performance, as the Cause is before the Effect. Now the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here taxed for a dangerous Principle is not, that nothing can be performed as thy Duty, but what thou art perswaded is thy Duty: But, that nothing is a Duty incumbent on thee, but what thou art perswaded is thy Duty. Though it be true, that a man cannot rightly perform a thing as his Duty, which he is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded is his Duty: yet it doth not thence follow, that it is not his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45978:19"/>
Duty, because he is not perswaded it is his Duty. It is not simply want of perswasion or conviction, but want of sufficient means for perswasion or conviction, that can exempt any man from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Duty. The <hi>Iews,</hi> though they had sufficient means for conviction, or perswasion that it was their Duty to own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ for the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> yet were not perswaded that that was their Duty; was that therefore not a Duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? <hi>If I had not come, and spoken unto them,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>they had not had sin: But now they have no Cloak for their sin,</hi> Joh. 15.22. Why so? They were never the more perswaded of their Duty for his speaking to them. Well, but they had sufficient means to have been perswaded, had they not resisted it. We read of some of old, that of some things were <hi>willingly ignorant,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.5. Of others, before them, that said unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy Ways,</hi> Job 21.14. Unlikely were these to be perswaded of Duty. Was therefore no Duty incumbent on them? This were a ready way indeed for men to discharge themselves of all Duty, if through negligent Carelesness, or wilful resisting, they harden themselves against Conviction. But as that is a dangerous state; so this is a dangerous Doctrine: And the endeavours the Adversaries use to justifie and establish it, render their Bottom the more justly to be suspected.</p>
            <p>Now let us see what Mediums they use to maintain this Doctrine or Principle, that nothing is a Duty incumbent upon one, but what he is perswaded is his Duty; <hi>If,</hi> say they, <hi>to assert or believe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a Duty incumbent upon us, but what we are perswaded on, be in its self a dangerous Principle, pernitious to true Religion, and what is still worse the Root of Ranterism, then the Saying that stands against this must be as Good as that is Evil; that is, it must be a Safe Principle, propitious to true Religion; and which is still better, it should be as the Root of all Good to men: for we conceive, the Root of Ranterism is as the root of all Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> Here they run a Ground again, by tampering unskilfully with Logical Conclusions. To shew them their mistake, I refer them to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. The Apostle there says expresly, <hi>The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil.</hi> Doth it therefore follow, or will they thence infer, that the Hatred of Money is the Root of all Good? They say, <hi>The saying that stands against this, must be as Good as that is Evil.</hi> Now the Apostle having said, <hi>The Love of Money is the Root of all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45978:19"/>
Evil</hi>; the saying that (according to their sense) stands against this saying of the Apostle, is, that the Hatred of Money is the Root of all Good. But I think they are not so much out of love with Money, as to assert that.</p>
            <p>They run on, pag. 12. in the same false way of Reasoning, thus, <hi>If to assert that Nothing is a Duty incumbent on us, but what we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded on, be the Root of Ranterism,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then, to avoid this Shoal, we must believe that something is a Duty incumbent upon us, that we are not perswaded on; and if we can thus believe, we must of necessity depend on him or others, to let us know what our Duty is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is the thing the Adversaries drive at, to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites believe, that Friends endeavour to draw People from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the Gift and Manifestation of God in themselves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on them for direction to, or information in their respective Duties. But this is utterly false, a wicked Slander and an evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to beget in such a Prejudice against Friends, that they may the more easily gain, the more strongly bind such to their Party. Nor is their way of Reasoning here fair or forcible. For supposing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, or may be a Duty incumbent upon a Man, which he is not perswaded to be his Duty; it doth not thence follow, that he must of necessity depend on some other Man, to let him know his Duty. This is no true Consequence. Though the Adversaries say, <hi>If we can thus believe, we must of necessity depend on him or some other, to let us know what our Duty is</hi>; yet there is no such necessity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The necessity such an one is under, is, to depend more truly on the Gift of God in himself, to attend more diligently and duly thereon, that so by and from that Manifestation of the Spirit, which God hath given unto him to profit withal, he may come to receive a right Sense, a true Understanding, a clear Discovery of the Mind and Will of God to him, with respect to that Duty or Thing, which hitherto, for want of such a due and diligent Attendance upon the heavenly Gift in himself, he has not had a clean sight of, a full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in, but has been in the dark and doubting concerning it. So that the supposing a Possibility for something to be a Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon a man, which he is not perswaded is his Duty, hath no tendency to draw him from a dependence upon the Gift of God in himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a discovery thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather to drive him some to it, to excite him to a more close and diligent attendance thereunto, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45978:20"/>
he may thereby come to see and know what yet he doth not. For, if the Adversaries do, yet none else, I think, will think that every man doth, at all times, so watchfully attend upon the Gift of God in himself, that he doth not at any time miss, or fall short of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind of God thereby. He, to be sure, thought otherwise, who said, <hi>God speaketh once, yea, twice, yet man perceiveth it not,</hi> Job 33.14.</p>
            <p>Now this Slanderous Suggestion of the Adversaries, is the more vile and wicked in them, in as much as they know it to be a Slander; and that very Book, which they pretend to Answer, doth plainly prove it so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in the 10th page of that Book (called, <hi>A brief Examination and State of Liberty Spiritual</hi>) to the Question, <hi>But if I do not presently see that Service in a thing, that the rest of my Brethren agree in, in this case what is my Duty?</hi> The Answer is, <hi>It is thy Duty to wait upon God in silence and patience, out of all fleshly Consultations; and as thou abidest in the Simplicity of the Truth, thou wilt receive an Vnderstanding with the rest of thy Brethren, about the thing doubted.</hi> Is this to draw from the Gift of God in ones self, to depend upon others for Guidance? Yet the Adversaries say, pag. 12. <hi>This</hi> (to wit, that something may be a Duty incumbent upon one, though he be not perswaded it is his Duty) <hi>is to impeach the Grace of God, and Spirit of Truth, to whose sufficiency so many Testimonies have been born, as not now sufficient to lead all into all Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> No such matter. They had no cause to suggest this; no ground for it. The Book they pretend to Answer denys it posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; for asking where the fault is, it says, pag. 3. <hi>Is it thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or thy Carelesness</hi> or <hi>If thy weakness, it is to be born with, and to be informed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thy carelesness, thou oughtest to be admonished.</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower in the same page it follows thus, <hi>So that though thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly, yet thou art seriously to consider, why thou art ignorant, and what the Cause of such Ignorance may be; Certainly it can't be in God, nor in his Gift to thee</hi> [mark that] <hi>it must then needs be in thy self</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. This is plain enough; and this they could not choose but see, picking up matter just before and after it; which shews they had <hi>a design to abuse</hi> Friends, and that makes their guilt the greater. Yet thus they go on, adding Falshood to Falshood. For in their same page they say, <hi>The Consequence of his arguing is to make us believe, that somthing is a Duty incumbent upon us that we do not know, and yet at the same time doth not let us know on whom we may depend.</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:45978:20"/>
Whereas (as I have cited before) he said expresly, pag. 10. <hi>It is, thy Duty to wait upon God, in silence and patience,</hi> &amp;c. So that he did let them know on whom they were to depend, namely upon God. Again, they insinuate as if their not understanding their Duty, were placed upon their <hi>Inability.</hi> Whenas they know, it is laid upon Carelesness, Disobedience, Prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this they do, on purpose to render Friends odious to their separate Party, as if we held that somthing may be a Duty incumbent upon one, which he <hi>cannot</hi> know, which he is in no capacity of being perswaded of; whereas indeed we hold no such thing. For what is <hi>impossible</hi> for a man to know, to understand, or be perswaded of, cannot be said to be a Duty incumbent on him. But what he <hi>may</hi> know, what he hath <hi>sufficient means</hi> to understand, what he is put into a Capacity to be convinced and perswaded of, by the Gift and Manifestation of the Spirit, which God hath given him for that end, may be a Duty incumbent on him, although he, through his Carelesness, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Non-attendance on the Gift, or prejudice against the thing, hath not received a certain Knowledge, Understanding, Conviction or Perswasion that it is his Duty. Had the Adversaries taken the matter plainly and fairly, as it was laid down in the Book they pretend to Answer. They had not thus run beside the line. But their manner is (as is obvious to an observing Reader) when they have pickt out a Sentence which they intend to oppose, to turn it this way and that way, to shift it to and fro, to alter the form of it, till they have varied it from the Author's Terms and Sense, and fitted it to their own turn and service, and then triumph over it. Thus (besides other Instances) they have done in this particular case. The sentence, as they first quarrelled with it, was this; <hi>It is a dangerous Principle, and pernitious to true Religion, and which is worse, it is the Root of Ranterism to assert, That nothing is a Duty incumbent upon thee, but what thou art perswaded is thy Duty.</hi> No sooner had they drawn this forth, but in their first modelling of it, they slip in the words <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi>; whereas <hi>Duty</hi> is one thing, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of it another, as I have noted before. Then in the next place, they frame up another Sentence, in terms (as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) directly opposit to this, and argue from one to t'other, till at length they have slipt it quite beside its first and right bottom, and set it upon a bottom of their own, an <hi>Inability</hi> to understand;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45978:21"/>
Whereas the sentence is not, that it is a dangerous Principle to assert that nothing is a Duty incumbent on thee, but what thou art <hi>in a Capacity,</hi> or <hi>hast means</hi> to understand or be perswaded of (for there were no danger in asserting that) But, its a dangerous Principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to assert, that nothing is a Duty incumbent on thee, but what thou <hi>art</hi> perswaded is thy Duty. There is some odds, sure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thou <hi>art</hi> perswaded, and thou <hi>mayst be</hi> perswaded, or thou <hi>art in a Capacity,</hi> or thou <hi>hast means</hi> of being perswaded. Yet the Adversaries, confounding these Terms, run on to the same effect. For, taking offence at the mentioning of seared, dark, dead Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the Book they pretend to answer (which the Author there mentioned, to set forth the dangerousness of asserting as a Principle, that nothing is a Duty incumbent on thee, but what thou <hi>art</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded is thy Duty: for, said he, <hi>The seared Conscience pleads his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty against all Duty, the dark Conscience is here unconcerned, the dead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is here uncondemned,</hi> &amp;c.) They say, p. 13. <hi>There is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt denying all Duty to God, and believing nothing a Duty but what we are perswaded on. The first,</hi> say they, <hi>deny all duty; the latter owns all Duty that can be known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> This is a high and bold, but not a safe expression. To own all Duty that can be known, is not an ordinary state. But let us see who this first is, that denys all Duty, and who the latter. The first, that which pleads Liberty <hi>against all Duty,</hi> is expresly term'd the <hi>seared</hi> Conscience, in the Book &amp; place the Adversaries pretend to Answer. The <hi>dark</hi> Conscience, and the <hi>dead</hi> Conscience, are not there charg'd with that, with pleading Liberty against <hi>all</hi> Duty, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <hi>all</hi> Duty. How then know the Adversaries but the <hi>dark</hi> Conscience may find a place among the <hi>Latter,</hi> among those that believe nothing a Duty, but what they are perswaded of? And how then will it hold that the Latter, they that believe nothing a Duty but what they are perswaded of, do indeed own <hi>all</hi> Duty, that can be known? Will the Adversaries, upon second thoughts, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly and consideratly assert, that <hi>All</hi> they who believe nothing a Duty but what they are perswaded of, do really own <hi>all</hi> Duty that <hi>can</hi> be known? I don't think they will. Nay I find they begin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to flag from it, within two lines: for they immediatly subjoyn thus, <hi>The first denying all Duty is Evil; but the Latter, as they own all Duty that they know, so,</hi> &amp;c. Here it is not (as above) <hi>all</hi> Duty that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45978:21"/>
               <hi>can be known</hi>; but <hi>all</hi> Duty that <hi>they know.</hi> If they own all Duty that they know; 'tis well: But there is some odds sure, betwixt owning <hi>all</hi> Duty that <hi>they know,</hi> and owning <hi>all</hi> Duty that <hi>can be known.</hi> But so little constant to themselves, so little consistent with thenselves, are the Adversaries, so loose and regardless of the terms they write in, that <hi>Do know,</hi> and <hi>Can know; Are known,</hi> and <hi>Can be known,</hi> seems to be alike with them. They add, <hi>As the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter own all Duty that they know, so may they wait truly to know what God is pleased further to shew.</hi> Rep. I grant they may so; I wish they would so; and it is that which All are exhorted to. But if they do not so, what then? What may be, may not be. And I suppose the Adversaries will grant, that as they <hi>may,</hi> so it is not impossible but that they <hi>may not</hi> wait so truly, as to know what God is pleased fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew. And then, if by reason of their not waiting, or not waiting so truly and rightly as to know what God is pleased further to shew, they fall short of, miss and deprive themselves of the knowledge of what God is pleased further to shew, or what God requires as a Duty of them; will their falling short through their own default, and missing the knowledge thereof, make it not to be a Duty to them? There were indeed times of Ignorance, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>at which God winked; But now he hath commanded All men every where to Repent,</hi> Acts 17.30. Why now? Because now the Gospel Light, the discovering Light, the universal Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, is arisen and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth; by the inshinings whereof every one is put into a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to know and understand what God requires of him.</p>
            <p>After all this, in pag. 14. They tell us, <hi>They believe where the Gift of God is received to profit withal, and truly adhered to, nothing is a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent upon such, but what they are perswaded on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here now they have given it another stretch. What was spoken with direct relation to a state of Carelesness, Disobedience, Prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or a seared, dark, or dead Conscience, they apply to such as have received the Gift of God to profit withal, and truly adhered thereto; and make their Inference from that misapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>What they speak, pag. 13. concerning Circumstantial things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called requisit things, on the score that we could not (as they say) know dead, dark and seared Consciences without them; hath
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45978:22"/>
nothing in it but an <hi>unsavoury Scoff,</hi> fit to discover what <hi>frothy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> it came from. But when they ask, in the same flouting manner, if <hi>those Requisit things that keep out or make known those dead, dark and seared Consciences,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can keep out Hypocrites</hi>: I must tell them, that is in one sense a difficult matter. For truly, I think, there can hardly be a grosser sort of Hypocrites found, than those that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving publickly printed Friends to the world to be <hi>Apostates, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, Introducers of Popery, Idolaters, setters up of Idols,</hi> with much more of that kind, and having upon that score (as they pretend) separated from us, and set up separate Meetings of their own, will and no yet come, whether we will or no, into our Meetings, in shew and pretence of joyning with us in Worship, and impose upon us to hear them Preach and Pray among us, and require to be received and owned by us therein, after they have so publickly disowned us, and departed from us. But though such Hypocrites will not keep out, but will thrust in, yet they cannot keep themselves from being discovered, but are known to be what they are.</p>
            <p>In their 15th page, they carp at an Expression, taken out of the 9th page of that Book which they pretend to Answer. It is this, <hi>A Saying may be true or false, according to the Subject Matters it is spoken upon, or applied to.</hi> They say, <hi>We believe he has missed the Truth there.</hi> And repeating it, pag. 44. they say, <hi>That we believe is a mistake; for we think Truth's Testimonies are not false, because some may misapply them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> The Author's words are not, that Truth's Testimonies may be true or false, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, that a Saying may be true or false, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now we know every Saying is not Truth's Testimony. And yet, even that which is a true Testimony when spoken of or applied to a right Subject, may not be a true Testimony, when spoken of or applied to a wrong Subject. When the Apostle said, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have kept the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Tim. 4.7, 8. This was a true Testimony, as spoken of or applied to him. But this same saying, if applied to or spoken of <hi>Iudas, Demas,</hi> or any other Apostate or wicked Person, would not have been true, but false. But though they Cavil at this saying from him, yet they could be content the same fort of Expression should pass for Truth from them, when they thought to serve their own turn by it. For in their 4th pag. blaming his Answer to that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45978:22"/>
Question, which he said was true in a sense, they say it is so far true, that if it can be <hi>wrong</hi> at all, 'tis only in a sense, and that is only <hi>when misapplied.</hi> Misapplying then it seems, can make a Right saying Wrong, when they hope to get some advantage by it, else not. Doth not this shew both great Partiality, and a captious mind? So also, they wrangle much about that Expression, <hi>The Root of Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terism</hi>; Whereas they might easily have seen it to be a Metaphorical or Figurative Speech, to shew that that Assertion was a Radical or Fundamental Principle or Doctrine of the <hi>Ranters,</hi> from which (as Fibres from a Root) other erroneous Tenets did sprout forth and grow up. But this shews their propensity to Contention and Quarrelling.</p>
            <p>Now that it may most evidently appear, that all this Out-cry against the Author, and Clamour against this Passage in his Book, as tending to bring in blind Obedience, and draw from a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, to a Dependance upon Man, for discovery of Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is without ground, and that his Book hath not given them any colourable Occasion for it; but that they have wickedly perverted, and wrested both his words and meaning in that Passage: I desire the Reader more particularly to observe that Passage, and consider the Occasion, scope and drift of it. For the Occasion, it is manifest it was written with direct relation to the <hi>Careless</hi> state, to those who, through Heedlesness and Inadvertency, neglect and disregard the divine Gift in themselves; and so, for want of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereunto, are ignorant of its motions, and what the Lord by it requires of them. For having put this Question, But <hi>must I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to things whether I can receive them or no</hi>? and answered directly and flatly, <hi>Nay</hi> (which positively excludes blind Obediences:) the Author thereupon puts the Questionist to consider what the Reason is that he cannot receive them, that so he may find where the Fault lies, whether in himself, or elsewhere. Therefore he subjoyns, <hi>Is the fault in the things themselves? Are they inconsistent with Truth, or will not the Truth own or assent unto them?</hi> As much as to say, If thou canst make appear that thou canst not receive them, because the things themselves are faulty, as being inconsistent with Truth, then thou wilt appear clear in not receiving them. But if thou canst not rightly lay the fault upon the things themselves, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether the fault is not in thee, that is to say, <hi>Is it thy Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45978:23"/>
or thy Carelesness? If thy weakness, it is to be born with, and to be informed; if thy Carelesness, thou oughtest to be admonished</hi>: for though thou mightest have acquitted thy self, if thou couldest justly have laid the fault upon the things themselves, as inconsistent with Truth; yet thou canst not clear or acquit thy self by laying the fault upon thy Ignorance, if thy Ignorance proceed from, or be occasioned by thy own Carelesness. And because some have entrench't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their own Ignorance, and thought themselves secure from Obligation to Duty, under a Plea of want of sight; therefore to excite such to a closer Inquiry, to a stricter Search, to a more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent waiting upon the Lord, for a clear discovery and sight of his will, the Author there adds, that <hi>It is a dangerous Principle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to true Religion, and which is worse, it is the Root of Ranterism to assert, that nothing is a Duty incumbent upon thee, but what thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded is thy Duty.</hi> And to evince the dangerousness of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and shew in particulars the Perniciousness of this Principle, He adds, <hi>For the seared Conscience pleads his Liberty against all Duty, the dark Conscience is here unconcern'd,</hi> (reckons its Darkness, its Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, it was want of sight and Conviction, a sufficiet defence and excuse, and so concerns it self no further) <hi>the dead Conscience is here uncondemned, unless this Distinction be allow'd of, that there may be an Ignorance or an Insensibility from Inability or Incapacity, or a dark Education</hi> (which he comprehended before under the word Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) <hi>and an Ignorance and Insensibility from Carelesness, Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Prejudice,</hi> &amp;c. Hence it is most apparent that this Passage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the careless, disobedient, dark Ones, who make darkness their refuge, want of sight there shelter. To such it is said, by way of Reproof and Admonition, It is a dangerous Principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to assert, that nothing is a Duty incumbent upon thee (thou care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, disobedient, prejudiced, dark One) but what thou (who, by thy own Carelesness, Disobedience or Prejudice, hast brought Darkness upon thy self) art perswaded is thy Duty. Now this being the plain and clear import of the place, it is not without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and great Injustice that the Adversaries have strained, and applied this so such as have received the Gift of God to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and have truly adhered thereunto. Then, as to their Suggestion that the Author's drift, and the tendency of his Discourse, was to lead into blind Obedience, and from a dependence on God, it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45978:23"/>
utterly groundless. His own words prove the contrary, not only (as I noted before) in saying positively <hi>Nay</hi> to the Question, Must I conform to things whether I can receive them or no? But also, when in the same page, and on the same subject, he says expresly afterwards, <hi>Thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly.</hi> This fully shuts out blind Obedience. And so far was he from drawing to a Dependence on Man, for sight or understanding in point of Duty, that he expresly says, pag. 9. <hi>The People of God ought to be left to the Guidings of the Spirit of God in themselves.</hi> And pag. 10. <hi>It is thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to wait upon God in silence and patience, out of all fleshly Consultations, and as thou abidest in the simplicity of the Truth, thou wilt receive an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with the rest of thy Brethren about the things doubted.</hi> These are Evidences plain enough: Yet because the Testimony of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is accounted of great force, and unexceptionable, take here, for an over-plus, the Adversaries own Confession in the case, p. 16. where, of the Author of that Book they are so offended at; they say, That he desires all should be guided by God's Spirit, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Now, if they believe this of him, what, Reader, may we believe of them, who have raised all this Noise and Clamour against him, charging him that he would bring in blind Obedience, frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into blind Obedience, and lead to a dependence on himself or some others; and yet now, after all this, confess they believe, <hi>He desires all should be guided by God's Spirit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding they say they believe thus of him, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently blames him again, p. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. for <hi>limiting it</hi> (as they say) <hi>to that one way, with respect</hi> (as they apprehend) <hi>to Shadowy or Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again, and frequently in their following Discourse, they run into their former Error, confounding Shadowy with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial and Circumstantial things, as if they were all alike, and had all but one and the same signification; thereby rendring (in their sense) all Circumstantial things Shadowy things: which to be a great mistake, and such an one as would make all outward Acts of Gospel-Worship, contrary to the Nature of the Gospel, shadowy, I have shewed before. Yet upon this Shadowy Notion of theirs, they take upon them with Confidence to pass Judgment upon him, that <hi>Though he may have received a measure of God's Spirit, yet in plain he is not truly born of it.</hi> And this, methinks, is pretty briskly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45978:24"/>
done for such, whose common Theam and Cry was wont to be, <hi>Iudge not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next whereas the Author of that Book they Cavil at in Answer to that part of the Question which was, <hi>Ought I not to be left to the Grace and Spirit of God in my own Heart</hi>? had answered <hi>Yea; That is of all things most desirable, since they are well left that are there left; for there is no fear of want of Vnity, where all are left with the one Spirit of Truth; They must be of one mind, they cannot be otherwise:</hi> To this the Adversaries say, <hi>That those that are truly left with the one Spirit of Truth, must and will agree, we grant; and therefore, where difference is carried on to the breach of Charity, one side at least, must be wrong, but which, ought in God's fear to be inquired, the greater Number cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here they grant that those that are truly left with the one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>must and will agree,</hi> and yet at the same time suppose they <hi>will differ</hi>; and which is more, that they <hi>may differ,</hi> and yet neither side be wrong, if the difference be not carried on to the breach of Charity. How they will reconcile these their different Notions, I know not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But since they yield that one side at least must be wrong, where difference is carried on to the breath of Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and Friends be looked into, and inquiry made, in God's fear, on which side the Breach of Charity began, that it may thence appear (according to their own Proposition) which side is wrong. And in this Disquisition, we will not expect any advantage from being the greater Number; though they may give us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave to put them in mind, that when and where an Argument from the greatest Number, with respect to particular Places, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie on their side, they have not failed to urge it. Now in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a right understanding, how Charity came to be broken in the carrying on of this Difference, it should be remembred, that when some things were recommended to the Churches, relating to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Discipline, in order to prevent such disorderly and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Practices, as under an abuse of our Principle of true Christian Liberty, a Spirit of Looseness and Libertinism was introducing, some shewed themselves dissatisfied therewith, and unwilling to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the use thereof, pretending that they did not see the service of the things recommended. Though this Plea was seen to proceed from weakness in some, and want of a true watchfulness unto, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45978:24"/>
waiting upon the heavenly Gift in themselves, which would have given them a true sight and sense, as it did their Brethren, both of the want, and of the usefulness of the things recommended: yet while they kept quiet, out of Contention and open Opposition, Friends tenderly bore with them, and carried themselves Brotherly towards them, endeavouring in the love of God, as occasion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to open and inform their Minds in the things, concerning which they profest to doubt. But long it was not ere they, abusing the tenderness of Friends towards them, grew high and heady, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and quarrelsome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> endeavouring publickly, and labouring much in private to gather into a Faction, and make a Party. Which when they had in some measure effected (having, by evil Surmises and false Reports, betrayed and misled many young Convinced Ones, and some that were but weak in Judgment, as well as pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up others that went discontented, whose <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

This their unruly and turbulent behaviour, gave occasion to Friends to reprove them, and exhort them to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be quiet, and have regard to the Churches peace. And surely had they indeed had any regard to the love of their Brethren, to the peace of the Churches of Christ, to the Reputation of Truth in the world, or to the honour of that holy Name of the Lord, by which we are called, they would never have begun, much less have carried on a Difference, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

up separate Meetings of their own, for themselves and their Party to meet apart in, in separation from, and opposition to the constant settled Meetings of Friends, not only with respect to the outward Affairs and Business of the Church, but even with respect to publick Worship too: And in several printed Books and Papers (written by some, and industriously spread by others of them) pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the difference to the world, exposing Friends (as much as in them lay) to the Contempt and scorn of the Prophane, as <hi>Apostates, Innovators, Idolaters; setters up of Images, Idol-Prophets,</hi> possessed with the Spirit of <hi>Belial,</hi> and the like; and not only to the Government, but even to the Rabble also, as a <hi>treacherous Company, Introducers of Popery,</hi> and <hi>but one step from it,</hi> &amp;c. and that in a juncture of time, when the then present discovery of the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> had exasperated the Nation against all that were but suspected to favour that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. That this is the true state of the Case (though but briefly set forth) I appeal to all Friends that understand it, and hereupon leave it to all such to judge, in the fear of God, whether the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries be not they that have made this Difference, and carried it on to the Breach of Charity; and are therefore, according to their own Conclusion, WRONG.</p>
            <p>The Adversaries having granted in their 16th page, that those that are truly left with the one Spirit of Truth, must and will agree; they in the same page add, <hi>But that there must be an Identity of Opinion, as</hi> (say they) <hi>we think the School-men call it, that is a Sameness of Mind, and Oneness of Iudgment to Circumstantial, Ceremonial, or Shadowy things, is sooner said than proved, and savours more of Curiosity, than any real Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> It may perhaps be thought to savour more of Curiosity, or something else, as Vain-glory, <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> or a fond <hi>Affectation</hi> of being thought to have converst with <hi>School-men,</hi> than of any real necessity, or common Discretion, for them to tell us what the <hi>School-men</hi> call <hi>Sameness of mind,</hi> especially unless they could have done it upon better assurance than an [<hi>as we think.</hi>] They had better have kept in the School of Christ, where they might have learnt <hi>Sameness of mind,</hi> and <hi>Oneness of Iudgment</hi> with God's People in the things of God, than have puzzled their brains about <hi>Identity of Opinion,</hi> and made themselves ridiculous by Cracking of their Converse with School-men. But leaving them to their thoughts, and the School-men to themselves, they might have learnt from the Author of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45978:25"/>
Book they are so angry with, if it had pleased them to have taken notice of it, that there is a difference between <hi>Sameness</hi> of mind, and <hi>Contrariness</hi> of mind; between <hi>Oneness</hi> of Judgment, and <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of Judgments. But if I may tell them so, without offending them too much, the word <hi>Opinion</hi> (with respect to Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) is fitter for the School-men, th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n for any that would be taken for a <hi>Quaker.</hi> Nor is it aptly or properly expounded by the word <hi>Iudgment</hi>: For <hi>Iudgment</hi> implies <hi>Certainty,</hi> and should be <hi>Positive</hi>; whereas <hi>Opinion</hi> is but <hi>Suppositive,</hi> importing uncertain or doubtful Thought.</p>
            <p>They complain, pag. 16. that the Author of the Book they would Answer, hath not made <hi>a difference between Circumstantial things, and such as are truly Essential.</hi> Yet they themselves have not yet told us what things they account truly Essential. They said indeed once, pag. 5 <hi>There are some Outward things so far Essential to true Religion, as those that do contrary to them may be detected of Error.</hi> But they have not particularlized what those outward things are, nor whether they intend them for <hi>absolute</hi> Essentials. But they are in the dark, and in Confusion, and no wonder, having kickt against the Light, and that wholsome Order which the Children of the Light have in the Light received. They say, <hi>Though all that fear God must and will agree in things truly Essential, yet there is no necessity that they must agree in Circumstantial things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This seems to me as if they should say, All must agree in things Essential; but they may differ, disagree, wrangle, jangle, contend and fall to pieces as much as they will about Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things; <hi>There is no necessity that they must agree in them.</hi> Strange! But whence should this Liberty of disagreeing proceed? Are not all to be led by the One Spirit of Truth <hi>into all Truth,</hi> into Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials, as well as into Essentials? Or will the Adversaries say, that in Essentials indeed the Spirits Guidance is to be expected; but for Circumstantials, every one may choose for himself, and please his own humour? If they will grant (which methinks they should scarce care to deny) that into Circumstantial things all ought to expect, and may receive the Spirits guidance and leading, as well as into those things which they call Essential, will they then find any room for the Disagreement they contend for? Can any one of a sound mind think, that the one holy Spirit of Truth will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45978:26"/>
lead his Followers to contradict one another in Practice, any more than to contradict one another in Words? If all are led by the Holy Spirit, he will undoubtedly lead them to agree, not to disagree, in whatsoever he leads into. Of the Primitive Christians it is written, <hi>The Multitude of them that believed were of one Heart, and of one Soul,</hi> Acts 4.32. Was it only in such things as are accounted Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial? Or was it in all things then relating to Religion amongst them, even in those things that were rather Circumstantial than Essential? It may seem to be spoken more immediatly of those things: for it follows in the Text, <hi>Neither said any of them, that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Yet none, I suppose, will affirm that the Community they had of Goods and outward Substance was Essential to Religion: for then they that hold not that Community of Goods, would want an Essential part of Religion.</p>
            <p>In their 17th page, having surmised before, that some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial things have been over-valued they say, <hi>On the other hand, some, seeing this as a certain wrong, the Enemy hath aggravated the matter to make both wrong,</hi> &amp;c. Here they seem willing to own themselves faulty, provided they may fix some fault too upon those they design to asperss; But they may be supposed to understand <hi>their own Guilt,</hi> better than anothers. If they are truly sensible that the Enemy hath made <hi>them wrong,</hi> let them return to that which can make them Right. They add, <hi>It is our danger, and will continue until the Spirit of the Son of God be more plentifully poured forth upon us that can say, Father forgive them, they know not what they do: This</hi> (say they) <hi>is that which we want, and should truly wait for, that the great Deceiver, the Occasion of all Strife and Trouble among such as fear God, might be cast out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> That saying, Father forgive them, they <hi>know not what they do,</hi> if it be spoken according to Truth, and in the Spirit of the Son, can be spoken only of such as <hi>know not what they do.</hi> The <hi>Iews,</hi> of whom the Son of God so spake, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>knew not what they did</hi> in Crucifying him that came to save them. <hi>Paul</hi> bears them that witness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Now it is one thing, not to be able to say of Opposers, Father forgive them, they know not what they do, from a belief or perswasion that <hi>they do know</hi> what they do: And another thing, not to be able to say of Opposers, Father forgive them, they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45978:26"/>
know not what they do, from a want of the Spirit of the Son, which alone can inable in Truth to say so, though there be a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that the Opposers do not know what they do. Now this, it seems, is the state of the Adversaries; the want of the Spirit of the Son of God, plentifully poured forth upon them, that can say (of such as oppose them) Father forgive them, they know not what they do. <hi>This</hi> (say they) <hi>is that which we want, and should truly wait for, that the great Deceiver might be cast out,</hi> &amp;c. That this relates to themselves, appears by the Advertisement which they give at the end of their Preface, where they say, the word [<hi>We</hi>] may be understood in respect to those of the same mind with the Author of their Book. Their want of this, shews their Condition to be bad; their not truly waiting for it, shews it to be worse. And since they acknowledge, the great Deceiver, the Occasion of all Strife and Trouble among such as fear God, is not yet cast out, it is no wonder that he hath thus long <hi>deceived them,</hi> and yet doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, out of whom he is not yet cast, and through them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions so much strife and trouble to those that truly fear God, But, as if they had already forgot what they have here acknowledged, they in the next page say, <hi>As we can truly say, Father forgive them, they know not what they do, we are not without hope.</hi> But they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they think they can truly say that, while they want the pouring forth of the Spirit of the Son of God upon them, in and by which alone that can be truly said. But, blessed be God, Friends (whom these Adversaries oppose) have received the pourings forth of the Spirit of the Son of God so plentifully, as that they can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in say of many, whom the great Deceiver hath, through the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, deceived, and by Deceit drawn into the Separation with them, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though they here acknowledge the great Deceiver is not cast out, yet they say they hope <hi>his casting out is near: for</hi> (say they) <hi>there seems but one grand Remove to know the Mystery of Iniquity finished; and that is</hi> (say they) <hi>to know our habitation in God, who we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed hath appeared in us by his Light and Spirit.</hi>

               <hi>Rep.</hi> It seems then they do not know their Habitation to be in God now. But if they know not their Habitation in God, in what do they know their Habitation to be? Or do they not know where, or in what their Habitation is? Oh uncertain and sad estate! Our

Saviour Christ said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 65.6. <hi>He that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> If the Adversaries object that this is an high state, let them know, that all short of this <hi>is too low,</hi> the same Mouth having expresly said, vers. 53. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood; ye have no Life in you.</hi> The beloved Disciple said, <hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God,</hi> 1 John 4.16. Again, <hi>He that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him,</hi> chap. 3.24. And <hi>hereby,</hi> says the same Apostle, <hi>know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> chap. 4.13. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> dedicated two Epistles to the Church of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> which is <hi>in God the Father, and in the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> By all which it appears, that it is the proper state of God's People to have their Habitation in God, and that God's People then had, and did know their Habitation in him. And surely, I cannot but in Charity believe, that some of those that are in the Separation, have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known in some measure, an Habitation in God also. But not keeping in the true Love, but going out of that into the Enmity; not keeping his Commandments, but rejecting, opposing, scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, slighting, despising, reviling and vilifying them, and instead of Teaching others to keep them, discouraging and diswading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from keeping them, have (like the Angels which kept not their first Estate, or Principality, <hi>Iude</hi> 6.) left their Habitation in God; and now, by their own Acknowledgement, do not know their Habitation in him, who they have professed hath appeared in them by his Light and Spirit; but must have one grand Remove more, before they can come to know their Habitation in God again. O that all the Beguiled ones among them would weigh this well, and see and consider what their Separation hath brought them to, even to be destitute of an Habitation in God! Nay, if according to what they deliver in their 7th page, As man must be made a new Creature, before he can come into Christ, so must he travel through the whole Mystery of iniquity; <hi>In the last step of which travel,</hi> they say, <hi>the Mystery is finished</hi>: then, since with them the Mystery of Iniquity is not yet finished, but there is one grand Remove yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to know the Mystery of Iniquity finished) they are not, it seems, yet come in to Christ.</p>
            <p>In their 17th page they say, <hi>To make lesser things than Essential
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45978:27"/>
things Terms of Communion, we have observed to be a great Evil in others, and shall we cry it up as good in our selves?</hi> And in pag. 18. They speak of making <hi>Nothing Terms of Communion but Essential things.</hi> And something to like purpose they toucht before, p. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is, first, an evil Insinuation, to prejudice Peoples minds against Friends, as if Friends did set up this, that, or t'other thing, as Terms of Communion with us. Secondly, it is a plain Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Adversaries do not truly and rightly understand the Saints Communion, and the terms thereof. Amongst other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Societies, as the Communions are outward and visible, so the Terms of such Communions consist only in outward and visible things; as an outward verbal acknowledgement of Creeds, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an outward or actual Observance or Performance of such things as are reputed Ordinances, Duties, Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the confessing the former, and doing the latter of which, intitles any one to those Communions. But the Communion or Fellowship of the Saints in Light is another thing. For as the Dispensation of the Gospel is Spiritual, so the Communion or Fellowship which stands in the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5. is Spiritual also. The Apostles declares the Terms thereof to be <hi>walking in the Light,</hi> when he says, <hi>if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. As therefore the Communion of God's People is Spiritual, so the Terms of that Communion are, to receive the Holy Spirit, to be led by the Spirit, to walk in or after the Spirit, to obey the motions and requirings of the Spirit. So that it is not an acknowledgement of Doctrines, or an Observation of outward Practices, that can bring any one into the Fellowship or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the People of God (for the one may be in Words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the other in Act performed, by such as neither believe the one, nor regard the other.) But it is a being truly subjected to, and led by the Spirit of God, both to believe and confess to the Doctrines of Truth, and to take up and appear in those Practices which the Spirit of Truth leads into, that are indeed the true Terms of the true Spiritual Communion. And as a coming under the Government and Guidance of the Spirit of Christ, brings into Communion or Fellowship with the Church of Christ: So the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Government and Guidance of that Holy Spirit, the grieving, the quenching, or resisting of the holy Spirit in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45978:28"/>
shuts out of the Communion or Fellowship of Christ's Church. And as such a departure from the Guidance of the holy Spirit may be felt, and known by those that keep under the Spirit's Guidance, by the holy Unction, and that Spiritual Sense (so much at this day by the Adversaries set at naught) which the People of God do from thence receive, as the Lord is pleased to dispense it: so may it also be certainly and safely concluded, from either an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renunciation and Denyal of any of the Doctrinal Principles of Truth, or from an opposing, rejecting, slighting, or reviling of any Practice which the Church of Christ is by the Spirit of Christ led into. So that, though no outward things (whether Doctrines or Practices) are, or can be the Terms of true Spiritual Communion: yet the rejecting, opposing, despising and slighting such outward things, as the Church of Christ is by the Spirit of Christ, led into the practice of, and finds acceptance with God in, is a certain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering sign and token, that such Opposers are departed from under the leadings and Government of that holy Spirit, in which the Communion and true Christian Fellowship stands.</p>
            <p>In their 18th page, to suggest that Friends would use Violence as others have done, if they had more power, they say, <hi>Do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that was only as carried on to Violence; for they that omit nothing of that Power they have, who can believe, if such had more, they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it better.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This shews their Envy, but doth no more affect us, than it would the Church of Christ in all times. The Apostles, we read, and Primitive Christians did not omit to exercise that Power they had in reproving, rebuking, denying and testifying against such, in their times, as by loose and disorderly walking, or unruly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, turbulent Behaviour, disturbed the Peace of the Churches, and brought scandal upon the Profession. Such (persisting in their disorders) they declared not to be of them: Such (so persisting) we declare not to be of us. They desired no greater Power: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we. They, if they had had more Power, could not have used it to outward Violence: neither could we, if it were in our power. But what might be expected from the Adversaries, if they had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er equal to their Wills, who have already given so plain a poof of their propensity to Acts of Violence, that, having no lawful Power, they have <hi>usurped</hi> a Power to keep Friends by Violence, out of their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45978:28"/>
publick Meeting-Houses, wherein the Friends, so kept out, have a plain, undoubted, rightful, legal Property! Was it not a great piece of Folly, as well as Injustice, in them, to suggest such a thing against Friends, which they knew they had no ground for; when they could not but know with what an unavoidable force and stroke it would recoil upon themselves.</p>
            <p>In their 19th page they say, <hi>Do we think we have been the most true that have been since the Apostacy, which</hi> (say they) <hi>perhaps we have, as to Notion and Profession of the things of God</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They did well to say [<hi>We</hi>] that it may be known they speak this only of and for themselves, having, at the end of their Preface, directed us to understand the term [<hi>We</hi>] in respect to themselves. Friends have no need of such Advocates. The People of God, in scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> they who have received the Truth in the love of it, they who have obeyed the Truth in the manifestation of it, they who have kept their habitation in the Truth through the Power of it, can say <hi>beyond thinking,</hi> much more beyond thinking with a [<hi>perhaps,</hi>] that they have been (and, through the preserving Power of God, are) the most true that have been since the Apostacy, and that not only as to Profession of the things of God. but as to the true, living, experimental knowledge, injoyment and possession of the things of God. And before these Adversaries had turned their backs on Truth, and wandred from their Habitation in God, they too perhaps would, <hi>without a perhaps,</hi> have adventured to have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted this <hi>beyond thinking,</hi> and further than Notion and Profession only. But now we see how <hi>low they are sunk,</hi> that they can content themselves to say, <hi>perhaps</hi> we have been the most true that have been since the Apostacy, as to <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> of the things of God. <hi>Notion</hi> is a term they often use in their Book, but not very properly, with respect to the things of God: for <hi>Notion</hi> imports rather an uncertain <hi>Speculation,</hi> than a solid, certain, scientifical Knowledge, such as is fit to be had of Religious matters. And therefore Persons of speculative Fancies are often called <hi>Notionists,</hi> or men of high Notions. But these men, it seems, dare pretend at highest but to <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> of the things of God, to <hi>think</hi> they have <hi>perhaps</hi> been the most true that have been since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy. It seems then they do not think they have been the most true that have been since the Apostacy, as to Life, Power, Virtue, Sincerity,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45978:29"/>
divine Injoyments, experimental Knowledge in the things of God, Possession of the living Substance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, with them 'tis but a <hi>perhaps,</hi> that as to Notion and Profession they have been the most true that have been since the Apostacy. But undoubtedly, were they not now Apostatized from what some of them once have known and been, they would not have written in such a loose and unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible manner.</p>
            <p>In the same 19th page, they confound themselves again with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their own Notions; they say, <hi>We know 'tis writ, they shall come from the West, North, East and South, to sit down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom.</hi> (I know there's something written to this purpose; but where this is thus written, I know not.) Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they thus descant, <hi>Those certainly was not of one external Form or Order, as to Ceremonial and Shadowy things, yet we find they agree.</hi> (That, say I, is more than we can find from these: for rather than these will agree, they'l Oppose, Rail, Revile, Print against, Rend, Divide, Separate and Tear, if they could, all in pieces:) <hi>But,</hi> say they, <hi>perhaps some will say this</hi> (agreement of all these from the four Quarters) <hi>is in Heaven. Well,</hi> add they, <hi>what then? Must they not agree on Earth, that must agree in Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 'Tis fit no doubt they should; and 'twere well they would, that expect to come there. But if they must agree on Earth that must agree in Heaven, then pray consider, whether such an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Adversaries propose, p. 16 <hi>viz.</hi> that they must agree in <hi>some</hi> things, (such as they account Essential) but there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that they must agree in <hi>all</hi> things, will serve the purpose. Must the Agreement in Heaven be in <hi>some things only,</hi> and not in all? What shattered work would these Men make with their idle Notions Besides, is it not too ridiculous in these men, speaking of them that shall come from the West (for they may be allowed to begin where the Sun goes down, upon whom the Sun is already gone down) North, East and South, to sit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. to say, those was not of one external form and order, as to Ceremonial and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy things, and yet we find they agree, and apply this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Heaven? Do they think then that there are Ceremonial and Shadowy things in Heaven too, where many perhaps, if not most, of the things which they account Essential, will find no place? However, if (as they here, by a kind of affirmative Interrogatives,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45978:29"/>
deliver) they must agree on Earth, that must agree in Heaven: If God's will must be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven; then surely they must retract their Notion of a necessity of agreeing in some things (Essentials;) but <hi>no necessity of agreeing</hi> in other things (Circumstantials.) Is the will of God, think they, done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>by some, one way, by others, a clean contrary way</hi> in opposition to that? Their Comparisons help them not, but helps Truth against them.</p>
            <p>They go on for a while in a strain of Interrogatives, pag. 20. <hi>Is not Christ,</hi> ask they, <hi>the Head of all that is good, from the least breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fullest perfection</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> All that is good proceeds from God and Christ. But since Head and Members are Correlatives, and all in whom some little (not to say the least) breathings may be, are not yet come to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Body of which Christ is the Head, and brought into a Membership thereof, it seems not a clear and proper Expression to say Christ is the Head of all that is good, &amp;c. There may be good desires, and true (though weak) Breathings after that that is good, in many in whom Christ is not Head, but the evil one is head, and Christ as in the Sepulcher; the Seed, from which those Breathings spring, kept under, crushed down, pressed as a Cart is pressed with Sheaves, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. But among all those of whom Christ is Head ought there not to be an Agreement? Doth Christ, the Head, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or allow any of his Members <hi>to quarrel amongst themselves? to oppose one another</hi>? For some to slight, reject, deny and obstruct the work and service of the rest? according to the Doctrine laid down by the Adversaries, pag. 16. That in Circumstantial things (as they call them) there is no necessity that they must agree. These consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not that Christ's <hi>Coat was without seam,</hi> Joh. 19.23. a Tipe of Unity and <hi>Agreement</hi> even <hi>in Profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They go on; <hi>Doth not he own all that's of his own beegtting, every where, according to the degree of knowledge received? — And as Christ owns all that's good, shall not we own it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Yes; He doth own all that's of his own begetting, and so do his People. But he doth not own all those for his, and as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Body, in whom he hath begot some Breathings, neither do his People. For too many, in whom such Breathings are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, answer not the love of him that begot them, but by joyning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45978:30"/>
with the evil one, and doing that which is evil, stifle and quench those Breathings, and greive him that begot them. Therefore as Christ owns all that is good, so do his People: But neither he, nor they, own all those to be of him, and fellow Members with them, in whom there is some good thing. He has given of his good Spirit unto all, even to them that rebel against it. The Gift is good, and owned: the Rebellious bad, and disowned.</p>
            <p>They go on; <hi>Doth not he gather all the Good together in one, even himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> The Scripture no where saith so, that I remember. But it saith, Ephes. 1.9.10. <hi>He hath made known unto us the Mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself: That in the Dispensation of the fulness of times, he</hi> might <hi>gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven and which are on Earth, even in him.</hi> This Universal gathering is not spoken in the present Tense, nor of the <hi>present</hi> Time; but <hi>of the fulness of Times.</hi> Neither is it spoken simply of all the good, as they express it; but of <hi>all in Christ:</hi> All these, both in Heaven and one Earth, hath he purposed, in the fulness of time, to gather together in one.</p>
            <p>They go on; <hi>Doth he gather all Vniversally in every Nation that fears him, and work Righteousness, without respect to shadowy things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein they may differ, for those he hath left unmeasured on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that they might not hinder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And shall he not do it in one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> The Scripture doth not say, He gathers all universally that fear him, and work Righteousness, without respect to shadowy things. But the Apostle Petet saith <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34.35. <hi>Of a Truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of Persons: But in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted with him.</hi> This is without respect to <hi>Persons</hi>; not without respect to <hi>shadowy</hi> things: For they whose Righteousness stands in <hi>shadowy</hi> things, are not <hi>therein</hi> accepted with him. But alsuch as he gathers, in this his day of Gospel substance, if they were working Righteousness in shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy things before he gathered them, he gathers them out of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy things to the substance. Here the Adversaries shew Error upon Error. First, They hereby suggest, that such as fear Christ, and are gathered by him, may continue in shadowy things; which is contrary to the nature of the Gospel. This Error springs from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45978:30"/>
another (which it self springs from extream Ignorance) that all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial things are shadowy. Secondly, they say, that they that fear Christ, and are gathered by him, <hi>may differ</hi> (that is, as in pag. 16. they explain it, there is no necessity that they must agree) <hi>in shadowy things,</hi> as if Christ gave Liberty to his to differ, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, contradict, oppose one another in any thing. Thirdly, that he hath left those things unmeasured on purpose that they might not hinder (that is, not hinder their agreement.) As if those things would have hindred their Agreement, if God had measured them; and as if he did measure other things on purpose that they might hinder the Agreement of those about them, who were to practise them. Oh the darkness and blindness that is come over these men!</p>
            <p>They add, <hi>The true Church is here indeed, but not yet referrable to any society, with respect to outward Rules,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is the voice of the Enemy, that would detract from, and deny the work which God hath wrought, and brought forth by his Power, in this day of his Glorious Appearance; wherein he hath reached unto many, and by the Cords of his Love hath drawn many unto himself, and hath gathered them into an heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himself, and into an holy Society and pure Fellowship one with another in him. Now as the true Church is here indeed, so it is indeed <hi>referrable to this Society,</hi> and that too with respect to such outward Rules, as Christ, who is the Head of this Society, hath given for the well-ordering of such outward things, as relate to the well-being and preservation of the Society. But if (according to the Adversaries) the true Church is <hi>not yet referrable to any Society,</hi> with respect to outward Rules; what then will become of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves! Have they not hereby unchurched themselves? Or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Membership with the true Church? For do not they pretend to be a Society, and that too with respect to outward Rules? How then can they pretend to be of the true Church, which they will not allow to be yet referrable to any Society, with respect to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rules?</p>
            <p>Another Passage which they Carp at in the Book they pretend to Answer, is by them thus worded; <hi>To plead being left to the Grace of God against Vnity, is to abuse the very Plea,</hi> &amp;c. To this they say, <hi>The Drift of this Argument is like the rest, to gaine a presumptive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45978:31"/>
upon men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without true regard to Conviction or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> If the drift of this Argument (as they call it) be like the rest, then it cannot be to gain any dependence upon men, on any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whatsoever, without true regard to Conviction or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion: For that has not been the drift of any of the rest of the Arguments or matter in that Book. But the drift of that Passage, and of the rest also, was to draw from a <hi>feigned pretence</hi> of being left to the Grace of God, (as a Cloak of Evil, of any kind) to a real acquaintance with, subjection to, and dependance on the Grace of God indeed. This appears (not only from several other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in that Book, as, <hi>Thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly,</hi> page 3. And, <hi>It is thy Duty to wait upon God, in silence a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

For the Question being there put, <hi>Ought I not to be left to the Grace of God in my own Heart</hi>? The Answer there is, <hi>That is of all things most desireable, since they are well left, that are there left; for there is no fear of want of Vnity, where all are left with the one Spirit of Truth,</hi> page 4. This was far sure from a drift to gain a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Dependence upon Men, without true regard to Conviction or Perswasion. And therefore it is evident, that the drift of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, in suggesting this slander, is to prejudice unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against Friends, by misleading them into a wrong apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that Friends endeavour to draw them from the Divine Grace, and holy Spirit in themselves, to a dependence on men, to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as men shall direct them, without true regard to Conviction or Perswasion in themselves. But this is a foul slander upon Friends, and a gross abuse to the Readers: for indeed, the contrary hereof is most true. Friends as they have always done, so now, as much as ever, do direct all to the <hi>heavenly Gift,</hi> the <hi>saving-Grace</hi> that hath appeared, the <hi>manifestation of the Spirit in themselves,</hi> of it to learn, and on it <hi>to depend,</hi> for both Conviction and Conduct in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Performances. But, as on the one hand, they labour to bring every one to an acquaintance with this heavenly Gift in themselves, and a true dependence on it for Guidence by it: So, on the other
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45978:31"/>
hand, they caution all to beware, that they be not beguiled by the Enemy in themselves, (who forms Likenesses of heavenly things, on purpose to deceive and mislead thereby, and for the same end <hi>transforms himself into an Angel of Light,</hi>) and take him for their Guide and Leader, as too many have done, instead of the Spirit of Truth; and then demand to be <hi>left to the Grace of God in themselves,</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are <hi>gone from the Grace of God in themselves,</hi> and oppose the manifestations, operations, and productions thereof in others. So that the Controversy (rightly stated, and truly considered) is not about being left, or not left, to the Grace of God (for that all should be left to that, was never doubted, much less denyed, by Friends) but about being left, or not left, to that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the Grace of God, but indeed and in truth is not it; and by the fruits it brings forth sufficiently manifests, that it is not it.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>'tis true, to plead this against our understanding is an abuse of the Plea, and is little better than Heresie, but none can be an Heretick that truly fears God; therefore, to plead this against this or that thing, brought in by this or that Man, or by this or that Assembly, that we believe is wrong, is so far from abusing the Plea, that it may be a true using of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is a very loose and trifling way of arguing, having nothing cogent or conclusive in it. The Passage they oppose is this, <hi>To plead being left to the Grace of God against Vnity, is to abuse the very Plea.</hi> This was grounded upon, and drawn from an undenyed Proposition, that where all are left with the one Spirit of Truth, they must be of one mind, they can't be otherwise. Now from this Proposition, that All who are left with (that is, led by) the one Spirit of Truth, must be of one mind, it fairly and naturally follows, that for any to plead a being left to the Grace of God, and led by the Spirit of God in themselves, in order to countenance or defend a being of a <hi>contrary,</hi> opposite mind from the rest that are led by the Spirit of God, is to abuse the Plea; and to commit (as the Author of the Examination there says) the greatest Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to that very Doctrine of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that all should be guided by the Grace and Spirit of God in themselves: for the End of that Doctrine is Certainty; which the Author there confirms by several Scripture-Evidences, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19.

               <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Adversaries do not attempt to answer: but turn the matter from pleading this against Unity, to pleading it against Understanding, which, they say, is little be<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter than He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, and grant that to do thus is an abuse of the Plea. But can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be an abuse of the Plea, but using it against Understanding? What if any have <hi>so little</hi> understanding in the things of God, as to believe that God's People may be led by the one Spirit of Truth to disagree, act contrary to, and oppose one another in the things of God (as the Adversaries say, in their 16th page, There is no necessity that they must agree in things Circumstantial:) is not this to abuse the Plea, though it should not be done against Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but <hi>for want of Vnderstanding</hi>? For the Plea of being left to the Grace of God in ones self, is therefore said to be abused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause used to an End and purpose directly contrary to that, for which it was given. For the end for which it was given is to bring men into Unity, both with God (from whom the Devil, by Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, divided them) and with one another in the things of God, in whom is no variableness, nor shadow of turning. And therefore to plead being led by it, out of Unity, and against Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to abuse the very Plea. And surely, if they go not against their Understandings, they go much <hi>without Vnderstanding,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that because it is an abuse of the Plea to plead this against Understanding, <hi>therefore</hi> (for so they infer) <hi>to plead this against this or that thing, brought in by this or that man, or by this or that Assembly, that we believe is wrong, is so far from abusing the Plea, that it may be a true using of it.</hi> For here is not only no Coherence between their Premises and Conclusion: but a plain departing from the terms of the Proposition; which was a Pleading this (of being left to the Grace of God in themselves) against <hi>Vnity.</hi> Which word they wholly leave out, and instead thereof put in [<hi>to plead this against this or that thing, b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And if the Adversaries believe those things to be wrong, that doth not prove they are wrong; though it may prove their belief and themselves wrong.</p>
            <p>In their 21th page, They quote another passage out of the said Book, in these words; "I must say unto thee, Friend, what if thou wilt not be left unto the Grace and Spirit of God in thy self?
<q>(Here they break off with an, &amp;c. omitting the rest of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which in the said Book follows thus,) nor wait for its mind, nor be watchful to its Revelations, nor humble and quiet till thou hast received such necessary manifestations, but pleadest against the Counsel of the Spirit of the Lord in other faithful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, under the pretence of being left to his Spirit in thy self; by which means thou opposest the Spirit to the Spirit, and pleadest for disunity under the name of Liberty.</q>
Their Answer is, <hi>Then such do the thing that is extreamly Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> No doubt of that. But when they do so, what is to be done in the case? Are they to be left to their Liberty and Freedom in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing that is <hi>extreamly Evil?</hi> Is the Church bound to own them, receive them, acknowledge and admit them, not only for Members, but Ministers and Preachers, while they are doing the thing that is so <hi>extreamly Evil</hi>? Or in case they disturb her godly Care and Practice, and grow Contentious, and exalt their Judgment against her, (as the Adversaries have done,) hath she power from God to exhort, admonish and reprove them, and (if they persevere therein) in his Name to refuse any further fellowship with them, till they repent of their Evil, as, in the 10. <hi>pag.</hi> of the Book they pretend to Answer, is laid down, but not taken up, answered, or taken notice of by them, that I find.</p>
            <p>Having nimbly answered to the former Quotation, <hi>Then such do the thing that is extreamly evil</hi>; they immediately add, <hi>but on the other hand, what if they are left with the Grace and Spirit of God, which they may, or at least some; for any thing that he hath said.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> May they so? That's strange! They that will <hi>not wait</hi> for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45978:33"/>
the mind of God's Spirit, not be watchful to its Revelations, nor humble and quiet till they have received such necessary Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but plead against the Counsel of the Spirit of the Lord in other faithful Persons, under the pretence of being left to his Spirit in themselves, and so oppose the Spirit to the Spirit, and plead for Disunity under the name of Liberty; may they for any thing that he hath said (who hath said all this here, and more elsewhere) be left with (that is led by) the Grace and Spirit of God <hi>in this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But say they, <hi>What care has he taken? What remedy has he provided, that true Liberty and Freedom of Speech may be maintained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Let them shew, if they can, when or where true Liberty and Freedom of Speech hath been denied by Friends. That it hath been indeed by the Adversaries, may be proved, if need require. But it may well be supposed what sort of Liberty and Freedom of Speech they would maintain, by the <hi>Licencious</hi> Liberty they have taken, and used in speaking of, and against such Persons and things, as they dislike: a Liberty to <hi>rail</hi> at and <hi>revile</hi> those whom they call their Brethren, under the Names of <hi>Apostates, Innovators, Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Popery, Setters up of Im<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

This is the Liberty and Freedom they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto used, both in speaking and writing; how true, and fit to be maintained, let all, that live in Truth, judge.</p>
            <p>To the Author's Question, whether he may not exhort to the practice of what he is moved to press to the practice of; they An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>We graunt he may,</hi> &amp;c. Adding, <hi>It's not our Duty to obey him, because he says it, but because we know, or at least are perswaded, that what he says is true,</hi> page 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Neither that Author, nor any Friend besides, ever exhorted or desired (much less pressed as a Duty on any) to obey him, or to do any thing of a Religious concern, because he said it; but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes directed to that which would give every one a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Perswasion of the thing so exhorted to. There was therefore no need for the Adversaries to fence themselves against that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45978:33"/>
which was never offered them. But they delight, by such suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to insinuate evil surmises into the minds of their beguiled Proselites.</p>
            <p>In their 22. pag. They quibble upon the words [Common, and Universal:] for citing these words out of the Book they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Answer, viz. <hi>But therefore are not the Members of one mind and Iudgement, in common and universal matters, relating to the Church of God?</hi> They answer, <hi>There is not much doubt in this when truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; but we are to mind,</hi> say they, <hi>that we be not deceived and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon, as to what is, or ought to be accounted common and universal matters.</hi> Hereupon they give us their notion thereof, both affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively and negatively, thus; <hi>By common and universal matters we understand</hi> (<hi>and we hope,</hi> say they, <hi>according to Truth</hi>) <hi>what has been commonly and universally received, and not new and novel things that have not been so received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is not according to Truth, which is free and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; whereas this would lay a Limit and Restraint upon God, from opening the way of Truth and Righteousness further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from adding such helps and means for the Propagation thereof, and preservation of his People therein, as he in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable Wisdom shall see need of: For every fresh Discovery may on this pretence be slighted, rejected as a <hi>Novelty,</hi> in the same Spirit wherein the World rejects the whole way of Truth as a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty. Common and Universal matters therefore, relating to the Church of God, are not to be restrained to such things as have been commonly and universally received. For the envious Seeds-Man was not backward to sow his evil Seed <hi>betimes</hi>; and Captious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have risen up <hi>early</hi> (as well as now of late) excepting against, some one, some an other thing, in Doctrine or Practice, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to own the Fundamental principle of Truth. So that the most approved practice amongst Friends may, perhaps, fall short of having been, in a strict Sense, Universally received: For Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal admits no Exception. But by Common and Universal matters, relating to the Church of God, are to be understood matters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Universal <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> in the Church of God; things not peculiar to this, that, or to'ther Member only, but of common use or benefit to all the Members of the Body. And that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor so meant it, his own words plainly shew, <hi>page</hi> 5. Where he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45978:34"/>
says, <hi>Degree or Measure in the same Life can never contradict or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct that which is from the same Life, for the</hi> common benefit <hi>of the Family of God.</hi> Did <hi>Iude</hi> call the Salvation he writ of verse 3. <hi>Common,</hi> because it was commonly received; or because it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, intended and tendred as a <hi>Common Benifit</hi> to all that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it? And whereas the Adversaries say, <hi>This of Conviction and Perswasion preceding Conformity, hath been a Common and Vniversal matter or thing, because commonly and universally received among us as a great Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Reply,</hi> It is indeed a great Truth, and hath been, and is, a common and universal Matter; but not for the cause or reason they assign: For if it had not been commonly and universally received among us, as a great Truth; yet it would have been a common and universal Matter, relating to the Church of God, because it is a Matter of common and universal Service and Benefit to all and every Member in the Church of God. But since they here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this Doctrine, of Conviction and Perswasion preceding Conformity, hath been commonly and <hi>universally received</hi> among us as a great Truth; they do ill to insinuate (which too frequently they do,) that Friends would draw any to a Conformity to any thing before, or without, Conviction or Perswasion.</p>
            <p>In their 23d page, They pick another piece of a Sentence out of the Book they pretend to Answer, which they set down thus, <hi>What comes from the Light, Life and Spirit in one, is the same in Truth and Vnity to the rest, as if it rise in themselves. This is seen in our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies every day, &amp;c.</hi> Now because they dare not directly gainsay this, and yet are disposed to wrangle, they pretend to know the Design of the Argument, and quarrel with that. <hi>The Design,</hi> they say, <hi>of this Argument is to gain a dependance upon the Teachings of God, by Instruments, equal at least to the Teaching of God, immediately by his Spirit, in our own hearts; and this</hi> (they say) <hi>how plausible soever, is not according to the Truth, as 'tis in Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Their surmise in this Case is wrong and <hi>Evil,</hi> and therefore not according to Truth. That which they suggest to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, was not the Design of that Argument (as they call it.) But the plain and true Design of it was to obviat an Objection, and cut off a <hi>false Plea</hi> for Disunion and Discord, grounded upon variety of Measures, and diversity of Gifts and Offices in the Body. For
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45978:34"/>
the Author. having put the Question, <hi>page</hi> 4. <hi>Are there not various Measures, diversities of Gifts, and several Offices in the Body?</hi> And having granted that there are, proves that that <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>diversity</hi> of Measures, Gifts and Offices in the Body, administers no ground for Disunion, Discord or <hi>Contrariety</hi> amongst the members of the Body; since it is a false way of Reasoning to conclude <hi>Discord</hi> from <hi>Diversity, Contrariety</hi> from <hi>Variety</hi>: which having illustrated by an Instance of the <hi>various</hi> Senses in a natural Body, without any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety</hi> flowing from that <hi>variety,</hi> he shews, <hi>page</hi> 5. That <hi>Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Gifts doth not infer <hi>Disagreement</hi> in Sense, nor <hi>variety</hi> of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>contrariety</hi> in Judgment concerning those Offices. Then having, from the concurrent Testimonies of the holy Scriptures, set forth the Unity of God, he infers that <hi>the Light, Life and Spirit of God is at unity with it self in all; and what comes from the Light, Life or Spirit in one, it is the same in Truth and Vnity to the rest, as if it rise in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> For this he appealed to the daily experience of Friends in our Meetings, where the Living and sensible ones know, that what comes from the Light, Life or Spirit of God in any Friend that Ministers, is felt, received, closed with and united to as Truth, by those that in the same Light, Life and Spirit wait, as well as if it had arose in themselves. this was the Design of the Author's words in that place, as is apparent to any that fairly reads them; and the Design was <hi>good.</hi> But the Design of the Adversaries was <hi>Evil,</hi> in surmising another Design without ground, that they might <hi>make an occasion</hi> for Cavilling. For they are fain to confess, that <hi>there is no contrariety in the Spirit of God, no Contradiction in the Spirit's Teaching, being all for one and the same end, the good of Man, by the Salvation of his Soul.</hi> Nay, they acknowledge, <hi>There is so much Truth in what the Author hath said, that when fairly stated, they are content it should be as a Rule to measure the whole difference by.</hi> And yet they spend about a couple of Pages in Carping at it. They say, <hi>betwixt God's Teaching by Instruments, and Teaching immediately by his Spirit in our own hearts, there is this Distinction or Difference, that the first is but to prepare, the latter to perfect.</hi> Whereas the Scripture saith expresly, <hi>When Christ ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto Men, some, Apostles; and some, Prophets; and some, Evangelists, and some, Pastors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 4.8, 11, 12. So that hence it appears that the Teaching of God, through such <hi>Instruments</hi> as he gives his heavenly Gifts unto, for the work of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45978:35"/>
Ministry, hath a <hi>further</hi> tendency and Service, than <hi>but</hi> (or <hi>only</hi>) <hi>to prepare</hi>: for those Gifts were given for the <hi>Edifying</hi> (that is, building up, or Establishing) of the Body of Christ, and for the <hi>Perfecting</hi> of the Saints. This shews, the Adversaries, for all their <hi>high Notions</hi> and fluttering Pretences, are short of a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and to seek in the work of the Ministry, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true and full end of Divine Ministerial Gifts. So again they say, <hi>page</hi> 23. <hi>When the things of God do come from God's holy Spirit immediately, they are then as the Oracles of God.</hi> this shews they do not reckon them as the Oracles of God, if they come from the Light, Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Spirit of God through Instruments. But the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> (who knew as much as they, and is fitter to be believed than they) saith, <hi>If any Man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. So that the Apostle, it seems, understood no other, but that the things of God, when Ministred as of the ability which God giveth, were as <hi>the Oracles of God,</hi> though spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by or through Man.</p>
            <p>To make way yet for more wrangling, they reason after this manner; <hi>either</hi> say they, <hi>all that do speak in our Assemblies or Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, speak from the Light, Life and Spirit, or all do not, if all do so speak, prove it; if all do not so speak, then you must give us a certain Rule to know who do so speak and who do not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> At the end of their Preface, they give an Advertisement, that where the Term <hi>You</hi> is found in the following Discourse, (namely in their Book) they intend the Author (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Book they pretend to Answer) and those of his mind. And where the term <hi>We</hi> is also used (in their Book) it may be understood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those of the same mind with the Author of that Book of theirs. So that <hi>You</hi> and <hi>We</hi> are there set for Characteristical Notes, or distinguishing Terms, between Friends and them; Friends being intended and denoted by the word <hi>You,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the word <hi>We.</hi> Now since <hi>Your</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> are but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivatives from <hi>You</hi> and <hi>We,</hi> each ought to follow its own Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And since by the term <hi>We,</hi> they would have themselves to be understood, it is but reason that by the term <hi>Our</hi> Assemblies or Meetings, their own Assemblies or Meetings should be understood, not the Assemblies or Meetings of Friends: especially, seeing <hi>they have Meetings of their own,</hi> properly their own, <hi>set up themselves,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45978:35"/>
in their own wills and choice, in a Spirit of separation from the Meetings of Friends, and in opposition to them. Now, if we take them in this Sense, when they say as before, Either all that do speak in <hi>Our</hi> Assemblies or Meetings, speak from the Light, Life and Spirit, or all do not; I shall easily grant, what they say they take for granted, that all that speak in <hi>their</hi> Assemblies or Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, do not speak from the Light, Life and Spirit of God, if any do. But if they mistook themselves here, and by <hi>Our</hi> Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies or Meetings, intended the Assemblies or Meetings of Friends, and so put the Question, whether all that speak in the Meetings of Friends, do speak from the Light, Life and Spirit of God, or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Reply,</hi> No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For many of the Adversaries themselves (who are gone into a <hi>wicked</hi> separation from Friends, and instead of abideing in the Light, Life and Spirit of God, are got into an <hi>ungodly</hi> Spirit of Wrangling and Quarrelling, Rayling and Reviling, Envy, Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness and Restless Contention) do notwithstanding thrust into Friends Meetings, and there take upon them to speak, though they (or their Party) have openly denyed Friends in Print. This is such <hi>a work of darkness</hi> and <hi>horrible Hypocrysie,</hi> as manifests that such speak not from the Light, Life or Spirit of God. But whereas they say, <hi>You must give us a certain Rule to know who do so speak, and who do not, or otherwise you must leave us to receive or refuse, according to the best of our understanding</hi>; (which they repeat over and over, biding us) <hi>Observe, either you must give us a Rule as above, or you must leave us free, &amp;c.</hi> I Reply, Friends have always directed and left them, and all others, to that which makes <hi>free indeed,</hi> the Truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.32. And their insinuating the contrary, is a foul Slander, and a wicked Design. I would to God they, who are run into Enmity to and separation from Friends, would leave us free, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon us their Preaching and Praying, which they have been often told Friends cannot receive or own. And whereas they say, both here in <hi>page</hi> 24. and elsewhere, <hi>We take it for granted, that you can give no such Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Reply,</hi> They mistake, taking that for granted which they ought not. That Light, Life, Spirit, Grace or Truth, which Friends have always directed them and all unto, is a Rule. a certain Rule, to know who speak from it, and who do not. And they that abide in it, and are attentive to it, do know who speak from it, and who
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45978:36"/>
do not; who are acted by it, and who are not: and know accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly what, and whom, to receive, and what, and whom, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse. For the true Sheep know the true Shepherd's <hi>Voice, Iohn</hi> 10.4. and 27. which is more than words. But there is a difference between being left to this Light, Grace or Spirit of God in our selves, to receive or refuse according to that; and being left to our own understanding, to receive or refuse according to the best of that, as the Adversaries would be left. For Man's understanding, as it is a natural Faculty, must be illuminated by this heavenly Light and Spirit of God, before it can receive, or know, the things of God, because <hi>they are Spiritually discerned.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Well therefore did the Wise-man advise, <hi>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding,</hi> Prov. 3.5.</p>
            <p>In the close of their 24 <hi>page,</hi> They say, <hi>We may safely conclude, where Conviction and Perswasion are disallowed, that Government ceaseth to be true.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Rep.</hi> But where is that? not amongst Friends, I am sure. This they have suggested over and over; but without proof, without colour. The contrary has been asserted and proved over and over, again and again, and that by undenyable Evidences, from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book they pretend to Answer, As <hi>thou art not to conform to a thing ignorantly,</hi> page 3. <hi>The People of God ought to be left to the Guidings of the Spirit of God in themselves,</hi> page 9. <hi>It is a great Truth that all are to be left thereunto,</hi> ibid. And again, <hi>If thou dost not presently see that Service in a thing, that the rest of thy Brethren agree in, it is thy Duty</hi> (what to do? not to Conform without or against Conviction or Perswasion, but) <hi>to wait upon God in silence and patience, out of all flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Consultations, &amp;c.</hi> page 10. These plain Testimonies, one would think, were enough to stop the clamorous mouth of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Envy.</p>
            <p>They begin their 25th <hi>page</hi> with a Passage, which they single out of the 6th <hi>page</hi> of the Book they pretend to Answer; And they word it thus, <hi>They that walk in the Light, have Fellowship one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>Whence he saith, 'tis easy to conclude. that those that go out of Fellowship, go out of the Light, &amp;c.</hi> Upon this they spend about four pages in meer Cavilling. And to make the more way for their Cavilling, they <hi>miscite</hi> the Passage, leaving out a word of <hi>small sound,</hi> but of <hi>great force</hi> in the present Case, because a strong
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45978:36"/>
Emphasis lies upon it. For whereas the Author's words were, they that go out of [<hi>the</hi>] Fellowship, go out of the Light; the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, omitting the word [<hi>the</hi>] report him to have said, <hi>They that go out of Fellowship, go out of the Light</hi>; By that means, making themselves a liberty to extend this <hi>to any sort</hi> of Fellowship, that they have a mind to stretch it to, which was spoken Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and by way of Excellency, of that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, which is attained only <hi>by walking in the Light.</hi> Nor was this a single slip, or oversight; but seven or eight times over have they here repeated this Passage in the same Terms, and with the same Omission: and have made advantage of it accordingly, to prevent the Sense, abuse the Author, and beguil the Reader. For in their 26th <hi>page.</hi> They put themselves upon the Inquiry, <hi>What must be understood by the word Fellowship; for,</hi> they say, <hi>it cannot stand of it self</hi> (it seems they take it for a <hi>Noun Adjective</hi>) and they have taken from it that, by which it might have both stood, and been understood. They pursue their Inquiry thus; <hi>Therefore,</hi> say they, <hi>to make it intelligible in the best Sense, we must joyn to it what he calls the Church, and then</hi> (add they) <hi>that Church must relate to People, and at last</hi> (say they) <hi>we judge, it must relate to those Orders, Rules and Forms, that are set up by this Church, &amp;c.</hi> Thus have they <hi>taken away</hi> what they pleased from the Author's words, and <hi>added</hi> to them of their own, that they might the more foully pervert the Sense and meaning of them.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Author's words, [They that go out of the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, go out of the Light,] had a direct and limitted relation <hi>to that Fellowship</hi> which stands in the Light, which they that walk in the Light have one with another, in and by walking in the Light. So that the true Fellowship here treated of, is a pure, holy, Spiritual Fellowship, which God's People have and enjoy one with another; and their Fellowship one with another stands in that wherein their Fellowship stands with God; not in any Ceremonial or shadowy thing, as the Adversaries, with an evil mind, suggest.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>page</hi> 25, <hi>We may see the cunning that is in Daubing, as well as something of that ground of the false Reasoning, that is among the Children of men.</hi> Their <hi>Daubing,</hi> and their <hi>Cunning</hi> is laid open in the foregoing. Their <hi>false Reasoning,</hi> and their <hi>Folly</hi> will appear in what follows. They tell us, <hi>page</hi> 25, <hi>Every saying or Position hath only one other Saying or Position that stands against it; if therefore</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45978:37"/>
(say they) <hi>what is brought as the Antithesis, differ from the direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Sense, the work that follows, or what is builded upon it, cannot be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is so opposite to Sense, that it is hard to pick any Sense out of it. <hi>Antithesis</hi> is a Position directly contrary to another Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which is the <hi>Thesis</hi> to it; and it must differ from the <hi>Thesis,</hi> or direct opposite Sense, which it is brought against, else it is not truly <hi>Antithesis</hi>: Yet they would have it, that if it do differ from the direct opposite Sense, it cannot be true. They have got hold of a <hi>Cramp-word</hi> (as the saying is) and seem very fond of it; but handle it with so <hi>little skill,</hi> a shews they do not rightly understand it: For they confound <hi>Thesis</hi> with <hi>Antithesis,</hi> making the same words some times one, some times to'ther; not considering that themselves at the same time say, <hi>Opposites remain as fixt in their Sense, as the East doth from the West.</hi> Then sure they are not Convertible. Yet they make those words, [<hi>They that go out of Fellowship, go out of the Light,</hi>] one while a <hi>Thesis</hi> or Position; another while an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis,</hi> which is quite contrary. Again, they say, <hi>This Position, that they that go out of Fellowship, go out of the Light, he brings as the true Antithesis to this Position of Scripture, quoted</hi> 1 John 1. <hi>or he doth not so bring it; if he doth not bring it as true, he deceives or abuses his Reader, but if he doth bring it as the true Antithesis, he is mistaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> What ground had they to <hi>dream</hi> that he brought it as an <hi>Antithesis</hi> at all? He no where calls it so: Nay, he directly calls it a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> (his words are, <hi>Whence it is easy to conclude, They that go out of the Fellowship, go out of the Light:</hi>) And cannot they discern between a <hi>Conclusion</hi> and an <hi>Antithesis?</hi> They had better then not have medled with either. Is every <hi>Conclusion</hi> an <hi>Antithesis,</hi> do they think? They say, <hi>He brings it as the true Antithesis, or he doth not so bring it; if he doth not bring it as true, he deceives or abuses his Reader.</hi> Here, to shew their <hi>Cunning</hi> in <hi>Daubing,</hi> they leave out the word <hi>Antithesis</hi> in the latter Clause of the Sentence, and only say; if he doth not bring it <hi>as true,</hi> he deceives or abuses his Reader. But he doth bring it <hi>as true</hi> (though not <hi>Antithesis,</hi> but) <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the Premises; so that they deceive themselves and their Readers, and abuse him. They grant, from the Text in <hi>Iohn,</hi> that <hi>The ground and cause of true Fellowship, is a walking in the Lig<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> And it is very evident, that it was this true Fellowship, which walking in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45978:37"/>
the Light is the Ground and Cause of, that the Author spake of, whom he said, <hi>They that go out of the Fellowship, go out of the Light,</hi> because he inferr'd it from having Fellowship by walking in the Light, asserted by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. Now therefore, after all their wrangling, and idle Cavilling about it, I desire they will seriously consider, whether they that go out of this true Fellowship, which stands in the Light, which is attained only by walking in the Light, or which (as their own phrase is) walking in the Light is the ground and cause of, do not go out of the Light in which the Fellowship stands, when they go out of the Fellowship which stands in the Light.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>The proof that the work is true, is the witness in a Man</hi>'s <hi>own mind by the cleansing from all Sin</hi>; and they add, <hi>without this, Fellowship is ineffectual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> I grant that Cleansing, being an effet of walking in the Light, is a good proof of such walking. But since Cleansing is a gradual work: (for as, <hi>Nemo repentè fit Turpissimus</hi>; So <hi>Nemo repente fir Purgatissimus:</hi> As no Man becomes most filthy all on a sudden; so neither is it usual for any one to be made throughly Clean in a moment:) Cleansing <hi>from all sin</hi> is the highest degree of Cleansing. Now though the further this work of Cleansing is carried on, the more sweet and precious the Fellowship is; yet to assert (as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries here do) that <hi>without cleansing from all Sin, this Fellowship is ineffectual,</hi> is an Error. For while the work of Cleansing is but <hi>in part</hi> wrought, and is <hi>carrying on</hi> from one degree to an other, this holy Fellowship is of <hi>good effect</hi> to them, who by walking in the Light, are brought into, and preserved in it. I find the Author of the Book I am Replying to, doth <hi>not weigh</hi> his matter in the true Ballance before he brings it forth; but runs on in a <hi>dark</hi> way of <hi>natural</hi> Reasoning (wherein his greatest strength seems to ly) which leads him to lay hold too suddenly of <hi>Crude</hi> and indigested <hi>Notions,</hi> which will not stand, when brought to the true Tryal. But to manifest more directly to him and his Party, their mistake in the present Instance, I recommend to their Consideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, among themselves, have, or pretend to have any Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship one with another, or no. If they have; whether <hi>All</hi> in that Fellowship can in truth say, they are cleansed from <hi>All</hi> Sin. If they cannot; then whether (according to their own Position be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45978:38"/>
laid down) that Fellowship of theirs is not <hi>ineffectual.</hi> This concerns all them that value that Fellowship, or themselves for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, to consider.</p>
            <p>In their 27th and 28th <hi>pages,</hi> having spoken of the Church<hi>'s</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Wilderness, and of her being led out of it again by Christ, they say, <hi>As we believe there is to be no end of the Increase of his Government now begun, we are to consider there is some alteration in the work; it then decreased, it must now increase, and if it must increase, we may will consider, as God is infinite and eternal, he hath still more Wisdom, Power and Glory to reveal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> There is no doubt but he hath: And in his Wisdom he hath revealed such things, as his Wisdom saw needful and useful to his Church and People, which by his glorious Power he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them in; And which the Adversaries, in <hi>their carnal Wisdom,</hi> judging too mean and low for them to receive, have despised, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, rejected and opposed. But while they here admit, that God hath still more Wisdom, Power and Glory to reveal, they seem to have forgotten how oft throughout their Book, they have scornfully rejected things as <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Novel,</hi> and bounded all to their beginning.</p>
            <p>Again they say, <hi>there must be a looking forward, and not backward for the mind of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Why then would they limit us to their beginning, as in their 5th and 9th <hi>pages,</hi> as if nothing were to be received, but what is (in their esteem) Essential to true Religion, or which hath been <hi>from their beginning</hi>? Is not that looking <hi>backward,</hi> instead of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Besides, if there must be a looking forward, and <hi>not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> (as they say) for the mind of Christ; why then do they twit us with <hi>unscriptural</hi> Orders, and peremptorily call for a plain <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proof</hi> for this or that Practice? Is not this looking <hi>backward,</hi> instead of forward? For the Scriptures, they know, were written many hundred years ago. Thus their weakness and self Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction appears. But this is not all. Their Position is <hi>unsound</hi> in it self. They say, there must be a looking forward, and <hi>not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for the mind of Christ. This Negative part of their Position is false and Erronious, excluding the Scriptures of Truth to be looked in for the mind of Christ. Herein they Err to one Extream, as the World<hi>'s</hi> People do to the other. They are for looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45978:38"/>
               <hi>not forward,</hi> for the mind of Christ; <hi>backward</hi> to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they call such a compleat Canon, as admits no Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or further discovery of the mind of God; <hi>not forward,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God hath so bound himself up to what is revealed in the holy Scripture, that he will not reveal his mind any further. These, on the other hand, are for looking forward, <hi>not backward,</hi> for the mind of Christ. The Truth lies between these two Extreams. There ought to be a looking both forward, and backward, for the minde of Christ. <hi>not only forward,</hi> to every fresh and further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, discovery or Revelation of his minde: <hi>but also backward,</hi> to those Revelations, discoveries or manifestations of the minde of Christ, which we have already received from him in our selves, and which the Church of Christ in Ages past received from him, through the holy Spirit, and are recorded in the holy Scriptures, which were written for our Instruction. Thus running on headily and in haste, the Adversaries have shut out the use and Service of the Scriptures of Truth, from being look'd into for the minde of Christ.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>We should not think by what we know, to measure what is to come</hi>; and they add, <hi>we hereby limit the holy One as much as is in our power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They directed us before, at the end of their Preface, to understand the term [<hi>We</hi>] of those that are of the same minde with the Author of their Book. Now this which they here say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of limitting the holy One, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They speak in the term [<hi>We.</hi>] So that this is applicable to themselves, by their own direction. I am sensible indeed, that what they here speak concerning themselves, is true; and I am sorry for it: for hence has proceeded <hi>their hurt, and the loss that is come upon them.</hi> They have measured the Lord<hi>'s</hi> Appearances by the <hi>false Metwand</hi> of their own <hi>conceited Knowledge,</hi> and the things they so measured not answering their expectation by that measure, they have rejected, despised and vilified the things themselves, blasphemed the Power which led Friends into the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, turn'd head against their Brethren, disquieted and disturbed the Church of Christ, proclaimed in Print open War, and set up their separate Meetings, as Ensigns and Standards thereof.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:45978:39"/>Their 29th <hi>page</hi> contains a Quotation out of the Book they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Answer. It is too long to transcribe (being almost a page) consisting of many particulars, pickt out of the 6th and 8th pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that Book, but <hi>not fairly</hi>: for, besides other Variations, there is this material one, that whereas the Author<hi>'s</hi> own words are, <hi>If I will not comply with him that God hath made an Eye, &amp;c.</hi> They have cited it, <hi>If I will not comply with him that is made an Eye, &amp;c.</hi> leaving out <hi>God,</hi> that they might make room for an evil minde to furmise, that the Eye there spoken of might be of <hi>Man</hi>'s making, not of God<hi>'s</hi>; though the Author had expresly said, <hi>Him that GOD hath made an Eye</hi> This shews (as they elsewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, <hi>page</hi> 25th) more <hi>Cunning</hi> in <hi>Daubing,</hi> than <hi>honesty</hi> in <hi>Dealing.</hi> In their Answer they say, <hi>'tis plain the Author intended to gain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon what he calls the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 'Tis plain they herein <hi>abuse</hi> the Author, and endeavour to mislead their Reader. 'Tis plain the Author had no intention, nor doth his Discourse tend, to gain a dependence upon the Church, or upon any thing else than what the Church it self is built and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon, Christ Jesus, the Head thereof. That which they Carp at is a Scripture-Metaphor, borrowed from the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And the Author<hi>'s</hi> intention in using it was no other, than to reprove, and refute the folly of those, who from the <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> of Measures, <hi>diversity</hi> of Gifts and Offices in the Spiritual Body, would infer, and bring in a Liberty and allowance for the members of that Body to <hi>disagree</hi> among themselves, to <hi>contradict</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> each other, in and about the self same matter and thing, relating to the Family or Church of God. That this was his Intention, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears most plainly in his 4th <hi>page.</hi> Now in order to convince such of the weakness, unreasonableness, and falseness of that Plea, he used the Comparison which the Apostle had made, drawn from a natural Body, wherein, notwithstanding there are divers Members, and various Offices to which they are adapted, yet is there <hi>no disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi> among them, <hi>no Contrariety,</hi> Contradiction, or Opposition. So that the Adversaries, in this Cavil, do but in effect carp at the Apostle, at the Holy Scripture, and at the Spirit of Truth by which it was written. But I come to particulars of their Answer.</p>
            <p>Having said, 'tis plain his intention is to gain a Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he calls the Church, they add, <hi>And that he makes infallible as she relates to Men.</hi>

               <hi>Rep.</hi> This is a notorious Falsehood, not to be fastned on any thing in his Book; and that I suppose, they were sensible of: for they do not attempt to quote any passage of his in proof of it, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prop up this, by setting another Falsehood to it, which is this; <hi>That she must relate to Men is clear, the Difference</hi> (say they) <hi>being betwixt Men and Men.</hi> This is false as well as the former. The Difference is not betwixt Men and Men; if it were, it would relate to the things of Men, such things as are common to Men <hi>as Men.</hi> But the Difference is between Spirit and Spirit, and relates to the things of the Church, not of the World; of Christians, not of Men <hi>as Men.</hi> But the Adversaries, in their <hi>carnal minds,</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish not between Men and Christians. Next they say, <hi>He makes no provision in all his Book to the contrary, by allowing Conviction to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Conformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Doubtless the Adversaries are come to an high degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate hardness, that without remorse they can so often repeat so foul a Falsehood as this. How many places have I already cited out of that Book (in which, they say, he makes no provision at all for this) which plainly convict them of Falsehood and Slander therein! when he said, <hi>page</hi> 3. <hi>Thou art not to conform to a thing ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly</hi>; was here no Provision at all made for Conviction to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Conformity! If they were not to conform <hi>ignorantly,</hi> then surely they were to know, be perswaded, convinced, before they conformed. So that here was a good provision made, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction should precede Conformity. When, to the Question, [Ought I not to be left to the Grace and Spirit of God in my own heart,] He Answered, <hi>Yea, that is of all things most desireable, &amp;c. page</hi> 3. and 4. when he said, <hi>page</hi> 9. <hi>The People of God ought to be left to the Guidings of the Spirit of God in themselves</hi>; and again, <hi>It is a great Truth that all are to be thereunto left</hi>; was here no Provision at all for Conviction to precede Conformity! what better Provision could have been made for allowing Conviction to precede Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, than to declare that God<hi>'s</hi> People ought to be left to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of God<hi>'s</hi> Spirit in themselves? Is it not from the Spirit of God in ones self, that Conviction or Perswasion of Duty is to be accepted and received? will the Spirit of God lead them that <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45978:40"/>
God<hi>'s</hi> Spirit in themselves, was the best Provision could have been made for Conviction to precede Conformity. When, to the Question, [If I do not presently see that Service in a thing, that the rest of my Brethren agree in, in this case what is my Duty?] He Answered, <hi>It is thy Duty to wait upon God in silence and Patience, out of all fleshly Consultation, and as thou abidest in the simplicity of Truth, thou wilt receive an understanding with the rest of thy Brethren about the thing doubted</hi>; was there no Provision at all here, for allowing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to precede Conformity! Did he say, thou must Conform before or without Coviction? whether thou seest the Service, or no? Whether thou hast received an Understanding about it, or no? Nay, did he not positively exclude that, and obviate this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, by saying directly, <hi>It is thy Duty to waite upon God, &amp;c.</hi> And what was such an one to wait upon God for? to be lead into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity before Conviction? no sure; but to receive Conviction from God: therefore he there added, <hi>And as thou abidest in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Truth, thou wilt receive an Vnderstanding, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, so far was he from favouring (much more from pressing) Conformity before Conviction, that, having declared, as before, the Duty of such an unconvinced, doubting one; he adds also, what is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Brethren towards such an one, thus, <hi>And it is their Duty, whilst thou behavest thy self in meekness and humility, to bear with thee, and carry themselves tenderly and lovingly towards thee.</hi> Can any be so impudent as yet to say, that he makes no Provision in all his Book to the contrary, by allowing Conviction to precede Conformity! Nay, the Adversaries themselves say of him, <hi>page</hi> 16. That they believe he desires <hi>all should be Guided by God's Spirit.</hi> Doth this look like leading into blind Obedience, like drawing to Conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conviction, like drawing to a Dependence upon Men, as they often suggest against him! how abominably wicked are they herein!</p>
            <p>In their 30 <hi>page,</hi> they quarrel at some particular passages in the large Quotation they gave before, relating to the Metaphor of a natural Body. As first, they say, <hi>The Author seems to make the Church immediately joyned to Christ for her Head, as the natural Body <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Doth this offend them? It is then because they do not know the true Church, nor her strict Conjunction with or to her Head.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45978:40"/>
Do they indeed think the true Church is not immediately joyned to Christ for her Head! were they of that Church, they would think otherwise. It concerns them to consider, whether they are not such as the Apostle complained of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. for <hi>not holding the Head, from which all the body, by joynts and bands having nourishment ministred, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</hi> The same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle exhorting the <hi>Ephesians</hi> not to be <hi>tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the slight of Men, and cunning Craftiness, whereby they ly in wait to deceive,</hi> Ephes. 4.14. adds, <hi>But speaking the Truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body unto the edifying of it self in love.</hi> And <hi>Baeza,</hi> on these words, thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; <hi>Thereof it followeth,</hi> saith he, <hi>that neither this Body can live without Christ, neither can any Man grow up Spiritually, that separateth himself from the other Members.</hi> A fit Note, and worthy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all those, who have separated themselves from that Church, which yet they acknowledge to be true.</p>
            <p>They Cavil yet further at the parts of the Metaphor taken from a natural Body, which shews they do not well understand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Metaphor, Comparison, or Sinicle, which (as the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) runs not on all four, nor agrees in every particular; but it is enough if it square in these parts, wherein the Comparison lies. When Christ compared his Coming) called by the Apostles, the coming of the day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.2. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.) to the coming of a Theif, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.43, 44. it was <hi>not</hi> with respect to the <hi>end</hi> or intention of the coming of each: (for <hi>the Thief cometh not but to steal, kill and destroy, Iohn</hi> 10.10. Whereas Christ came to give Life, and to Save.) But it was with respect to the <hi>unexpected suddenness</hi> of the coming of each. The comparing the Members of Christ<hi>'s</hi> Body to the Members of a natural Body, was not to tie the Spiritual Members to a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> proportion and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>every</hi> respect, to the Members of a natural Body, in <hi>all</hi> and <hi>singular</hi> the Offices, Properties, Qualifications and Faculties of the Members of a natural Bedy: But to shew, that as all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a natural Body, being influenced, animated and acted by one and the same vital Spirit, do harmoniously agree, and <hi>not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45978:41"/>
thwart</hi> one another, in their various Offices and Actions: So the Members of the true Spiritual Body, being all influenced, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, acted, moved, led and guided by the one Spirit of Life and Truth, do harmoniously agree, and sweetly consent together, in the performing of their several Offices, according to the divers Gifts, and various Measures that they have received thereof. Which cuts off, and wholly excludes that pernicious Plea, which the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Enemy hath furnished some with, for maintaining Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Discord, and opposite Senses, Judgments and Practices, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Members of the same Body, in and about the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Performances. Had the Adversaries rightly considered this, they would not perhaps have thought there had been any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency between the Church of Christ seeing, hearing, speaking with the same Eye, Ear, Mouth; and particular Members being made by God an Eye, Ear, or Mouth, at such seasons, or such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and for such Services, as he sees meet to use them in: For there is no inconsistency in this at all; though they labour to make one, by <hi>a carnal way of Reasoning,</hi> not suitable to the nature of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Senses. For though they say, <hi>In the first of these Cases, they all seem to hear for themselves; in the latter, some hear immediately, and some secondarily</hi>; and that <hi>the first hear not only for themselves, but for others also, the second only for themselves by others:</hi> They err, not knowing the Mystery of true Spiritual Hearing. For in the true Church All (whose Ear the Lord hath truly opened, and who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively listen to his Voice, hear for themselves, and that <hi>immediately,</hi> by the Spiritual Ear which God hath opened in them, at the same time that, with the outward Ear, they hear the Testimony of Truth sounded forth, by the Spirit of Truth, through any Instrument unto them. But, Oh! the darkness that comes over those, who give scope and liberty to their minds to rove, and range in the way of carnal Reasoning, about the things of God, which are, and only can be, Spiritually discerned, by them that wait in the Light. <hi>Let us know,</hi> say the Adversaries here, <hi>what Member is this Eye that we must see by, and what Member is this Ear that we must hear by, and what Member is this Mouth that we must speak by, in those things that relate to Christ and his Church, that so we may not be imposed upon by such as may pretend to be that Eye, that Ear and Mouth, and are not.</hi>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45978:41"/>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> This looks too like that <hi>impertinent Curiosity,</hi> which drew from the Apostle the Rebuke of [<hi>thou Fool</hi>] to him that asked, How are the Dead raised up? and with what Bodies do they come? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.35, 36. The Adversaries here bewray an Imagination, that some particular Members are determinately appointed to the constant, and continual performance, and execution of those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Eye, Ear, Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to and for the Body. And they seem to expect we should describe those Persons to them by name, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward Character. But how <hi>carnally minded</hi> must they be, that could conceive so strange an Imagination! They bid us let them know that, which none but God knows. For as no Member can be rightly a Mouth to the rest, but that which God makes so, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through it to the rest, and that only at such times as it is so made use of by God: So none but God knows what Member he will make use of, as a Mouth to speak his mind by. But as all the Members wait upon God, in their own respective measures of the heavenly Gift in themselves, all are in their proper places, ready to be ordered and disposed of by the Lord to whatsoever Office in, or Service for the Body, he shall see meet to use them in. And every one thus truly waiting, in that which gives a true discerning, none such can be imposed upon by any false Pretender. Hence it is, that when any of these Adversaries (that are gone out of the Unity, into a separation inwardly in Spirit, and outwardly in Meetings also, from Friends) <hi>thrust</hi> into our Meetings, and take upon them to be a Mouth, either from God to the Assembly, by Preaching, or from the Assembly to God, by Prayer; they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, felt, feen and known to be but false Pretenders; and as such rejected and denied by Friends. But is it not strange blindness in them, to Cavil at the Expression of a Member being made a Mouth by God to the rest of the Members; when it is plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, that divers of themselves pretend to that Office, of being a Mouth to or from the Assembly, and on that pretence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude and impose their Preaching and Praying on Friends! Does not this shew they are devoted to Cavilling?</p>
            <p>They say, in their 31 <hi>page, Will he leave us to depend, and not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell us what on</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> By this they would insinuate, that the Author of the Book they pretend to Answer, would have some of the Members depend
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45978:42"/>
upon others. Yet they immediately add, <hi>He doth not intend that sure.</hi> But if they really believe he doth not intend that, why would they suggest that he doth so intend, by saying, will he have us to depend, and not <hi>certainly</hi> tell us what on? when it is certain he had certainly and expresly told, what all God's People ought to depend on, namely, the Guidings of the Spirit of God in themselves, <hi>page</hi> 9. And indeed, so far are Friends from having, or referring any to, a dependence on any Instrument, through which God at any time spake; that they have always recommended all to the Grace, and Spirit of God in themselves, (which says <hi>Amen</hi> to the Testimony that proceeds from the same Grace and Spirit in another) that their dependence might be upon God in that! And had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries look'd with an indifferent Eye, they might have observed what the Author, of the Book they are so angry at, hath written in the 8th and 9th <hi>pages</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That the same lowly frame of mind that receives and answers the mind of the Spirit of the Lord in a Man's self, will receive and have Unity with the mind of the same Spirit through another, and the reason is plain; because the same self evidencing Power and virtue that ariseth from the measure of the Spirit of Truth in one self, and that convinceth a Man in his own heart, doth also attend the discovery of the mind of the same Spirit, when delivered by another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They speak of <hi>the Church that is perfectly redeemed, &amp;c. But this,</hi> say they, <hi>is that Church that is hid from the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> By this they would make as if Christ had two Churches, one hid from the World, and another known to the World. But is the Church (or was it ever) known to the World? Was not his Church always hid from the World? Can the Church of Christ be seen but by a Spiritual Eye? And hath the World that Eye to see her with?</p>
            <p>In their 32 <hi>page,</hi> they say, <hi>Why do you impose upon your Brethren?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> The Insinuation is false and malicious. Friends impose not upon any. But what God hath manifested as his mind unto us, for the Service and good of his Church, that in his Fear we practice our selves, and that we have recommended to others. When some have said, they saw not the Service of it, such have been exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and desired, to wait upon God in the measure of his Light,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45978:42"/>
Grace and Spirit manifested in themselves, that thereby they might come to a Sight and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ense thereof, and have Unity with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren therein; and in the mean time to be quiet, and not oppose those things, which their Brethren were conscientiously concerned in, and which they themselves confessed that they had not a sight, whether the things so recommended, were of God or not. But instead of taking this good Counsel, some Factious Spirits amongst them, set themselves to obstruct and hinder Friends from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the way which the Lord had led them into; working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Friends, at first, in a more hidden manner, by <hi>sly Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>evil Surmises</hi> secretly conveyed from House to House, among such as were <hi>weak</hi> of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> or but <hi>young</hi> in the <hi>Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and knowledge of Truth, or under some <hi>discontent</hi> of mind, or such as wanted a <hi>broader</hi> way than Truth allows. These they smoothly and craftily insinuated themselves into, entertained them with Stories and false Reports against this, that and the other Friend, labouring to perswade them that such sought to set up a <hi>Lordly Dominion</hi> over them to make themselves <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church, and bring others in subjection under them: Than which, nothing could be more false. But after that those wicked Agents had, by these and such like ungodly Courses, beguiled many, and formed to themselves (as they thought) a sufficient party in divers parts of the Nation; they then brake forth into open Opposition, gain-saying, withstanding and disturbing Friends in the practice of those things, which friends were convinced of, and satisfied the Lord had led them into, and owned them in; calling them (in scorn and derision) by the reproachful and despightful Terms of Canons, Constitutions, Decrees, Mens-Inventions, Human Traditions, Popish-Prescriptions, Edicts, Orders, Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when Friends, seeing them thus run out from Truth, and bandying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against Truth, could no longer receive their Testimonies in our publick Meetings, as Preachers amongst us, but were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to shew some open dislike thereof; then did the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>impose</hi> their Preaching and Praying upon Friends, requiring Friends to bow in Conformity to their Prayers, and that not only <hi>before</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> but even <hi>against</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to Conviction and Perswasion, (for Friends gave them to understand that they were convinced and satisfied in their Judgments and Consciences, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45978:43"/>
they, being gone from the Spirit of Truth and Gospel of Peace, ought not to be owned as Ministers thereof.) Nay, to that height did the Adversaries proceed, in <hi>obtruding</hi> their Ministry upon Friends, that (in some places, where they had gotten strength, by Numbers, sufficient to carry on their evil Designs,) they <hi>imposed Conformity</hi> to their own Ministry, under an <hi>outward Penalty,</hi> and that no less than a being excluded from, debarred and deprived of the use of their publick Meeting-places, in which the Friends, so deprived, had, and have, a true Right and legal Property. Nor did they only threaten this, but were as bad as their words, and did actually shut and keep the Friends out, and refuse them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into their own Meeting-places, unless they would first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to conform. This was Imposition with a witness: And <hi>Reding</hi> is a witness of this.</p>
            <p>The Cavils they make in their 34. and 35. pages, on occasion of the Differences mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. about Observation of Meats and Days, are very trivial. They do not prove that the Instances of abstaining from Meats, and observing Days, are Parallels to those parts of Church-Discipline, which they fight so much against. They confess indeed, that the instance of <hi>Meats,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>is an Instance of Weakness</hi>; but they urge, that the Apostle's Advice was, that those <hi>weak ones,</hi> notwithstanding their weakness, <hi>should be received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> We agree with the Apostle's Advice, and have testified our Consent thereto by our Practice: For so long as the Adversaries kept within the bounds of weakness only, alleadging want of sight, their weakness was born with, and they were received by Friends, in hopes that, if they waited humbly and honestly upon the Lord, he would open their understandings, and give them a sight, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction concerning the things they then doubted about. But when, not content with this bearing and forbearing, they grew <hi>heady and quarrelsome,</hi> and sought, by running into jangling disputations, to stagger others, and spread the Leaven of their own doubts, that by making others as doubtful as themselves, they might raise a party, to carry on strife and contention by; they then put themselves out of the Protection of the Apostle's Advise. For as he advised, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him that is weak in the Faith</hi>; so he also cautioned <hi>not to receive him to doubtful Disputations.</hi> He was to be received, if he would be <hi>quiet,</hi> and his <hi>weakness</hi> to be born with; but not if he would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>wrangling,</hi> and raising <hi>Dissentions</hi> in the Church. So far as the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45978:43"/>
cases will admit Comparison, the Adversaries Representative was that <hi>weak one,</hi> who could not eat what his Brethren could. <hi>He,</hi> through <hi>weakness,</hi> could <hi>not eat: They,</hi> through <hi>weakness</hi> (of sight) could <hi>not see</hi> what their Brethren saw, could not Act as their Brethren did; at least pretended so. Now, as the Apostle gave a cautionary <hi>Let not,</hi> to him that was strong; <hi>Let not him that eateth dispise him that eateth not,</hi> Rom. 14.3. (which Friends observed towards the Adversaries, not despising nor rejecting them for their apparent weakness, but bearing with them, and carrying themselves tenderly towards them: So he gave another cautionary <hi>Let not,</hi> to him that was weak (by whom, as I noted, the Adversaries are here represented) <hi>Let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth.</hi> Had the Adversaries observed this Caution <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Apostle, and not <hi>judged their Brethren</hi> in and for those things, which their Brethren saw to be their Duty, and were satisfied and conscientiously concerned in (and which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves acknowledged they had not a clear sight of) the Difference in probability had not come to what it now is. But the Adversaries forgeting the Apostles Counsel, fell to judge their Brethren, and that in the most provoking and reflecting manner, under the names of <hi>Apostates, Innovators, Idolaters, Setters up of lordly Dominion, V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers of Authority over Conscience, Introducers of Popery,</hi> &amp;c. and that in Print; And never gave over, till they run themselves by open war, into that open Separation, in which they now stand.</p>
            <p>In their 35th page, they fall again upon their old odd Notion of making <hi>Circumstantial</hi> and <hi>Shadowy</hi> to signifie the same thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Herein they err, for want of considering the proper nature of each. Every Shadow is a Representation of some particular Substance, which it is a shadow of. But every Circumstance is not Representative. There are Circumstances of Time, Place, Gesture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belonging to every Action: yet is not every such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance a Representation of some particular Substance. Therefore every Circumstance is not a Shadow. In meeting together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, there must be a time to meet at, a Place to meet in. These are Circumstantial to the worship for which the Meeting is, but they are not Shadows. If the Adversaries think they are, pray let them assign the particular Substances of which they are Shadows, and which, as Shadows, they represent. But for ought I see, they make all things to be Shadows, but the Spirit of God. For they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45978:44"/>
say, they must be Substance or Shadow; and they admit nothing to be Substance, but that which leads into all Truth; and they add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The Substance is God's holy Spirit, that only and alone guides into all Truth.</hi> So that, after their <hi>Shadowy</hi> way of Reasoning, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Dispensation should be as Shadowy as the Legal was, or else there must be no external Appearance of Worship under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And yet they acknowledge, <hi>There should be no Shadows in Christ's Government.</hi> But, if there should be no Shadows in Christ's Government, and all External Acts of Worship (according to their notion) are but Shadowy; then there must be no external Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or Acts of Worship under Christ's Government. And what then would this shadowy, shady, dark Reasoning of theirs bring things to! I wish the more single-hearted of their beguiled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites would well observe this, and consider what Shadows of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> they have made, or would make them.</p>
            <p>In like manner, they blunder about the <hi>Circumstantial</hi> and <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> puzzling themselves, and their Reader, to no purpose, for want of applying the words <hi>Circumstantial</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective and proper <hi>Relatives</hi> for they must relate to something that which is but Circumstantial to one thing, may be Essential to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Outward Motion, or motion of the outward Members, is <hi>Circumstantial</hi> to man; <hi>not Essential</hi> to his being: for a man may be a man without outward motion. But this outward motion, though it be not Essential to man's Being, yet it is Essential to his Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Talking, Eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For walking, talking, eating, cannot be without some outward motion of the outward Members. As it is thus in Natural, so in Religious Matters. Outward Performances are but Circumstantial, not Essential to Religion, simply considered as in it self, and strictly taken in the abstract. But those very Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, which are not Essential to Religion it self in that strict fense, may be Essential to the Outward Profession and external Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Religion. And indeed, no outward Profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can be made, no external Exercise of Religion performed, without the Circumstance of some outward Act or Medium. Which shews that outward Performances, outward Acts or Mediums are Essential to the Being of outward Profession, or Exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though not to Religion it self, in that strict and abstractive sense before mentioned. I write this (not with respect to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45978:44"/>
Medium, Act, or Performance, but) in a general way, with respect to every Outward Performance, that relates to the right Exercise of true Religion; And to check the too confident Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which the Adversaries over hastily draw th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> whatsoever is not Essential to Religion (according to their undistinguished sense of Essentials) is, without more ado, a meer-Shadow.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Book they pretend to Answer, in his 9th page thereof, having shew'd that the Plea which the Adversaries make, viz. [<hi>I must mind the Spirit of God in my self</hi>] though true in it self, yet ought not <hi>to be so applied, as to disregard the Preaching or Writings of Christ's enlightned Servants, because by them applied properly to the Preaching or Writing of false Prophets and Seducers,</hi> concluded thus, <hi>I say the Doctrine is true, but not exclusively of all external Counsel or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; therefore false in application, where men are allowed to have had the fear of God, and the mind of his Spirit, and are not proved to have acted in their own Wills and Wisdom, or without the Guidance of the Spirit of God, about the things of his Church and Kingdom.</hi> Here the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries open wide, and a grevious Out cry they make, p. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7. &amp;c. Two main Exceptions they take against this. One at the words [<hi>have had</hi> the fear of God] and the other at the words [<hi>are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> to have acted, &amp;c.] Against the first, they alledge that <hi>such as may have had the fear of God, may now be without it.</hi> And, to give a <hi>flurt</hi> at the Author, they add, <hi>As well as himself, who used to have good Arguments, but now wants them.</hi> Against the second, they urge, that since <hi>every fact must be committed before proved, they may have acted in their own will, and not yet fully proved.</hi> Now, that this is a meer empty Cavil, and carping at words only, will appear by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own words, in the place fore-cited, where he expresly calls the Persons he spake of, <hi>Faithful Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Christ's enlightned Servants.</hi> So that it is evident, he used that other way of Speech afterwards upon the Adversaries, Concession, and to bind them the faster, who, how meanly soever they thought of Friends then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to <hi>have had</hi> the fear of God, and the mind of his Spirit, &amp;c. and <hi>had not proved</hi> them to have acted in their own wills, how much soever they slighted them.</p>
            <p>And it appears the Adversaries understood this to be so worded upon their Concession: for they say, p. 38. <hi>If we have allowed any to have had the fear of God, and mind of his Spirit in things offered to us,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45978:45"/>
if that allowance was true (observe) it was because we had a divine sense, relish and taste of it in our own Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> If that allowance was true! it seems then they cannot tell, they have no assurance, whether that allowance was true, or no. How know they then whether the sense, relish, and taste of it, which they say they had in their hearts, was Divine, or no? For since they say that allowance was because they had a divine sense of it, &amp;c. if the allowance was not true, the sense, which was the Cause of that allowance, will not appear to have been Divine.</p>
            <p>They add, <hi>And are we to go any further for a Proof, that such are wrong, than when the same Evidence comes not along with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Yes sure, they especially, who have so little certainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the allowance they gave before was true; whether the sense in their own hearts, on which that allowance was grounded, was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, had need go further for a proof that others are wrong, than their own apprehension that the same Evidence comes not along with them. For how know they, but the same Evidence may come along with them, whom they judge wrong, though it cannot get entrance into their hearts, which are prepossessed with ill will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Envy? Was it not so with some of old, who received, owned, embraced and allowed the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> as right, and yet afterward turned against him as wrong? Where was the fault? Did not the same Evidence come along with the Apostle, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Ministry, as before? Or was there no room in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced mind for the Evidence to enter? Should not they have gone further then, for a proof that he was wrong, than their sense that the same Evidence came not along with him?</p>
            <p>But they say, <hi>Can any indifferent man think that all this Smoke can be without Fire? What, one part all right, and t'other all wrong; let them think so that can, we cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> No, no: All this Smoke is not without Fire; and that they know full well: for <hi>they kindled the Fire.</hi> But much of this Smoke <hi>is the Smoke of their Torment,</hi> who have <hi>no rest</hi> day nor night; but are <hi>fretting</hi> and <hi>fuming,</hi> making a <hi>Pother</hi> and <hi>Smother,</hi> and sending forth one <hi>Pamphlet</hi> after another, stuft with <hi>Falsehoods</hi> and <hi>Reproaches,</hi> to <hi>keep the Fire burning,</hi> and the <hi>Smoke ascending,</hi> that if possibly they may <hi>darken the sight</hi> of some or other, and by that means draw them to their party.

answered their <hi>Expectation.</hi> They thought to have drove all before them, and with one sweep of their Leader's Tail, <hi>to have drawn,</hi> at least, <hi>the third part of the Stars from Heaven.</hi> But the Lord hath disappointed them, blessed be his holy Name. So that though here and there <hi>a wandring Star</hi> hath fallen in with them; yet <hi>the Stars of the Morning sing together,</hi> and <hi>the Sons of God shout for joy,</hi> feeling their Establishment in the heavenly Power, and their Root in him that lives for ever. From this disappointment of the Adversaries Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and the unsuccesfulness of their Separation to the end they proposed, I take it to be, that they still hover at the Meetings of Friends, to tinck off (if they can) unsensible and unwary Ones, and gain some addition to their separate Party.</p>
            <p>When they say, <hi>We cannot think one part all right, and t'other all wrong,</hi> they seem to acknowledge that <hi>themselves are not right.</hi> But if they are really sensible that <hi>they are not right,</hi> why do they not own wherein <hi>they are wrong,</hi> and condemn themselves therein, that (Repenting) they may come to be right? If they can't think <hi>the other Part all wrong</hi>; why did they so revile and reproach them, and that publickly in Print, as <hi>Apostates, Innovators, Idolaters, setters up of Idols and Images, Introducers of Popery,</hi> and the like? And why did they divide and separate from them.</p>
            <p>Their 38th page gives a Quotation, pickt out of the 11th and 12th pages of the Book they pretend to Answer, and serves them to Cavil at to the end of their Pamphlet, which is half a dozen Leaves, or more. But because their Answer thereto is not so much Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative as a <hi>Declamatory Harangue,</hi> and the matter thereof, for the most part, a Repetition of what they have said, and I replied to, before; interlarded thick with the old Terms [<hi>Imposition, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial, Ceremonial, Shadowy, bringing in New things, forcing new things,</hi> &amp;c.] I shall not think my self obliged to imitate their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity, by following them step by step, over each particular again; but touching on some Passages in the way, draw this Discourse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to the Quotaion they give, they give it not fairly: for connecting many Particulars together, they take liberty to leave out what they please. They begin it thus; <hi>He saith, The Enemy is at work to scatter the minds of Friends, by those loose Pleas, as leave me to my Freedom, and to the Grace of God in my self,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45978:46"/>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here they leave out the first part of that Plea, which the Author there impleads, and which proves the loose mind of them that so make it. For the Author's words lie, thus, The Enemy is at work to scatter the minds of Friends, by that loose Plea, <hi>What hast thou to do with me? Leave me,</hi> &amp;c. This shews that that End of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Plea, which the Author there taxes as <hi>loose,</hi> was to unbody, to disjoynt, dismember, dissociate, disunite Friends, so as that one should have nothing to do with another, even in those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Testimony of Truth, common to all that profess Truth lies, as will appear by the following Lines. They go on with their Quotation thus, <hi>The plain Consequence is to go from autient Principles and Practices, as there set down.</hi> This they say, <hi>He saith,</hi> and they set this down in manner and Character with the rest of the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, just as if he had said it indeed; whereas his own words are thus, —
<q>This Proposition and Expression (namely, What hast thou to do with me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as now understood and alleadged, is a Deviation from, and a Perversion of the antient Principle of Truth; for this is the plain consequence of this Plea, if any one (especially if they are but lately convinced) shall say, I see no Evil in paying Tithes to the Hireling-Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I see no Evil in Marrying by the Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I see no Evil in decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a publick Testimony in suffering Times, or hiding in times of Persecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I see no Evil in worshipping and respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the persons of Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I see no Evil in keeping my Shop shut upon the World's Holy-days and Mass-days, as they call them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
All this (and more) they omitted. When as these are instances of the looseness of the Plea; and which the Adver, saries knew to be too true to be denied, and therefore chose rather to conceal, than revive by bringing them forth. Nay, the Author there shewed the Consequence of this Plea extended further, that he who should plead it in the Cases before instanced, might go on to say to Friends,
<q>Since your Testimony is against Imposition, and for leaving every one to the measure of the Grace which God hath given him, not only, no Man hath power to reprove or judge me, but I may be as good a Friend as any of you, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my measure.</q>
This also they left out. And then, having pieced up the rest of the Quotation as they pleased, they give no direct Answer to it. They neither grant that the things there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced are Evil, as paying Ththes, Marrying by the Priest, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45978:46"/>
in times of Persecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Lest perhaps they should stumble those of their Party who expect that Liberty.) Nor do they deny that those, and such like, things have been, or may be, defended, by some under that Plea, What hast thou to do with me? Leave me to my Freedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But instead of this, they begin their long Answer thus, <hi>The ground of this great Noise and Clamour, was not agoing from antient Principles or Practices, but your bringing in new things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They say not right. The ground of this great Noise and Clamour was, their going from the antient Fundamental Principle of all true Principles and Practices, the Light. They went from the Light of Christ in themselves, and so became Darkned: Then complained they wanted sight, they could not see the Service pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the things recommended. But as little sight as they had, they could see to oppose and obstruct their Brethren, and not suffer them quietly to proceed in that, which they saw and were satisfied was their Duty. They could see to wrangle, jangle, cavil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and disturb their Brethren with ungodly Speeches, and very unruly and turbulent Behaviour, whereby they raised a great Noise and Clamour.</p>
            <p>They say, they <hi>ought to be left to the Grace of God in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> To the Grace of God they were left in this, and every matter. But their ungodly Speeches, and unchristian Carriage, shewed, though they were left to the Grace of God, they were not led by it.</p>
            <p>They say in <hi>page</hi> 39. <hi>If nothing that is simply Evil or immoral can be charged upon your Brethren, will you to make way for Lordship and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over your Brethren, joyn with the Prophane and Professors against them and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> No: But the Adversaries, by their own practice, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge of Professors and Profane against the Light, have thereby joyned with both against Friends and Truth. And their saying here, If nothing that is <hi>simply Evil or Immorral</hi> can be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shews how easy and willing they are to admit this Plea [of being left to their Freedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] For a defence or Cover for those, or the like Evils before instanced, as <hi>paying the Priest Tithes, Marrying by a Priest, &amp;c.</hi> Which though not such things as in the Eye of the World are accounted <hi>simply Evil
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45978:47"/>
or Immoral,</hi> are in the Eye of Truth certainly Evil, and inconsistent with our principle.</p>
            <p>Again, they say, <hi>If you deny that you impose, why are not you quiet?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Friends are quiet. But the Adversaries are not, will not be quiet; but in a restless, tossed, turbulent mind and Spirit, are continually <hi>devising deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the Land.</hi> They could not be quiet till they were separated; they will not be quiet now they are separated: but ever and anon some or other of them come to Friends Meetings, to disquiet Friends there. And not satisfied with that neither, they scatter abroad their dirty Books, stuft with evil Surmises, sly Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, envious Reflections, and foul Falsehoods; like those of Old, whom the Prophet compared to the <hi>troubled Sea,</hi> when it cannot rest, whose Waters <hi>cast up Mire and Dirt,</hi> Isa. 27.20. <hi>to whom there is no peace,</hi> ver. 21. Therefore 'tis no wonder they are not quiet, but as <hi>raging Waves of the Sea,</hi> are ever and anon <hi>foaming out their own shame,</hi> like those whom <hi>Iude</hi> complained of, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. Nay, so averse are they to Quietness, that rather than want pretence for Strife, they have pickt up a Book that was written some Nine or Ten years ago, to make an occasion for a new Qarrel, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Old.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>page</hi> 4, You must bring those things in, about which the Difference is, either as Terms of Communion, or not. (It seems, as often as they have charged us with bringing those things in as Terms of Communion, they do not yet know whether we have done so, or not.) <hi>If,</hi> say they, <hi>you did not bring them in as Terms of Communion, then why do you criminate your Brethren as evil Doers, whilst you have nothing against them, but refusing Compliance with your Opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Not to enumerate all we have against them, (who, in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolous way, still call themselves our Brethren, though they are gone from the true Brotherhood, that under that Name they might do us the greater mischief,) we have more against them, than their refusing Compliance with what they scornfully call our Opinions; namely, the <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Disturbances</hi> they have raised in the Church, by their unruly, violent and turbulent Oppositions; the <hi>Dissention</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> they have caused thereby; the <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Breach</hi> they have made; the <hi>open War</hi> they have begun, and carried
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45978:47"/>
on; the <hi>Separation</hi> they have run into; the wicked, envious <hi>Books</hi> they have Printed, to expose them they hipocritically call their Brethren, and, together with them; the Truth they profess, to the Scorn Contempt and Rage of the wicked; in all which they are <hi>Evil-Doers.</hi> And so they also are in suggesting, that Friends brought in those things, about which (they say) the Difference is, as Terms of Communion. For that is false. We brought not in any things as Terms of Communion. The holy God, who is the Author of our Communion with himself, and with one another, hath appointed and fixed the Terms of this Communion, <hi>viz.</hi> Walking in the Light, as he is in the Light, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. But I would gladly see what the Adversaries will assign for the Terms of their Communion: for where I have had any opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving them, or understanding their ways, I could never yet find or learn, that they excluded any from Communion with them, who would go to their separate Meetings, and rail against Friends. Sure I am, whoever shall observe, with an indifferent Eye, what they lick up, and whom they give the hand of Fellowship to, will find no cause to suppose the Terms of their Communion to be, walking in the Light.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>We are sure it is more according to Truth, for you to omit the doing of what you may believe is good in this Sense, than for others to receive what they believe is wrong.</hi> And this they speak, in order (as they pretend) <hi>to discontinue the Difference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They state not the Case fairly on either hand: for what they would have us omit, they call only what <hi>we may believe is good</hi>; whereas they are not ignorant, that we have declared we believe those things to be, not only good, but required by God of us as our Duty. On the other hand, when they speak of others not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, they call it what <hi>they believe is wrong</hi>; whereas they have not adventured to charge those things with being positively wrong, but have alleadged, they did not see the Service of them; or, as some of their Party have elsewhere stated it, they had <hi>great cause to be jealous,</hi> several things proposed were not from Heaven, but of Man: for in their Birth into the Church, they <hi>seemed</hi> not to bear the heavenly Image. There is some ods, surely, between <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> and <hi>Iealousy,</hi> between Believing a thing to be wrong, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>jealousy</hi> that it was not from Heaven; but of Man; especially
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45978:48"/>
when that Jealousy hath no greater ground than a <hi>seeming</hi> not to bear the havenly Image. Thus they craftily <hi>extenuate</hi> on the one hand, and aggravate on the other. But when each comes to be rightly stated, and set on its true bottom, it will appear to be no more according to Truth, for Friends to omit, the doing of that which they believe to be (not only good, but) their required Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than for the Adversaries to receive what they did not see the Service of, but were <hi>jealous</hi> was of Man, because it <hi>seemed</hi> not to bear the heavenly Image. However, sure I am, it had been more according to Truth, for the Adversaries to have been Quiet, and not run headily against what; through <hi>want of sight</hi> and true Sense, they were <hi>jealous</hi> of; than either for them to have made the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, Disturbance, Division and Separation they have made. Or for Friends to have omitted the doing that good, which they believed the Lord required of them, and felt him by his Spirit lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them into, and by his good presence owning them in. And indeed, a readier way could hardly be proposed, for <hi>obstructing all Duty</hi> in any Society, than to injoyn those, who believe it to be their Duty, to omit the doing of it, because others are jealous of it. However, their here proposing that Friends should omit the doing of what they believe is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a way or means to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the Difference, shews that (notwithstanding their loud Clamours, and reiterated Outcries against Friends for <hi>Imposition, Imposition, Imposition:</hi>) it was not Friends imposing upon them, that gave the occasion of the Difference: but it was Friends <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to be imposed upon by them,</hi> to omit the doing of their believed Duty, and to be driven, by their impetuous Opposition, out of the practice of those things, which they believed were required of them. It was not enough to the Adversaries, not to be imposed on themselves: but they must have us omit the doing of what we believed to be good, and our Duty to do. Was not this Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their parts, who so often cry out of being imposed upon!</p>
            <p>What they say in their 41 <hi>page,</hi> with Allusion to the building of <hi>Babel</hi> of Old, and Confusion of Tongues that ensued therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, needs no more, in this place, than their own Application there of to themselves: for they deliver it in the first Person Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>[WE.] Was not We of one Language</hi> (say they) <hi>whilst We
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45978:48"/>
truly travelled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But when We found</hi> Shinar <hi>a Plain, and took up Our dwelling there in the likeness of Truth, then did not We, as others before Us,</hi> begin to build, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this they appropriate to themselves by the Advertisement they have given at the end of their Preface to the Reader, where, after they have said, <hi>Where the Term You is found in the following Discourse, we intend the Author and those of his mind</hi>; they add, <hi>And as the Term We is also used, it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in respect to those of the same mind with the Author of this</hi> (that is their) <hi>Book.</hi> Let them take it therefore to themselves, to whom (if to any) it of right belongs. For they have been long hunting for a Plain (a place of more Room, Scope, and <hi>Liberty</hi>; finding Truth's way <hi>too strait and narrow for them</hi>) and at length have found one, where they have taken up their Dwelling, in but the likeness of Truth, if in that. They have built up a <hi>Separation,</hi> which they designed for a <hi>lofty Tower,</hi> to preserve them from what they were in no danger of, <hi>In position</hi> from those they call their Brethren. How they have sped in their undertaking, may in some measure be gathered by this, that some of their Fellow-Builders in that work, have since submitted to the Ministry of the Parish-Priests (to go no further.) So that, as those <hi>Babel</hi> Builders of old met with that they shunn'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>scattered abroad, &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 11.4, 8. So these, to avoid an imagined Danger, of Imposition from their Brethren, have betook themselves to the Parish Priests, where <hi>Imposition is avowed.</hi> How far they are divided in Language, while some are mumbling their Mattins in the old Mass-Houses, I leave themselves to consider. But that they do agree, and are one in Spirit (as well such of them as are already gone off to the Priest, as such as are not yet,) to write against the Innocent, to Reproach, Revile, Raile at, Slander, and wickedly bely Friends, a late scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Book of <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s, and another of <hi>Iohn Pennyman</hi>'s, compared with others written by other of the Adversaries, plainly shew. Which Books came out so near in time with that I am now Replying to, as if there had been an Intelligence held, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence carried on, between the respective Authors.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>page</hi> 41, <hi>For you to call such Pleas as those, Leave me to the Grace of God, and to the Spirit of Truth, loose Pleas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We look upon it as of dangerous Consequence; what though some may abuse them, will you take them away, and with them freedom of Speech?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45978:49"/>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> We do not call those Pleas loo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, with respect to the Pleas themselves (which we acknowledge are sound and good:) but with respect to the Spirit by which, and the end to which, those Pleas have been pleaded by the Adversaries; which was by a loose Spirit, in order to let up Looseness <hi>without controul.</hi> Therefore we take not away the Pleas; but the <hi>abuse</hi> of them. Nor do we take away freedom of Speech, but in Truth's Authority reprove that exorbitant Liberty of Rayling at, Reviling and Reproaching Friends, and exposing Truth to the Worlds contempt and scorn, under pretence of freedom of Speech.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 42, they ask, <hi>Why may not you be cautioned to beware of Formality</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> We are often cautioned so; as they that frequent our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings know. And when that Caution is given in the love of God, it is in the same love received. But when, under pretence of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning against Formality, some (not distinguishing between <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> and <hi>Form</hi>) endeavour to overturn, subvert and take away all Form and Order from the Church of Christ, we cannot receive, but reject, such Cautions and Cautioners, as knowing that they come not from, nor serve. the God of Order; but that Spirit which would bring all into disorder and Confusion.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 43, they say, <hi>Pray let us know why Truth's Testimonies may not be allowed and pass current, where the Life and Conversation is suitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Truths Testimonies are allowed, and do pass currant among Truth's Followers. But the Adversaries should have explained what they mean by Truth's Testimonies. For those Doctrinal Principles, delivered of old by Truth himself, and afterwards by his inspired Followers, and Recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, are Truth's Testimonies, especially as they are taken up and used by the same Spirit that gave them forth. And the Testimonies that proceed from the Spirit of Truth, speaking through any of his Servants in our Meetings, or elsewhere, at this day, are the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Truth also. And all these are allowed, and pass cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent amongst Friends. But if the Adversaries mean, by Truth's Testimonies, their own Testimonies, those Testimonies that they bring, and <hi>thrust upon Friends</hi> in our Meetings, and ask why those Testimonies may not be allowed and pass currant; the Answer is,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45978:49"/>
because those Testimonies are not Truth's Testimonies, (how like soever they may seem to be,) neither come they in Truth's way. They proceed not from the Spirit of Truth, but from that Spirit that Fights against Truth; a Spirit of Dissention, Division, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union and Separation from Friends in Truth.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 45. they say, <hi>Might not a little Charity help all this, could you look upon such as trouble you to be Conscientious.</hi> Again, <hi>Certainly you cannot think that all is wrong that are dissatisfied,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We would perswade you better, by assuring, that some are right by being sincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> They who have known these <hi>Troubles</hi> throughly, and have seen and observed their manner of <hi>Troubling,</hi> and in what Spirit they have done it, had need have more than <hi>a little</hi> Charity, to make them look on such to be Conscientious. Was their publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends in Print to be Apostates, Innovators, Setters up of Images, Introducers of Popery, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An Argument that they were Conscientious? Was their exposing Truth and Friends, by their printed Pamphlets, to the Scorn, Contempt and Derision of the Wicked, and rendring them (as much as in them lay) obnoxious to the Government, a token of their being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious? Was their shutting Friends out of their Meting-Houses, wherein they had a rightful Interest and Propriety, exposing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and tender Bodies, and some their nearest Relations, to all Extremities of Weather, and that for divers years together (as at <hi>Reding,</hi> and elsewhere) an Effect of their being Conscientious? <hi>O barbaroas Consciences! O conscientious Barbarism!</hi> where shall a Parallel to this be found, unless in that which Christ foretold his Disciples, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.2. <hi>They shall put you out of the Synagogues:</hi> yea, <hi>the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> How far these <hi>conscientious Troublers</hi> have answered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, let themselves and others consider. Nay, have they not been worse than those forespoken of by Christ? For they were open Enemies; these <hi>feigned</hi> Friends and <hi>false</hi> Brethren. Now whereas they say, <hi>Certainly you can not think that all is wrong that are dissatisfied with those new things brought in, at least, as made Terms of Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Reply,</hi> We do not think all that are so dissatisfied <hi>equally wrong</hi>: for we are sensible those <hi>Troublers</hi> have, by slanderous Suggestions and false Insinuations, beguiled and betrayed some; whose Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45978:50"/>
out of the Snare, in which those <hi>Troublers</hi> have taken them, we earnestly desire and travel for. But though we do not think all <hi>alike</hi> wrong; yet we do think and know that <hi>all</hi> who think new things are brought in and made Terms of Cummunion with Friends, are <hi>wrong in thinking so,</hi> whatever they are otherwise.</p>
            <p>And whereas they say, <hi>They would perswade us better, by assuring that some are right by being sincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Reply</hi>; If they are, they must not be any of those <hi>Troublers,</hi> who notwithstanding they have separate Meetings of their own, to which they have <hi>withdrawn,</hi> and <hi>chosen to meet apart</hi> (as some of themselves have elsewhere exprest it) do yet frequently <hi>thrust in</hi> at some of our Meetings, and <hi>impose themselves</hi> upon Friends for Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as if they did it on purpose to disturb, and to make trouble in our Meetings. Can any thing be more contrary to Sincerity than this! Is not this an extream degree of Hypocrisie! Let the <hi>Troublers</hi> therefore give over their <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and make it appear that they themselves are sincere to what they themselves have chosen, and set up, before they take upon them to give assurance of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of others.</p>
            <p>They bid us <hi>Remember, They obtrude nothing upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> That's false. Those <hi>Troublers</hi> obtrude themselves, their Preaching, and their Praying, upon Friends (which they know, (having been often told) Friends cannot receive:) than which, what worse they could obtrude, I know not. And where they have had strength by numbers, they have <hi>obtruded</hi> these upon Friends, under the Penalty of being deprived of their Meeting House, if they would not conform to this Imposition. And because Friends could not conform thereunto, those <hi>Troublers</hi> have actually shut Friends out of their Meeting-Houses, and do yet continue to keep them out; thereby depriving Friends of their just Right. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any of those <hi>Troublers</hi> shall again come to <hi>obtrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> upon Friends in our Meetings, <hi>Let them Remember this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, they say, <hi>The Lord often spared those that are wrong, for the sakes of those that are right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> We know he hath done so, and we desire he may do so still: but we leave that to him; who best knows to whom, and how long, to extend that forbearance. But let not the Adversaries abuse God's merciful forbearance, by <hi>continuing in the wrong,</hi> after that the Lord hath made them sensible that <hi>they are wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45978:50"/>They add, <hi>And 'tis our Doctrine, Tares should be suffered to grow, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than destroy Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> And 'tis Christ's Doctrine, and his own Exposition of his <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Tares,</hi> that the <hi>Field,</hi> in which they should be suffered to grow, is the <hi>World,</hi> Mat. 13.38. This is a good Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Persecution, or <hi>outward Violence,</hi> for Religion's sake. Men ought not to be killed, destroyed, pluckt up, and <hi>rooted out of the World,</hi> only because they are <hi>Tares,</hi> or <hi>a wrong Seed</hi> of the Enemies sowing. But I wish the Adversaries would speak plainly, whether it be their Doctrine that such Tares, called by Christ, <hi>The Children of the wicked One,</hi> should be suffered to grow in the Church, the Garden of God, after they are discovered, discerned, plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and certainly known (as the Tares in the Parable at the first sight were) to be Tares. Ah, how would this loose Spirit, that is got up in some, turn Spiritual <hi>Zion,</hi> the <hi>inclosed Garden</hi> of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Plowed-Field!</hi> However, it is to be hoped, <hi>Their applying the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of Tares to themselves,</hi> may help to make some others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them better, than hither to they have done. And their plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Toleration for Tares to grow in the Church (for of the Church, and its Members, they here treat; not of the World:) may give some a further sight of <hi>their Design</hi> for <hi>sheltring Evil,</hi> and what they aim at in this Plea, than ever they had before.</p>
            <p>After they have shewed the utmost of Immoderation in managing the Difference on their own part, they now at length begin to preach Moderation to Others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If,</hi> say they, <hi>this Difference cannot be ended,—manage it with more Moderation</hi> (they might have added, than themselves have done) <hi>and in that love of God, that it may be shewed the Lord is at hand, to gather different apprehensions into a better Temper.</hi> (They might have added, than Themselves have hitherto been in.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> But why did they not think of this <hi>Moderation,</hi> before they published their many <hi>scandalous</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Books, to the <hi>defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> of Truth and Friends to the world, as much as in them lay? Why did they not preach this <hi>Moderation</hi> to their own Party at <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and other Places, to have gathered them into a <hi>better temper</hi> (for <hi>a worse</hi> they could hardly have been in) than to keep Friends out of their Meeting-Houses, wherein they had a just and legal Property, and expose them, for divers Years together, to those
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45978:51"/>
hardships that <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold, Rain</hi> and <hi>Storms</hi> of Weather bring? They, who have done the greatest mischief by <hi>their Immoderation</hi> that they can, begin now to recommend Moderation to others. And they, who have done their utmost to <hi>dishonour the God of Truth and Peace, before the People,</hi> by publishing their <hi>wicked Books,</hi> and setting up their <hi>separate Meetings,</hi> do now take upon them to exhort Others to Moderation; <hi>Otherwise,</hi> say they, <hi>you will dishonour the God of Truth and Peace, before the People.</hi> Is not this <hi>Hyprocrisie in grain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They add, pag. 46. <hi>You must agree together quietly, or part friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or you are no Preachers of Righteousness, whatever your Principles of Truth may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> To what end do they propose this now, so long after they have actually <hi>parted from us!</hi> They have had their <hi>separate Meetings</hi> these many years. And more than a year ago, some of them gave us to understand in Print, that they had <hi>chosen to meet apart,</hi> and had <hi>withdrawn.</hi> But since they did neither <hi>agree quietly</hi> with us while together, nor did <hi>part Friendly</hi> when they withdrew, does it not follow upon them, according to their own words, that <hi>They are no Preachers of Righteousness,</hi> whatever Principles of Truth they may hold? They urge the Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> for parting by agreement. But they do not take notice, that that was only a parting of outward <hi>Habitations,</hi> and that through Necessity, because the place was not large enough to hold them. So that this was not a <hi>Religious parting,</hi> muchless a parting through <hi>Opposition of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> Yet this was in the <hi>Vncircumcised</hi> state too: for Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was not instituted till after this. But they would do well to consider, that <hi>Lot,</hi> who <hi>took his Choice,</hi> and <hi>parted</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God, came to <hi>great Loss,</hi> and <hi>suffered deeply</hi> thereby. For though, at first remove, he pitched his Tent but <hi>towards Sodom, Gen.</hi> 13.12. yet quickly after we find him settled <hi>in Sodom,</hi> chap. 14.12. And he had not long been there, before he was made <hi>a Captive,</hi> and was glad to be rescued by him he had parted from. O that all, that are in danger of being beguiled, <hi>betrayed</hi> and led away by this <hi>Dividing</hi> Spirit and its Agents, would consider these things in a Spiritual Application, and <hi>beware of Separating from God's Friends</hi>; lest, by the pleasantness of the Plains (where <hi>liberty, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> room and scope may be had, <hi>to walk at will</hi>) they be allured to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45978:51"/>
pitch their Tents <hi>towards</hi> mystical <hi>Sodom,</hi> and by degrees drawn <hi>into it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows in their Book, <hi>But why cannot you agree together, whilst you own one and the same righteous Principle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> By this it seems as if owning a Principle, were Terms of their Communion. To own the Principle of Truth, is one thing: to hold it, keep to it and obey it, is another. Many do the one, that do not the other. Many own the Principle of Truth in words, that never came into Obedience to it: and some that have departed from obedience to the Principle, have yet retained a verbal Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And of them that have made Profession of the Truth, and afterwards turned their Backs upon it, how few are there that do not own the Principle! They find fault with something or other in the Society, to make themselves an Out-let, that they may thereby slip out, and shake off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ, which is as <hi>uneasie</hi> to the <hi>Wrong,</hi> as <hi>easie</hi> to the <hi>Right.</hi> But they commonly cry up the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple still. Do not <hi>Pennyman, Crisp</hi> and <hi>Bugg</hi> own in words the same righteous Principle still? Let me turn the Question then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Adversaries, and ask them, Why cannot you and those men agree together, whilst you and they own one and the same righteous Principle? Nay, why cannot you and they agree in other things, as well as in <hi>contending against Truth,</hi> and <hi>writing Books against Friends</hi>?</p>
            <p>They add, <hi>You came out together, have you not done the greater, and cannot you do the less? That's strange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> That's not so strange, as they would make it. <hi>Israel</hi> of old came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> together (and with them a mixt multitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. or, as in the Margin, a great Mixture.) But all they that came out together, did not agree to travel on together. No, some <hi>grumbled</hi> and <hi>murmured</hi> at the <hi>Hardships</hi> in the way. Some <hi>emulated</hi> and <hi>repined</hi> at the <hi>superior Gifts and Graces of their Brethren.</hi> Some let in, and cherished <hi>Evil Surmises,</hi> and <hi>false Iealousies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Brethren, as if some of their Brethren <hi>took too much upon them,</hi> and <hi>lifted themselves up above the Congregation,</hi> and sought a Principality or Lordly Dominion over the rest, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. Thus wrought the subtil Enemy after divers manners, to divide, scatter and turn aside, some after one manner, some after another. Some were <hi>swallowed up of the Earth,</hi> and perished in their <hi>Gain-saying.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:45978:52"/>
Some were for <hi>making themselves a Captain,</hi> (in opposition to the Captain God had made,) and for <hi>returning again into Egypt,</hi> the Land of Darkness out of which they came up together. Others were consumed by the <hi>Fire</hi> of the Lord, which in hot <hi>Indignation</hi> brake forth against them. And <hi>all the Murmurers fell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Now <hi>all these things</hi> (as the Apostle says) <hi>hapned unto them for Examples: and they are written for our Admonition,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. Therefore <hi>Murmur not ye, as some of them also Murmured, and were destroyed of the Destroyer,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
            <p>That which remains of the Adversaries Book is mostly a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation, or contracted Repetition of their foregoing Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, grounded upon a false Hypothesis or Supposition, that Friends would impose new things, as matters of Faith and terms of Communion; and would bring in blind Obedience, by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Conformity before Conviction, and the like: which, I hope, the Reader will find, to his Satisfaction, refuted before. That therefore I may not swell this Book with unnecessary Repetitions, I will only recommend to the Reader's Observation, what, after all their Outcry against bringing in new things (as they call them) the Adversaries themselves grant, in <hi>page</hi> 48. in these words; <hi>Any Particular, or any Assembly of the Community, may offer what is new, if they sincerely believe it good and Serviceable, without breach of Vnity, or at least of Communion; but</hi> (say they) <hi>we cannot find to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new things in, as matters of Faith, or terms of Communion, that any Assembly have any more power than a particular Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep,</hi> What Power an Assembly may have more than a particular Person, I list not here to dispute, because I would not (like them) <hi>pick occasion</hi> of Debate and Quarrelling. But since Friends have not offered any of the things, the Adversaries except against under the Notion of new things, as matters of Faith to others, or as terms of Communion; but have only offered such things as they <hi>sincerely believe are good and Serviceable</hi>: let it suffice, that Friends have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in done no more, than the Adversaries here grant may be done, by any Particular, or any Assembly of the Community, without breach of Unity or Communion. The Breach therefore of Unity and Communion that now is betwixt them and Friends, must lie, and doth, at the Adversaries Door, who (by the heady, willful, violent and turbulent Opposition they made, to obstruct and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45978:52"/>
Friends from proceeding on, in the use and practice of those things, which the Friends sincerely believed, and do yet believe, to be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>Serviceable</hi>) have run themselves into <hi>open War,</hi> and that in Print, against Friends, and into <hi>open Division</hi> and <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from Friends. So that it is <hi>They have broken themselves off</hi> from the Unity, Communion and Society of Friends, both <hi>inwardly</hi> in Spirit, and <hi>outwardly</hi> also in Religious Exercises. The Lord (if it be his good pleasure) give them yet a clear sight, and true sense of the great Evil, and Mischief they have done against God, his Truth and People; that in the sense thereof they may be truly humbled, and bowed down before him, and brought to such an honest and sensible Acknowledgment thereof, as may evidence their sincere Repentance, that, through Judgment, they may find Mercy, and obtain Remission from him.</p>
