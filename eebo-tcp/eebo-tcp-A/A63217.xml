            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>And the End was suitable to their Beginning, they first practised these Crimes upon their own Country-men, the <hi>English,</hi> and then continued them on to Strangers and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners: For the Ship in which this Piracy was committed, was an <hi>English</hi> Vessel, called <hi>The Charles the Second,</hi> belonging to several Merchants of this City, designed for other Ends, and a far different Voyage, which by these Criminals, with the Assistance of one <hi>Every,</hi> their Captain, in all these Villanies, was seized near the <hi>Groyn</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>May 1694.</hi> from which place, having first by Force, set Captain <hi>Gibson</hi> the Commander, on Shoar, they carried off the Ship, and with it committed many and great Pyracies, for several Years (as will appear in the Course of the Evidence) in most of the parts of the known World, without distinction upon all Nations, and Persons of all Religions.</p>
                           <p>Their last Piracy, was this in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the greatest in it self, and like to be the most pernicious in its consequences, especially as to Trade, considering the Power of the great <hi>Mogull,</hi> and the natural Inclination of the <hi>Indians</hi> to Revenge: But they are now brought hither on their Tryal, and if the Matters, they are Charged with, shall be proved, to receive that Iudgment from you, their Crime deserves; and that is Piracy, which by so much exceeds Theft or Robbery at Land; as the Interest and Concerns of Kingdoms and Nations, are above those of private Families, or particular Persons: For suffer Pirates, and the Commerce of the World must cease, which this Nation has deservedly so great a share in, and reaps such mighty advantage by: And if they shall go away unpunished, when it is known whose Subjects they are, the consequence may be, to involve the Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, in War and Blood, to the Destruction of the Innocent <hi>English</hi> in those Countries, the total Loss of the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, and thereby, the impoverishment of this Kingdom.</p>

                              <speaker>Sir <hi>Charles Hedges.</hi>
                              </speaker>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Gentlemen of the Grand Jury.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>THE Opinion which this Court had of the Good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Abilities, and Integrity of the last Grand Jury, was so fully answered at our late Meeting in this Place; that I am confident all good English-men, who were Witnesses of their Proceedings, will concur in giving them Publick Thanks, for the good Services which they then performed: I wish that all others, who were concerned in the Dispatch of that Days Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, had the like pretence to have the same; the Publick Justice of the Nation, would not then have lain under any manner of Reproach, neither would you have had this farther trouble. But seeing that it hath so happen'd, it is become absolutely necessary that a farther, and a strict Enquiry should be made after those Crimes which threaten, and tend to the Destruction of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and Trade, and therefore I am assured of your Patience, whilst I shew you briefly,</p>
                              <p>
                                 <list>
                                    <item>1. What the Crimes are, which you are to enquire after.</item>
                                    <item>
                                       <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106389:4"/>2. How far the Jurisdiction, and your Power in making these Enquiries doth extend.</item>
                                    <item>3. What is the Duty incumbent on you in this behalf.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1. As to the Crimes, I shall not repeat what was mentioned touching all the particulars thereof, at the opening of this Sessions; but confine my Discourse to those, which I find by the Calendar will, at this time, necessarily fall under your Examination, and those are Piracies.</p>
                              <p>Now Piracy is only a Sea term for Robbery, Piracy being a Robbery committed within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty; if any man be assaulted within that Jurisdiction, and his Ship or Goods violently taken away without a Legal Authority, this is Robbery and Piracy. If the Mariners of any Ship shall violently dispossess the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and afterwards carry away the Ship it self, or any of the Goods, or Tackle, Apparel, or Furniture, with a felonious Intention, in any place where the Lord Admiral hath, or pretends to have Jurisdiction; this is also Robbery and Piracy; the intention will, in these cases, appear, by considering the end for which the Fact was committed, and the end will be known, if the Evidence shall shew you what hath been done.</p>
                              <p n="2">3. Now the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty is declared, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Statute, and Commission by vertue of which we here meet, and is extended throughout all Seas, and the Ports, Havens, Creeks, and Rivers beneath the first Bridges next the Sea, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higher Water-mark.</p>
                              <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> hath not only an Empire and Soveraignty over the British Seas; but also an undoubted Jurisdiction, and Power, in concurrency with other Princes, and States, for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Piracies and Robberies at Sea, in the most remote parts of the World, so that if any person whatsoever, Native or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, Christian or Infidel, Turk or Pagan, with whose Country we have no War, with whom we hold Trade and Correspondence, and are in Amity, shall be robbed or spoiled, in the narrow Seas, the Mediterranean, Atlantick, Southern, or any other Seas, or the branches thereof, either on this, or the other side of the Line, it is Piracy within the limits of your Enquiry, and the cognizance of this Court.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Concerning the Duty incumbent upon you in making your Enquiries, and Presentments, you may consider that there is a great Trust and Authority committed to you, and therefore it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106389:4"/>
that a suitable care should be had, and your Power execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to a well regulated discretion: As you are, on the one hand, to take care that the Court be not troubled, nor any man put in hazard of his Life, through any frivolous, or malicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; so, on the other side, and more especially in the cases of great, and publick Offences, you are to use your utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that Justice, the support of Government, be not obstructed by any partial Proceedings.</p>
                              <p>You are not obliged in all cases to require a clear and full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but only to examine till you find, and are satisfied in your Consciences, that there is sufficient and just cause to put the Party accused upon his Tryal. You cannot convict, but may in effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit it the greatest Criminals, and therefore if you do but find proofs enough to create a Presumption against the Party accused, when the case seems odious, and is of great consequence, and importance, your safest way is to put it in a proper Method for the Petty Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who are to receive full satisfaction from the Evidence that shall be given in the presence of the Party; and according to that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have power to determine whether guilty, or not guilty, condemn, as well as acquit.</p>
                              <p>And upon this occasion, seeing many who are upon that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice are present, it seems fit that they should also know that they have no power to do more or less than what is agreeable to the Evidence: They are not to interpose in points of Law, or to be swayed by any consideration whatsoever, but what shall arise from the proofs judicially made; they are indeed Judges of the Fact, but they are not Arbitrary; they are as much restrained by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Conscience formed and convinced by reasonable proofs, as the Judges on the Bench are by the Rules of Law.</p>
                              <p>No man can believe just as he lists, and therefore a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or judgment at will and pleasure will never be thought to deserve the name of a Verdict: for whatever may be pretended, the World will not be persuaded that a Jury hath pursued the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Conscience, unless some reasonable grounds for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings shall appear, and therefore, whenever it shall happen that notorious Malefactors escape unpunished, notwithstanding, that in the Opinion of most good men, there was a full and sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for their Conviction, it is to be wished, and indeed it seems to me to be necessary, in cases that relate to the Laws of Nations, that the reasons which induced such a determination should be


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106389:5"/>
given for the publick satisfaction, otherwise, since Forreigners look upon the Decrees of our Courts of Justice as the sense and judgment of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Enemies will be glad to find an occasion to say, that such Miscreants as are out of the protection of all Laws, and Civil Governments, are abetted by those who contend for the Soveraignty of the Seas. The barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will reproach us as being a Harbour, Receptacle, and a Nest of Pirates, and our Friends will wonder to hear that the Enemies of Merchants and of Mankind, should find a Sanctuary in this ancient Place of Trade. Nay, we our selves cannot but confess, that all Kingdoms and Countries who have suffered by English Pirates, may, for want of Redress in the ordinary course, have the pretence of Justice, and the colour of the Laws of Nations to justifie their making reprizals upon our Merchants wheresoever they shall meet them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Seas. If a Jury happens in these cases to be too severe, there is room for Mercy, and I am confident, that upon a just representation, the Innocent never failed of obtaining it; but for a fault, neglect, or errour on the other hand, there is no relief for injured Forreigners, but by their carrying out, as we may be sure they will, for themselves, such a satisfaction, upon our Merchants as they shall think fit, whenever they shall have an opportunity; and so our whole Nation must unavoidably suffer both in reputation and interest, and all as it were through our own default.</p>
                              <p>I hope what hath been said upon this unexpected occasion, will not be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as intended to influence any Jury; I am sure it is far from being so designed; Religion, Conscience, Honour, common Honesty, Humanity, and all Laws forbid such Methods: There is no doubt but the Judge as well as the Jury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>man then best discharges his duty, when he proceeds without favour or affection, hatred or ill-will, or any partial respect whatsoever.</p>
                              <p>Every man ought to be extreamly tender of such a Person as he has reason to believe is innocent; but it should be considered likewise on the other side, that he who brings a notorious Pirate, or common Malefactor to Justice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the safety, and preservation of the Lives of many, both bad and good, of the good by means of the assurance of protection, and of the bad too by the terrour of Justice. It was upon this consideration that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours in their Edicts made this piece of service for the publick good, as meritorious as any act of Piety, or Religious Worship.</p>
                              <p>Our own Laws demonstrate how much our Legislators, and particularly how highly that great Prince K. <hi>H.</hi> the 5th. and his Parliament thought this Nation concerned in providing for the security of Traders, and scowring the Seas of Rovers and Free-booters. Certainly there never was any Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Ancestors were not extraordinary zealous in that affair, looking upon it, as it is, and ever will be, the chief support of the Navigation, Trade, Wealth, Strength, Reputation and Glory of this Nation.</p>
                              <p>Gentlemen, our concern, as our Trade is, ought in reason to be rather grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of our Fore-fathers; we want no manner of inducements, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to stir us up, whether we consider our Interest or Honour, we have not only the sacred Word, but also the glorious Acts of the best of Kings, which sufficiently manifest to us, that the good and safety of this Nation, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test care of his Life; let every man therefore who pretends to any thing of a true English spirit, readily, chearfully follow so good, so great, so excellent an Example, by assisting and contributing to the utmost of his power and capacity at all times towards the carrying on his noble and generous Designs for the common good, and particularly at this time, by doing all that he can, to the end that by the Administration of equal Justice, the Discipline of the Seas, on which the good and safety of this Nation entirely depends, may be supported and maintained.</p>

                  <p>I was not in that Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was Mate of the <hi>Iames.</hi> And about 9 came one from aboard the <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and askt me for the Drunken Boatswain; and I replyed short, and he went away again, and said the Ship was going to be run away withal. Whereupon I went with ten men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Ship. And after I had advised with the Commander, I ordered the Pinnace to be mann'd; and when I came, the last that went into the Boat was <hi>Pike;</hi> and I bid them put back, and they would not, but went away to the Ship <hi>Charles.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the 7th of <hi>May,</hi> 1694, I came to the <hi>Groin,</hi> in company with the Boatswain and several others, on board the <hi>Charles;</hi> and when I was going in to the Captain of the <hi>Charles,</hi> Captain <hi>Gibson,</hi> I found Mr. <hi>Every,</hi> the Carpenter, and some others, drinking a Bowl of Punch: And after I was come from the Captain, I came and sate down with them; and Mr. <hi>May</hi> drank an Health to the Captain, and Prosperity to their Voyage: And we not knowing their Design then, thought it was to our Lawful Captain, and Prosperity to the Voyage he was designed for.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. I. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>What was your Voyage?</p>

                  <speaker>D. Creagh.</speaker>
                  <p>It was to the <hi>Spanish Indies.</hi> And afterwards the Company broke up, and retired, and went to their Cabins. And when we were in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, we heard a great Noise above Deck; and Captain <hi>Humphrys,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Gally, called to us, to tell us his men were run away with the Boat, and were gone to Captain <hi>Gibson.</hi> To which <hi>Every</hi> answered, that he knew that well enough. So the men came aboard, and as I was coming out of my Cabin, to see what the matter was, I was met by <hi>Every,</hi> the Carpenter, and two <hi>Dutchmen;</hi> and they obliged me to retire again to my Cabin. And Cap. <hi>Humpreys</hi> fired two Guns at us. But we presently gotout of reach of the Guns, and proceeded on the design. And I came out of my Cabin, and went on the Quarter-deck, where I met <hi>Every</hi> and the Carpenter together; <hi>Every</hi> was cunning the Ship.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. I. Holt.</speaker>
                  <p>What is the meaning of that?</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>That is, to direct in the Steering of her. So <hi>Every</hi> took me by the hand, and ask'd me if I would go with him? And I Answered, I did not know his Design. He said, there were but few that knew it. Says I, tell me who do know it, that if you will not tell me your self, I may ask them that can tell me. But he said, we should all know by to morrow Morning eight a Clock. I told him, that would be too late to repent of the Design. The Carpenter stood by him, and said, Do you not see this, Cock? Yes, says I, I do. Says he, this Man, and old <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Knight,</hi> I can trust with any thing, they are true Cocks of the Game, and old Sports-men. Then said I, I suppose they know your Design. Yes, says he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they do, and if it were a thing of ten times the Consequence, they should know it. Upon this the Carpenter came to me, and said, If you do not go down, I will knock you on the Head. And as I was going down, I met with <hi>W. May,</hi> the Prisoner at the Barr. What do you do here? Says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head, and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from <hi>Every,</hi> that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was then very ill of a Feaver, <hi>Every</hi> came and said, I am a Man of Fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and must seek my Fortune. Says Cap. <hi>Gibson,</hi> I am sorry this happens at this time. Says he, if you will go in the Ship, you shall still

command her. No, says Cap. <hi>Gibson,</hi> I never thought you would have served me so, who have been kind to all of you; And to go on a design against my Owners orders, I will not do it. Then, says <hi>Every,</hi> prepare to go ashore. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, the Captain, and several others of us, went into the Boat. When we were by the Ships side, I heard them order the Doctor to be secured; but if there was any more would go into the Boat they might. And we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Boat to the Number of Sixteen. And they gave us four Oars in the Pinnace, and set us a drift.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, VVe came to the <hi>Groin,</hi> and had been there about three or four Months, and we had been about eight Months out of <hi>England,</hi> and we lay for our VVages, and there was no VVages to be got. But in as much as we wanted VVages, <hi>Every,</hi> and several others, contrived to carry this Ship away. So that Night, which was <hi>Sunday,</hi> they went ashore; and when they came aboard again, made some Men Privy to it, whom I know not. And the <hi>Monday</hi> follovving, I think, the Packet vvent out in the Morning, and the Night being fair, was ordered to give notice. And they came to the <hi>Dove,</hi> and about Nine or Ten her Boat broke off, and she haled us: For they told Cap. <hi>Humphreys</hi> they vvere coming to run avvay vvith our Ship. So he hales the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106389:9"/>
                     <hi>Iames.</hi> And presently some of the Officers came and ordered their Pinnace to be mann'd, and it was so. And when they gave this order, there was <hi>Every</hi> and 25 or 26 Men. And as they came aboard, our Cables were cut, and ready to go. And coming under the Castle, we cut all the Boats but two, and stood out to <hi>Sea</hi> about two or three Leagues. And there <hi>Every</hi> went to Cap. <hi>Gibson,</hi> and as they said, to ask him if he would go with them, or not? He said, no. Then he said, he must prepare to go ashore; and he did so, and several others with him. And the word was given about, that they that would go ashore might go; but whether these Men heard it or no, I cannot tell; and no Mans Name was mentioned to be stopt, but the Doctor. And when they went away, they cry'd, there was water in the Boat, and they desired a Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of us, to heave it over, and we gave them one; and away they went, I think, about 15 of them, and no more did offer to go as I saw, nor did I see any hinder any that would go: And afterwards, they that went off, went about their Business, and we about our Business. And we came to the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and Victual'd our selves there. And there we met with three <hi>English</hi> Ships, out of which we took some necessarys for our selves, and among the rest several Men, nine Men we took out of them.</p>

                  <p>The next was a small Vessel, about 30 or 40 Tun, and we put her ashore, and took a small matter out of her, and let her lie. And there vve put this Gentleman, Mr. <hi>May,</hi> ashore. And vve seeing 3 <hi>English</hi> Ships a coming, vve left him there, and vvent to the <hi>Equinoctial Line:</hi> And aftervvards, for vvant of Bread and Water, vve came again, and took another small Vessel, and some <hi>Rice</hi> and <hi>Pody</hi> out of her, and sunk her, and then vvent to the <hi>Cape</hi> again, and took in <hi>W. May</hi> again; and met another Vessel, and took Rice and meal out of her, and sunk her too. And then vve vvent to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to a Town called <hi>Meat,</hi> and the People would not trade with us, and we burnt it. And thence we went up to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as far as we could And going up the Cape <hi>Adin,</hi> we met with two <hi>English</hi> Privateers more, and they came and joyned with us.</p>

And then they went after them and overtook them, and took one that was about three or four Hundred Tun, and took Gold and Silver out of her; and sent Men aboard her to plunder and keep her. And next day they spied another Sail, and got up their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and stood to her, and took her; she was called the <hi>Gunsway;</hi> they killed several Men aboard, and when they had taken and plundered the Ship, they left the Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to go to <hi>Surat</hi> again.

                  <p>My Lord, when I was in the Boat, I knew not who was in it, nor how many. When I came aboard the <hi>Charles,</hi> the Sails were loose, and I was in a very sorry condition; they cut the Boat off, and put her a Drift, I could not get into her, she was gone in a Minutes time, I did not know which way or what Men there were in her, nor heard nothing till two a Clock the next day. And I hope, my Lord, as we are but poor Sea-faring Men, and do not understand the Law, you will take it into consideration.</p>

                  <p>I stay'd in the Cabin a considerable time. I was thinking, I must leave my old Captain without seeing him; and I begg'd them to give me leave to come to him; and there was two Men stood with naked Cutlaces, and would not let me come to him. We had some confabulation together, and I begg'd the favor to come in, and at last they permitted me; and the Doctor was Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commanders Temples. And as I was coming along, I had my hand cut; and I went to the Doctor, to desire him to bind up my hand. When I came out again, they began to hurry the Men away. Here was Mr. <hi>Gravet,</hi> the second Mate, who is now one of the King's Evidence; and I told him he should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me to my Wife, I am not like to see her; for none could go, but who they pleased: For when those Men were in the Boat, they cryed to have a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else they should sink, they having three Leagues to go: And I do not know how they could go so far with more, when their Boat was like to sink with those that were in her, as some of the King's Evidence have testified.</p>

                  <p>I knew nothing of it, I intended to declare it to none but the Lords of the Admiralty. I knew no man there, but two men that were Fellow-Tradesmen in <hi>Virginia.</hi> I came from <hi>Virginia</hi> by the first Ship; and if that Ship had come away before the Fleet, I had been at home long before. I lay sick at <hi>Bristol</hi> four or five days, and the fifth day I got passage for <hi>London</hi> in the Coach; and was taken three miles off <hi>Bath</hi> by the King's Messenger, by one who betrayed me, and I was carried back to <hi>Bath</hi> again. And there was the Duke of <hi>Devonshire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>;</hi> and there they Examined the whole matter, in every particular, as I have now declared to the Court. And my Lord desired the Messenger should take me away again, and see me safe to <hi>London,</hi> which was all he said to me. I have more to say, as to my being put ashore at <hi>Joanna.</hi> I had no place to go to, but lay in a lamentable Condition, I could not put Water to my mouth without help, and remained useless of Hands or Feet, despairing of my life. I desired to go ashore, to see if the Air would do me any good; and I went ashore at <hi>Joanna,</hi> with another Man, <hi>Gunning,</hi> and others for Refreshment. So the second day we went in, there appears three Ships, which were <hi>East-India Men.</hi> Captain <hi>Every</hi> being Surprised by these Ships, hastened his Men and Water aboard to get out to Sea, that he might not be surprised in the Road without his Men on Board, who were come ashore for the Sick. And I told them, I will not go with you, I will rather trust to the mercy of my Countrey-men, or the mercy of the <hi>Negroes;</hi> I should endanger my Life, if I go aboard; If I stay, no question my Countrey-men will have Compassion on me; And if I have committed any thing worthy of Death, they have Authority to put me to Death according to the Law of the Nation. And I applied my self to Mr. <hi>Edgcomb,</hi> when he came ashore, and he gave me Scurolous Language. But I replied, I am a weak man, for me to stay behind is Death; I had rather suffer Death by the Laws of my Countrey, then to be left to the mercy of these <hi>Negroes.</hi> Mr. <hi>Edgcomb</hi> says, I will take you down with me, and will hang you there too.</p>

                  <p>At <hi>Bombay,</hi> where he said I should be Tried. His Mate, and several other <hi>English-men</hi> came to see me, and brought one thing or other to refresh me. And at last, at Night he sent his Doctor and Purser to me, who said, The Captain is just now sending his Boat for you. I replied, I am ready, here is all I have in the World, and he goes away about two a Clock in the Morning. And I remained seven or eight Weeks after at the Mercy of those <hi>Negroes,</hi> and had Perished, but that a <hi>Negro</hi> hearing an <hi>English-man</hi> was there came to me; he lived at <hi>Bednai-Green,</hi> and spoke <hi>English</hi> very well. He went from <hi>England</hi> in the Ship <hi>Rochester,</hi> taken at <hi>Guinea</hi> some time before. The Captain commanded this <hi>Negro</hi> to go for the Long-boat, and turn her adrift; which he does, but goes away with her himself; and in the Fight, says, The Ship blew up by an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Fire, and several were lost. This <hi>Negro</hi> I got to look after me, and he did really feed me, and got me all necessaries belonging to me: And by that means I saved my Life.

                  <p>I belonged to the Ship <hi>James,</hi> and at the <hi>Groyn</hi> the Men began to complain about wages, and that was the first begining of the disturbance about this Ploting. We were Shipt out of <hi>England,</hi> in Sir <hi>James Hubland</hi>'s service, to the <hi>Spanish West-Indies.</hi> Upon this Mutiny among the Men for their wages, several Men went aboard the Kings Ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106389:13"/>
and desired to be entertained on Board any of them to go for <hi>England;</hi> and we all went away again to the Ship because we could not be entertain'd. But this Design of <hi>Everies</hi> I did not know of. On the 17th day Capt. <hi>Humphrys</hi> calls, and says, My Men are gone aboard the <hi>Charles,</hi> I think. And he calls out, says he, Mr. <hi>Druit,</hi> Man the Pinnace. I being then on the Deck, at night, the men all quiet, as I thought, I went into the Pinnace, and I was no sooner in, but in comes 15 or 16 more that knew of the Design; but I was then sent, and knew it not. And they put off the Boat, and over-powered us; and several of us would have gone aboard again, and they would not suffer us. And when we came aboard the Ship <hi>Charles,</hi> they had cut the Cables, and the Sails were loose, and several Men went from the <hi>Charls</hi> to the <hi>Iames</hi> in a Boat; and they Commanded the Innocent to do what they pleased, with Pistols and Cutlaces; and they Commanded me to go into the Hold, to do what they pleased. And I not knowing of this matter, the Men that were in the Boat called, Hand the Buckets, or we shall Sink. And I heard afterwards, that none went ashore, but whom they pleased, that is, <hi>Every</hi> and his Crew. And I not knowing of it, could not go; and if I had known it, I had not been admitted to go. Then we were carried two Leagues without the <hi>Groyn.</hi>

                  <p>I had been in <hi>France,</hi> a little before the Ship came to the <hi>Groyn,</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner there; but I knew nothing of <hi>Everies</hi> Design. By the command of our Officer I went aboard the Boat, and as soon as we were in her, we were over-power'd, and carried away; they took the Oars out of our Hands, and carried us to the Ship <hi>Charles.</hi> And when we came aboard, they put the Boat a drift, and then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me into the Fore-Castle; they had Arms but we had none, and so were forced to obey them. When the Boat was going off, I heard a Noise of crying out for a Bucket. And when we were gone from the <hi>Groyn,</hi> we were forced to do what they would have us; it was against my Consent, and against my Will.</p>

                  <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counsel in this Case for the King against the Prisoners at the Bar. They are


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106389:13"/>
Araign'd for a very high Crime, a Robbery upon the Seas. It was not a less Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause committed on the Sea, but rather the more. These Men had a Trust reposed in them to assist their Captain in his Voyage; but instead of that, they resist their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, turn him out, and run away with the Ship. They could not find Shelter in any other part of the World, and I hope you will make it appear such Crimes shall not find Shelter here, more than in other parts of the World. These are Crimes against the Laws of Nations, and worse than Robbery on the Land: For in Case of a Robbery on the Land, we know who is to pay it; but in a Robbery by Sea, it often happens that innocent Persons bear the loss of what these Men do. It has been very plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the Prisoners, That the Ship <hi>Charles</hi> was run away with from the <hi>Groyn.</hi> And it is as plain by two Witnesses, That all the Prisoners at the Bar were in this Ship; by three that <hi>W. May</hi> in particular was one of them; and by one that <hi>W. May</hi> was so far concerned, that because <hi>I. Gravet</hi> seem'd to dislike it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he said, He deserved to be shot through the Head: So that he that would make himself the most Innocent of the five, is most Guilty.</p>
                  <p>Now they have only this to say for themselves, that they were forced to do what they did. But it has been proved to you that they were not forced; it was said, All might go that would. And it is not proved on their side, that any one of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners did seem to dissent from their going away. It is proved that they all made use of this Ship to very bad Purposes; that they took and plunder'd several Ships, and shar'd the Booty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We do not produce this to prove them Guilty, but to shew that they made use of this Ship to this very Purpose. Now if you allow what they say, That they were forced to go away; than you must never convict, at any time, one or two Highway Men that robs in the Company of four or five; for they may say too that they were over-power'd, and forc'd by their Company. It is so, not only in case of Robbery, but in all other Crimes also. They have said a great deal indeed, but without any manner of probability of Truth. They have produced no Witnesses for themselves, to prove any thing they have said. And the Witnesses for the King have given Testimony without any Exception. And, I hope, you will vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Credit of the Nation, and find them Guilty as the Evidence has proved them.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, These five Prisoners, <hi>E. Forseth, W. May, W. Bishop, Ia. Lewis</hi> and <hi>I. Sparks,</hi> are Indicted for a Piracy and Robbery committed on the High-seas, some distance from the <hi>Groyn,</hi> in taking and carrying away a Ship, and several Goods therein contained; she was call'd the <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. This was done in <hi>May</hi> last was two Years, 1694. You have heard what Evidence has been given on this Indictment against the Prisoners.</p>
                     <p>It has appear'd that this Ship was bound in a Voyage to the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> Two of the Prisoners, <hi>W. May</hi> and <hi>I. Sparks,</hi> were Seamen then on board this Ship, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Voyage; the other three were not Marriners in that, but in another Ship, call'd the <hi>James,</hi> that lay, at that time, near the <hi>Groyn;</hi> but they came aboard the Ship <hi>Charles</hi> before, and continued on board her when she was carried away.</p>
                     <p>That there was a Piracy committed on the Ship <hi>Charles,</hi> is most apparent by the Evidence that hath been given; that is, a Force was put on the Master and some others of the Seamen on board her, who because they would not agree to go on a piratical Expedition, had liberty to depart, and be set ashore. But the Ship was taken from the Captain, who was possessed of her for the use of the Owners, and was carried away by <hi>Every</hi> and others of his Crew that remained on board her; and others came from the <hi>James,</hi> which taking was a Piracy that is manifested by the use they did put her to, for they did afterwards commit several other Piracies with her, and took se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Ships, and then went to several Islands, Countries and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to the Isles of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> to <hi>Madagascar,</hi> and then to <hi>Joanna,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Meat,</hi> and then to the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> and at the entrance of the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more Piracies, in the manner as you have heard, and has been very particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to you. So that I must tell you, beyond all contradiction, the force put on the Captain, and taking away this Ship, call'd the <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was a Piracy; and for that particular Fact these Prisoners are now Charged.</p>
                     <p>The Matter you are now to inquire after, is whether all these Prisoners were Guilty of this Piracy, or which of them.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Ed. Foreseth, Bishop</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> it hath appear'd to you, that they, with others, were aboard the Ship <hi>James;</hi> and that there was a Report spread about of a Plot against the Captain of the <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and a Design to carry that Ship away. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, there were some of these Men sent out in a Boat, by the Captain of the <hi>James,</hi> to this Ship to assist Captain <hi>Gibson,</hi> but instead of preventing this Piracy, they stayed behind and went along with these Men that carried away the Ship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106389:14"/>As to <hi>Will. May</hi> and <hi>Io. Sparks,</hi> that were of this Ships Crew, they continued on board, and were Parties in all those Piracies.</p>
                     <p>There was a Consult, it seems, by some particular Persons, of which <hi>Every</hi> was the Ringleader, how to effect this Design, Captain <hi>Every</hi> as they call him; though he was no Captain, but was under the Command of Captain <hi>Gibson</hi> that had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Ship.</p>
                     <p>It's true, it is not proved to you that these Men were at that Consult; for, it seems, they were too many, for they were about 160 that remained on board when the Ship was carried off.</p>
                     <p>Now for <hi>W. May, Io. Gravet,</hi> second Mate, that was aboard, and though he had a Pistol clapt to him to prevent any resistance, yet had liberty to depart; and upon his going off discoursed with <hi>May,</hi> who shook Hands with him, and bid him farewel, and remember him to his Wife. And therefore it is evident that <hi>W. May</hi> was under no force to stay; he staied with his good Will, and did consent to the Piracy. And then another Witness is <hi>D. Cray,</hi> who says, that <hi>May</hi> was so zealous in the matter, that he said to him, <hi>God Damn him he deserv'd to be Shot through the Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sparks</hi> was on Board the Ship and had a design'd end, and no compulsion was used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, but since had liberty to depart; but the staying behind by the rest, is a great Evidence to induce you to believe they were Parties in the Design; for why else should not they go ashore as well as others, since there doth not appear any restraint upon them to stay, especially when a general word was given, that those who would go on Shoar should go on the Deck, and a Boat was ready to carry them off.</p>
                     <p>They say, they wanted a Bucket in the Boat, and they gave them one to lave out the Water; that is a plain Evidence they were willing to be rid of those that were not willing to Engage with them; and if they had not approved of the Design, they were not hindred from going in the Boat. As for those that came from the <hi>James,</hi> there was no manner of Force on them, but they were sent from the Capt. to assist the Capt. of the <hi>Charles;</hi> for those two Ships having lain near together at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> there was some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligence of such a Design in agitation, and these three forsook their own Ship; <hi>Every</hi> declared his Design to some: And he told them what Shares they should have; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was their Capt. and Commander, he thought himself intituled to a doble share.</p>
                     <p>And then you have heard what was done in the whole Progress of this wicked Design, Every one of these Men had their share, even this <hi>W. May,</hi> tho he was sick for some time, and was set ashore at <hi>Joanna,</hi> and at the Ships return taken in again, yet he had his share of all the Prizes. <hi>W. Bishop</hi> had his share, <hi>James Lewis</hi> had his share, and <hi>John Sparks</hi> had his share; and, says this young Man <hi>Phillip Midleton,</hi> I had my share, which was above an hundred Pound, which was thought by them to be a good share for a Boy; and <hi>Sparks</hi> took him at a disadvantage, and having an opportunity, took it from him.</p>
                     <p>Now if there be a Piracy committed tho contrived but by one Man, yet if others do concur in it they are equally Guilty.</p>
                     <p>Now tho these Prisoners tell you, there was a force upon them, it is a meer suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any manner of Evidence; But there is Evidence of their consenting and confederating in this wicked Enterprise.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there hath been a Tryal before, which you have all heard of; for the City and Nation have discoursed of it; consider therefore the Evidence. You have a great Trust reposed in you, for you are not to act Arbitrarily, but you are accountable to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to whom you are sworn, and to the Government for the Verdict you give. If you are not satisfied in your Consciences that the Evidence is sufficient to find these Men Guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in God's Name, acquit them.</p>
                     <p>But if you are satisfied in the sufficiency of the Evidence to convict them, you must find them Guilty.</p>

So that those who bring not such Criminals to Judgment, when it lies in their Power, and is their Duty to do so, are answerable, in a great Measure, before God and Man, for all the fatal Consequences of such Acquittals, which bring a Scandal on the publick Justice, and are often attended with publick Calamities.</p>
                        <p>It is not therefore, Gentlemen, to be supposed, that Wise or Honest Men, (and there are none who would be thouhght to be otherwise) who love their Country, and wish its Peace and Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, would be guilty in that kind.</p>
